        July   23. 1883.
    It  has always been difficult to account for the widely-spread nature
of outbreaks of wheat mildew in districts in which the common bar
b-rry is either entirely absent or very uncommon. In the year 1874 the
Rev. James Stevenson found at Glamis, in Forfarshire, an ^Ecidium
upon Maluniia aquifolia, which the Rev. M. J. Berkeley* pronounced
to be JEcidium berberidis. In the following year Dr. Paul Magnus t
found the same fungus at Lichterfelde, near Berlin, but since that
time it does not seem to have been noticed by any one. On the

2              Mr. C. B. Plowright.        On Mahonia      Aquifolia.        [Xov.   15,
31st of May, 1883,           Mr. William C. Little, of Stagsholt, March, gave
me afreshly gathered specimen of Mahonia aquifolia, upon the berries
of which the ./Euidium was abundant.     Knowing that upon the
barberry no less than three different ^Ecidia occur,     determined toI
prove by direct experimental culture whether this one was the JEcidinm
berberidis of Persoon (the tBcidiospore of Puccinia graminis).       At
10 p.m. on the evening of the 31st May      placed   I
                                                    some  of the spores
upon the cuticle of some wheat-plants which had been cultivated
under a bell-glass. In eleven days the uredo of Puccinia graminis
made its appearance upon these plants. The details of this, as well as
of two other experiments, are appended. On the 13th June placed               I
some       the aecidiospores upon a piece of wheat cuticle ; in twelve
          of
hours they had germinated, and a little later the germ-tubes were
seen entering the stomata, in the same manner as those of JEcidinm
berberidis do (see figure).   It is then clear that the iridium upon
Mahonia aquifolia is identical with the JEcidium berberidis (Pers.),and
is a part of the life-cycle of Puccinia graminis, and is unconnected with
the JEcidium magellanicum (Berk.),* and the .^Ecidium of Puccinia
berberidis (Mont.).t
   The Mahonia in question is widely cultivated in gardens throughout
England and is a favourite evergreen in shrubberies. It is also exten
sively planted in woods as a covert for game.
                         J
   Experiment 151. — Four wheat seedlings, grown in a flower-pot,
which have been continuously covered by a bell-glass since the seed
was planted (at the end of April), had on 31st May the spores of the
^Ecidium on the fruit of Mahonia aquifolia applied to their green
leaves. The bell-glass was replaced as soon as this was done. On
the 10th of June on two leaves pustules of uredo were observed.     On
the 19th these plants were gathered.      Every   one of them  had the
uredo upon it.
   Six precisely similar wheat seedlings, planted at the same time and
grown under the same conditions, as control plants, were perfectly
free from uredo, and remained so up to the present time (10th June).
                                                     "                "
   Experiment 152. — Three wheat-plants, grown by water culture
in a room in the house, were removed from the bottle in which they
were growing and planted in a flower- pot on the evening of the 31st of
May.    To their leaves the spores of the ^Ecidium on Mahonia were
also applied as in the former experiment.    On the 8th of June the
presence  of the mycelium  of the uredo  was indicated by the appear
ance of sickly yellow spots upon the leaves, and on the 10th the
perfect uredo of Puccinia graminis was developed.

    Experiment 162. — A wheat-plant, grown out of doors in the parish
of West Lynn, was placed in a flower-pot in April.                On the 31st of
May this plant was removed to my garden, near King's Lynn, and
covered by a bell-glass.        The plant was far more robust and consider
ably larger     than those employed in the former experiments.              On the
2nd     of   June it was infected with fresh aecidiospores,               sent by
Mr. Little from Stagsholt.           The bell-glass was removed on the 5th,
and on the 10th of June the uredospores of Puccinia graminis made
their appearance.         On the 19th there were thirteen stems of this
 wheat-plant, about 18 inches in height ; fourteen leaves were affected
 with uredo.       There were many wheat-plants, of all ages, growing at
 this time in the garden, but upon no one of them did any Uredo
 linearis exist.

     In this paper the author describes teeth of a new genus of
  Mammal, representing         a species of the size of the Thylacoleo or
  Sototheruim, specimens       of which teeth have been discovered in three
  distinct and remote localities in Australia.           In shape the teeth re
  semble the scalpriform incisors of the upper jaw of the Rvdentia; in
  the  microscopic structure of the dentine there is a nearer resemblance
  to  that in the   incisor of the large extinct form of wombat (Phasco-
  lonrns).    Figures   of  the teeth, and of    their dentinal structure mag
                                                                      B 2

 nified, are appended to the text.     The author remarks that the first
indication of since restored species, e.g., of the Diprotodon, as a large
extinct Marsupial, was a portion of a tooth, and corresponding
 accessions of fossil remains may be expected to lead to a like recon
struction of the present animal. He is indebted to E. P. Ramsay,
 Esq., F.L.S., for casts of the first found specimens of the teeth in
question to which the transmitter had appended the name Sceparnodon ;
subsequently the author received, through the kindness of C. H.
 Hartman, Esq., of Toouromba, Queeasland, a large portion of the
tooth itself.

V. " Note on the Irregularities -in Magnetic Inclination on the
    West Coast of Scotland."       By T. E. Thorpe, F.R.S., and
        A. W. Rucker, M.A.             Received October 20, 1883.
   In the Report of the results of the Magnetic Survey of Scotland,
undertaken at th- request o£ the British Association by the late
Mr. Welsh during the years 1857 and 1858,            stated by Professor
                                                         it   is
Balfour Stewart (by whom the observations were reduced and the
report drawn up) that the values of all the elements as determined
    and adjacent to the Island of Mull were apparently largely affected
by inlocal attraction, and from a comparison of the various observations
Professor Stewart was led to place the centre of the disturbance a
little to the south of the Mull stations, and at a considerable depth
below        surface.
              the     The effect of this local attraction was most
apparent  in  the determination of the dip, which at Tobermory was
upwards of 57', and at Glenmorven, on the other side of the Sound,
was 14' in excess of the probable normal value, that      the value     is,
unaffected by local disturbance and dependent merely on geogra
phical position, as deduced by combining together all the other
observations for Scotland, in the manner adopted by Sir Edward
Sabine in discussing the observations of the previous Survey of 1836.
  Dr. Stewart's localisation of the centre of disturbance was based
partly on a consideration of the abuormal values exhibited by the
observations made at the two stations on the Sound of Mull, and
partly on certain irregularities manifested by the determinations
taken on Islay and in Skye.    So far as the Mull observations them
selves were concerned, the clue as to the exact locality of the area of
disturbance was of the very slenderest.   Mr. Welsh appears to have
made   only a single observation of the dip at Tobermory; and
although observations were made with two needles at Glenmorven,
the divergence between the resultant values happens to be greater
than    exhibited by any other pair of dip observations throughout
         is
the survey.   Nevertheless, as we shall show, we are able to confirm

not only the general accuracy of Mr. Welsh's observations on this
particular point, but also Professor Stewart's inference as to the
probable locale of the area of disturbance.
    Since the date of the publication of Professor Stewart's Report,
the Island of Mull, and the adjacent district of Morvern, have been
made the subject of very careful geological and petrological study,
more particularly by Professor Judd (see his paper in the " Quart.
Journ. Geol. Soc," xxx, 220), who has demonstrated that the great
central mountain group in the island is the denuded core of an
immense volcanic pile, the base of which must have had a circum
ference of at least forty miles, and the lava streams from which must
have flowed to enormous distances and in quantities so vast as to have
accumulated     to a thickness    of 2,000  feet.  We have in   these huge
accumulations of gabbro, dolerite, basalt, tachylite,          —
                                                            &c. all rocks
containing more or less magnetite and, possibly, even finely-divided
metallic iron, as in the basalts of the north of Ireland and of Green
land, an undoubted source of local attraction, sufficient in all pro
bability to affect the needle to the extent observed by Mr. Welsh.
    It seemed to us highly desirable, however, to repeat Mr. Welsh's
observations in the light afforded by Mr. Jndd's analysis of the
geological features of the district. Although the geological facts
doubtless serve to strengthen the validity of the magnetic observa
 tions, it should be stated that the direct evidence as to the existence
of the great area of local attraction practically rested upon a single set
of observations.     It appeared to us, therefore, desirable, as a prelimi
 nary step to any subsequent survey of the west coast of Scotland,
to confirm, in the first place, Mr. Welsh's observations as to the
 existence of the local attraction ; secondly, to ascertain, if possible,
 the position of maximum disturbance ; and thirdly, to determine the
 influence of the area on the direction of the isoclinal line.
    Our observations were made with an excellent dip-circle belonging
 to Owens College,     for the loan of which we are indebted to Professor
 Balfour Stewart. The instrument is known as " Dover No. 6 ; it
                                                                       "
 had already been employed by one of us in magnetic observations in
 America and in the Azores (see
                                      " A Magnetic Survey of the Fortieth
 Parallel in North America,"        " Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 30, 132; and
 "Note on the Magnetic Inclination in the Azores," "Proc. Roy.
  Soc," vol. 31, 237). The circle is provided with two needles, each
 3s inches long and 0'27 inch in maximum width. Similar precautions
 were taken to preserve the needles from rust as are indicated in the
 communications     referred to, and the method of observation was the
 same as that previously adopted ; it is identical with that described
                             " Admiralty Manual of Scientific
 by Mr. Welsh in the                                              Inquiry,"
 third edition,  1859.    With a single exception duplicate and indepen
 dent observations were made in all cases with the two needles.

1883.]        On h-regularities in Magnetic Inclination.                 7
   Our plan of investigation was briefly as follows : — In the first place
we sought for a station sufficiently remote from the supposed area of
disturbance, and itself free from any suspicion of local attraction,
where we could hope to obtain a perfectly normal value for the inclina
tion. We then proceeded to confirm this value by observations made
at distances of a few miles and in different directions from this
station on spots as free as possible from local attraction.  Our normal
station we found on the Island of Shuna in Loch Linnhe ; this island
is composed of alternations of micaceous schist and limestone, and a
careful examination of the locality by our colleague Professor Green,
to whom we are indebted for the geological notes which accompany
our observations, revealed nothing which could exercise any disturbing
influence on the dip. The subsidiary stations were near Carron Point
in Loch Aber and on the shore of Loch Corrie.        We then approached
Mull    along lines converging to the supposed place of maximum
disturbance, making observations at tolerably regular intervals as we
came towards the volcanic district as indicated on Professor Judd's
map of Mull and Morvern.         In this manner we imagined we should
 be able to determine    the influence of the attractive mass upon the
dipping needle.     We  next made observations near but not actually
upon the extreme edge of the basalt in Morvern and on the opposite
shore of the Sound ; and lastly we made a number of determinations
on Mull itself with a view of ascertaining, if possible, the position of
the maximum disturbance.
    The results are contained in the following table (see next page) : —
    These results serve, in the first place, to establish most unequivo
cally the existence of the area of local attraction which Dr. Stewart
found to be indicated by the observations of Mr. Welsh. In the
table showing the results of Mr. Welsh's observations, contained in
the Report to the British Association, no particulars are given as to
the exact spot in Tobermory on which the tripod was placed, nor is
anything to be obtained on this point from Mr. Welsh's MS. notes of
his survey work which are kept at the Kew Observatory.         Neverthe
less, when regard is had to the secular change in the inclination, our
results are as concordant as could "be expected. Nothing is, of
course, known as to the precise amount of this change at Tobermory,
but assuming that it is identical with that calculated by Dr. Stewart
from tho whole of the results of the surveys of 1836-7 and 1857-8,
viz., an average yearly decrease of 2'-23, our value would become
72= 43', which agrees closely       with that observed by Mr. Welsh,
viz., 72° 46'-8. This agreement would in all probability be actually
closer if we assume that we have in Scotland as in England a
progressive augmentation in the amount of secular change with an
increasing westerly position.
   Our observations further tend to show that the centre or focus of

1883.]         On Irregularities in Magnetic    Inclination.
the area   of attractive matter in Mull is near the upper part of Loch
Tnadh or Loch Na Keal ; that is to say, at about the spot indicated
by  Dr. Balfour Stewart as its probable place. This spot is certainly
very close to,- and may indeed on a more complete examination turn
out to be identical with the locality where Profesor Judd places the
great volcanic vent in the island.
   The observations, moreover, show that great as may be the
absolute mass of the magnetic matter in Mull, its influence extends to
no very great distance from the island.         The observations in Loch
Aline to the north-east, and in Loch Scridain to the south-west,
prove that the masses of igneous rocks, as these are constituted in
Mull, may be approached to within a very few miles without
appreciable effect on the needle. The determination of the normal
direction of the isoclinal line in the neighbourhood of Mull is not
likely therefore to be materially affected by this area of attractive
matter.     It is almost- certain for instance, that the area was without
sensible influence on the observations at Shuna, Carron Point, Loch
Corrie, and Loch Ailort. At Loch Ih-umbuy the influence of the
Morvern basalt is appreciable, whilst at Fishnish the effect of the
horizontal component o£ the attractive force is very marked.
Although this place is only about five miles in about the normal
direction of the isoclinal from Kinloch Aline, there is a difference of
42' in the dip, an amount of course far in excess of any possible error
of observation.
   Our observations lastly afford some indieation of the probable
amount of the- secular change in the inclination in these parts. So
far back aa 1836"5, Sir Edward Sabine found the dip at Artornish
to be 72° 43' ; this place is close to Kinloch Aline where we this year
found the dip 71° 9' -T this is eqnal to an average yearly decrease of 2'.
At our station in Shuna we observed the dip 70° 54'"5 ; the inter
polated value for 1858 as obtained from the chart accompanying
Professor Stewart's report is 71° 45' ; this too is exactly equal to a
yearly decrease of 2'. It is worthy of note that this value is identical
with that adopted by Sir Edward Sabine in the reduction of all the
Scotch observations made prior to 1858 to the mean epoch of 1842-5
(" Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism," No. XII, "Phil. Trans.,"
1870, p. 265).
   Our observations are; of course, too few in number, and are distri
buted over too> restricted an area to allow us to draw any definite
conclusions as to the direction of the ieoclinals at the present time,
but  it is almost certain that tLIs- direction will now      be found to be
very  different  from   that observed by  Mr. Welsh   in 1858.    It is to be
hoped that before very long      another  magnetic survey    of the  whole of
 the British Isles will be set en foot.    So far as Scotland is concerned
the present time would appear to be very opportune for a new survey.

10                 On the Circulation     of Air in Kundt's      Tubes.    [Nov. 15,
More than twenty-five years have elapsed since Mr. Welsh made his
survey, and this was separated by an interval of twenty-one years from
that which we owe to the joint labours of Sir Edward Sabine, Sir James
Ross, and Mr. Fox. The instruments and methods of observation in
1858 were greatly superior to those of 1836-7, and hence a new
survey made during the approaching period of minimum sun-spot
disturbance, and on stations selected with careful reference to their
geological character, would undoubtedly afford far more accurate data
as to the absolute value of the magnetic elements and as to the extent
of secular          change   in this part of the world than we at present
possess.
VI. " On the Circulation of Air observed in Kundt's Tubes,
    and on some Allied Acoustical Problems."      By LORD
    Rayleigh, D.C.L., F.R.S. Received October 23, 1883.
                                        (Abstract.)
  Experimenters in acoustics have discovered more than one set of
phenomena apparently depending for their explanation upon the exist
ence of regular currents of air, resulting from vibratory motion, of
which theory has as yet rendered no account. This is not, perhaps,
a matter for surprise, when we consider that such currents, involving
as they do circulation of the fluid, could not arise in the absence of
friction, however great the extent of vibration. And even when we
are prepared to include in our investigations the influence of friction,
by which the motion of fluid in the neighbourhood of solid bodies
may be greatly modified, we have no chance of reaching an explana
tion,   if,
          as  usual, we limit ourselves to the supposition of infinitely
                  is
small motion and neglect the squares and higher powers of the
mathematical symbols by which          expressed.
                                           it   is
   Iu the present paper three problems of this kind are considered,
two of which are illustrative of phenomena observed by Faraday.*
In these problems the fluid may be treated as incompressible.        The
more important of them relates to the currents generated over a
vibrating plate, arranged as in Chladni's experiments.       It was dis
covered by Savart that very fine powder does not collect itself at the
nodal lines as does sand in the production of Chladni's figures, but
gathers itself into    cloud, which, after hovering for a time, settles
                             a
itself over the places of maximum vibration. This was traced by
 Faraday to the action of currents of air, rising from the plate at the
places of maximum vibration, and falling back to       at the nodes.

 a vacuum     the phenomena observed by Savart do not take place, all
 kinds of powder collecting at the nodes. In the investigation of
this, as of the other problems, the motion is supposed to take place
in two dimensions.
    It is probable that the coloXr phenomena observed by Sedley Taylor*
 on liquid films under the action of sonorous vibrations are to be referred
 to the operation of the aerial vortices here investigated.              In a

 the peculiar arrangements of colour accompanied by whirling motions
 caused by the impact of a gentle current of air.           In Mr. Taylor's
 experiments the film probably divides itself into vibrating sections,
associated with which will bo aerial vortices reacting laterally upon
the film.
    The third problem relates to the air-currents observed by Dvorak
in a Knndt's tube, to which is apparently due the formation of the
dust figures. In this case we are obliged to take into account the
compressibility of the fluid.
VII. " The      Influence of Bodily Labour upon the Discharge of
       Nitrogen." By W. North, B.A., F.C.S. Communicated
       by Professor J. S. BURDON SANDeRSON, F.R.S. Received

                                  (Abstract.)
    The scope of this inquiry has been strictly limited to one question,
viz., that of the influence of labour in modifying the normal relation
between food and excreta. No attempt has been made to investigate
the mode in which nitrogenous products .come into existence in the
organism.
   The researches immediately bearing on the subject of this paper are
those of Dr. Parkes (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vols. 16 and 21), and those
of Dr. Austin Flint, made on the pedestrian Weston (" New York
Med. Journal," June, 1871). Dr. Parkes found that bodily exercise
caused a slight increase in the nitrogen discharge during or imme
diately after labour. The increase was, however, so inconsiderable that
it may well be questioned whether it could not be accounted for as
dependent on the more perfect absorption of food ; for although the
diet of the soldiers experimented upon was carefully regulated, and
the nitrogen it contained determined by analysis, with the result that
before work the quantity of nitrogen taken in considerably exceeded
the quantity discharged, the two became practically equal during the
work period.       Consequently if the whole period of observation            is

taken into account. the nitrogen discharged is found to be more than
balanced by that of the food.
   Dr. Austin Flint, on the other hand, found that over the whole
period of work the excess of discharge     was so large that no such
explanation appeared to him admissible.     If, however, comparison be
made of the intake with the output of nitrogen during the whole
time of observation, comprising three periods of five days each, before,
during, and after labour, it is found that the two are unequal, the
difference in favour of the nitrogen of the food amounting to 217 grs.
in a total of 5075.
   These results were subjected to careful experimental criticism in
1876 by Dr. Pavy (" Lancet," 1876, vols* i and ii), who showed as the
result of his own analyses that the immediate effect of labour in
increasing the nitrogen output is more than compensated by the con
comitant and subsequent intake.
   It is further to be considered that whatever results had been
obtained by Dr. Austin Flint, they could not have been received
without some misgiving, for his methods of research were insufficient
as bases for quantitative statement. Thus the nitrogen of the urine
was throughout determined by a process which is known to be liable
to errors of variable amount, and which no care on the part of the
worker is adequate to guard against.
  So also as regards the intake of nitrogen.   Dr. Flint's estimates
were founded for the most part not on actual analyses of the material
used, but on calculations based on the percentages given in M. Payen's
tables ("Traite des Substances Alimentaires," 1865), which are known
to be at best only approximately correct; moreover, the diet of Weston
was of so complicated and variable a composition that, even if each
constituent       had been analysed, the result would still have been open
to question.
   The circumstances under which Dr. Austin Flint had to make his
observations, probably made it impossible for him to secure uniformity
of diet.   In this respect the conditions of Dr. Parkes' experiments
were immeasurably superior.    Fully recognising that uniformity was
essential, he fed his men in the simplest possible way ; he was not,
however, able to accomplish this without employing a diet which was
so different from that to       which, as soldiers, they were accustomed, that.
however       satisfactory   its elementary composition might be, it could
scarcely be considered as natural.
     Notwithstanding  this difficulty, the- experiments of Dr. Parkes
render    to say the least, highly probable that the immediate effect of
         is it,
labour   to increase the discharge of nitrogen    they leave
                                                       ;      undecided

whether or not this increase occurs at the expense of stored material
independently of any concomitant or subsequent increase of intake.
     The decision of this point     is   the object of my experiments.

1883.]       Bodily Labour upon      the Discharge  of Nitrogen.        13
   It will  be obvious from the consideration of the experiments above
mentioned, that in approaching this question, methods of research are
of prime importance.       These divide themselves very naturally under
two heads — first, the diet, and secondly, the investigation of the
excreta in order that the results may be satisfactory.      It is essential
first that the daily intake of nitrogen shonld be accurately known and
admit of exact regulation, and secondly that the mode of analysis of
the excreta should not be open to question.
   The use of the method of combustion with soda-lime effectaally
disposes of the latter difficulty ; the former is not so readily over
come.
   It is a matter of common knowledge that the composition of the
ordinary food-stuffs in their usual state is, from the chemist's point of
view, exceedingly variable.       The first consideration then is how to
reduce them to such a state that this objection shall disappear.
   The mode in which      I have overcome this difficulty constitutes  the
chief difference between my experiments and those of other observers.
   It would occupy too much space, and is indeed unnecessary, to
describe in detail the process of preparation of the food-stuffs, and it
will here suffice to say that   I  have acted on the principle that only
fluids or powders can be accurately sampled and analysed ; all my
food-stuffs have been reduced to one of these states, and      I may here
enumerate them —
                     Meat (dried and ground to powder).
                     Flour.
                     Vegetables (dried).
                     Potato (Edward's patent desiccated).
                     Condensed milk.
   All  these articles can be obtained in quantity ; all admit of being
easily and accurately weighed and measured ; they are in a state
which readily admits of accurate analysis, and will keep indefinitely.
 Further they are the constituents of an ordinary mixed diet, and
 except in their palatability and mode of preparation,         involve no
 serious departure from one's usual-food.
   By the use of these materials I can, knowing their composition,
 adjust the intake of nitrogen with the greatest possible nicety, and
 maintain it at any desired level for almost any length of time, besides
 having it in my power to use, not merely a similar, but precisely the
 same, diet at any time when it may seem desirable to repeat an experi
 ment.
   My plan of experiment was as follows : —
    Believing as   I  do that previous food may materially affect the
 results of an experiment, and that the body has the power of storing
 nitrogen at one tiine which can be discharged at another as occasion

14                        Mr.     VV.  North.    The Influence    of           [Nov. 15,
requires,    I  regulated my diet for some four or five days before begin
ning an experiment, and took rather more exercise than usual in order
to get rid of any possible surplus in the body ; in the latest experiments
I have adopted the plan of abstaining from food on the first day of an
experiment, in order to effect the discharge of this surplus, and I am
inclined to regard this as the best method to pursue.
   I   then place myself upon a regulated diet of accurately known
composition for nine or ten days, and about the middle of the period
I perform a certain amount of muscular labour. In all experiments
made thus far the labour consisted in walking a known distance, and
carrying     a load whose weight was accurately determined.                  By observing
the relation of the nitrogenous intake to the output from day to day,
I was enabled to determine with very considerable accuracy the effect
produced by the labour upon it. In addition to the nitrogen the
phosphoric and sulphuric acids were accurately determined in the
food and excreta, and so                 I  was able to institute a comparison, and
observe the effect            of the  exercise in modifying the relationship.
   It is impossible in a brief abstract to enter into the immense mass
of detail which            these    experiments involve, but the following tables
 will,  I   think, suffice to exhibit the general nature of the results
obtained.

   My results, while they confirm those of Dr. Parkes, show that the
disturbance produced by very severe labour is much more immediate
and of mnch greater intensity than that which Dr. Parkes observed,
the explanation obviously being that in his experiments the exertion
imposed on the soldiers who were made the subjects was inadequate.

1883.]        Bodily Labour upon    the  Discharge    of Nitrogen.         1 7
   I  have farther been able to show as the result of a very lengthy
experiment in which several days of complete abstinence from food
were introduced,      and of which it is impossible in a short abstract to
give the figures, that just as in Dr. Parkes' experiment on the effect
of privation of nitrogenous food the diminution of the nitrogen
stored    in the system was followed by retention, i.e., by a state of
things in which the intake was greater than the output, so, after the
disturbance of the nutrition of the body which is produced by severe
labour, the immediate effect of which is to diminish the store of
nitrogenous material in the system, there follows a corresponding
diminution of discharge ; so that the result is the same, viz., to use
Dr. Parkes' own words " an insufficient supply at one time must be
                              " whether the
subsequently compensated                    insufficiency be due to privation
of food   or to exercise.
   A   third result of importance is this : that this storage of nitrogen
is the expression of a tendency of the organism to economise its
resources, which is much more constantly operative than has hitherto
been supposed.
   Finally, as regards the phosphates and sulphates, it has been shown
that unless the exertion be very severe the phosphates are not increased,
whilst the output of sulphates is distinctly increased in every case,
the increase being in general terms proportional to that of nitrogenous
material.
   It  is a matter of regret that the total sulphur of the food was not
estimated    ; it is known that the percentage of sulphates contained in
the food was insignificant as compared with that excreted in the urine,
and consequently almost all the discharge must have been a product
of oxidation.
   I beg leave in conclusion, to state that the expenses of the present
research, which have been extremely heavy, have been defrayed by a
grant of the British Medical Association.         I  desire to express to the
Association    my most grateful thanks.

I. " On the Formation of Ripple-mark in Sand."                  By G. H.
       Darwin, F.R.S., Plumian Professor and Fellow of Trinity
       College, Cambridge.        Received October    18, 1883.
    The following paper contains an account of experiments and obser
vations on the formation of ripple-mark in sand. The first section i-
 devoted to experiments on the general conditions under which ripple-
mark is formed, and especially on the mode of formation and main
 tenance of irregular ripples by currents.    In the second section it i-
 shown that regular ripple-mark in sand is due to a complex arrange
 ment of vortices in oscillating water ; and the last section gives some
account of the views of certain recent observers in this field, and a

discussion      of some phenomena in the vortex             motion of air and
water.
                         § 1. First Series of "Experiments.
   A cylindrical      zinc vessel, like a flat bath, with upright sides,
2 feet 8 inches    in diameter and 9 inches deep, was placed on a table,
which was free to turn about a vertical axis.               Some fine sand was
strewn over the bottom to a depth of about an inch, and water was
poured in until it stood three inches deep over the sand.            After some
trials of simply whirling the bath, in- which no regular ripple-mark
was formed, I found that rotational oscillation with a jerking motion
of small amplitude gave rise almost immediately to beautiful radial
ripples all round the bath.         If the jerks were of small amplitude the
ripples    were  small,   and if  larger  they were larger.    On one occasion
having made large ripple-marks,             I oscillated the bath much more
rapidly, and a second set of ripples sprang into existence in the
fnrrows of the first set.           Another time, when in consequence oV
irregularity in the motion, a set of radiating waves were generated in
the water, a second set of transverse ripples were formed, which pro
duced by inte rference a beautifully mamellated structure, arranged
like a chess-board.         In all these experiments the radiating rippl-s
began first to appear at the outer margin of the bath and grew
inwards; but the growth stopped after they had extended to a certain
distance.      If the jerking motion was violent, ripples were not formed
near the       circumference, and they only began at some distance
inwards. After these preliminary trials, arrangements were made for
regularising both the frequency and amplitude of oscillation of the
bath.      An attempt was then made to formalate the laws which govern
the generation of ripple-marks.          In the following notes of experiments
the expression
                    " octave
                               " is used to denote a ripple-length which is
 one-half of the main or fundamental ripple, and the amplitudes are
 measured by the displacement of the edge of the batb.
    The water stood 1 inch deep in the bath.

    In one part 7 ripples to 9 inches ; at another part 12 ripples to
1  foot ; some tendency to break into the octave. The ripples only
extended an inch or two from the edge.
    More water was then poured in until it stood about                  If inches
deep.
    5.  Repetition of No. 4.
    There were 33 ripples in a half circumference (which is 22 inches) ;
the ripples were more regular than in No. 4, with not so much
tendency to break into the octave.
    6. Water 2\ inches deep ; frequency 59 ; amplitude 3 or 4 inches.
    43 ripples to the circumference (which is 44 inches), extending
inwards 8 inches.

3 inches from the edge of the bath.

     53 ripples, extending 8 or 9 inches ; not so regular.

     12. Water 1\ ; frequency about 80 ; amplitude 7 inches.
     The water churned up the sand with violence ; margin the same as
 No. 11 ; from 8 to 12 inches from margin rather irregular ripples,
 about 34 to circumference.
     13.   (Bad observation.)    Water 2|  ;  frequency about 85      ;  amplitude
 about    1J to 2 inches.
     80 ripples to circumference.
     14.   (Bad   observation.)     Water    2 \;     frequency  57 ;   amplitude
  2 inches.
     No ripples raised.
     An analysis of the observations marked          7 to 14 was made on the
  hypothesis    that   the water  remained     still,   when the bath oscillated
 with a simple harmonic motion. I endeavoured to find whether X,
 the wave-length of ripple (in inches) was directly proportional to v,
 the maximum velocity of the water relatively to the bottom (in inches
per minute) during the oscillatory motion ; also the values of vj and

v9,  the least and greatest velocities   of the water compatible with the
formation of ripple-mark.
    The following are the results : —

          or -147 second.
    It appears therefore that ripples are not formed if the maximum
velocity of the water relatively to this particular sand, estimated on
the above hypothesis, is less than half a foot or greater than a foot
per second ; and that if v be that maximum velocity in inches per
minute, the wave-length of ripples generated is "00245V, or -147« when
v is measured in inches per second. The results seem as fairly con
sistent with one another as could be expected. It will appear from
section 2 that the maximum velocity of the water, as estimated on
the hypothesis that the water as a whole executes a simple harmonic
 oscillation relatively to the bottom, does not give the maximum
 velocity of the water in contact with the sand relatively thereto.
The quantity called v is not in reality the maximum velocity of the
 water in contact with the bottom relatively thereto, but it is in fact
6-283 times the amplitude multiplied by the frequency.             Thus we
cannot conclude that a current of half a foot per second is just
sufficient to stir the sand.    In the state of oscillation corresponding
to i?j, it is probable that part of the water at the bottom is moving
with a velocity much greater than half a foot per second relatively to
the sand.       The number of the experiments analysed is insufficient
for the accurate determination of the law connecting wave-length,
amplitude, and frequency; but this branch of the subject was not
pursued further because other observers, whose work is referred to in
§ 3, have made a number of experiments with this object.

    It was after making this set of experiments that hit on what
appears to be the key-note of the whole phenomenon.
    A series of ripples extending inwards for some distance having
been made by oscillation, and the water having come to rest, the bath
was turned slowly and nearly uniformly round.             The ripples were
then observed to prolong themselves towards the centre ; this shows
that a uniform current is competent to prolong existing ripples. The

22                         Prof. G. H. Darwin.                  [Nov. 22,
uniform current flattened the tops of the ripples, but made the lee-
side steeper. After being exposed to a prolonged current, the ripples
were not only not in course of obliteration, but became somewhat
more pronounced.
    The sand was then smoothed with the edge of a board ; after the
exposure of the sand to a current, marks made with the edge, which at
first were too faint to be seen, became by a course of development
well-defined ripples.     The whole surface became gradually mottled
with irregular chains of ripples of which the weather-side was a
very gradual slope, and the lee-side was steep.       The appearance was
strikingly like that of drifted snow. As it might be conjectured that
there would be eddies or vortices on the lee-side,    I made some regular
ripple-marks by oscillation, and then exposed them to a current.        I
shortly observed minute particles lying on the surface of the sand
climbing up the lee-slope of the ripples apparently against stream.
This proved conclusively the existence of the suspected vortices.
   If  when the bath was at rest, a sudden motion was given in one
direction, the sand on the lee-side of each ripple was observed to be
churned     up by a vortex.    By giving a short and sudden motion, 1
was able to see the     direct  stream pile up the sand on the weather-
side and the vortex on the lee-side.         Fig. 1 shows the effect of a

single short jerk. Two little parallel ridges of sand were formed,
namely (a) by the direct stream, and (b) on the lee-side by the
vortex, a little below the crest of the ripple-mark.
    It is thus clear that casual surface inequalities are accentuated by
the combined action of the direct stream and of the vortex.
   For the purpose of examining the vortices a glass tube was drawn
out to a fine point, and fitted at the other end with a short piece
of india-rubber tube. With this a drop of ink could be squirted out
at the bottom of the water.         This method was adopted in all sub
sequent observations, and it proved very valuable.       It may be worth
mentioning that common ink, which is heavier than water, was better
than aniline dye ; and the addition of some sulphate of iron to the
ink improved its action.
   A drop of ink was placed in the furrow between two ripples ; as
soon as the continuous stream passed, the ink was parted into two
portions, one being sucked back apparently against stream up the
lee-side of the ripple-mark, and the other being carried by the direct

stream towards        the crest.   By observing  the limits of the transport
of the ink,    I conclude     that the stream lines were as shown in fig. 2.

These points being settled, it remained to discover how the vortices
were arranged which undoubtedly must exist in the oscillatory for
mation of regular ripples.  The rapidity of the necessary oscillations
made      this a task of some difficulty.
             §2. On     the Formation   of Ripple-mark      by Oscillation.
  The observations    were made in two different ways.
   In the first of these, which also ultimately proved to be the most
successful, the ripple-mark was made in a glass trough about 1 foot
long, 5 inches wide, and 6 inches deep.       In order to observe the
formation of the ripples absolutely in profile, a sheet of glass fitting
the trough was placed to stand on four short corks at the bottom.
The trongh was then  put to rock on two corks, one at each side, on
the linewhich bisects its length. Two other slightly shorter corks
were put at the ends ; these served as stops, and only allowed it to
rock through a very small angle.      The trough was placed on a
window-sill with a strong light outside, and was gently rocked by

  When the trough iR half filled with water, and sand is sprinkled
on the  glass plate, it is easy to obtain admirable ripple-marks by
gently rocking the trough.
  When a very small quantity of sand is sprinkled in and the
rocking    begins, the sand dances backwards and forwards on the
bottom, the grains rolling as they go.
   Very shortly the sand begins to aggregate into irregular little
flocculeut   masses, the appearance    being something like that of
curdling   milk.   The position of the masses             is,

    Some of the elongated patches disappear, and others fuse together
and form     ridges, the ridges then become straighter, and finally a
regular ripple-mark is formed with the wave-length double that in
the initial stage.
   When a drop of ink is put on the glass without any sand, it simply
slides to and fro, with perhaps a faint tendency to curdle, but it
cannot be caused to form ripple-mark. This shows that the initial
stage when the sand is beginning to curdle is due simply to friction.
   When the ink is put upon a flocculent mass it betrays some kind
of dance in the water, but the layer of water disturbed is so thin that
it would hardly have been possible to detect the law of the motion
from this case alone. When, however, the nature of that motion, as
described below, has been discovered, the same kind of motion may
be recognised in the dance of the ink over these flocculent aggre
gations.
   I found in the   later experiments that it was advantageous to have
a very   regular ripple-mark. I therefore sprinkled sand on the sheet
of glass, and, before beginning the rocking,      I traced regular furrows
in it with the point of my finger. A few oscillations of the trough
soon effaced all signs of the artificial origin, and the ripple crests
with the bare glass in the furrows, were absolutely indistinguishable,
except by perfect regularity, from those produced naturally. Most of
the observations were, however, made with the natural ripples, and it
                                    I
was only towards the end that adopted this plan in order to save
time and to obtain perfect regularity.
   In the rocking trough, the water moves whilst the bottom of the
vessel is still, save for the small rocking motion.      A second arrange
ment was, however, made in which the converse is true.           A sheet of
plate glass is caused to oscillate in the bottom of a trough with glass
sides. The oscillator is moved by a connecting rod and crank driven
by a small water-motor, the throw of the crank is small, and the
rapidity of oscillation can be varied within considerable limits.
   When sand is sprinkled on the oscillating sheet of glass, phenomena
such as described above are again observed, and good regular ripple-
mark is formed in the sand. Although much was learned from this
instrument, still the rocking trough was on the whole more useful.
   It appeared to be certain from the first set of experiments that
ripple-mark was due to eddies or vortices, and the question remained
as to how the vortices were arranged in oscillatory            motion.    It
required   some   practice, and  many  hours  of watching,  to establish the
conclusions explained below, indeed the phenomena next described
were only detected long after that which follows them in this paper.
   If a very gentle oscillation be started, the layer of ink on the crest
of  a ripple-mark    becomes   thicker and thinner alternately, swaying
backwards    and forwards    ;  then a little tail of ink rises from the

 1883.]             On the Formation    of Ripple-mark.                   25
crest, and the point of growth oscillates on each side of the crest ;
the end of the tail flips backwards and forwards.          Next the end of
the tail spreads out laterally on each side, so that a sort of mushroom
of ink is formed, with the stalk dancing to and fro. The height of
the mushroom is generally less than a millimetre.
                                   Fio.  3.
   Fig.  3 is the best representation     I  can make of this appearance,
which   I shall call an ink mushroom.       The first of these figures gives
the extreme of excursion on one side, the second the mean position,
and the third the extreme on the other side. The figures show the
state   of affairs when the oscillation is very gentle, so that the
amplitude of oscillation of the main body of water is small compared
 with the wave-length of the ripple-mark. The elongated hollows
 under the mushroom are the vortices, and the stem is the upward
current. If the ink be thick these spaces are clouded, and the
appearance is simply that of an alternate thickening and thinning of
the ink on the crest. When one is familiar with this motion, after
examining it carefully with gentle oscillation over ripple-mark of some
size, the same kind of dance may, I think, be detected in the stage of
ripple manufacture after the sand has curdled into elongated flocculent
 masses.
    The oscillations being still gentle, but not so gentle as at first,
streams of ink from the two mushrooms on adjacent crests creep
 down the two slopes into the furrow between the adjacent ridges,
and where they meet a column of ink begins to rise from the part of
the water whose mean position is in the centre of the furrow. The
column is wavy, and the appearance is strikingly like that of smoke
rising from a fire in still air.
   The column ascends to a height of some 5, 10, or perhaps 20
times the height of the ripple-marks, according to the violence of
the agitation.    It broadens out at the top on each side and spreads
out into a cloud, until the appearance is exactly like pictures of a
volcano in violent eruption ; but the broad flat cloud dances to and

      i-ro relatively to the ascending column.           The ink continues to spread
      out laterally and begins to fall on each side.          In this stage if the ink
      is not thick it is often very like a palm- tree, and for the sake of a
      name     I  call this appearance an ink tree.         The branches (as it were)
      then fall on each side, and the appearance becomes like that of a
      beech-tree, or sometimes of an umbrella.               The branches reach the
      ground, and then creep inwards towards the stem, and the ink, which
      formed     the branches, is sometimes seen ascending again in a wavy
      stream parallel to the stem.
   t      Perhaps a dozen or twenty oscillations are requisite for making
  j
      the ink go through the changes from the first growth of the tree.
          The descending column of a pair of trees comes down on to the top
      of the mushroom.           I  have occasionally, when the oscillations         are
     allowed to die, seen both tree and mushroom, but the successful
     manufacture        of the tree necessitates an oscillation           of sufficient
     violence to render       the  observation  of  the mushroom very difficult.
          The alternate thickening and thinning of the ink on the crests
     seems to render it probable that with moderate oscillation the mush
     room vortices are still in existence, or at any rate that alternately one
     and the other is there. With violent oscillation, when the stem of
     the tree is much convoluted, as described below, it cannot be asserted
     that the mushroom vortices exist, and I am somewhat inclined to
     believe them to be then evanescent.
          Each side of the ink tree is clearly a vortex, and the stem is the
i    dividing line between a pair, along which each vortex contributes its
     share to the ascending column of fluid.             The vortex in half the tree
  \  is  clearly  in  the first place generated   by  friction of the vortex in its cor
     related mushroom, and is of course endued with the opposite rotation.
     The ascending stem of the tree is a swift current, bnt over the mush
     room the descending current is slow until close to the mushroom, when
     it is seen to be impelled by pulses.
   ^     I was on one occasion fortunate enough to observe a mote in the
    water which was floating nearly in the centre of a tree vortex, and
    counted twelve revolutions which it made before it was caught away
    from its fortunate position.
         If the adjoining crests are of unequal height the stem of the tree
    is thrown over sideways away from the higher crest ; and indeed it
    requires care to make the growth quite straight.                   The ink in the
    stem ascends with a series of pulses, and it is clear that there is a
    pumping action going on which renders the motion of each vortex
    somewhat intermittent, the two halves of the tree being pumped
    alternately.
         The amount of curvature          in the  stem of the tree depends on the
    amplitude of the oscillation            of the water.      Figs. 4, 5, 6, give  fair
    representations       of ink trees.

   The ink is propagated along the convolutions of the stem of the
ink tree, but the convolutions are themselves propagated upwards,
and each convolution corresponds to one oscillation.        The motion of
the ink along the convolutions soon becomes slow, but the convolu
tions become broader and closer.       Thus the upper part of the tree is
often seen to be most delicately shaded by a series of nearly equidistant
black lines. A perfectly normal ink tree, made by a very thin stream
of ink, would be like the fig. 9, in which the whole is formed by a

single line ; but it is not possible to represent the extreme closeness of
 the lines adequately.
   In the transition from the mushroom stage to the tree stage it
 appeared to me that it was very frequent that only half the ink tree
 •was formed.     At any rate I have frequently noted the mushrooms
 and half the tree vortices lasting during many oscillations, and then
the other halves of the trees gradually appeared. This might, of
course, be due to an accidental deficiency of ink in an invisible tree
vortex, but   I have observed this appearance frequently when there is
ink at the stem of the tree, and when there seemed no reason why it
should only be carried up in one ascending stream and not in the
other.
   If the agitation is very gentle the sand on the crests of the ripple-
marks is just moved to and fro ; with slightly more amplitude, the
dance is larger, and particles or visible objects, such as minute air-
bubbles, in the furrows, also dance, but with less amplitude than those
on the crests.     When the rocking is gentle the oscillation       in the

 1883.]             On the Formation     of Ripple-mark.                  29
farrow appears to be in a different phase from that on the crest, with
more violent rocking I did not observe the difference of phase. The
dance is not a simple harmonic motion like that of the main body of
the water relatively to the bottom, but the particles dash from one
elongation to the other, pause there, and then dash back again.
    As the amplitude further increases the furrows are completely
scoured out, and the sand on the crests is dashed to and fro, forming
a spray dancing between two limits. With violent agitation this
dance must have an amplitude of more than half a wave-length.
If the agitation be allowed to subside the dance subsides, and when
the water is still the ripple-mark is left symmetrical on both sides.
With extremely violent oscillation all the water becomes filled with         -
flying dust, and it is no longer possible to see what is happening.
This seems to be the condition when the agitation is too strong for
th- formation of ripple-mark. It is probable that the rush of water
sweeps away the existing ripple-mark, and there is then no longer
anything to produce a systematic arrangement of vortices.
    In fig. 10 I have tried to exhibit the dance of the vortices by the
succession of figs. i to vii. When the amplitude of oscillation is the
same as when the ripple-mark is generated, the series of changes is
of the kind shown.         The figures succeed one another in time, but
they   do  not  pretend   to  such accuracy as to represent the stages at
rigorously equal intervals.
    The dotted waves show a mean contour of the ripple-mark ; they
are introduced to show the displacements of the crests relatively to
the mean position.        A perfectly symmetrical ripple-mark does not,
however, present a simple harmonic outline, for the hollows are flat
and the crests rather sharp.
    The convoluted line is the stem of the ink tree, which forms the
dividing line of the two vortices ; the curved arrows show the direc
tion of rotation.
    In i the water is at its elongation to the right. The crest of the
ripple-mark is also at its extreme to the right, and the right hand
 slopes are steep, whilst the left are gentle.     Here the water is at rest
except    for  the  vortices,  which  both  tend  to  carry sand up to the
crest.
    In ii the general mass of water is beginning its movement to the
 left ; it carries with it the upper convolutions of the ink tree, but
 leaves the root very nearly in the same position as in i. The crest of
the ripple-mark is but little displaced.      In iii the crest has begun its
 displacement, so that although the root of the ink tree has begun
 moving to the left, it is still over the crest. The convoluted stem
continues to move to the left with increasing velocity, leaving the
 root behind it over the crest.
     Just before the convolutions reach the position over the middle of

 the furrow, the root leaves its crest and moves with very great speed
 to the left.    In iv the root is just passing under the convolutions.
 The whole system is moving with its maximum velocity, but the root
 outstrips the stem. The two slopes of the crest are nearly symme
 trical. In v the root has gained so far on the convolutions as to have
 again reached a crest.

   In vi the convolutions    have caught up the root, and the crests are-
being displaced.
   Finally vii is a repetition   of i in the opposite direction, and the
half oscillation is completed.
   If in these figures i to vii we take the wave-length of ripple-mark
as  unity, the amplitude of oscillation of the main body of water is 2'1,

that    of the crests is -7, and the breadth of the convolutions of the tre-
is "3.       The sum of the amplitude of oscillation of the crest, with
the breadth of the convolutions,                and the wave-length        of ripple-
mark is equal to 2, and this is very nearly equal to the amplitude of
oscillation of the water, as it ought to be.                                         —

     The law which governs the intensity of the vortices must be a i
matter of inference, since     I     found the motion too rapid to be sure of
anything save that the vortices are driven alternately by pulses, and
that the motion was most energetic near the elongations.
     In i the right hand vortex of a pair must be at its maximum of
intensity, and it seems probable that the left hand vortex has a sub-
maximum           in consequence of the friction of the water along th-
dividing line.         During the return motion from i to vii, the left
hand vortex must be increasing               in intensity, so that it is at its
 maximum in vii.            Probably    the   right hand vortex diminishes in
 intensity from i to v, and then increases to its sub-maximum in vii.
     I am not able to say from observation that the vortices which have
been described as giving rise to the ink mushrooms                  actually exist in
this state of oscillation, but if they are there, one of them should be
found at the point marked with an asterisk in iv.
     The figures tell better than words the mechanism by which the
ripple-mark is made and maintained, and the cause of the dance of
the crests.        The only difficulty is in stage iv, where the root of the
 tree is in the state of transference from one crest to the next.             In this
stage    the  vortices   would   seem  to be   in  the  act of degrading  the ripple-
mark, hut they are not then either of them at their maximum                        of
intensity,    and    the time    during  which    this   holds  good  is exceedingly
 short compared with the whole semi-period of oscillation.                  It seems
 somewhat       likely that small vortices are called into existence at the
 points marked with asterisks in iv, which serve to protect the ripple-
 marks from degradation during the transference.
     Fig. 11, i to vii, exhibits the dance of the vortices when the oscilla
  tion of the water is considerably less in amplitude                than the wave
  length of ripple-mark.
     Here the crests of the ripple-mark are scarcely sensibly disturbed.
  Above the crest is drawn the pair of mushroom vortices, the curved
 wows showing the direction of rotation being placed outside of the
 nrashrooms ; but   I      am not able to satisfy myself that they are both
 in existence during the whole oscillation.                Fig. 8 above exhibits an
 appearance      which    I  have  sometimes      seen,  which  seems to show that
 they may both exist together with an ink tree.
     We must now draw attention to the manner in which the convolu
 tions are added to the ink tree, and thus show the continuity of this
  fig. 11 for gentle oscillation with fig. 10 for violent oscillation.

subsequent unwrapping assumes more and more prominence.

   It must be understood that these figures are drawn from the results
of long watching of the process.            My attention was at one time
directed to one part of the phenomenon, and at another to a different
part, and the amplitudes were constantly varied.           I do not pretend to
be able to see      all these changes in    a single half oscillation, lasting
barely half a second.      It may appear that I am incorrect in some parts
of the construction, but       I would ask any one who repeats the experi
ments not to condemn me hastily, for the constructions which            I have
given are the results       of frequent trials and errors in the attempt to
represent the changes observed.
   I have    not been able to determine exactly the mode of motion in the
initial stages of ripple-making, when the oscillation has large ampli
tude. hnt when the ripple-marks are still in what          I have described as
the  curdling stage.
   If  a  current    be passed   over existing ripple-mark a vortex is esta
blished on the       lee of each ripple ; if the current be reversed the
vortex is on the other side.          Thus intermittent opposite currents
will form ripple-mark, but probably without giving it a very regular
wave-length.                                                                   „
   If  the  intermittence is rapid, the vortex established on the lee-side,
when the      current is in one direction, is not annulled when the current
is reversed, but it will be carried over the crest of the ripple-mark,
and will diminish in intensity, whilst the new vortex with opposite -
rotation is established.
   The study      of a very gentle oscillation over existing ripple-mark, by
means     of a drop of ink placed on the ridge, enables us to observe
these vortices (see fig. 3).      I think it depends on the amplitude of
oscillation whether both vortices are always in existence and simply
 vary in   intensity, or whether the vortex due to motion to the right is
quite annulled during the motion to the left, and vice versa.
   It may be suspected, therefore, that, in the early stages of ripple-
 making, when the amplitnde of oscillation is large, vortices are set up
 in the lee of each aggregation        of sand, in the same way as if the
 current were permanent, and that when the current is reversed these
 vortices  are speedily annulled, and a new set on the other side of the
 aggregations is established.       When a drop of ink is put on an aggre
gation, and the oscillation is started, the ink forms a layer of not more
than half a millimetre in thickness.        It is easy to see that there takes
place some     kind of rapid oscillation which is not simply harmonic.        It
appears to     present all the characters of the motion when gentle oscilla
tion is established over ripple-mark of some height, and therefore it
w probable that the motion is of the same kind in both cases.
   When the aggregations are more pronounced, small correlated tree
vortices are set up.       As above stated, it has seemed to      me that  fre
quently    only half of each tree vortex is set up at first.

   I am disposed    to regard this as the transitional state from the mode
of oscillation, which produces the octave with small height of ripple-
crest, to the fundamental with considerable height.
   In gentle oscillation over high ripple-mark the tree vortices are,
in the first instance,  seen to be started by the mushroom vortices, anil
the same is probably true of the condition we are considering.
    If the suggested view as to the mode of transition be correct,
then we must       suppose that at first every alternate tree vortex is
started by its correlated mushroom vortex.         If there be no tree vor
tices, or if there be only every alternate one, the vortices can pack
twice as close as if the trees are symmetrical ; but the existence of a
half tree vortex tends to generate its other half, and this half cannot
exist normally unless every alternate ripple-mark is removed.           The
degradation of the alternate ripple-mark must arise then from the
existence of the second half of the ink tree.      In these early stages the
phenomenon is not highly regular, and therefore, besides the small-
ness of the scale and the rapidity of the motion, we have the difficulty
of irregularity to contend with.
   Other observers have endeavoured to determine the laws con
necting the wave-length in the ultimate formation with the various
concomitant     circumstances, and I shall leave this subject to the
following section, where some account of their work will be given.
   We may summarise the results of these observations as follows : —
   The formation of irregular ripple-marks or dunes by a current is
due to the vortex which exists on the lee of any superficial inequality
of the bottom; the direct current carries the sand up the weather
slope and the vortex up the lee slope.      Thus any existing inequalities
are increased, and the surface of sand becomes mottled over with
irregular dunes. The velocity of the water must be greater than one
limit and less than another, the limiting velocities being dependent on
the average size and density of the particles.             Existing regular
ripple-mark is maintained by a current passing over it perpendicular
to the ridges.     A slight change in form ensues, the weather slope
becoming less steep and the lee slope steeper. The ridges are also
slowly displaced to leeward. The regular ripple-mark may also thus
be somewhat prolonged, so that although a uniform current cannot,
as I believe, form regular ripple-mark, yet it may increase the area
 over which it is to be found.
    Regular ripple-mark is formed by water which oscillates relatively
to the bottom.      A pair of vortices, or in some cases four vortices, are
 established in the water ; each set of vortices corresponds to a single
ripple-crest and the vortices oscillate about a mean position, changing
their shapes and intensities periodically, but not with a simplo
harmonic     motion.
   The successive changes in the vortex motion, whilst ripple-mark

1883.]               On the Formation    of Ripple-mark.                 35
is being established, and when the amplitude of oscillation over
existing ripple-mark varies, are complex. As far as I have been able
to determine, the following is an account of the phenomena : —
     We begin with variation in amplitude of oscillation over existing
regular ripple-mark, where the height of the undulations is not a very
small fraction of the wave-length.
     When the amplitude of oscillation is small compared with the wave
length, a pair of small vortices are established above the crest of
-each ripple-mark, rotating in opposite directions.           In the mean
 position the upward current is over the crest, and the current of
 water tends to carry up sand from each furrow to the crest. The
dividing line of the vortices oscillates, but the bottom of the line has
 much less amplitude of oscillation than the top, so that the dividing
 line is alternately inclined to one and the other side of the vertical.
 The vortices are thus carried backwards and forwards over the crest
 of the ripple, but the current always tends to maintain the crest,
 merely displacing very slightly the position of the highest point.
 The vortex which is on the lee-side is more intense than the other.
  We will call these the primary vortices. (See tig. 3.)
      Suppose now the amplitude of oscillation to be somewhat larger ;
  then the primary vortices by their friction on the adjacent water
 generate two other vortices.      The upward current in these secondary
  vortices has its mean position over the middle of a furrow, and the
 -current comes down immediately over the upward current of the
  primary pair of vortices.       It appears that sometimes only every
  alternate one of the secondary vortices is established.       The upward
  current of the secondary vortices oscillates with a motion which is
  very far from being harmonic.        It remains at its elongation for a
  long    time  and  then  darts  across  to the other elongation.     (See
  fig. 11.)    During this mode of oscillation the primary vortices are
  carried much further backwards and forwards over the crests.
      With still larger amplitude of oscillation it is no longer possible to
   distinguish the primary vortices, and the secondary vortices increaso
   in intensity. It seems probable that the primary vortices are no
   longer both in existence during the whole oscillation, but that they
   are alternately created and annulled, so that when one exists the
   other does not.    If this be so the vortex which exists is that which
   is on the lee side of the ripple in the state of motion at the instant.
      With strong oscillation the secondary vortices apparently do .all
   the work, and the primary vortex, if it exists, only exists for a short
   time, whilst it may serve as a protecting vortex to the ripple-crest,
   daring the rapid transference of the dividing line of the secondary
   vortices from one crest to the next.     Each secondary vortex is alter
    nately a vortex under the lee of a ripple-mark as exhibited in fig. 10.
   Mere description is hardly sufficient to explain the motion.
                                                                D 2

36                         Prof. G. H. Darwin.                    [Nov. 22.
    With very violent oscillation the ripple-marks are obliterated, and
the water is filled with flying dust.
    We now revert to the initiation of ripple-mark.
    If the surface be very even, as when sand is sprinkled on glass,
when a uniform oscillation of considerable amplitude be established,
the sand is carried backwards and forwards and somo of the particles
stick in places of greater friction. As soon as there is any superficial
inequality, it is probable that a vortex is set up in   the lee of the in
equality which tends to establish a dune there.         Such vortices are,
however, too small to be seen.      The return current   in the second half
of an oscillation maintains the dune, a vortex being     established on the
other side, now the lee-side.     As the sand tends to stick by friction in
a great    number of positions, the sand agglomerates into elongated
patches, and the patches are so near to one another that the vortex
on either side of one patch just fails to interfere with the next patch.
As the patches elongate and regularise themselves the vortices
increase in intensity, and the vortex established on one leo is not
obliterated in the return current.       The two vortices are then the
primary vortices described above. As the ripple increases in height
by the obliteration of some of the elongated patches, the primary
vortices set up the secondary vortices.     Perhaps the normal state of
transition is that only one of the secondary vortices is established at
first, and that when the other secondary vortex is set up it tends to
obliterate every alternate ripple-mark, and thus to generate a ripple
of double wave-length.        As the ripples increase in height the
secondary vortices become more and more important, and the primary
less important.     The final or stationary condition is that described
above as the case of strong oscillation.
    It is to be admitted that this history of the successive stages of
the formation of ripple-mark is to some extent speculative, but it is
the only method of formation which appears to accord with the
various phenomena observed and described above.
    It is important to note that when once a fairly regular ripple-
 mark is established, a wide variability of amplitude in the oscillation
 is consistent with its maintenance or increase.        No explanation of
 ripple-making can    be deemed satisfactory   which   does not satisfy this
 condition.
     In this summary no attempt has been made to go over again the
 various peculiarities of the motion, which have been noted above, such
 as the dance of the crests and of the convolutions of the dividing line
 of the vortices. We must refer the reader back for the consideration
 of these points.

tion, I have but little to say on his work.              He remarks that regular
ripples are due to      alternating currents, and that the irregular marks

     In this passage the dance of the particles is in the first place
described as being from one side to the other of the ridge, and this, I
believe, is the fact.          This statement is, however, apparently contra
 dicted by what follows, viz., that the dance is from crest to crest.                     I
 have     very    rarely    seen the intercalated           ripple-marks to which
 M.    de Candolle     refers, but I venture to think that his explanation is
 not sound, and that they are formed by the particles of sand which,
 in violent oscillation, have been caught up by the secondary or tree
 vortices, carried quite round and dropped at the root of the tree,
 when the oscillations of the water are dying out.
     M. de Candolle arrives at the interesting conclusion that the wave
 length of ripple-mark is independent of the nature of the oscillating
 fluid. His suggestion that cirrus clouds are ripple-marks between two
 aerial currents will be referred to below. The whole paper forms a
 valuable contribution, and should be read by those who are interested
  in the subject.
      The last paper to which            I  shall refer is by M. Forel.t          He has
 made extensive observations on ripple-mark, formed both naturally
  and artificially.       He distinguishes between dunes formed by continu
   ous   currents    either   of air or water and ripple-marks formed by
 oscillation.      His view accords with the experiments in § 1 above, but
  he has not apprehended the importance of the vortex in the lee of the

  Geneve, 15 Juillet, 18c3.      M. Forel quotes an article of mine in " Nature " as
  attributing the formation of ripple-mark to the action of currents in the sea. My
  statement was intended merely to imply that shallowness        of water is favourable to
  the formation of ripple-mark. I had already made       a great part of these experiments
 when that article was written in 1882.

dune, considering that region merely as slack water.                      I   feel some
donbt as to the view that a regular series of dunes may be formed by
uniform current; at any rate, in my experiments the dunes were
irregular, and had no definite wave-length.
    His observations on         the circumstances which govern the wave
length    of   ripple-mark are important.            He finds that the factors
which enter are the amplitude and period of oscillation of the water;
and a third factor is the maximum velocity of the water, which lie
takes as identical with the ratio between the two others.                         If the
water moves as a whole with a simple harmonic oscillation it is un
doubtedly true that the ratio of amplitude to period is proportional
to the maximum velocity, but the vortices quite disturb this relation.
The maximum velocity of the water relatively to the bottom must
depend upon the intensity of the vortices, and this depends upon the
 height of the ripple-mark.
    M. Forel finds that the length and breadth of the vessel have no
 influence on wave-length, but that it diminishes with increasing depth
 of water.     This he attributes to a diminution both of the period and
 of the amplitude of the oscillation of the water which is in contact
 with the bottom. The wave-length increases with the coarseness of
 the sand.                                                                               .
    He remarks that when the ripple-mark is once made, the amplitude
 of oscillation is without influence on its wave-length.                      He draws
 attention to the two limiting velocities, one too great, and the other
 too small for the formation of ripples, for which values were found
 in the experiments of § 1.                                                             —-
    IL Forel explains ripple-mark as the confluence of two dunes,
formed     alternately by the oscillating currents.                  This theory is
 undoubtedly      correct,  if somewhat incomplete.
    The wave-length,       he says, is the amplitude      of oscillation of a grain
 of sand
           " librement transported par l'eau."           This expression requires
 further explanation ; if it means the amplitude of oscillation of a
 particle of water at the bottom, when the oscillation is started, and
 before the ripples have risen, T am disposed to doubt it. It may
 mean the distance which an average grain of sand is transported
 when lying on the surface of other sand, under the like circum
 stances ;*  if   so,  ripple-marks formed with        a thin layer of sand on         a
 sheet  of glass should have         a longer wave-length       than   if   the sand be
 thick ; this I am also disposed to doubt.                 However this may be,
M. Forel considers that the wave-length should vary directly as the
amplitude of oscillation, directly as the velocity of the current,
inversely as the density of the sand, and inversely as the size of the
grains. Considering with M. Forel that the velocity of the current is

    the ratio of amplitude to period, we should have the wave-length for
    any one sand varying as the frequency multiplied by the square of
    the amplitude.    The few fairly consistent experiments recorded in
    § 1, do not accord with     this view, for it    seemed that wave-length
    varied as v, which is        proportional   to frequency multiplied by
   amplitude.     This I understand to accord with M. de Candolle's law.
    As to the law that the finer the sand the longer the wave-length, M.
    Forel justly observes that it is in contradiction with the fact that small
   ripples are formed by fine sand, and large ripples by coarse sand. But
   he endeavours to remove the apparent inconsistency by remarking in
   effect that the larger limiting velocity for fine sand is smaller than the
   smaller limiting velocity for coarse sand. There must undoubtedly
   be truth in this view, but I hesitate to accept it as the whole truth.
      Noticing that, in the same sites in the Lake of Geneva, the ripples
   are always of the same length, he says, " de ces observations il
  semblerait resulter que l'intensite des vagues a bien pen d'influence
  stir la largeur des rides ; que la nature du sol est le seul facteur
  important."
      It  appears to me that M. Forel's view as to the wave-length of
  ripple-mark cannot be accepted as final, but he has certainly
  thrown much light on the subject in his interesting paper.
     The    following   considerations    bear  upon    the laws   of   wave
 length    :—
     It appeared that in the initial stages of ripple-making, the wave
 length is at first only half as long as it becomes ultimately, and
 that when the layer of sand is thin, the wave-length always remains
 shorter than if it is thick.    Hence if a little sand is dusted on to the
 oscillating sheet of glass, it is found that the wave-length of ripple is
 long in the middle of the patch of sand, and short near the margins.
 Thus the patch when ripple-marked presents such an appearance
                                     Fig. 12.
as    fig. 12.   If the sand is thin, this appearance often persists
however long the oscillation is maintained.          This shows that wave-

length is a function       of the height of the existing undulations ; that is
to say,   not. only of the amplitude of oscillation of the upper part of the
vortices, but also of their intensity.          On the parts of the plate where
the sand is thick, a continual rearrangement of ripple-mark goes on ;
the wave-length extends by the excision of short patches of inter
calated ripple-mark, and by general rearrangement.                     Finally the
sand reaches an ultimate condition as regards wave-length,                although
rearrangement of ripple-mavk still appears to go on for a long time.
Then we find in this final condition most of the sand arranged with a
certain fundamental wave-length, but where the sand is thin, patches
remain with the octave or half wave-length.
    It is not ensy to understand precisely the mode in which the
oscillation of the water over the undulating bottom gives rise to
vortices, but there are familiar instances in which nearly the same
kind of fluid motion must occur.
    In the mode of boat propnlsion called sculling, the sailor places an
oar with a flat blade through a rowlock in the stern of the boat, and,
keeping the handle high above the rowlock, waves the oar back
wards and forwards with an alternate inclination of the blade in one
direction and the other.           This action generates a stream of water
sternwards.       The manner in which the blade meets the water is
closely    similar to that in which the slopes or two ripple-marks
alternately meet the oscillating water ; the sternward current in one
case, and the upward current in the other are due to similar causes.
We may feel confident that in sculling, a pair of vortices are formed
with axes vertical,         and that the dividing line between them is
 "noons.      The motion of a fish's tail gives rise to a similar rearward
 current in almost the same way.               These instances may help us to
 realise the formation of the ripple-making vortices.
    Lord Rayleigh has considered the problem involved in the oscilla
 tions of a layer of vortioally moving             fluid separating two uniform
 streams.-     At the meeting of the British Association at Swansea in
 1880, Sir William Thomson read a paper discussing Lord Rayleigh's
 problem. t     He showed that, in a certain case in which the analytical
 solution leads to an infinite value, there are waves in the continuous
 streams     in diametrically opposite phases, and that the vortical
 stratum consifits of a series of oval vortices.          Fig. 13 illustrates this
 mode of motion.          The uniform current flowing over existing ripple-
 mark exhibits almost a realisation of this mode of motion, one of the
 streams   of fluid being replaced by the sandy undulations.             The same
 kind of motion must exist        in air when a gust of wind blows a shallow
 pnddle   into standing ripples.

   It seems probable that what is called a mackerel sky is an evidence
of a closely similar mode of motion ; and this agrees with M. de Can-
dolle's suggestion that cirrus is aerial ripple-mark.               The layer of
transition between two currents of fluid is dynamically unstable, but if
a series of vortices be interpolated,      so as to   form friction rollers as it
were, it probably becomes stable.           It is likely that in air a mode of
motion would be set up by friction, which in frictionless fluid wonld
be stable.     If one of the currents of air be colder than the other, a
precipitation of vapour will be caused in the vortices, and their shapes
will   be rendered evident by clouds.*
   The direction of striation and velocity of translation of mackerel
clouds require consideration according to this theory.             If the velocity
of the upper current be m, and of the lower current be — u, the
interposed vortices have a velocity zero, and have their axes perpen
dicular to the velocity u. Hence if relatively to the earth the rect
angular components of the upper current are u+w, v, and of the
lower are    — u + w, v, the component velocities of the vortices are to, v,
and their    axes are parallel to the component v.
   Therefore the striations should be parallel to that direction in which
the two currents have equal components, and the component velocity
of the clouds parallel to the striations should be equal that of either
current in the same direction.         The resultant velocity of the clouds is
clearly equal to a half of that of the two currents, and the component
velocity of the striations perpendicular to themselves is the mean of
the components of the two currents in the same direction.
    [If one of the currents veers the axes of the vortices are shifted.
   *  I had suggested that the centrifugal force of the vortical rotation must
produce rarefaction, fall of temperature, and precipitation of Tapour.    I have to
thank Professor Stokes for pointing out that the fall of temperature would neces
sarily be so small as only to cause precipitation if the air were almost completely
saturated.   I think the fall of temperature at the centre of the vortex might be
between a hundredth and a fiftieth of a degree Centigrade.    [Sir W. Thomson tells
me that he had given this vortical explanation before the B. A. in 1876.        The
volume, however, gives no abstract.   He explains the formation of cloud as due to
 the upward motion in the vortices, and consequent rarefaction.— Jan. 4, 1884.J

The existing clouds   will be furrowed obliquely, and the vortical stratum
will be cut up into diamond-shaped spaces, determined by the inter
section  of the old and new vortex-axes. This would explain the patch
work arrangement commonly observed in mackerel sky.              May not the
lengths of the patches give a measure of the rate of veering of one
of the currents ? — Jan. 4, 1884.]
   The above account of the formation of ripple-marks shows it to be
due to a  complex arrangement of vortices.        The difficulty of observa
tion is considerable, and perhaps some of the conclusions may require
modification.    I  hope that otber experimenters may be induced to
examine the question.
   Lord Rayleigh      has   shown     me   a  mathematical     paper, as  yet
unpublished,    in which he has considered the formation of aerial
vortices over a vibrating plate.      It seems possible that an application
 might be made of similar modes of approximation to the question of
water oscillating over a corrugated          bottom.    Even a very rough
solution would probably throw much light on the exact changes which
the ripple-making vortices undergo, and any guidance from theory
 would much facilitate observation.
"On the Atomic Weight of Titanium."                   By T. E. THORPE,
        •    .   F.R.S.     Received November        7. 1883.
                       (Preliminary communication.)
    The stoichiometrical     quantities which we ordinarily term atomic
 weight* are not only the fundamental constants of chemical calcula
 tions; their relations as mere numbers are of the highest significance
 in connexion with our conceptions concerning the essential nature of
 matter.
    The recent publications of Becker and Clarke          in America, and of
 Lothar Meyer and Seubert in Germany, have                 served  to demon
 strate on how slight an experimental basis a            large   number — the
 greater proportion, it must be confessed — of the         accepted values of
 these constants really depend.
    A notable   instance of this fact is seen in the case of titanium.
 The atomic weight of this element was determined by Rose iu 1829,
 and by Pierre in 1847 with the following results : —
                    Rose                  48 13 and 49 58,
                    Pierre                50 25.
    The commonly accepted value of titanium is that founded upon the
 experiments of Pierre j the atomic weight adopted by Mendelejeff in
 the series based upon his periodic law is 48, a number which finds

some   experimental           support from the observations of Rose.                          The
direct evidence      in   favour of      either    value       is,  however,   very slight, and
a critical examination of the observations affords no ground for
assuming that Rose's value is nearer the truth than that of Pierre. It
is probable that the value 48 has been adopted in one or two modern
text-books, mainly because it agrees best with the requirements of the
periodic law.
   I have attempted to deduce the atomic weight of titanium from
observations made with the tetrachloride, the tetrabromide, and the
dioxide.     The present communication contains the results furnished
by the analysis of the chloride.                   The work with this body affords
three independent           values   for  Ti   based     on the ratios —

chlorine and silver, it at once disposes of the possibility of error du-

 the chlorine or the titanic oxide, are given with the exception of two -r
 one of these was made upon a small quantity of material, and was

-value becomes  —

    It would appear,    therefore, from these observations,        that titanium
must   be added to the increasing list of the elements whose atomic weights
are simple multiples of tliat of hydrogen.
    In these observations, which have occupied           me many months, I
have sought to eliminate such sources of error as were known to me.
It is of course possible, in spite of the agreement between tins
several values, that the results may be affected by undetected and
constant errors.     Experience warns us that no determination                   of
atomic weight, however well the individual observations may agree
among themselves, can be considered wholly satisfactory if it depends
 upon a single reaction or is referred to a single relation.         It is for this

reason      that   I  have sought to extend my observations                    to other
compounds         of titanium,      and to vary the nature of the reactions
involved in the chemical process.                 Unfortunately it is found thnt
comparatively few bodies containing              titanium lend themselves to tho
purpose of atomic weight determination.                  I am, however, making
observations with the tetrabromide, which, in some respects, is to be
preferred to the tetrachloride, and the results furnished by its analysis
will be given in a second communication, which will also contain
details respecting the preparation of the substances used, the methods
of weighing, tho processes of manipulation,                  effect of errors, &c.
With reference to the tetrabromide, I may here say that I find it can
be very easily made by the action of hydrobromic                  acid gas upon the
chloride, and that this proves            to   be   a more  convenient       method of
preparation than that by which it was first obtained by Duppa.

     This ./Ecidium,        which is common in this country upon Rumex
 hydrolapathum,         Huds., obtusifolius, Linn., crispus, Linn., and con-
 glomeratus, Murray, was regarded by Fuckel* and Cooket as being
 a condition of Uromyces rumicis (Schum.), is now stated by Winter                      J
 in his last work to be a condition of Puccinia magnnsiana.                      During
 the present year I have conducted a series of cultures, in which the
 life history of this fungus has been carefully,                if not laboriously,
 worked out, from which it appears that JEcidium rumicis bears the
 same relationship to Puccinia phragmitis (Schum.) { = P. arundinacea,
 D.C.) as
             jEcidium berberidis, Gmel., bears to Puccinia graminis, Perss.
     History    of the Subject. — Winter, in 1875, § showed that those
 botanists who had associated this ^Ecidium with the Uromyces rumicis,
 simply because these two fungi occurred upon the same host plant,
  were wrong, and that the fungus in question was the aecidiospore                     of
  Puccinia phragmitis.           Stahl, in 1876, repeated Winter's experiment,
 and confirmed         it.    Now it happens that there are two Puccinint
  common upon Phragmitis communis, the P. phragmitis (Schum.), and
 P. magnusiana, Korn.||            In March, 1877, Schroter^f placed the spores

of both these Puecinia} upon Rumex hydrolapathum (the species Winter
originally experimented with), and found that the ./Ecidium was only
produced from P. magnusiana.              Winter,* in the " Kryptogamen-
Flora," now in course of publication, accepts Schroter's statement,
and gives as the aecidiospores of Puecinia magnusiana, not only the
./Ecidium on Rumex hydrolapathum, but also on R. crispus, conglomeratic,
obtusifolius, and acetoia, and adds a note to the effect that the ./Ecidium
upon Rheum officinale has probably the same life history.
   Personal Investigations. — In 1882        I performed a number of experi
mental     cultures    for  the   purpose   of  personally observing the life
history of the hetercecismal uredines generally.             For instance, upon
two occasions, a handful of reed leaves and stems were laid upon
healthy plants of Rumex conglomeratus ; after a time these plants
became affected with JEcidium rumicis, and               I  naturally concluded
that   this  had   arisen  from    the spores  of  Puecinia    magnusiana which
I  had observed upon the reeds employed.              Afterwards, upon three
separate occasions, when         I  had become more expert ip performing
these    experiments,    I  applied the spores of P. magnusiana to other
plants of Rumex conglomeratus and once to R. obtusifolius, but without
producing any ^Ecidium.             Subsequent research has rendered clear
that on the reeds used in my first two experiments, both Puecinias
were present.       Being desirous of finding, if possible, the aecidiospores
of P. phragmitis, if this plant possessed any, I this year placed its
spores upon various Ranunculi (R. repens and Ficaria), but without
any result.      It then occurred to me that Winter might be in error in
affiliating all the dock aecidia to P. magnusiana, and that perchance on
some of them the aecidiospores of P. phragmitis might occur.                  This
 presumption was favoured by the fact that the aedioia we have been
 in the habit in this country of lumping together as Mcvlium ranunat-
 lacearum include two species which, although resembling each other
 very closely in appearance, have distinct life histories.           I, therefore,
 on 16th May (1883), placed sporest of Puecinia phragmitis upon
 Rumex crispus, and in due time obtained an abundant crop of JEcidium
 rnmicis.    On 16th June, when the ^Ecidium             was perfectly mature,
 I placed some of its spores upon two plants of Phragmitis communis,
 where it produced, first the uredo (distinguished from the uredo of
 P. magnusiana by the absence of paraphyses), and later the perfect
 Puecinia   phragmitis.      Subsequently plants of Rumex hydrolapathum,
 obtusifolius,   conglomeratus,     and Rheum officinale, were successfully
 infected with      Puecinia phragmitis spores ; whereas the infection of
 other specimens of these plants with Puecinia magnusiana was in all

       Action of Metals in Electrolytes."            By G. Gore, LL.D.,
       F.R.S. Received November 14, 1883.
                                  (Abstract.}
    The author states that the object of this research was " to ascertain
the thermo-electric action of a series of metals in particular liquids,
and to examine the relations of the thermo-electric          to the chemico-
electric behaviour of metals in electrolytes, and to ordinary chemical
corrosion, and the source of the voltaic current."
    With this object, the thermo-electric tension series, also the chemico-
electric tension series, at 60° and 160° F. of thirteen metals in solu
 tions of twenty-two different salts, alkalies, and acids, were experi
mentally found, and are shown in two tables. The same thermo- and
chemico-electric     series were also determined in solutions of different
strengths of the same substances, and are also exhibited in two
tables ; and the effects of difference of strength of liquid upon the
orders of those series are inferred from the results.
    Several other tables contain series of determinations of the electric
potentials, in volts, of numerous thermo-electric, and also of chemico-
electric couples of the same series of metals in the weak solutions and
in the strong    ones, and show the influence    of strength of liquid upon
thermo-electric    and chemico-electric   potential.   The measurements of
potential were made by means of a new form of thermopile (see
" Proc. Birm. Phil. Soc," vol. iv, Part
                                             1).
    The influence of temperature upon the chemico-electric potential of
those metals in the series of weak solutions, and also in the strong
ones, at 60° and 160" F., was also determined, and the results are
given in several tables.
    The " voltaic reversal points," or temperatures at which the two
metals of a voltaic pair balanced each other, and produced no current,
in fifty-four different cases discovered during the research, were also
determined and are given.        The metals and solutions employed were
the same as thoso used in the previous series of experiments.

      The potentials    of voltaic currents with the    same series  of metals in
  the   weak    solutions   at 60°  F. were also determined in seventy-five
  instances,   in each    case  in thermo-electric terms of one of the same
  metals in the same liquid ; aud the iramber of degrees of difference of
  temperature      of the particular thermo-electric • couple reqnired to
  balance the corresponding voltaic couple in each instance is given in
  a table.
     A  series   of experiments was also made to determine whether the
 difference    in potential, cansed by heating a voltaic couple, is com
 pletely    accounted for by the electromotive forces produced by the
 same    rise  of temperature of the      same   metals separately in the same
 liquids, and the results are shown in a table.
     With considerable difficulty, a series of about 120 determinations
 •were   also made     of rates of ordinary chemical corrosion of the same
  metals   in solutions of the same substances at 60° F., and a second
 series of about seventy-five determinations          with the same metals and
  liquids at 160° F. were also made, and the results are given in two
 tables.
     These   and other results are contained in a series of twenty tables;
 and by    comparing the contents of these various tables with each other,
 and also by means of additional experiments, a number of general
 conclusions were obtained.          The following are the conclusions, and
 the chief results arrived at by these means.
     It is shown, that when metals in liquids were heated, they were
 more frequently rendered positive than negative in the proportion of
 about 2"8 to 1 ; and that while the proportion in weak solutions was
 about 2 29 to 1, in strong ones it was about 3-27 to 1 ; and this
accords with their thermo-electric           behaviour as metals alone.      The
 thermo-electric order of metals in liquids was, with nearly every
 solution, whether weak or strong, widely different from the thermo
 electric order of the same metals alone.             A conclusion previously
 arrived at was also confirmed, viz., that the liquids in which the hot
 metal was thermo-electro-positive         in the largest proportion of cases,
 were those containing highly electro-positive bases, such as the alkali
 metals.     The thermo-electric effect of gradually heating a metal in a
 liquid was sometimes different from that of suddenly heating it, and
 was occasionally attended by a reversal of the current.
     Degree of strength of liquid greatly affected the thermo-electric
order of the metals.          Increase of strength usually and considerably
increased the thermo-electric           potential of metals thermo-electro-
negative in liquids, and somewhat decreased th.it of those positive in
liquids.     The electric potential of metals thermo-electro-positive          in
weak liquids was usually about 3-87 times, and in strong ones l-8 7
times as great as of those which were negative.            The potential of th e

 solution   of sodic diphosphate, was 0-6G volt for 100 F. degrees
 difference of temperature, or about 100 times that of a bismuth and
 antimony couple.
    Heating    one  of the metals, either the positive    or negative, of a
 voltaic couple usually increased the electric difference, making most
 metals more positive and some more negative, whilst heating the
 second one also usually neutralised to a^arge extent the effect of heat
 ing the first one.    The electrical effect of heating a voltaic couple was
 nearly wholly composed of the united effects of heating each of thf
 two metals separately, but was not, however, exactly the same,
 because   whilst in the former      case the metals were    dissimilar and
  heated to the same temperature, in the latter they were similar but
 heated to different temperatures : — also, when heating a voltaic pair,
 the heat was a pplied to two metals, both of which were previously
 electro-polar by contact with each other as well as by contact with
 the liquid, but when heating one junction of a metal and liquid
 thermo-couple, the metal had not been previously rendered electro-
 polar by contact with a different one, and was therefore in a some
 what different electric state. When a voltaic combination in which
 the positive metal was thermo-negative and the negative one was
 thermo-positive    was heated, the electric potential       of the couple
 diminished, notw i thstanding that the internal resistance was decreased.
    Magnesium in particular, also zinc and cadmium, were greatly
 depressed in elect ro-motive force in electrolytes by elevation of tem
 perature.    Reversals of position of the two metals of a voltaic couple
 in the tension series by rise of temperature, were usually due to one of
 the two metals increasing        in electro-motive force faster than the
 other, and in many cases        to one metal increasing and the other
decreasing in electro-motive force, but only in a few cases was it
a result of simultaneous but unequal diminution of potential of the
 two metals.    With eighteen different voltaic couples, by rise of tem
 perature from 60° to 160° F., the electro-motive force in twelve cases
 was increased, and in six decreased; and the average proportions of
 increase for the eighteen instances was 0'1 volt for the 100 F. degrees
 of elevation.
    A great difference in chemical composition of the liquid was attended
 by a great change in the order of the volta tension series ; and the
differences of such order in two similar liquids, such as solutions
of hydric chloride and potassic chloride, were much greater than in
those produced in either of those liquids by a difference of 100° F.
of temperature.       Difference of strength of solution, like difference
of composition or of temperature, altered the order of such series with
nearly every liquid, and the amount of such alteration produced by an
increase of four or five times in the strength of the liquid was rather
less than that caused by a difference of 100 F. degrees in temperature

Whilst also variation of strength of liquid caused only a moderate
amount  of change of order in the volta tension series, it produced
more than three times that amount of change in the thermo-electric
tension     series.   The usual effect of increasing
                                                  the strength of the
liqnid upon volta-electro-motive force was to considerably increase         it,
but its effect upon thermo-electro-motive force was to largely decrease
it.  The degree of potential of a metal and liquid thermo-couple was
not always exactly    the same at the same temperatures during a rise
as during a  fall of temperature    this; analogous to the variation of
                                            is
melting and fusing points of bodies under such conditions, and also
to that of supersaturation of    liquid by salt, and
                                    a            a     probably due to

some    hindrance to change of molecular movement.
     The  rate of ordinary chemical corrosion of each metal varied in
every    different liquid in each solution also
                             ;                     differed with every
                                                       it
different    metal.       The most chemically positive
                                                    metals were usually
the   most            corroded, and the corrosion of each metal was
                quickly
usually the fastest with the most acid solutions.     The rate of corro
sion was dependent both upon the nature of the metal and upon that
of the liquid, and was limited by the most feebly active of the two —
usually the electrolyte.    The order of rate of corrosion of metals also
differed in every different liquid.   The more dissimilar the chemical
characters   of two liquids, the more diverse usually was the order of
rapidity  of corrosion of a series of metals in them. The order of rate
of
    simple corrosion in any of the jiquids examined differed largely
from that of degree of chemico-electric,         and still more from that
of thermo-electro-motive force.      Corrosion was not the cause of pure
thermo-electric action of metals in liquids.
   Oat of fifty-eight cases of rise of temperature the rate of ordinary
corrosion was increased in every instance except one, and that was
only  afeeble exception     the increase from 60° to 160° F. with different
                             ;
metals was extremely variable,       and was from 1*5 to 321-6 times.
Whether     ametal increased or decreased in thermo -electro or chemico-
clectro-motive force by being heated,       increased in rapidity of corro
                                            it
sion.  The proportions in which the most corroded metal was also the
most thermo-electro-positive     one was 65-87 per cent. in liquids at
W° F., and 69"12 in the same at 160° F.       and the proportion in which
                                              ;
it was the most chemico-electro-positive      at 60 F. was 84-44 per cent.,
and at 160° F. 80v7 per cent.       The proportion of cases therefore in
which the most chemico-electro-negative           metal was the most corroded
one increased   from 15"5G to 19-23 per cent. by rise of temperature of
                                                      a
100 F. degrees.    Comparison of these proportions shows that corrosion
usually influenced in a greater degree chemico-electric than thermo
electric actions of metals in liquids.     Not only was the relative
number of cases        in which the volta negative was the most corroded,
increased    by   rise of temperature, but also the average relative loss by

;>4                 A ction of Metals in Electrolyte!?.            [Nov. 22.
corrosion of the negative to that of the positive         one   was increased
from 311 to 6'32.
   The theory most consistent with all the various results and conclu
sions is a kinetic one.  That metals and electrolytes are throughout
their mass in a state of molecular vibration. That the molecules of
these substances being frictionless bodies in a frictionless medium, and
their motion not being dissipated by conduction or radiation, they
continue incessantly in motion until some cause arises to prevent
them.    That each metal (or electrolyte) when unequally heated has,
to a certain extent, an unlike class of motions in its differently heated
parts, and behaves in those parts somewhat like two metals (or elec
trolytes), and those unlike motions are enabled through the inter
mediate conducting portion of the substance to render these parts
electro-polar. That every different metal and electrolyte has a different
class of motions, and in consequence of this they also by coutact
alone with each other at the same temperature become electro-polar.
The molecular motion of each different substance also increases at
a different rate by rise of temperature.
     This theory is equally in agreement with the chemico-electrif
results.   In accordance with     when in the case of a metal and an
                                it,
electrolyte the two classes of motions are sufficiently unlike, chemical
corrosion of the metal by the liquid takes place, and the voltaic
current originated by inherent molecular motion under the condition
of contact,  is maintained by the portion of motion lost by the metal
and liquid during the act of uniting together.      Corrosion, therefore,
is an effect of molecular motion, and       one of the modes by which
                                           is
that motion   isconverted into electric current.
   In accordance with this theory,    if we take a thermo-electric pair
consisting   of a  non-corrodible  metal   and an electrolyte (the two
being already electro-polar by mutual contact), and heat one of their
points of contact, the molecular motion of the heated end of each
substance at the junction  isaltered and as thermo-electric energy in
                                      ;
such combinations usually increases by rise of temperature, the metal
and liquid, each singly, usually becomes more electro-polar. In such.
a case the unequally heated metal behaves to some extent like two
metals, and the unequally heated liquid like two liquids, and so the
thermo-electric pair islike a feeble chemico-electric one of two metals
in two liquids, but without corrosion of either metal. If the metal
and liquid are each when alone thermo-electro-positive, and     when in
                                                                  if
contact the metal increases in positive condition faster than the
liquid by being heated, the latter appears thermo-electro-negative,
but if less rapidly than the liquid, the metal appears thermo-electro-
negative.
  As also the proportion of instances    small in which metals that
                                            is
are positive in the ordinary thermo-electric  series of metals only,.

 become negative in the metal and liquid ones (viz., only 73 out of 286
in weak solutions, and 48 out of the same number in strong ones),
we may conclude that the metals more frequently than the liquids
have the greatest thermo-electric influence, and also that the relative
largeness of the number of instances of thermo-electro- positive metals
in the series of metals and liquids, as in the series of metals only, is
partly a consequence of the circumstance, that rise of temperature
usually makes substances, metals in particular,            electro-positive.
These statements are also consistent with the view that the elementary
substances lose a portion of their molecular activity when they unite
to form acids or salts, and that electrolytes therefore have usually a
less degree of molecular motion than the metals of which they are
composed.
   The current    from a thermo-couple of metal and liquid, therefore,
may be viewed as a united result of difference of molecular motion,
first of the two junctions, and second of the two heated (or cooled)
substances ; and in all cases, both of thermo- and chemico-electric
action,   the immediate true cause of the current is the original
molecular vibrations of the substances, whilst contact is only a static
permitting condition.     Also, that whilst in the case of thermo-electric
action,  the   sustaining cause is molecular motion supplied by an
external source of heat, in the case of chemico-electric action it is the
motion lost by the metal and liquid, when chemically uniting
together.     The direction of the current in thermo-electric          cases
appears to depend upon which of the two substances composing a
junction increases in molecular activity the fastest by rise of
temperature, or decreases the most rapidly by cooliug.

Voltaic Currents," the author has investigated the amounts of external
voltaic current produced by the corrosion of known weights of
various metals at atmospheric temperature.

   The Report of the Royal Gardens at Kew for 1881 contains
abstracts of correspondence, in which it was pointed out that, in
order to introduce a cheese- making industry in India, some vegetable
substitute must be found for the ordinary animal rennet, since cheeso
made with the latter is unsaleable among the natives.       In response to
the above  " Surgeon-Major Aitchison brought to the notice of the autho-

  56                               Mr. S. Lea.                          [Nov. 22,
  rities at Kew that the fruit of Puneeria* coagulant, a shrub common
  in Afghanistan and Northern India, possesses the properties of coagu
  lating milk ;" and experiments showed that an aqueous extract of the
  seed-capsules of the above plant does somewhat rapidly coagulate
  milk.
      I was  recently requested to make some experiments on the seeds of
  Withania to determine whether they contain a definite ferment with
  the properties of ordinary rennet, and the applicability of such a
  ferment to cheese-making purposes.
     The material supplied to me consisted of an agglomerated dry mass
 of seed-capsules and fragments of the stalks of the plant.                When
 crushed in a mortar the whole crumbled down into a coarse powder,
 in which the seeds were for the most part liberated from the capsules.
 I  picked out the larger pieces of stalk, sifted out the finer particles,
 chiefly earth and fragments of the capsules, and then by a further
 sifting   I  separated the seeds from the other larger particles.           The
 seeds appeared to be each enveloped in a coating of resinous material,
 presumably      the  dried juice of     the  capsules    in which they had
 ripened.
     Taking equal weights of the seeds,       I extracted them for twenty-
four hours with equal volumes of (i) water, (ii) 5 per cent. sodic
chloride, (iii) 2 per cent. hydrochloric acid, (iv) 3 per cent. sodic
carbonate. Equal volumes of each of the above were added in an
acid, alkaline, and neutral condition, to equal volumes of milk, and
 heated in a water-bath at 38° C. The milk was rapidly coagulated by
the salt and sodic carbonate extracts, much less rapidly by the other
two ; of the four, the salt extract was far the most rapid in its action.
 All subsequent experiments have shown that a 5 per cent. solution of
sodic chloride is the most efficient in the extraction of the active
 principle from the seeds.
     There is no ddubt that the substance which possesses the coagu
lating power is a ferment closely resembling animal rennet.
    I. A portion of the 5 per cent. sodic chloride extract loses its
activity if boiled for a minute or two.
     II. The active principle is soluble in glycerine, and can be extracted
 from the seeds by this means ; the extract possesses strong coagu
lating powers even in small amounts.
    III. Alcohol precipitates the ferment body from its solutions ; and
the precipitate, after washing with alcohol, may be dissolved up again
without having lost its coagulating powers.
    IV. The active principle of the seeds will cause the coagulation of
milk when present in very small quantities, the addition of more of
the ferment simply increasing the rapidity of the change.
          * The genus Puneeria is now reduced by botanists to Withania.

    V. The coagulation is not due to the formation of acid by the
 ferment.     If some of the active extract be made neutral or alkaline
and added to neutral milk, a normal clot is formed, and the reaction
of the clot remains neutral or faintly alkaline.
    VI. The clot formed by the action of the ferment is a true clot,
resembling in appearance and properties that formed by animal rennet,
and is not a mere precipitate.
   Haying thus determined the presence of a rennet ferment in the
seeds,   I  endeavoured to prepare an active extract, which should be
applicable for cheese-making purposes.           All the extracts of the seeds
are of a    deep brown colour, and it appeared, therefore, in the first
place, desirable to obtain less highly coloured , if not colourless, solu
tions, which should still be active.                I
                                           In this have so far failed. The
precipitate    caused     by alcohol carries down the chief part of the
colouring-matter       also, so that on being subsequently redissolved the
solution is nearly as highly coloured as before the precipitation.          The
colonr can be removed by using animal charcoal, but the ferment is at
the same    time destroyed.      If all excess of charcoal is avoided and the
solution is    filtered at once, the filtrate is largely decolorised, but
contains    only traces of the ferment.          Animal rennet is similarly
removed by filtration through charcoal.            The colour can be removed
by the addition of very finely-powdered         kaolin in a dry state, but, as
before, the ferment activity is thereby destroyed.            The same holds
good of animal rennet.          The colouring-matter is scarcely soluble in
either ether or alcohol, so that no advantage is gained by a preliminary
treatment with these before extraction with the salt solution.           I have
also endeavoured to get rid of the colour by treating the seeds as
rapidly as possible with successive quantities of water before making
the final extract.      By using a centrifugal machine I was able to wash
the seeds six or seven times with large volumes of water without
their being exposed for any considerable time to the action of the
 water.    Each portion of water was highly coloured and the seeds
 were thus freed from adherent colouring-matter.           But, apart from the
fact that some, though not much, ferment is thns lost, no special
 advantage is obtained, since the seeds are themselves coloured, and
even after prolonged       treatment with water the final extract is always
of a dark brown colour.
   In order to obviate the disadvantages of this colouring-matter,            if
disadvantage it is,      I have found it best to prepare very concentrated
active extracts of the purified seeds, so that it should only be necessary
to add a very small quantity of the extract in order to coagulate the
milk and obtain a colourless curd.               I
                                           This have done by grinding the
dry seeds very finely in a mill and extracting them for twenty-four
hours with such a volume of 5 per cent. sodic chloride solution that
the mass is still fluid after the absorption       of water by the fragments

of the     seeds as they swell up.       From this    mass the fluid part may be
readily separated by using a centrifugal machine (such as is used in
sugar refining), and it can then be easily filtered through filter-paper ;
without the centrifugal machine the separation of the fluid from the
residue of the seeds is tedious and imperfect, 40 grms. of the seeds
treated as above with 150 cub. centims. of 5 per cent. sodic chloride
solution gave an extract of which 0-25 cub. centim. clotted 20 cub.
centims. of milk in twenty-five minutes, and O-l cub. centim. clotted a
similar portion of milk in one hour. When added in these propor
tions the curd formed is quite white.             The presence of the colouring-
matter is, however, perhaps on the whole unimportant, since even if a
larger quantity of the ferment extract is added in order to obtain a
very rapid coagulation the colouring-matter is obtained chiefly in the
whey, the curd being white.*
    The question of preparing an extract which should be capable of
being kept for a considerable time is perhaps of importance.
Ordinary commercial rennet usually contains a large amount of sodie
chloride     and    some   alcohol.    One    specimen     I  analysed    contained
19 per cent.     of common salt, and 4 per cent. of alcohol.         I have,  there
fore, added to the 5 per cent. chloride extract mentioned above,
enough salt to raise the percentage of this to 15 per cent., and also
alcohol up to 4 per cent. The activity of the extract is not
appreciably altered by this, and such a preparation corresponds very
closely in activity with a commercial solution of animal rennet with
          I
which compared it. The possibility of making extracts which may
be expected to        keep is thus indicated, but of course time alone will
show whether the activity of the ferment is impaired to any important
extent by such keeping.
    I  may add in conclusion that            I  have coagulated a considerable
volume of milk with an extract such as            I have described, and prepared
a cheese from the curds.         I have   also given a portion of the extract
to a professional cheese-maker who has used it as a substitute for
animal rennet in the preparation of a cheese.                  The product thus
obtained,      and   the  statements    of    the   person who has made the
experiment for me, lead me to suppose that extracts of the seeds of
Withania can be used as an adequate and successful substitute for
animal rennet.
   *  It is extremely probnblc that some stage in the growth or ripening of the seeds
of Withania might be found at which the development of colouring-matter is slight.
 while at the same time the ferment is present in considerable quantity.

                    THE PRESIDENT           in the Chair.
   The Report of the Auditors of the Treasurer's Accounts on the
part of the Society was presented, by which it appears that the total
r-ceipts during the past year, including a balance of £1,940 14«. 3(7.
carried from the preceding year, amount to £20,873 19s. 4<Z. ; and
that the total expenditure in the same period, including purchase of
ground rents, amounts to £21,258 10s. 3d., leaving a balance of
£384 10s. lid. due to the Bankers, and £7 4s. 3d. in the hands of
the Treasurer.
   The thanks of the Society were voted to the Treasurer and Auditors.
   The Secretary read the following Lists : —

    The President then addressed the Society        as follows : —
 Gentlemen,
     It will   be as much in consonance with your feelings as it is with
 my    own,   that  the first sentences of this address should give utterance
 to our sense of the calamity which befell us during the recess.
     On the 27th of June, our honoured and loved President, William
 Spottiswoode, fell a victim to that cruel malady, typhoid fever, which
 is at once the scourge and the reproach of modern civilisation ; and
 we were bereaved of a chief of whom all those who had the highest
 interests of this Society at heart, hoped that he would continue, for
 many a year, to discharge the responsible and laborious duties of his
 office with that broad intelligence, that faithful diligence, that inex
haustible patience and courtesy, which were so characteristic of the
 man.
     Every one of the Fellows of the Society, in whose hearing        I speak,
 knows that these are no words of conventional eulogy, as of a cus
 tomary epitaph. But, it is only those of us who worked with our late
 President in the Council, or as officers of the Society, who are in a
 position fully to appreciate his singular capacity for the transaction
of business with clear judgment and rapid decision ; and yet with
 the most conscientious consideration of the views of those with whom
 he was associated.
     And,   I  may add, that it is only those who enjoyed Mr. Spottis-
 woode's     intimate    friendship, as it was my privilege to do for some
 quarter of a century, who can know how much was lost, when there
 vanished from among ns that rare personality, so commingled of
delicate sensitiveness with marvellous self-control, of rigid principle
with genial tolerance, of energetic practical activity with untiring
benevolence,       that it always seemed to me the embodiment of that
•exquisite ideal of a true gentleman which Geoffry Chaucer drew five
hundred years ago        : —

  1883.]                           President's  Address.                        61
                      " .    .  . He lovcde chyvalrye,
                        Trouthe and honour, fredom and curtesie.
                        And though that he was worthy he was     wys,
                        And of his port as meke as is a mayde.
                        He never yit no vilonye ne sayde
                        In al his lyf unto no maner wight.
                        He was a verray perfight gentil knight."
      It is not for me to pass any judgment upon Mr. Spottiswoode's
  scientific labours      ; but    I have the best authority for saying, that
  having occupied         himself    with  many branches of mathematics, more-
  especially with the higher algebra, including the theory of deter
  minants, with the general calculus of symbols, and with the application
  of analysis to geometry and mechanics, he did excellent and durable
  work in all ; and that, in virtue of his sound and wide culture, his deep
  penetration, and the singnlar elegance with which he habitually
  treated all his subjects, he occupied a place in the front rank of
  English mathematicians.
      The interment in Westminster Abbey of one who, though com
  pelled to devote a large share of his time to business, was a born man
   of science,   and had won himself so high a place among mathema
   ticians, was doubtless        grateful to ns as men of science ; it could not
  but be satisfactory       to ns, as Fellows of the Royal Society, that, on the
   rare occasion of the death of our President in office, the general public
.  should show its sympathy with our bereavement ; yet, as men,            I think
   it is good to   regard those solemn and pathetic obsequies as the tribute
   which even our busy, careless, cynical, modern world spontaneously
   pays to such worth and wisdom, to such large humanity and unspotted'
   purity, as were manifested in the "very perfect gentle knight" who
   so well represented the chivalry of science.
       The total number of Fellows deceased during the past year amounts
   to  twenty-one ; a large iuroad upon our ranks in mere numbers, an
    exceptionally severe mortality if we consider the scientific rank of
    many names in the death-roll.               Almost at the same time with
    Mr. Spottiswoode's         nntimely death, we lost, at the ripe old age of
    ninety-five,  a very distinguished       Fellow and former President of this
    Society,   Sir Edward         Sabine.     It is said that the average age of
    Fellows of the Royal Society is greater than that of any body of men
    in Europe ; and it is certainly a remarkable             fact that one who so
    long presided over us in this generation, should, as a man of thirty
    years, have been the contemporary of Sir Joseph Banks, who became
    our President more than a century ago.              And nothing can give a
    more striking exemplification          of the gigantic progress of physical
    science in modern times than the fact that the discovery of oxygen
    by Priestley, and that of the composition of water by Cavendish, fall

                              A nniversary Meeting.                [Nov. 30,
 within the period of Sir Joseph Banks' presidency, while Black's work
 was but a score years earlier.       We are as it were but two Presidents
 off the budding of modern chemistry, as of many another stately
 growth of the tree of natural knowledge.
    Sir Edward Sabine's long services to this Society, first as Treasurer
 and then as President, deserve more than a passing allusion ; but for
a due appreciation of them, no less than of his great labours in
 terrestrial magnetism, I must refer you to our obituary notices.
    By the unexpected death of Professor Heury John Stephen Smith
 the University of Oxford lost one of the most distinguished, as he
 was one of the most influential, among those who have guided its
 destinies during this generation, and a capacity of the first order,
 not yet weakened by the touch of time, has disappeared from the ranks
 of the foremost mathematicians of Europe.
    As Chairman of the Meteorological Committee, Professor Smith
 rendered invaluable services to that body ; and we have all a grateful
 recollection of the readiness with which his knowledge and sagacity
 were brought to our aid in Council and in Committee.
    For the rest, I dare add nothiug to that which has been said of him
 by our late President in that just and loving appreciation of his friend,
 which is now touched with a sadder gravity and a deeper pathos.
    It is difficult to say of Professor Smith whether he was more remark
able as a man of affairs, of society, of letters, or of science ; but it is
 certain that the scientific facet of his brilliant intelligence was alto
 gether directed towards those intelligible forms which people the
 most ethereal regions of abstract knowledge.        Tn Sir William Siemens,
 who, but the other day, was suddenly snatched from among us, we
had a no less marked example of vast energy, large scientific acquire
 ments, and intellectual powers of a high order, no less completely
devoted, in the main, to the application of science to industry.
    I believe I am expressing the opinion of those most competent to
judge, when I say that Sir William Siemens had no superior in
 fertility and ingenuity of invention ; that hardly any living man so
thoroughly combined an extensive knowledge of scientific principles
with the power of applying them in a commercially successful
 manner; and that the value of his numerous inventions must be
measured, not merely by the extent to which they have increased the
 wealth and convenience of mankind, but by the favourable reaction
on the progress of pure science which they, like all such inventions,
 have exerted, and will continually exert.
    Time compels me to be but brief in alluding to the remainder of
our long list of deaths.        But   I may not omit to mention that we
have     lost a distinguished     mathematician    in Professor Challis; in
Mr. James Young,         a  chemist whose skilful application of theory to
practice established a new industry; in Mr. Cromwell Varley, an

1883.]                         Presidents Address.
                                                                           -
ingenious    inventor   ;  in Lord Talbot      de Malahide, a warm friend of  •
science and a zealons promoter of archaeological research;             in Mr.
Walker, an eminent engineer;              in John Elliot Howard, a distin
guished quinologist; and, in the Rev. Dr. Stebbing, an accomplished
and amiable man of letters, who for very many years filled the
honourable, but not very onerous, office, of Chaplain to the Society.
    And it would ill become us, intimately connected as this Society
always has been, and        I   hope always will be, with the sciences upon
which medicine bases          itself, to leave unnoticed the decease of the
very type of a philosophical           physician, the venerable Sir Thomas
Watson.
    Two well-known names have disappeared from among those of the
eminent    men who are enrolled upon our foreign list ; the eminent
physicist Plateau, and the no less distinguished               anatomist and
embryologist Bischoff.
    I  now beg leave to bring under your notice a brief general review
of the work of the Society during the past year.
    The papers printed in the "Transactions" for 1882 and 1883 will
occupy two volumes,        of which three parts, containing 1038 4to. pages
and    52 plates,  have already        been published.   Two parts more, to
complete 1883,    will    shortly be published.
    The "Proceedings," which steadily increase in size from year to
 year, amonnt during the past year to 780 8vo. pages, with four plates
and    numerous engravings.
     Yon are aware   that nothing is printed in the " Proceedings " or in
 the "Transactions"        except by the authority of the Council, which,
 in the latter case, calls in the assistance of at least two carefully-
 selected and independent referees, by whose advice it is in practice,
 though not necessarily, guided.          I am inclined to think that Fellows
 of this Society who do not happen to have served on the Council, are
 little aware of the amount, or of the value, of the conscientious labour
  which is thus performed for the Society by gentlemen whose names
 <lo not appear    in our records. And I trust         I may be forgiven for
 stepping beyond precedent so far as to offer our thanks for work,
  which is always troublesome and often ungrateful ; but, without which,
 the contributions    to our pages would not maintain the high average
 of excellence which they possess.
     Among the points of importance, by reason of their novelty or
 general significance, which have been laid before us, much interest
 attaches to the result brought out in Professor Osborne Reynolds'
 "
    Experimental Investigation of the circumstances which determine
 whether the motion of water shall be direct or sinuous, and of the law
 of resistance in parallel channels "; which shows that when the con
 ditions of dynamical similarity are satisfied, two systems, involving

G4                       Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
fluids treated as viscous, may be compared (as regards their effects)
even when the motions are unstable ; and that if any one of the two
systems is in the critical state separating stability from instability, so
will be the other.
  Last December, Dr. Huggins presented a note on " A Method of
Photographing the Solar Corona without an Eclipse," which had so
far proved successful, under the unfavourable circumstances in which
he had   put it in practice, as to lead to the hope that, under better
conditions of atmosphere and elevation, the corona might be photo
graphed, from day to day, with so much accuracy as to preserve a clear
record of the changes which it undergoes.      And, as the photographs
taken during the eclipse   at Caroline Island show  a condition of the
corona, intermediate between those exhibited by Dr. Huggins' photo
graphs at periods antecedent and subsequent to the Caroline Island
observations, there is reason to believe that this hope is well based,
and that a new and powerful method of investigation has been placed
in the hands of students of solar physics.
   Lord Rayleigh and his sister-in-law, Mrs. Sidgwick, have made a
very elaborate determination of the relation between the ohm and the
British Association standard of electrical resistance.
   -With respect to those branches of knowledge on which          I
                                                                  may
venture to offer an opinion of my own,      I   may say that, though our
records show much useful          and   praiseworthy   work in biological
science, the only event which appears to me to call for special remark
is the opening of an attack upon a problem of very great interest, one
which, in fact, goes to the root of the question of the fundamental
unity of the two great embodiments of life — plants and animals.
   The well-known phenomena presented by many plants, such as the
sensitive plant and the sun-dew, our knowledge of which was so
vastly extended by Darwin, abundantly prove that the property of
irritability, that is, the reaction of a living part, by change of form,.
upon the application of a stimulus to that part, or to some other part
in living continuity with
                           it,
                           is      not confined to animals.
   But, in animals, the connexion of the part irritated with that which
changes its form     always effected by a continuity of more or less-
                    is
modified protoplasmic substance, and reaction takes place only so long
as that continuity  unimpaired
                    is           ;while, hitherto, the protoplasmic cell-
bodies of plants have appeared to be isolated from one another by the
non-protoplasmic cell-walls in which they are inclosed.
   It as in the one case, there was a continuous bond of conduct
         is   if,
ing substance between the point of irritation and the point of contrac
tion while, in the other, there was a chain of pellets of protoplasmic
     ;
substance, each inclosed in  coat of a different nature.
                             a
   Now,-Mr. Gardiner, in his paper "On the continuity of the Proto
plasm through the Walls of Vegetable Cells," brings forward evidence,

based   chiefly upon the careful use of special reagents, that, in the
sensitive cushions of certain plants and in other situations, the
vegetable cell-wall is pierced by minute apertures, and that these
are traversed   by threads of protoplasm, which connect the cell-
body of each cell with those of its neighbour, and thus establish,
as in animals, a continuity of protoplasmic    substance between
different parts. Other observers are working at the same subject,
and we may hope that, before long, great light will be thrown upon
many hitherto puzzling questions in vegetable physiology.
    The Committee of the Royal Society, in the hands of which the
Lords of the Treasury have placed the administration of the funds
devoted to the publication of the work of the ''Challenger" expedi
tion, report that, under the careful and vigorous direction of Mr.
Murray, this great undertaking is making rapid progress.
    Mr. Murray informs me that thirty-eight reports have, up to this
time, been published, forming eight large quarto volumes, with 4195
pages of letter-press, 488 lithographic plates and other illustrations.
 Thirty-four of these memoirs are on zoological, four on physical
 subjects.   Nine reports are now nearly all in type, and some of them
 partly printed off. These will be published within three months, and
 will form three zoological volumes, with 230 plates and many wood-cuts,
 and one physical volume, with many diagrams and maps ; this latter
 volume will contain the report on the composition of ocean water,
 the specific gravity and temperature observations.
    A considerable part of the general narrative of the cruise is now in
 type, and nearly all the illustrations are prepared.       The narrative
 will extend to two volumes, and it is expected they will be ready for
 issue in May or June, 1884.
    The work connected with the remaining forty-two special reports      is,
 in most instances, progressing satisfactorily.    Portions of the manu
 script for three of the larger memoirs have been received and put
 in type, and the manuscript of many others        is in a  forward state.
  For these memoirs, 386 lithographic plates have been printed off and
  delivered to the binders
                         ;   404 others are now on stone, and the draw
 ings for many     more  are  being prepared.   It  is estimated that the
 whole work connected with the Report will be completed in the
summer of 1887.
  In his Address, last year, the President gave the Society        full
                                                                    a
account of the changes which had taken place in the administration
of the Government Fund — technically termed a grant in aid of this
Society — though, as you are aware, the Royal Society, while willingly
accepting the burden and the responsibility of administrator of the
aid granted by the State to science, is, in no sense, pecuniarily benefited
by the grant.

 66                        Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov.  30,
    A somewhat novel and extremely useful employment has been
 given to part of the fund by deciding to defray the expenses of
adequately-skilled persons who have undertaken to visit distant coun
 tries for the purpose of investigating certain interesting biological
 questions on the spot, and of procuring and transmitting to observers
at home, specimens prepared and preserved by those refined modem
methods which can be satisfactorily carried out only by persons who
 are well versed in the practice of such methods.
    Mr. Adam Sedgwick has thus been enabled to proceed to the Cape
of Good Hope for the purpose of completing our knowledge of the
singular genus Peripatus, so well studied by Professor Moseley and
afterwards by our lamented Fellow, Balfour ; and Mr. Caldwell,
similarly aided, is now in Australia, devoting himself to the elucida
tion of the embryology of the marsupial quadrupeds of that region, a
subject of which, at present, we know little more that was made
known in the Transactions of this Society half a century ago by
Professor Owen.
    It certainly was high time that British science should deal with a
problem of the profoundest zoological interest, the materials for the
solution of which abound in, and are at the same time almost con
fined to, those territories of the.Greater Britain, which lie on the other
side of the globe.
    Many years ago, the late Mr. Leonard Horner communicated to the
Society the results of a series of borings which he had caused to be
made in the upper part of the delta of the Nile, with a view of
ascertaining the antiquity of the civilisation of Egypt.        Since that
time, Figari Bey, an Italian geologist in the service of the Egyptian
Government, made and published the results of a large series of
borings effected in different parts of the delta, but his work is hardly
on a level with the requirements of modern science.
    It has been thought advisable, therefore, to take advantage of the
presence    of our troops in Egypt, in order to carry out a series of
borings across the middle of the delta, in the full expectation that
such borings, if made with proper care and carried down to the solid
rock, will afford information of the most important character, and
will throw     a new  light upon the natural and civil history of this
unique country.      I am  glad to say that the representations which the
President and Council made to the War Office on this subject were
most favourably received, and that instructions were at once sent to
the officer commanding the Engineers to undertake the operations
which they recommended.           I trust that, before long, information
will reach us which will be of no less interest to the archaeologist than
to the geologist.
    While   I  am speaking    of Egypt,   I may,   perhaps,  be  permitted

 to express a regret that the admirable energy of the Government, in
taking measures to make the recent advances of medical science
available during the late outbreak of cholera in that country, was
not extended beyond the purely practical side of the matter, or,
perhaps, not so far as the practical side in the proper sense ; for, until
 we know something about the causes of that terrible disease, our
measures for prevention and for cure will be alike leaps in the dark.
    Those who have looked into the literature of cholera may, perhaps,
be disposed to think that a new search after its cause will add but
another to the innumerable wild hypotheses which have been set
afloat on that topic ; and yet, devastating epidemics, like the pebriue
of    the silkworm, so similar in their fatality and their apparently
capricious spread, that careful investigators have not hesitated to
institute a detailed comparison of the phenomena of this disease with
those of cholera, have been proved by Pasteur to be the work of
microscopic organisms ; and hardly less fatal epidemics, such as
splenic fever, have been traced to similar agencies. In both these
cases, knowledge of the causes and of the conditions which limit the
operation of the causes, have led to the invention of effectual methods
of cure. And it is assuredly, in the present state of science, some
 thing more than a permissible hypothesis, that the cause of cholera
 may be an organic living materies morbi, and that the discovery of the
 proper curative and prophylactic measures will follow upon the deter
 mination of the nature and conditions of existence of these organisms.
    If this reasoning is just, it is certainly to be regretted that the
 opportunity of the outbreak of cholera in Egypt was nut utilised jor
 the purposes of scientific investigation into the cause of the epidemic.
 There are able, zealous, and courageous young pathologists in this
 country who would have been willing enough to undertake the labour
 and the risk ; and it seems a pity that England should leave to
 Germany and to France an enterprise which requires no leRs daring
 than Arctic or African exploration ; but which, if successfal, would
 be of a thousand times more value to mankind than the most
 complete knowledge of the barren ice wastes of the pole or of the
  sweltering barbarism of the equator.
    It may be said that inquiries into the causation of cholera have
  been for some years conducted in India by the Government without
 yielding any very definite result. But this is, perhaps, rather an
 argument in favour of, than against, setting fresh minds to work
  npon the problem.
     In December last year the President received from the Lords of
 the Treasury a letter, addressed to their Lordships by the Lords of
 th- Committee of the Privy Council on Education, recommending to
 the favourable consideration of the Treasury a memorial from the
  Solar Physics Committee, suggesting the organisation of an expedition

for the purpose of making observations during the solar eclipse of the
oth of May, 1883 ; and the President was requested to communicate
his views upon the subject to the Treasury.
    After careful consideration, the President and Council reported in
favour of the projected expedition ; but they added that they did so on
condition of its being possible to find some one, whose position in the
scientific world would command the confidence of the public, to take
charge of the expedition.     Unfortunately, for one reason or another,
none of the men of science who fulfilled this condition were able to
go ; and, at the meeting of Council of the 18th of January, the pro
jected expedition was abandoned.        The President was, however, re
quested to place himself in communication            with the American
authorities, and to ascertain from them whether a photographer and
assistant could be allowed to accompany their expedition to Caroline
Island.    On doing so, he at once received an invitation for two
observers ; who were accordingly sent out, their expenses being
defrayed, partly, by a contribution from the Government Grant and,
partly, by a special sum of £500 provided by the Treasury.
    I am indebted to Mr. Lockyer for the following list of photographs
taken by the observers : —
    "1. Six good photographs of the corona, exposures varying from
two to sixty seconds, giving coronal detail from near the limb to end
of streamers.      That the limit of the corona has been photographed is
shown by the manner in which the light of the sky has impressed
itself on the plate.
    " 2. Three large photographs    showing the details of the corona close
to the limb.
    " 3. Good    photographs of the spectrum of the corona, showing a
 great number of coronal lines and very faint Fraunhoferic lines.
    " 4. Photographs taken on a
                                    moving plate in integrating spectro
 scope, from one minute before to one and a    half minute after totality,
 showing the most prominent lines of the reversion spectrum.         These
 lines belong mainly to hydrogen.
    " 5. Photographs taken with first-order grating, before, during, and
 after totality.   These show H and K, near the limb, throughout the
 whole of totality.
    " 6.
         Photographs taken with a dense prism spectroscope before,
 during, and after totality. These photographs also give some of the
 prominent lines of the reversion spectrum.

               photographs taken in the prismatic camera on plates sensi
 tive to ultra-red rays. Results comparatively indifferent on account
 of the absence of prominences."
    The arrangements made for obtaining a series of Circumpolar
 Observations in Meteorology and Magnetism were fully described
 in the Presidential Address of last year.      I am glad to be able to

 report that the English party, under Captain Dawson, has success
 fully achieved its mission and has returned to this country.       Captain
 Dawson speaks very gratefully of the efficient assistance which he
 received from the Canadian authorities and from the Hudson Bay
 Company.
    The responsibility for the transaction of the ordinary work of the
 Society rests with the Council and the officers, of whom the Pre
 sident is only one, and I may be allowed to say by no means the most
 important, the heaviest part of the burden of the executive resting
 upon the Treasurer and the Secretaries.         But your President is, in
 virtue of his office, a member of two public bodies whose functions in
 relation to science are of great importance ; and I follow the excellent
 precedent set by my predecessor in considering it my duty to acquaint
 the Fellows of the Society with any occurrence, bearing on the in
 terests of science, which has come under my cognizance, as a Trustee
of the British Museum and as a Member of the Council and Execu
tive Committee of the City and Guilds Institute.
    In the first-named capacity, I am glad to be able to announce that
the transference      of the vast zoological, botanical, geological, and
mineralogical collections from Bloomsbury to the New Natural
History Museum is now accomplished ; and that it has been effected,
to the great credit of all concerned, with no greater mishap than the
fracture of a bottle or two.
    The advantages which will accrue to zoologists, botanists, and
mineralogists from the re-arrangement of this vast assemblage of the
objects of their studies, in such a manner as to be accessible to
every investigator, cannot be over-estimated.        The Natural History
Museum at South Kensington is, in fact, a library of the works of
nature which corresponds in value, in extent, and in the purposes to
which it should be applied, to the vast library of the works of men
which remains at Bloomsbury.
   In making this collection of use to the world of science by the
publication of complete catalogues of its contents, and of systematic
monographs upon particular groups ; and to the nation at large, by the
composition of guide books calculated to afford the ordinary visitor
an insight into the plan of the mighty maze of nature, the officers
in charge of the Natural History collections have before them a
task, the due performance of which, whatever their abilities, or their
number, or their industry, will tax their energies to the utmost.
It is in this way that, in the discharge of their proper duties, they
may render services of the highest value alike to pure science and to
the diffusion of knowledge among the people, out of whose resources
the great institution to which they belong is supported.             I
                                                                And trust
that no mistaken view     of  the functions of the officers of the Museum,

which no more embrace oral instruction in science than those of the
officers of the Library comprehend oral instruction in literature, may
lead to the imposition of duties, foreign to their proper business, upon
the already overburdened staff of keepers and their assistants.
   In Francis Bacon's apocalypse of science, the " New Atlantis," the
Father of Solomon's House — he, whose countenance was " as if he
pitied  men," — declares that the end of that foundation is " the know
ledge of causes and secret motions of things, and the enlarging of the
bounds of human empire to the effecting of all things possible."
   I  think that the Chancellor would have acknowledged the New
Natural History Museum to be a goodly wing of such a House, devoted
to the former of the objects which he mentions ; but, it may be, that
his practical mind, looking always to fruit, and caring for light
chiefly as something essential to fruit-bearing, would have been even
better satisfied with another building hard by, which has been
devot€d to the encouragement           of those applications     of science
through which human empire is directly extended, by the well-
directed munificence of the City and Guilds of London.
   This building, destined for a central institution in which ample
provision shall be made for thorough and practical training in so
much of the principles and the methods of the physical sciences as is
needful for those who aspire to take part in the development of arts
and manufactures, has been completed at a cost of more than £70,000,
while £20,000 has yet to be spent upon fittings and appliances, and
the working expenses, if the scheme is to be fully developed, cannot
be estimated at less than £10,000 a year.
   Having already been called upon to take an active part in the
deliberations of the committees charged with the carrying out of this
great work,    I       I
                 think am justified in expressing the hope, and indeed
the confident expectation, that, before long, this new Technical
College   will  be  in full activity ; and that, for the first time in our
history, there will be called into existence an institution in which,
without leaving this country, masters, managers, and foremen of
works will be enabled to obtain thorough instruction not only in
scientific theory, but in the essential principles of practice ; and a
machinery will be created, by which the poorest working lad in a
manufacturing town, if he have ability and perseverance, may be
brought within reach of the best technical education that is to be had.
   There can be no doubt that the founders of the Royal Society had
prominently before their minds the intention of promoting the useful
arts and sciences " that so (in the language of the draft of the
preamble to the first charter, which is said to have been drawn up by
Sir Christopher Wren) by laying in a stock as it were of several arts
and methods of industry, the whole body [of the nation] may be
supplied by a mutual commerce of each other's peculiar faculties, and,

consequently, that the various miseries               and trials of this frail life
may be, by as many various expedients                 ready at hand, remedied or
alleviated, and wealth and plenty diffused in just proportion to every
one's industry, that is, to every one's deserts."                It was the wish of
King     Charles    the   Second     that  all patents   for  inventions   should be
examined by the Royal Society ; and, so late as the reign of George
the Second, the Society actually performed this duty.                     The steam-
engine     itself may be said to have made its dehUt before the Royal
Society, when Savery exhibited his working model to the Fellows
in 1699.
    But the subsequent history of natural knowledge has shown that,
as in the moral world, those who seek happiness through well-doing
are less likely to obtain that reward than those who try to do well
without thinking what may come of it ; so, in the world of science, those
whose     vision is fixed on useful ends are often left poor and bare,
while those who strive only after the advancement of knowledge,
scatter riches along their path, for the whole world to pick up.                  The
Royal Society       has   chosen    the  latter course,  and  I  trust it  may  never
swerve from it. But I think that our warmest sympathy is due to the
efforts of those who translate the language of the philosopher into that
of the workshop ; and by thus ameliorating
                                                         " the miseries and toils of
this frail life," and
                          " diffusing wealth and
                                                       plenty," are executing that
part    of  the  first  design   of   this  Society,  with   which we, as a body,
have    long ceased to occupy ourselves.
    It  was   not  as  your President, but       as one of the Special Commis
sioners appointed        by  the   Government,      that I had some slight share
 in another considerable undertaking directed towards the improve
ment of industry.           But the fnture of the fisheries is so closely
connected       with   the  advancement of certain branches of zoological
science,    that  I may be permitted to advert to the great success of the
 International Fisheries Exhibition ; and to express my belief that, in
 accordance with the intimation contained in the speech of H.R.H. the
 Prince of Wales at the closing of the Exhibition, there will grow out
of   it an  organisation    which will provide for the application of         science
 to the   improvement of the fisheries.
    In conclusion,      Gentlemen,       I think that it is proper on my own
behalf, as    it is certainly due to you, that       I should   advert to the excep
 tional circumstances which have brought about my present occupa
tion of the     Presidential   office.
    The eleventh section       of the sixth chapter of the Statutes provides
 for the occurrence      of a vacancy in the Chair, whether by death or by
 resignation, as follows : —
    "
       Upon any vacancy in the President's place occurring in the
 intervals of the anniversary elections, the Treasurer, or in his absence

72                        A n it iversary Meeting.              [Nov. 30,
one   of the Secretaries, shall    cause the Council to be summoned for
the election of a new.President, and the Council meeting thereupon
in the nsual place, or any eleven or more of them, shall proceed to the
said election, and not separate until the major part of them shall have
agreed upon a new President."
    This statute is substantially, and, to a great extent, verbally,
identical   with the twelfth section of the seventh chapter of the
original statutes of 1663.
   Before the present year, five occasions had arisen on which it
became necessary to put the provisions of the statute into effect.
   Sir Isaac Newton died while President in 1727; the Earl of Morton
in 1768; Mr. West in 1772; and Sir Joseph Banks in 1820; while
Sir Humphry Davy resigned in 1827. On each of these occasions,
a new President was at once appointed by the Council, endowed with
all the privileges and powers of the office: and, like every other officer,
however appointed, he vacated his office on the 30th November follow
ing, when the Fellows sometimes elected him for the succeeding year,
and sometimes did not.
   These precedents were strictly followed on the present occasion. A
Council had been summoned, in ordinary course of business, for the
28th of June ; but, as the President died on the 27th, the meeting was
deferred until the following Thursday, when it was supposed the inter-
ment would have taken place. In consequence of the delay inseparable
from a public ceremony, however, it so happened that the funeral did
not take place until noon of the 5th of July ; and I have known few
sadder scenes than the gathering of the Council, fresh from the
unclosed grave of their President, for the performance of the duty,
imposed upon them by the Statutes, of choosing his successor from
their own number, before they should separate.
   The Council did me the great honour of selecting me for the office ;
and now, on this next following St. Andrew's Day, my tenure, like
that of the Treasurer and Secretaries, lapses ; and it is for the Fellows
of the Society to say who shall be their officers until the next
Anniversary Meeting.
   Having served several years, in another capacity, with three out of
four of my present colleagues, and having every reason to believe that
the Fellows of the Society, at large, see good reason to set the same
high value upon the services of all of them as I do, I do not find
myself able to imagine that you will fail to desire that those services
shall be continued ; but I have not the least difficulty in conceiving
that the Fellows of the Society may think many of their number
better fitted for the eminent place of the President than myself.
   I should be extremely ungrateful to my colleagues of the Council,
who have again honoured me by presenting me for election by the
Fellows, if I were to let fall even a hint of the extent to which I

 share    that opinion   ; but  I think it may be permitted me to say that,
 should you     think fit to give effect to it, there is no one who will more
cheerfully acquiesce in your decision than        I shall.-
    To a man like myself, who neither possesses, nor seeks, any other
distinction than that of having done his best to advance knowledge
and to uphold the worth and the authority of Science against all
comers, the Presidency of this Society is the highest dignity which
he can     attain, whatever else may befall him.
    But, Gentlemen, as men        of science, yon know better than   I can tell
yon,     that there are things of more worth than distinction.           I  am
within measurable distance                                         I
                                   of the end of my career ; and have long
looked forward to the time when           I should be able to escape from the
distractions and     perturbations of the multitudinous affairs in which 1
have     been so   long entangled, to that student life from which the
 Pates have driven me, but to which I trust they may, for a little space,
permit me to return.
    So that I am sure you will neither misunderstand           me, nor mislike
 my directness of speech, when I say that, if it please you to believe that
 the interests of Science and of the Royal Society will be advanced by
 maintaining me in the very distinguished position which I at present
 occupy, I will do my best to justify your confidence ; but if, as may
 well be, you think that some other Fellow of the Society will serve
 these interests better,     I shall, with a light heart, transfer to him the
honourable burden, which I have already borne long enough to know
 its weight.
    I  now proceed     to the presentation of the medals which have this
 year been    awarded by the Council.
    The President then proceeded to the presentation         of the Medals  : —
    The    number,    the   variety, and the importance of Sir        William
 Thomson's      contributions to mathematical and experimental         physics
 we matters      of common knowledge, and the Fellows of the Society
 will   be more gratified than surprised to hear that the Council have
 this year awarded him the Copley Medal, the highest honour which it
 is in their  power to bestow.
    Sir William Thomson has taken a foremost            place among those to
 whom the     remarkable     development of the theory of thermodynamics
and of electricity, in the last forty years, is due ; his share in the
experimental treatment          of these subjects has been no less con
siderable ;   while his constructive ability in applying science to practice
is manifested     by the number of instruments, bearing his name, which
are at    present in use in the physical laboratory and in the telegraph
office.
    Moreover,    in propounding his views on the universal dissipation

74                         A nniversary Meeting.                [Nov. 30,
of energy and on vortex motion and molecular vortices, Sir William
Thomson has propounded conceptions which belong to the prima
philusophia of physical science, and will assuredly lead the physicist
of the future to attempt once more to grapple with those problems
concerning the ultimate construction of the material world, which
Descartes and Leibuitz attempted to solve, but which have been
ignored by most of their successors.
   One Royal Medal has been awarded to Dr. T. Archer Hirst, F.R.S.,
for his investigations in pure geometry ; and, more particularly, for
his researches into the correlation of two planes and into the com
plexes generated by them.
   The other Royal Medal has        been awarded   to Dr.  J.  S. Burdon
 Sanderson,   F.R.S., for the eminent services which  he has rendered  to
physiology and pathology ; and, especially, for his researches on the
electrical phenomena exhibited by plants, and for his investigations
into the relation of minute organisms to disease.
   In making this award, the Council desire not merely to recognise
the merit of Dr. Burdon Sanderson's researches, especially those
which demonstrate the analogy between the electrical changes which
take place in the contractile tissues of plants and those which occur
in the like tissues of animals ; but to mark their sense of the important
influence    which   Dr.   Sanderson   has exerted   upon   the  study of
physiology and pathology in this country.
   The Davy Medal has this year been again awarded in duplicate to
M. Marcellin Berthelot, Member of the Institute of France, and
Foreign Member of the Royal Society, and Professor Julius Thomsen,
of Copenhagen.
   The thermo-chemical researches of Berthelot and Thomsen have
extended over many years, and have involved an immense amount of
work, partly in the application of established methods to new cases,
partly in devising new methods and applying them to cases in which
the older methods were not applicable.        Chemists had identified a
vast variety of substances, and had determined the exact composition
of nearly all of them, but of the forces which held together the
elements of each compound they knew but little.        It was known that
certain elements combine with one another with great evolution of
heat-forming products in which they are firmly united ; while other
elements combine but feebly, and with little evolution of heat. But
the materials for forming any general theory of the forces of chemical
combination were but scanty and imperfect.
   The labours of Messrs. Berthelot and Thomsen have done much
towards supplying that want, and they will be of the utmost value for
the advancement of chemical science.

      Report of the Kew Committee for the Year ending
                              October 31, 1883.
   The operations of the Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Committee, which is
constituted    as follows :
                          Mr. De La Rue, Chairman.
   Captain      W. de W. Abuey,        I Vice-Adm. Sir G. H. Richards,
      R.E.                                  C.B.
   Prof. W. G. Adams.                    The Earl of Rosse.
   Capt.   Sir  F. Evans,   K.C.B.       Mr. R. H. Scott.
   Prof. G. C. Foster.                   Lieut. -General W. J. Smythe.
   Mr. F. Galton.                        Lieut.-Gen. R. Strachey, C.S.I.
                                Mr. E. Walker.
   The Committee regret to announce the decease of their venerable
Chairman,      the late Sir E. Sabine, K.C.B., who died on the 26th of
Jane at th e very advanced age of ninety-four years and eight months.
Sir Edward was one of the chief promoters of the Observatory, and
took a    leading part in its direction from its first establishment as a
Physical Observatory in 1841.         Up to within a few weeks of his
death he was constant in his inquiries after its condition, although for
the last eight years he had been prevented by infirmity from taking
an active part in the meetings of its Committee.
   The instruments employed for the absolute observations of terres
trial magnetism, as well as several less important pieces of apparatus
used in the regular work of the Observatory, were originally provided
by Sir E. Sabine.
   To speak of that branch of their late Chairman's scientific work,
with which the Kew Committee has been more particularly concerned,
they may say that, in their opinion, the science of terrestrial mag
netism owes more to Sir Edward Sabine than to any man who ever
studied it, Gauss alone perhaps excepted.
   The work at the Observatory may be considered under six
heads   : —
   1st.    Magnetic observations.
    2nd.   Meteorological observations.

 88                      Report of    the   Kew Committee.
    3rd. Solar observations.
    4th. Experimental, in connexion             with any of the above depart
            ments.
    5th. Verification of instruments.
    6th. Miscellaneous.
                          I. Magnetic        Observations.
   The Magnetographs have been in constant operation throughout
 the year.
   The values of the ordinates of the different photographic curves
determined in January were as follows : —
            Declination    :  1 inch=0°      22' 04.   1 mm.=0° 0'S7.
   Bifilar, January   9, 1883,    for  1  inch SH=00221 foot grain unit.
                                   „  1  mm.     ,, =0-0004 mm. mgr. unit.
   Balance, January 12, 1883 „        1  inch SV=0-0376 foot grain unit.
                                   „  1  mm. „ =0-0007 mm. mgr. unit.
   It having been decided to attempt to re-adjust the Bifilar and
Vertical Force instruments so as to bring their scales more closely in
accordance with the generally adopted values, the necessary altera
tions were made in the adjustments, and on redetermining the scale
values on January 17th the following results were obtained: —
             Bifilar for    1 inch £H=0"0277 foot grain unit.
                       ,,  1  mm. „ =0.0005 mm. mgr. unit.
             Balance   „   1  inch £V=0"0261 foot grain unit.
                       „    1  mm. „ =0-0005 mm. mgr. unit.
   The tabulation of the traces of the three elements was temporarily-
suspended at the conclusion of the year for which the observations
were promised to the International Polar Commission.                Attention is
now being    devoted  to   the  revision    and  reduction of the results.
   A common gas-jet has been substituted in the Vertical Force
instrument with advantage for that formerly employed, but on trial the
results obtained by a similar substitution in the case of the other
instruments were not satisfactory, and the old burners with chimneys
are retained for the present.
   Gelatiuo-bromide      paper has been used for all three instruments
with great   success and economy of time throughout the whole year,
and an examination of the curves shows that not a single hour's trace
has been lost since its adoption, from purely photographic causes,
rapid and minute movements of the needles being recorded.
   Several magnetic storms have been observed, the principal being
that of November        17th and 18th, 1882, which, together with its
accompanying aurora and meteor, excited considerable attention.

                      Report of  the Kew Committee.                    89
    Owing to long usage the points of the Dip-needles Nos. 1 and 2 of
 Circle No. 33, used for monthly observations, were very blunt ; they
 were accordingly re-ground by Mr. Dover in August, and the axles at
 the same time repolished.
    The Committee     have to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of
 photographic    copies of magnetic curves from the Observatory at
 Batavia.
    The magnetic instruments have been studied, and a knowledge        of
 their manipulation obtained by —
                     Dr. Doberck.
                     Lieutenant A. P. Pinheiro.
                     Dr. O'Reilly.
   Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism, and
 various data, have been supplied to Dr. Buys Ballot, Padre Denza, the
 Rev. F. Howlett, M. l'Abbe Philippe, and others.
   The Unifilar Magnetometer returned by Rev. S. J. Perry, F.R.S.,
 on his arrival in this country from Madagascar was lent to Professor
 W. G. Adams, F.R.S., for use in the Wheatstone Laboratory, King's
 College, London.     Another Unifilar and Dip-circle have been lent to
 Professor O. Lodge, for use in the University College, Liverpool.
   A Dip- circle with bar-magnets has been lent to Dr. E. van
 Rijckevorsel for use in an expedition to Central America.
   The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been
made as usual, and the results are given in the tables forming
Appendix.   I of this Report.
   The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations
made during the year : —
        D-terminations of Horizontal Intensity                 35
                            Dip                              123
                „           Absolute Declination              29
   At the request of the Rev. S. P. Ferrari, of the private astrono
mical observatory on the Janiculan Hill, Rome, the superintendent
designed a set of Magnetometers, for . eye observations, on a new
pattern, much less costly than the Kew magnetographs.
   They were erected in the Verification House, and after a satisfactory
trial, were dismounted and forwarded to M. l'Abbe Philippe for the
Observatory at Lyons.
   A set of Magnetographs    has been ordered on behalf of the American
Government, and is now in process of construction.
                   II. Meteorological    Observations.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion respectively of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity,

90                     Report   of the Kew  Committee.
wind (direction and velocity), sunshine, and rain, have been main
tained in regular operation throughout the year. A summary of these
observations is given in Appendix II.
   Owing to the necessity of delaying the construction of the new
tabulating scales for the wet bulb thermograph until a somewhat
lengthened series of observations had been obtained, the work of
tabulation became some months in arrear. These, however, have now
been worked up, and the tabulations are up to date.
   The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic
records have been duly registered during the year, together with the
daily observations at 0 h. 8 m. p.m. in connexion with the Washington
synchronous system.
   Owing to the high quality of the photographic records, the Com
mittee considered that the maintenance of the noon eye observation
in addition to that at     0 h. 8 m. was superfluous,   and accordingly  it
was discontinued     on  July  1st.
   The tabulation     of the meteorological    traces has been regularly
carried on, and copies of these, as well as of the eye observations,
with notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine have been transmitted
weekly to the Meteorological Office.
   The following is a summary of the number of meteorological        obser
vations made during the past year : —
        Readings of standard barometer                          1825

   In  compliance with a request made by the Meteorological Council
to the Kew Committee, the Observatories at Aberdeen, Stonyhurst,
and Valencia, have been visited and their instruments inspected by
Mr. Baker during his vacation.
   With the concurrence of the Meteorological Council, weekly abstracts
of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to, and
published by
                 " The Times," " The Illustrated London News," " The
                                " The
Torquay Directory," and                Torquay Standard," and data have
been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society, the

                       Report of  the  Kew Committee.                     91
editor of   " Symons's Monthly Meteorological      Magazine," the Secretary
of the     Institute of Mining Engineers,        Messrs. Banner and Co.,
the   late   Mr. Greaves, and Messrs. Gwilliam, Maw ley, Rowland,
Dr. Radcliffe, and others.        The cost of these abstracts is borne by
recipients.
    Tracings of rain-gauge curves have been supplied to Mr. Symons
for the months of October, November, and December, 1882.
    Electrograph. — This instrument has been in continuous action
through the year.
    In May it was dismounted from the 16th to the 20th, to allow of
structural alterations in connexion with the new stairs.
    The tabulation of the curves is at present in arrear, not having
been completed beyond February 28, 1882.
    The portable Thomson Electrometer          has not been employed in
systematic     observations  during   the year, but has had its scale value
experimentally determined, at Mr. De La Rue's laboratory, for tensions
ranging from —1240 to +1030 volts.
    Information as to the working of Atmospheric Electrometers has
been given to Professor Atwater, of Middleton, U.S.A., Dr. H. B.
Baker, Lansing, U.S.A., and M. Leon Descroix, of Paris.
                          III.  Solar Observations.
    The sketches of Sun-spots     as seen projected on the photoheliograph
screen, have been made on 214 days, in order to continue Schwabe's
enumeration, the results being given in Appendix No. II. The sun's
surface was found to be free from spots on seven of those days.
    Solar Negatives. — The correction to the area-measurements for
foreshortening, which, at the date of the last report, had not been
applied to the reductions of sun-spot observations for the last two
years of the series, has since been made under Mr. De La Rne's
direction.
    The whole series is at the Royal Society, and is now being revised
 and arranged for reference by Mr. Marth, on behalf of the Council of
 the Royal Society, who made a grant of money for that purpose.
    With the view of utilising the instrument in the transit of Venus
 of   December     h,  1882,  the   Committee    obtained   the services   of
 Mr. Reynolds,      so long  associated with Astronomical Photography,
 who made every preparation for taking a series of pictures of the
 transit.    The adverse atmospheric conditions which prevailed at the
 time of     the  phenomenon,     however,   prevented    any results  being
 obtained.
     Dr. Terby, of Louvain, requested a number of photographs, which
 were selected from the Kew series and sent him on loan.              He has
 since returned them to the Observatory, having embodied the results

 02                    Report  of the Kew   Committee.
of his investigations in a work entitled " Sur l'Existence et sur la
 Cause d'une Periodicite mensuelle des Aurores Boreales."
    Three typical negatives have also been selected, in reply to Professor
 Pickering's request, and forwarded to the Harvard College Obser
 vatory, to be deposited in the collection of astronomical photographs
 being formed there by the Director.
    At the request of Professor Balfour Stewart, some measurements
 were made by Mr. Whipple and Mr. McLaughlin, in the Library of
 the Royal Astronomical Society, Burlington House,         of Carrington's
original sun-spot drawings, with a view of checking        the accuracy of
 the values of solar-spotted areas determined at the Observatory        in
 1866, and published by Messrs. De La Rue, Stewart, and Loewy           in
their " Researches on Solar Physics," second       series.  The work has
not yet been completed.
    Transit Observations. — One hundred and fourteen observations have
been made of sun-transits,     for the purpose of obtaining correct local
time at the Observatory ; 224 clock and chronometer           comparisons
have also been made.
    Shelton's clock, K.O., has beeD used as the standard      timepiece of
the Observatory.
                          IV. Experimental Work.
    Actinometry. — Observations have been made on favourable occasions
with the Stewart actinometer on the Observatory lawn, and the results
communicated to the Meteorological Council, who defray the cost they
entail.    Owing to the rarity at Kew of the occurrence of periods of
pjrfectly clear sky sufficient in duration for a satisfactory experiment
with Stewart's apparatus, the Superintendent has instituted inquiries
with a view to obtaining one of Professor Langley's bolometers for
comparison with it.
    Solar Radiation Thermometers. — With a view of investigating the
causes of the differences in the readings of black bulb thermometers
in vacuo, the Superintendent obtained on loan from Messrs. Negretti
and Zambra six of these instruments constructed according to his
suggestions.    They were after verification arranged on a stand on the
Observatory lawn beside the Observatory standard of reference, and
read daily during the summer months.         The observations have been
discussed, and the results indicate that the discrepancies observed in
the readings of this class of instrument are in part to be attributed to
want of uniformity in the sizes of the thermometer bulbs, and also in
the amount of lampblack with which they are covered.
   Photo- Nephograph. — At the request of the Meteorological Council, a
series of experiments have been commenced with Captain Abuey's
Photo-Nephograph, described in the Report of the Council for 1881.

                       Report   of the  Kew Committee.                      03
    Two of the cameras, with their tripod stands, have been received at
 the Observatory,    a base line of 180 yards has been marked off on the
 level path leading across the park from the Observatory,               and a
 carriage for conveying the battery and reels of wire constructed.
    A code of signals has been arranged to enable the observers at the
 cameras to work in accordance with each other, and several successful
 pairs of clond negatives have been obtained, both on the plates pre
pared by Captain      Abuey and also     on gelatino-bromide  paper.
    No steps have yet been taken towards the permanent installation of
the apparatus at the Observatory.
    Wat-r Surface Temperature. — The observations of the maximum and
minimnm temperature of the surface water of the pond which were
taken for the late Mr. Greaves, C.E., daily at 9 A.M., were discontinued
at his  request on May 1, and the results forwarded to him.
   Mr. Greaves applied to the Committee for permission to excavate a
tank in the ground attached to the Observatory, in order that con
tinuous    registration of water surface temperature might proceed in
the immediate     neighbourhood of the thermograph.          The Committee,
however, were unable to afford        him the facilities he desired, the time
of the    Observatory     staff being    fully occupied with their existing
duties.
   Nocturnal    Radiation. — The experiments on the fall of temperature
of the lower layers of the atmosphere at sunset, instituted at the
suggestion of Professor Tyndall, were terminated on February 16, on
the  resignation of the assistant by whom the readings of the thermo
meters were made, the grant devoted by the Meteorological          Council to
the  purpose being almost expended.
   Graphic Reductions. — The Superintendent, having made some expe
riments on the deduction of mean values, &c, from curves by a graphic
method, based on      Mr. Galton's composite portraiture, has communi
cated   a paper on the subject to the Royal Meteorological            Society,
which has been published in the
                                       " Quarterly Journal," vol. ix.
                        — Some experiments have been made with a view
   Artificial Horizon.
of testing an attachment to sextants answering            the purpose of an
artificial horizon, which has been invented by Mr. T. Tennent, of San
Francisco, and constructed by Messrs. Elliott Brothers.           The results
appear to indicate that the invention will prove a useful addition to a
Bextant under certain conditions.
   Watch-rating. — The Committee, having decided to make a trial of a
Bystem of watch-rating for the public, have granted £100 for the
preliminary expenses.        In accordance with a scheme prepared by
 the Superintendent,     they have fitted up at the Observatory a first-
class burglar- and fire-proof safe for the safe custody of the watches,
and with a view to the obtaining of star-transits,            have permitted
Mr. Whipple to fit up a temporary transit-house at his residence in the

94                     Report of  the Kew Committee.
neighbouring town of Richmond, where he has erected a Sheepshanks
3 .l-inch transit (No. 27) lent by the Royal Astronomical Society.
The apparatus used for determining the temperature correction of
aneroids is being fitted up to receive the watches for rating them at
extreme temperatures, and arrangements are in progress for their
reception and delivery at the Meteorological Office by Mr. Strachan,
and at the Horological Institute, Northampton Square, by Mr. Britten,
the Secretary.
    A circular has been drafted, which    will  be issued to watchmakers on
the completion of these arrangements, and it is hoped that operations
will be commenced early in the new year.
    Pendulum Experiments. — Professor C. S. Peirce, of the United States
Coast Survey, who made a series of pendulum observations at Kew
and elsewhere in 1876, visited the Observatory in July last, and made
a subsidiary    series of experiments with a view of determining the
flexure of his stand when on the Kew piers, using for the purpose an
instrument termed a " noddy."
    Major J. E. Herschel, R.E., F.R.S., and Mr. Chaney, of the
Standards Department, visited the Observatory and witnessed some of
his experiments.
                      V. Verification   of Instruments.
    The following magnetic instruments       have been verified, and their
constants have been     determined : —

   Besides    these, 51 Deep-sea Thermometers have been tested, 2 of
which     were   subjected in the hydraulic press, without injury, to
pressures exceeding three and a half tons on the square inch, and 78
Thermometers have been compared at the freezing-point of mercury,
making a total of 8739      for the year.
   Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 17 cases.
   The number of instruments which were rejected on account of
excessive error, or which from other causes did not record with suffi
cient accuracy, was as     follows : —
        Thermometers,      clinical                              19

   Seven     Standard Thermometers         have also been calibrated and
divided,   and supplied to societies and individuals during the year.
   A Barograph and Thermograph have been examined, and had their
scale  values    determined for the Hong Kong Observatory, also a
Barograph      for  the Japanese Hydrographic Department, and a large
Anemograph for the Zi-Ka-Wei Observatory.
   The following miscellaneous instruments have also been verified : —

   There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification,
27 Barometers, 932 Thermometers,            1 Anemometer and 4 Sextants,
and a self -registering Aneroid for the Meteorological Council.
   The Committee have recently revised the regulations for the verifi
cation    of graduated instruments, fixing a linear value equal to
O-Ol inch or 0-25 millim. as the limit to which corrections are to be
assigned    to scales intended to be read by the unassisted eye.

                       Report of the Kew Committee.
   With a view of facilitating the examination of the dark glasses and
mirrors of sextants,      of which a large number are now tested and
marked for makers before mounting in frames, the Superintendent
has devised a special apparatus for the purpose, an illustrated
description of which appeared in the
                                                  "
                                                     Proceedings of the Royal
 Society" (vol. 35,   p. 42).
   Redeterminations       have been made of the angles between the
collimators of the Cooke sextant apparatus, which show that they
retain their positions with a satisfactory degree of constancy.
   The Committee have been offered the loan of the apparatus
employed by Mr. J. M. Crafts, of Paris, for the comparison of
mercurial thermometers at high temperatures, but have not yet been
able to avail themselves of his offer.
   Standard Barometers. — From time to time comparisons have been
made between the two Welsh Standard Barometers and Newman
No.  34, the  working Standard of the Observatory, and their relative
values have been found to remain unchanged.
   Mr. F. Waldo, of the United States Signal                  Department,   being
instructed    by Major-General W. B. Hazen,               Chief Signal     Officer,
United States of America, to compare the Standard Barometers of their
Department with the European Standards, visited the Observatory in
July, and made a lengthened comparison of two Standards by Fuess,
which he brought with him, with the Observatory Working Standard,
Newman No. 34.        The results of his comparison have not yet been
communicated to the Committee, but Dr. Chistoni, of the Italian
                                                           " Annale della Meteo-
Meteorological Service, having published in the
rologia" an account of the results of his comparisons of Kew and
other Standard Barometers, the Committee desire to publish an
abstract of that part of his paper which more especially refers to the
Observatory Standard.
   Taking the absolute standard        barometer of St. Petersburg as the
basis for his comparisons, Dr. Chistoni finds that the corrections of the
Continental standards, referred to this instrument, are as follows : —
                       Barometer.                       Millim.      In.

  His first comparison with the Kew Standard was an indirect                  one,

                         Report   of the Kew  Committee.                «7
 made   by meant) of a Negretti and Zambra's Standard, No. 1042,
 which   he found at Pesaro, and which had been compared at Kew in
 1877.   By    means   of an indirect comparison of this instrument with
 the Standard, Deleuil No. 6, at Rome, he found the correction of the
 latter, so referred      to the Kew Standards, to be — 0-23 milliin.
 (— 0-009 inch).       Subsequently, Professor Tacchini conveyed another
 barometer directly to Kew, and this when compared with the Roman
 Standard,    indicated the difference between the two instruments to be
 — 0"19  millim.      —                   From these two comparisons he
                     ( 0-008 inch).
 assumes the true correction of Deleuil No. 6 to be — 021 millim.
 (— (K)08 inch). Having already determined the correction of that in
 strument referred to the St. Petersburg Standard to be — 022 millim.
 (— 0-009    inch), he concludes that the two absolute Standard Baro
 meters of    Kew and St. Petersburg perfectly agree, and taking into
 account the possible error of reading the instrument at Rome, " they
 cannot differ between themselves more than half the tenth of a
 millim. (0-002 inch)."      With the absolute Standard of the College de
 France he fonnd the correction of Deleuil No. 6 to be — 0-18 millim.
 (— 0-007   inch).    Hence he also concludes that the absolute Standard
 Barometer     of the College  de France perfectly agrees with the absolute
 standards  of Kew and St. Petersburg within the limits of the half-tenth
 of a millim. (0 002 inch).
                              VI.  Miscellaneous.

that a new survey is now desirable, they have requested the Hydro-
grapher (Sir F. Evans), Professors W. G. Adams and G. Carey Foster
to act as a sub-committee with a view of recommending the course to
be adopted for the carrying out of the survey.
    A number of instruments of interest were exhibited at the Fourth
Annual Exhibition of the Royal Meteorological Society, which was
devoted     to    meteorological       instruments    used   by explorers and
travellers, held in the rooms of the Institution of Civil Engineers in
March last.
    Library. — During the year the Library has received, as presents, the

Magnetism, and Meteorology, have been presented to the Library of
the newly established Observator}- at Hong Kong.
    Observatory    and Grounds. — The buildings and grounds have been
kept in order throughout the year.               A now staircase leading from
the ground      to  the  first floor  has   been  constructed ; a new chimney
fitted to the barometer-room stove, and the exterior of the building
maintained in repair by Her Majesty's Commissioners of Works, &c.
    A temporary vestibule has been put up in the Entrance Hall.
    Owing to the giving way of a gas-pips support attached to the
Electrograph, the building narrowly escaped being set on fire on the
 night of March 9th ; the housekeeper fortunately being near at the
 time, the fire was extinguished without damage being done.                Steps
 have been taken to prevent a recurrence of the accident.

 Magnetic Observations made at the Kew Observatory, Lat. 51° 28' 6"        N.
    Long. 0" lm 151 W.,for the year October 1882 to September 1883.
    The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked KG 1, and
 the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
    The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnets N D and N E being employed for
the purpose.
    The Dip observations were made with Dip- circle Barrow No. 33, the
needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3£ inches in length.
    The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
    These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the unit in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain       ;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English to metric values being O46108.
    By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given.
   The value of log tt3K employed in the reduction is 1*64365 at tem
perature 60° F.
   The induction-coefficient p. is 0 000194.
   The correction of the magnetic power for temperature t0 to an
adopted standard temperature of 35° F. is
                0-0001194(*o-35)+0-000,000,213(^-35)1.
    The true distauces between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
 magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-
 bar marked 1-0 foot and 13 feet, are 1 000075 feet and 1-300097 feet
respectively.
    The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
 of the suspension-thread subsequently.
    No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.
    The value of the constant P, employed in the formula of reduction
™
    =mYl-2\        is -0 00109.

   In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental         read
ings have been referred to    marks  made  upon the stone obelisk erected
1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the orientation
of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, was determined by the
late Mr. Welsh, and has since been carefully verified.
    The observations have been made and reduced by Messrs.      F.  G-. Figg
 and  T. W. Baker.

 " On the      Productiou of Transient Electric Currents in Iron

       or by Magnetising them when Twisted."                   By J. A. EwiXG,
       B.Sc, F.R.S.E., Professor of Mechanical Engineering and
       Physics in the University of Tokio, Japan, now Professor
        of Engineering in the University College, Dundee. Re
        ceived October 21, 1882 *
    § 1. A chance observation, made in the summer of 1881, drew my
attention to the fact that when the ends of an iron wire are connected
to the terminals of a galvanometer, a transient current will bo
observed if the wire be suddenly magnetised while it is held in a
state of torsion, or suddenly twisted whilst in a state of longitudinal
magnetisation.         Further inquiry showed that    these currents are satis
factorily explainable by reference to the results of more direct obser
vations which have been made on the effects of stress on magnetism.
They present, however, certain features of interest, and the examina
tion of them, of which a condensed account is given below, may form
a  useful supplement to any direct investigation of the effects of stress
on magnetic susceptibility and residual magnetism.
    § 2. A straight, moderately soft, well-annealed iron wire, 1 millim.
in diameter and 3-A centims. long, was placed horizontally in an E. W.
position, with one end securely fixed and the other held by a twisting
arm, by which any desired amount of torsion might be applied.                  The
twisting     arm     was provided   with  a pointer,  which     travelled   over  a
graduated circular dial.        The ends of the wire were connected by long
leading wires to a Thomson's mirror galvanometer of 0-25 ohm resist
ance, with a heavy mirror, which made it fairly suitable for ballistic
work. Bound the iron wire was a magnetising solenoid of GtiO turns,
31 centims. long, in two layers, wound so as to have no longitudinal
component       parallel   to the wire.   In circuit with the solenoid       was a
single large Daniell's cell and      a reversing key.    The resistance of this

The two directions of twist are distinguished by the signs + and — ,
the latter being used when the twist is that of a common screw.      The
two directions of the magnetising current will be called A and B ; the
connexions for A are shown by the full lines, and for B by the dotted
lines.   A has the effect of making the dial end (5) of the wire a
                     "
nominal N. (i.e., a north-seeking ") pole.       A transient current will
be called positive when   it flows along the wire from    a to 6.
   § 3.  When the wire was in a state of no torsion the closing of the
 battery circuit did not of course prodnce any current in the ballistic
 galvanometer ; nor, when the wire was sensibly free from magnetisa
tion, did twisting it produce any effect.     But when the wire was first
twisted negatively (like a common screw) and then magnetised by
closing the circuit, A, a transient current flowed along it from b to a,
that is, from N. to S. Reversal of the magnetising current from A to
B, the wire being still held twisted, caused a transient current of
twice the quantity of the first to pass in the opposite direction.
   In like manner, if the magnetising current A was first made and
the wire then twisted suddenly like a common screw, a transient
current   flowed along it from b to a, that is from N. to S., and similar
currents    were observed when, without maintaining the magnetising
force in action, a permanently magnetised wire was suddenly twisted.

              On the   Production of Transient Electric Currents.         Ill)
      § 4. The existence of these transient currents is due to the produc
  tion of a state of circular magnetisation as the result of torsional stress
 and longitudinal magnetism acting jointly.        To prove this,    I substi
  tuted for the wire a long piece of iron gas-pipe, itself insulated, but
 carrying in its interior an independent copper wire, which was in
 circuit with the ballistic galvanometer.         The gas-pipe was longi
  tudinally magnetised by a surrounding solenoid.          The making and
  reversing of a current in the solenoid whilst the pipe was held twisted,
  or the sudden twisting of the pipe during or after the operation of the
  magnetising force, gave transient currents along the insulated wire
 inside precisely similar to those which had been observed when the
 two functions     of inducing magnet and conductor were both discharXed
 by a   solid iron wire.     The pipe gave much greater currents, chiefly
 because of its greater size, but partly also because the metal in it was
 more advantageously disposed than in a solid rod, both as regards the
stress and the subsequent inductive effect on the conductor inside.
     § 5. That longitudinal magnetisation combined with torsion should
give rise to circular magnetism follows from Sir William Thomson's
 discovery that aeolotropic stress developes an aeolotropic difference of
magnetic susceptibility in iron.       When the wire or tube is twisted the
stress is equivalent to pull and push along linos perpendicular to the
radius and inclined at 46° to the direction of the length.         Along one
of these the magnetic susceptibility is increased ; along the other, at
right angles to that, it is diminished.        The effect is to change the
 lines of induction, originally straight and parallel to the axis, into
screws, whose circular components produce the transient currents now
 described.      The direction of the currents is that corresponding to
increase of magnetism by pall.
     I shall now give a brief account of the experimental results, and
afterwards point out their relation to the discoveries of Villari and
Thomson on the effects of stress on magnetism, as well as to certain
recent experiments of my own on the same subject.
     § 6. The wire described in § 2 was twisted oppositely to a common
screw by turning the pointer through an angle of 60° to the side
 marked positive (see fig. 1).       As the wire was initially free from any
considerable magnetisation, this operation gave no transient current.
The battery current A was then made, the wire being held twisted.
This gave a positive transient current along the wire (from a to 1),
which produced a deflection of 39 scale divisions of the ballistic
galvanometer.       The throw of the galvanometer will be taken as giving,
on an     arbitrary scale, a measure of the circular magnetisation of the
wire.
    Then keeping       the wire still twisted at +60°, the current A was
broken.      This gave almost no transient current: in other words, the
circular magnetism was scarcely at all affected by the removal of the

120                         Prof. J. A. Ewing.
longitudinal magnetising force.        Other experiments with wires of
larger   diameter   and with a tube have  shown that to remove the longi
tudinal magnetising force when the wire is twisted generally produces
a very slight reduction of the circular magnetism, although in some
instances    it produces an actual increase     (see § 22 below). In the
present case the breaking of the magnetising current produced no
effect at all comparable with that which was produced by its first
establishment.       Re-making the current after breaking also gave
almost no sensible effect.
    Reversal from A to B gave a transient current of — 78, showing
that the circular magnetism changed to — 39, and repeated reversals
of the current gave the same, or very nearly the same, effect.
    § 7. Again, if instead of twisting the wire first, and magnetising
it when twisted, we apply either A or B at the zero of torsion, there
is no effect.    Let A be kept on, and let the wire be suddenly twisted
to +60°: there is then a transient current equal to about +35.          The
circular magnetisation acquired in this way is therefore somewhat
less than that which was reached by twisting first and magnetising
afterwards.      If now, at + 60° of torsion, we reverse from A to B, we
have a transient current of — 74 : in other words, the circular mag
netism is changed from +35 to —39.            A  subsequent reversal   from
 B to A gives + 78, and so on.
    § 8.  If we next keep A made, and change the torsion suddenly
from +60° to —60°, we get a current, not of —78, but of only about
  — 72. A twist back from —60° to +60° gives a still smaller positive
 deflection, and successive repetitions of the same operation, under
 constant magnetising force, cause a gradual diminution of range,
 until, after many back and forth twistings, the transient currents are
  — 64, when the wire is twisted from +60° to —60°, and +64, when
 it is twisted from — 60° to +60°. This means that the circular mag
 netism is then changing between +32 and —32, on the assumption
 that the effects are symmetrical on the two sides. That they were
 very nearly so in the experiment cited I have no doubt ; there may,
  however, have been a slight set towards the side on which the first
 and greatest circular magnetisation occurred.        If, after this steady
 state has been reached by successive opposite torsions, the battery is
 reversed from A to B at +60°, a transient current of — 71 shows
 that the circular magnetism is at   once   restored to its normal value of
 -39.

 in tabular form, thus : —

   These figures show that         if  we call +39 the normal circular magneti
sation proper      to the given torsion (60°) and the given longitudinal
 magnetising force, then the first application or reversal of the mag
netising force while the wire is held twisted developes the full normal
value of the circular magnetism, whereas the first application                            or
                      -
reversal   of the torsion under constant magnetising force does not
produce   the normal value, but something less. Also that this defect
of circular magnetism is increased by successive back and forth twist-
ings, which finally cause the circular magnetism to oscillate between
two considerably reduced values.                     After this steady state has been
reached, a single reversal of the longitudinal magnetising force, the
torsion being kept constant, suffices to produce the full normal value
of the circular magnetism proper to the state so arrived at.
   § 10. If after being circularly magnetised by applying longitudinal
magnetising force whilst it is held twisted, the wire be relieved of
torsion by allowing the twisting arm to return suddenly, but without
shock, to zero, a portion of the circular magnetism survives the
removal of the stress which gave rise to it.                  Thus : —

(0° to —60°) brings us to the value — 33, almost identical with that
which was reached in § 9 by twisting at once from + 60° to — 60".
   This tendency on the part of the circular magnetisation to follow at
a distance instead of accompanying the changes of torsion is still more
clearly shown if we divide the whole angle from +60° to —60° into
several steps. The following figures give the transient current so
obtained after the torsion had been reversed sufficiently often to bring
the changes into a steady and sensibly cyclic state.          The current A

to angle of twist during this cyclic operation.            They show well

   § 11. The same tendency towards persistence of previous state
is exhibited whenever we change the magnetisation of a piece of iron
or steel by the alternate application and removal of any kind of stress.
It is exhibited also when magnetisation is changed by changing the
magnetising force, when it appears as the characteristic ordinarily
called retentiveness, to which the existence of residual magnetism is

             On the Production        of Transient Electric Currents.              123
  ascribed.    It  also appears, as was shown          first by M. E. Cohn, and
 afterwards independently by myself in a paper which                     I   had the
  honour recently to lay before the Royal Society,* in the changes of
 thermoelectric quality which occur in iron when it is subjected to
  <yclic changes of stress.        In the instances now referred to this lag
 ging    seems   to  be  permanent as regards time, so that if it is to be
 ascribed to molecular friction, the friction to which it is due must
 resemble the friction of solids rather than the viscosity of liquids.
 To avoid much circumlocution it is convenient to give this lagging
 action a name, and accordingly I have called it Hysteresis (from
 v<ntpiu, to come after, used either of place or time).             This name may
 be properly applied not only in cases where, as here, the persistence
 of previous state appears to be permanent as respects time, but also in
 those cases where (as in the relation of strain to stress in a viscous
 material) the ainonnt of lagging depends on the rate of change of the
 conditioning quality, and would disappear if that were indefinitely
 slow.
    To define the now term more precisely, let there be given two
qualities of matter, M and N, of which M is a function of N ; then if
 when    N is   changed      cyclically the corresponding changes of M lag
                                                                                  "
 behind the changes        of N, we may say that there is " hysteresis               in
 the relation of M to N.          The value of M at any particular point of
 the operation depends not only on the actual value of N but on all
 the preceding       changes of that quantity, and by properly manipu
 lating those changes any value of M within more or less wide limits
 may be fonnd associated with a given value of N.
    In all the instances of " hysteresis
                                                "
                                                  mentioned above this further
 characteristic is present, that the range through which M varies
 becomes gradually diminished when a cyclic variation of N is repeated
several times, and it would seem that only after an indefinitely large
number of repetitions of the cycle of N do the changes of M also
 become exactly cyclic.t
    § 12. In the paper referred to above           I showed that the action here
called hysteresis, when it exhibited itself in the relation of thermo
 electric quality to stress in a soft-iron wire, could be nearly, if not
 wholly, destroyed by mechanically agitating the wire during or after
   •  "
        Proceedings," vol. 32, p. 399.
   t  Objection may, perhaps, be taken to the coining of a new word on the ground
that the term " retentiveness," already in use, expresses sufficiently nearly tho same
idea.   In physics, however. retentiveness is limited by custom to denote the power
oi retaining magnetism when the magnetising force is rcmoTed, whereas one of the
instances in which
                     " hysteresis " has been noticed has, at least apparently, no con
nexion with magnetism.        And unless tho word retentiveness be used in a sense
 m»ch less restricted than is now customary, it will not cover even those cases of
* hysteresis " which occur in magnetic phenomena.

124                                  Prof.   J.   A. Ewing.
the change of stress. The same thing is true in the present case.
After the circular magnetisation has been rednced from 39 to 32 by
successive twistings between +60° and — 60° under constant magne
tising force, it can be at once raised again to 39 by tapping the wire
vigorously. Again, if in making the steps +60° to 0° and 0° to
— G0° under constant magnetising force, we permit the wire to spring
back freely to the zero of torsion and oscillate there (instead of
making the twisting arm come against a stop which arrests vibration),
we find that the two steps give nearly equal transient currents — in
other words, that at the zero of torsion there is then almost no
circular magnetisation.
   § 13. A still more effective way of restoring the circular magneti
sation to its normal value after it has been affected by hysteresis is to
change suddenly the longitudinal magnetisation of the wire.          The
molecular agitation so produced acts like mechanical vibration.
Almost all trace of the effects of hysteresis vanishes if we simply
break and rumake the magnetising current in the solenoid.        This is
especially true of soft iron; with steel the effects of hysteresis are
only partially removed by this means.
   For example, let the circular magnetism be reduced to 32 by
successive twistings between +60° and — 60° under the A current,
then   if   we break   A   and remake             it,   each   of these operations
                                                               gives                     a
small positive transient current, the two together showing that the
circular magnetism has risen to very nearly its full value of 39. Or,
again, if after applying A at +60° we untwist to zero, keeping      on,              A
there  isa residual circular magnetism of + 15   then let A be broken
                                                                   :
and remade, and each of these operations will give a negative tran
sient current, the two together amounting as nearly as possible to
— 15, after which subsequent makes and breaks of the magnetising
current will give no effect. If on the other hand we reach the zero
of torsion from —60° with A on, the residual circular magnetism is
negative, and in that case positive transient currents are produced
when    A    is   broken   and remade.             Generally, to remove and reapply,
or better,    to reverse the longitudinal magnetising force while there
is  no torsion, has the effect of removing any circular magnetisation
which mry have remained from previous operations.
  §  14. To determine the normal value of the circular magnetisation
corresponding to different angles of twist, with the same longitudinal
magnetising force, we have simply to bring the twisting arm to any
angle, and, holding       there, reverse the magnetising current more
                           it
than once.    The first reversal wipes out the effect of previous opera
tions and sets up the normal state of circular magnetisation         the             ;
second reversal changes that from + to — and so gives a transient

    The  same results are shown        graphically in the dotted line of fig. 2 ;
comparison of it with the full lines of the same figure will serve to
show the part played by hysteresis in the changes of circular
magnetisation which are caused by changes of stress.
    § 15. The torsions which have been hitherto spoken of wore well
within the limits of elasticity.              When the angle of twist was
increased beyond 60° the transient currents given on reversal of the
battery were not greatly augmented.               They reached a maximum at
about 90°, at which angle the torsion began to produce distinct
permanent       set, and for greater         angles they diminished slightly.
Moreover, after the wire was twisted beyond its elastic limit, and
allowed to come back to its new zero of torsional stress, reversal of the
longitudinal magnetism then gave transient currents of opposite sign
to those which were given while the stress which caused the set was in
operation ; the reason probably being that the wire, though then free
from torsional stress, had acquired a helical quality with respect to
magnetic inductive susceptibility, the susceptibility being less aloug
the lines of permanent extension than in other directions.               The lines
of induction were therefore screws of opposite sign to the lines of
permanent extension.           Again, effects of the same sign as those
observed    would     be given by permanent twist if permanent extension
produced a state in which the electrical conductivity of the iron was
less along than across the lines of strain.              After being twisted to
 4- 360° the wire was allowed to spring back : its new zero of stress
was at + 125°.         There, after several reversals, B to A gave — 7, and

 126                           Prof. J.  A. Ewing.
 A   to B gave + 7. By restoring 5° of positive torsion a state was
 reached in which reversals of the battery gave no transient currents.
    § 16. The effects which are obtained by twisting and untwisting
 after the longitudinal magnetising force is removed are somewhat
 more complex than those already described, on account of the fact
 that a gradual shaking        out of the residual       magnetism    takes place,
 which is not, however,        complete even       after  many   twistings. For

   It  is interesting to notice that the circular magnetisation has, so to

  A continuation of the same experiment showed that when the
magnetising force was increased the transient currents continued to
diminish, falling almost to zero, but did not become reversed.          Even
with a wire of very soft iron a magnetising force of over 100 c.g.s.
unite still gave effects of the same sign as the above.
   § 19. Similar series of experiments          were made with a piece of
pianoforte-steel wire in its ordinary temper.          Fig.  3 shows how the
                                     Fig. 3.

 circular magnetisation of the steel wire, starting from the norma
 value for + 903, was altered by successive twistings between +90°
 and — 90° under the action of a constant longitudinal magnetising
 force of 20 c.g.s. units.      It exhibits very strikingly the lessening of
 range brought about by successive twistings, which has been already
 alluded to (§ 8) as occurring (though to a less extent) in iron. Finally,
 after several twistings, a sensibly cyclic set of changes was instituted
 which is shown by the full lines in fig. 4. [The "normal" curve
                                        Fig. 4.
(see § 9) is shown   by the dotted line in the same figure.]           A remark
able feature here is that when the direction of twisting is reversed
the first effect is to continue the same kind of change of circular
magnetism as was going on before.            The curve rises before it begins
to fall, and vice versa.
   Many other observations have been made, which it is needless to
describe, since they are all in obvious agreement with the explanation
already offered.    It only remains to point out this agreement in the
case of those features      of the experiments        where    it is not at once
evident.

parallel to the lines of force     its magnetism is increased, provided that
the magnetising force does not exceed a certain value, but decreased if
the magnetising force does exceed that              limit. Experiments of my
own, not yet published, have shown that the Villari reversal of the
effect of pall occurs at a particular value of the magnetisation rather
than at a particular value of the magnetising force.              They have also
shown that, apart from its influence on magnetic susceptibility,                 pull
increases residual       magnetism      when     that   is not  too   strong    (this
Villari had observed), and further, that the changes of either induced
or residual magnetism produced by changes of stress always exhibit
the action I have called hysteresis, with the characteristic described
in § 11, viz., diminution of range in successive operations, with an
approach to a cyclic condition when a cyclic change of stress is
repeated.      The lagging of magnetic change is just such as might, on
Weber's theory of magnetic induction, be ascribed- to a frictional
resistance opposing the rotation of the magnetic molecules ; further,
it is capable of being, in great part, destroyed by mechanical
               •
vibration.
    The    experiments now under review exhibit the same actions
 occurring    when we deal with the combined pull and push stress set
 up by   torsion.
    § 21. In view of the discovery of Villari and Thomson                I  expected
that with a high magnetising force the signs of the transient currents
 would be reversed, so that they would                then indicate decrease of
magnetism        by pull. This did not occur (§ 18) apparently for the
 following    reason.    My own direct experiments show that moderate*
 pnll increases the magnetism of iron only so long as that is less than
 (very roughly) about three-fourths of its limiting value.               Now, when
 a longitudinally magnetised rod is twisted, the pull and push of which
 the stress is made up act not on the full magnetisation               but on com
 ponents of it inclined at 45° to the axis.          The intensity of magnetism
 on which the stress acts is therefore rather less than three-fourths of the
 whole,     and hence, even when we increase the magnetising force
 indefinitely, the action still occurs below, though very near to, the
 Villari critical point.         Under these circumstances the transient
 currents become much diminished in amount, but they preserve the
 same     signs as they have when the magnetising force is small, the
 signs, namely,     which correspond to increase of magnetism by pull.t
    •
       The precise point of reversal depends, amongst other things, on the amount of
 pull applied.
    +  Sir W. Thomson (loc. ext., § 229) has applied his discovery of the effects of
 stress on the mngnetic   inductive susceptibility of iron to explain G. Wiedemann's
  observation that an iron rod traversed longitudinally by an electric current becomes
  a magnet when twisted, and expresses his surprise at finding no reversal of the poles
  when a strong current was used ; but if the above explanation of the non-reversal
      VOL. XXXVI.                                                          K

     § 22.  It has been mentioned that the removal and re-application of
longitudinal magnetising force acting on an iron wire nnder torsion
produced almost no change of the circular magnetism, and that when
a small change was visible,         it had sometimes the apparently anomalous
character of increase of circular magnetism with removal of longitudinal
magnetising force.            My experiments show that the residual magne
tism of soft annealed iron is generally very great, amounting to as
much as 80 or even 90 per cent. of the induced magnetism, provided
that care be taken, by the use of a very long rod or a ring magnet, to
prevent      the   existence     of any    self-demagnetising       force when the
inducing force is withdrawn              (a  condition   present   in   these torsion
experiments),         and also provided that mechanical disturbance                   be
avoided, which, if it occurs, will remove by far the greater part of
this large residue.           Now any change of circular magnetism which
takes place when the longitudinal magnetising force is withdrawn
 from a twisted wire must be due to the fact that the effect of torsion in
producing circular magnetism is either less or greater on the residual
than on the total longitudinal magnetisation.                The two are so nearly
 equal   that   but  little  change  occurs,   and in general, when the longitu
 dinal magnetising force has not been very intense, the change is of
 the nature of a diminution.           But when the longitudinal magnetisation
 has been very strong, the 45° components of it, on which the effects
 of pull and push are felt, may approach so closely to the ViJlari
 critical point that the reduction of them which takes place when the
 magnetising force is removed makes them more susceptible to the
 action of stress, and so causes an increase of circular magnetism.
     § 23. To complete the explanation of the results, allusion need be
 made to only one other point.             It was mentioned in § 19 that when
 by successive twistings from one side to the other, a cyclic condition
 was established in steel, then at the beginning of each release from
 torsional stress a slight increase of circular magnetism took place (see
  fig. 4). My experiments on the effects of stress on magnetised wires
 show that at the beginning of each loading or unloading the initial
 change of magnetism is nil relatively to the initial change of stress, if
 great care be taken to avoid mechanical disturbance.                 When there is
 any disturbance at the beginning of the change of load, its effect is to
  make the magnetisation approach the value which it would assume
  under vibration. In the torsion experiments the changes of stress
  were necessarily effected suddenly, and must have been accompanied
  by some slight vibration.          This affords a sufficient explanation of the
  of the transient currents be correct, it applies equally to -Wiedemann's result.
 There, too, the intensity of magnetisation on which the differential effect of pull and
                      —
 push is felt, being    y=
                            of the whole circular magnetism,  cannot be increased  suffi
  ciently to cause the Villari reTersal.

                On the Production         of Transient Electric Currents.             131
  point now under consideration             ; for in the observation shown in fig. 4,
 the   initial effect of beginning to release the wire from stress, instead of
  being nil, was in fact just that which a small amount of vibration
  would cause.
     § 24.    The fact that sudden torsion gives a transient current along a
 magnetised iron or steel rod was observed by Matteucci as early as
  1858.       An account of his observations is given by Wiedemann
  (" Galvanismus," II, § 484), from which it appears that when an iron
 rod under the influence of longitudinal magnetising force was twisted
 like a common screw, the current flowed from south to north.                         The
 direction      stated is opposite to that taken, under similar conditions, by
 the   currents     in my experiments. A possible explanation of this dis
 crepancy may be found if we suppose that in Matteucci's experiments
 the Villari critical point had been passed, which might have been the
 case    if  he applied       strong torsional stress in conjunction with strong
 magnetisation.           For it has been shown by Sir W. Thomson,* and
 confirmed by my own experiments, that the Villari critical point
 comes earlier         with strong than with weak stresses.                      With the
 moderate stress used by me, reversal of the effects did not occur even
 with very high magnetising forces, but it is possible that by using
 more     powerful torsion Matteucci may have brought his rods into the
 coudition      which would give decrease of magnetism by oblique pull.
 This suggestion is borne out by his observations with hard steel, of
 which it is said that when the magnetising current was broken, the
 transient currents         produced by torsion changed their signs after the
 residual magnetism had been partly shaken out by the first twistings,
 showing apparently a passage through the Villari critical point as the
 magnetisation       was reduced.
    Matteucci has also remarked that the currents become constant
 only after several back and forth twistings.                     Curiously enough he
says that a twisted rod gives no current when it is magnetised, but it
 is not     unlikely that this (certainly erroneous)             observation may have
been      due to an accidental           omission   to notice the effect of the first
closing       of the       magnetising       circuit after the rod was twisted.
 Subsequent openings             and  closings   of the circuit do give scarcely any
 effect.
    § 25.     By using       a telephone in place of a ballistic galvanometer,
Professor Hughes            has   observed the production of transient currents
in a twisted iron wire by making and breaking a current in a
Burrounding solenoid, and he has described in a recent series of
paperst        this  as    well    as many     other    closely related     results.  For
example, he placed the             iron wire in the battery circuit, and connected
the    telephone. to the external             solenoid.     Sounds were then obtained

by rapidly interrupting the current through the wire.        This (which   I
have verified with a ballistic galvanometer) is a direct consequence
of Wiedemann's discovery alluded to in a footnote to § 21 above.
    § 26.  Apart altogether     from   the magnetic origin to which the
transient currents described in this paper have been assigned, another
cause probably contributes in some small degree to the production of
the observed results.     From Sir William Thomson's discovery of the
effects  of stress on electrical conductivity it follows that an originally
isotropic conductor will, when under torsion, possess a helical quality
with respect to electrical conductivity, and it has in fact been shown
experimentally by Professor W. G. Adams and Mr. J. T. Bottomley
that a brass tube, conveying a current longitudinally, becomes when
twisted equivalent to a conducting helix. Hence when the longitu
dinal magnetism of a twisted iron rod (forming part of a circuit) is
altered, a transient current will be induced in the helical lines of
greatest conductivity by the magnetic change of the interior portion
of the rod.     The direction of greatest resistance in iron is (probably)
that of pull, and the lines of greatest conductivity will therefore be
helices opposite in sign to the twist of the rod.        Magnetisation will
therefore give a current from S. to N. when the twist is that of a
common screw.        The actual transient current, however, flows from
N. to S. Moreover it is clear that the development of a helical
quality with regard to conductivity will not explain the fact that the
transient currents pass a maximum when the current in the solenoid
 is strengthened, nor apply at all to the gas-pipo experiment of & 4.
 It has been suggested to me that another more recondite partial
 origin of the transient currents given when a magnetised iron rod is
 twisted may be looked for in the fact that the diminution of longitu
 dinal magnetism brought about by torsion induces a current in the
 magnetising solenoid, which again reacts on the helical lines of con
 ductivity in the rod itself, — an idea which was perhaps present with
  Professor Hughes when he spoke of the transient currents as
  "
    tertiary." It is safe to say that these and perhaps other influences
 enter into the production of the effects which have formed the subject
 of this paper ; at the same time it may be affirmed with confidence
 that the phenomena, as they are observed, find a perfectly satisfactory
  and [sufficient explanation in the setting up of a state of circular
  magnetisation by the influence of torsional stress on the existing
 longitudinal magnetism and on the susceptibility             to magnetic
 induction.

      Supplementary        Note to the Original Paper.            Received
                               August     30, 1882.
   In the original paper nnder this title, communicated             to the Royal
Society on September 7th, 1881, it was suggested that the phenomena
were due to the production of a state of circular magnetisation by the
action of twisting stress on longitudinal magnetisation, the effect of
twist being to produce a difference of magnetic susceptibility in the
two    directions of pull and push, inclined at 45° to the axis. Recent
experiments of my own on the effect which pull has on the magnetic
susceptibility and residual magnetism of iron (an account of which
will   be given   separately) confirmed this conjecture ; and, guided by
the light which they threw on the subject,           I  have now made a short
supplementary      examination     of the  effects of  torsion, which has shown
that the   conjectural explanation is perfectly satisfactory.
   To show that the transient currents produced by twisting a magnet
are due to the development of circular magnetisation,               I substituted
for the iron or steel wire used in former experiments an iron gas-pipe,
itself insulated but carrying along its interior an insulated copper
wire which was in circuit with a ballistic galvanometer.                The gas-
pipe was longitudinally magnetised by a surrounding solenoid. When
the pipe was twisted, a transient current passed along the wire in its
interior.     Another transient current was given when the longitudinal
 magnetisation was reversed, the state of twist remaining constant.
By this arrangement, in brief, all those phenomena could be repro
 duced which were described in the paper as exhibited when the two
 functions of inducing magnet and conductor were both discharged by
 a solid iron wire.     The transient currents given by the tube were
much more powerful, partly because the position of the conductor
 was more advantageous than when conduction was taking place
 throughout the twisted metal itself, but chiefly because of the rela
 tively large size of the tube. By winding the insulated wire in the
 centre so that it passed several times through the tube, the effects
 were proportionately     increased.
    In  the paper  it was shown that when the longitudinal magnetising
 force was increased,     the   transient   currents    given by reversing that
 force while    the wire was kept in      a constant state of twist passed a
 maximum when (with one specimen) the value of the force was
 15 c.g.s. units, after which the effects diminished          slowly as the force
 was raised    to 24 c.g.s. units, that being the highest value then used.
 The effects were such as to correspond to increase of magnetism along
 the lines of pull.    From the discovery of Villari and Thomson that
  with. a certain value of the magnetising force the effect of pull on
  magnetisation becomes       reversed, we might expect the signs of the

134                          Prof.  J.  A. Ewing.
transient currents to change if the magnetising force were sufficiently
increased.     Recently I have examined the effects with very high
values of the longitudinal magnetising force.            The transient currents
are   then  exceedingly    small,  but   they obstinately refuse to become
reversed, even when the magnetising force is as much as 100 c.g.s. units.
The effects still correspond to greater magnetisation along the lines of
pull.
   The explanation of this seeming anomaly lies in the fact that the
Villari reversal of the effects of stress depends on the intensity of
magnetisation rather than on the value of the magnetising force, and
that the stress acts here only on a component of the whole magneti
sation.    1 find that in soft iron, the effect of a moderate amount of
pull is to give greater susceptibility      so long as the magnetisation does
not  exceed   about  three-fourths   of   its  limiting value. With a greater
stress the reversal comes earlier, and with a very small stress it
comes later.      Now, suppose that we apply to a soft-iron wire a
powerful magnetising force and thereby approach the limit of mag
netisation.     When we twist the wire, the directions of pull and push
are inclined at 45° to the direction         of magnetisation,  and the stress
therefore acts on         or about seven-tenths of the whole intensity of
                    -^=,
magnetisation.      Hence pull ought still to increase (though very
slightly) the magnetic susceptibility along the lines of pull, and the
circular magnetisation ought still to have the same direction as it had
when the magnetising force was small ; and this is what actually
occurs.
   In the paper, it was noticed that when the magnetising current
was interrupted while the wire was held in a constant state of twist,
there was scarcely any change of the circular magnetisation.             I now
find that although in general the circular magnetisation decreases very
slightly in these conditions, nevertheless it occasionally increases when
the longitudinal magnetising force is removed. This happens in soft iron
when that force is very high, and its occurrence is in complete agree
ment with direct observations of the effects of pull on magnetism.
It means that the effect of pull is then greater on the 45° component
of the residual magnetism than on the same component of the tem
porary magnetism, and this is the case when the affected component
of the temporary magnetism is near that value at which the Villari
reversal occurs.     The following figures give an observed instance of
this action in   a very  strongly magnetised soft-iron wire which was
held in a constant state of twist. Calling the two directions of the
magnetising current A and B, and the two directions of circular
magnetisation    + and — , we have      :

Here the circular magnetisation was greater in the ratio of 13 to 4
when the differential effect of torsional stress was exerted on the
(comparatively small) amount of residual than on the (comparatively
large) amount of temporary longitudinal magnetism.

   The subject of the present paper was discovered during the excava
tions of docks now in progress -at Tilbury Fort, Essex, at a depth of
32 feet from the present surface.       It consists of a considerable pro
portion  of a human    skeleton,  the parts of which are determined and
described.    The inferences deduced are that they were from a some
what aged male of great muscular strength ; and such inferences as to
food, as might "be drawn from the worn crowns of the teeth in use at
his demise, are given.     A  chemical   analysis of -the bones is added by
Dr. Walter Flight, of the Laboratory Department in the British
Museum.      A section of the several strata dug through before arriving
at the bed is appended.
   This section determines      the man to have lived      -at   the so-called
" Palaeolithic period."    The author acknowledges hie indebtedness to
Colonel Du Plat Taylor for the transmission of the skeleton, with
a notification of its discovery, in a letter of the 1st October, 1883 ; also

    M. Fievez has recently sent me a map of the solar spectrum from
C to    A* inclusive, and as part of this region is one which                     I  have
been    measuring,       I have examined the new publication with great
interest.      Photography and eye measurements do not exactly coincide
in the detail of the grouping of the little a group as far as A, and A
itself is shown by M. Fievez's map as wanting some details which
appear in the photographs.              Thus in the photographs there are some
seventeen lines, whilst in M. Fievez's map there are but thirteen.
 Between A and a there are several lines of marked intensity in the
 photograph which are not shown in the new map. The wave-lengths
 of the different       lines from above "a" to A are not the same as
 those given      by  Fievez,   when they are taken from comparison photo
 graphs of the 1st order of the red and 2nd of the ultra- violet on
 the    same plate, or when             checked by photographs of the 2nd
 order of the red with the 3rd order of the green taken in a similar
 manner.       In  my paper,

 method of using mirrors by which this conld be effected, but since
 Professor Rowland introduced his concave gratings this is much

  had    been suspended     as required by the Statutes, was balloted for

  I.   "Note      on a Series of Barometrical Disturbances which
         passed over Europe between the 27th and the 31st of
         August, 1883."       By Robert H. Scott, F.R.S., Secretary to
         the Meteorological Council.          Communicated by desire of
         the Council. Received December 4, 1883.
                                      Plate 1.
     The occurrence of sudden temporary derangements of atmospheric
 pressure has been occasionally noticed at all observatories provided
 with barographs, either mechanical or photographic.
     Among the most remarkable of theee which have been recorded in
 these islands have been that of January 16, 1869, which appeared at
 Aberdeen, and to a less extent at Glasgow, and that of January 30,
 1876,    which was noticed chiefly at Armagh and Aberdeen, and was
 described      by me in a note published by the Meteorological Society
 (" Quarterly Journal," vol iv, p. 73).
     In both of these cases the depression of the barometrical column
 amounted to about O-l inch, and the duration of the entire disturb
 ance    to about ten minutes.       In both cases the anemometers showed
 sudden disturbances both in the direction and force of ihe wind, and
 on    the   latter occasion certainly    a shower    fell.  In  1869 no self-
recording rain-gauges existed.
     It is evident that both of these         disturbances    were due to the
passage     of squalls.
     The phenomena which I have now to notice are very remarkable,
inasmuch as they are not accompanied by any traceable disturbance of
any other element than pressure, and they appear as clearly at
Coimbra and St. Petersburg as at our own observatories.
     The broad facts to be recorded are that at the end of August a
violent volcanic eruption took place in the Straits of Snnda (in 105°

east   longitude).    The continuance of the shocks is given at from
4 p.m. on the 26th to daybreak         on the 27th, corresponding to the
interval from 9 a.m. to 10    p.m. on the 26th, Greenwich time ; but they
probably continued for a longer period.        No precise statement as to
the moment of occurrence of any particular explosion or shock has
as yet been printed.
   Two letters have been received at the Meteorological Office from the
Board of Trade, one from Her Majesty's Consul at Batavia, and the
other an extract from the log of the Dutch steam ship " Governor-
General Loudon," which ship was in Sunda Straits at the time of the
eruption, having called at Anjer the day before it took place, and
again after the place had been swept by the earthquake sea-wave.
Neither of these accounts contains any precise statement as to time of
any particular phenomenon.
   The facts which I have to bring to the notice of the Society are the
indications of successive disturbances of the barometer occurring also
 at the end of August, at regular intervals and at every observatory in
Europe.
   I shall distinguish the four disturbances shown on the engraving
by Roman numerals.         Greenwich time is used.
   I. At about 11 h. a.m. on the 27th, a sudden increase of pressure,
followed by a decrease, appeared at St. Petersburg, and a similar
phenomenon       was noticed at Valencia Island, and at Coimbra in
Portugal, as well as at all the intermediate observatories over Europe
from which we have been able to obtain tracings of barograms.
   The character of the disturbance was not strictly identical, for at
the western stations the rise of the barometer was more marked than
at the eastern. The general appearance of the barograms at adjacent
stations is strikingly similar. It is, however, difficult to select any
peculiarly remarkable phase of the disturbance so as to recognise it
and record the time of its occurrence at each observatory.
   This movement (I) was propagated from east to west at a very
high velocity, for the recovery of pressure from the first decrease
occurred at St. Petersburg at noon, and at Valencia at 2 h. 25 m. p.m.
on the same day, thus taking only two hours and twenty-five
minutes     to traverse the distance of 1,315     miles between the    two
observatories.
   II. A somewhat similar disturbance appeared on the 28th, but was
propagated from west to east, reaching Valencia at 3 h. 20 m. a.m.,
and St. Petersburg at 5 h. 15 m. a.m., and thus requiring only one
hour and fifty-five minutes for its passage.      The same uncertainty as
to identification of the phase exists in this case as in the preceding.
In all   cases, however, the most marked     phase of the phenomenon has
been noted.

  on the 29th, and Valencia at 2 h. 28 m. a.m. on the same day, and
  traversing the distance in two hours and eight minutes.
      IV. A    disturbance travelling in the same general direction as
  No.   II,  but from W.N.W. to E.S.E., reaching Valencia at 2h. 0 m.
  PJf. on the 29th, and St. Petersburg at 3 h. 35 m. p.m., and occupying
  only one hour and twenty-five minutes in passage.
      Similar disturbances, though of a gradually diminishing intensity,
  can be traced in most of the barograms, occurring at Valencia at
  about 3 h. p.m. on the 30th and 2 h. a.m. on the 31st. After this time the
  traces of disturbance become less distinctly recognisable.    Some of the
  oscillations are more marked at some stations than at others ; the
  Scotch observatories, in particular, exhibit the later disturbances very
  distinctly.
     The engraving, which has been prepared in the Meteorological
  Office, and which shows all the records reduced to the same scale and
  to Greenwich time, exhibits the barograms at the following stations,
  which are enumerated in order of longitude, going from east to
  west : —

  exhibits considerable  similarity to that of the King's barograph at
  the Liverpool    Observatory, at the Waterloo Docks Pierhead on the
  15th of January, 1864, when the "Lottie Sleigh," loaded with about
  twelve tons of guupowder, blew up.        The ship was lying about three
  miles from the Observatory.     I  am indebted to the kindness of Mr.
  Hartnup for a tracing of this interesting curve.
      In this preliminary note I can only say that until copies of the
 barogram8 from extra- European stations, such as New Zealand, the
 Havana, and Calcutta, are received, it is impossible to see whether
 the phenomena so marked in their occurrence               in Europe have
 manifested     themselves elsewhere ; at Toronto they appear to have
 been recorded.     On that subject I shall hope to lay a future communi
 cation before the Society.
    II. Note on the foregoing Paper. By Lieutenant -General R.
           Strachey, F.R.S. Received December 12, 1883.
     The obvious correspondence of the forms and times of occurrence of
 the barometric disturbances, described    in Mr. Scott's paper, at once sug
 gested   that they were due to a common origin, and the great volcanic
 eruption at Krakatoa in the Straits of Snnda appeared to supply a
 probable efficient cause.      Any shock of sufficient violence might
be expected to produce an atmospheric          wave, advancing from the
 place where it was caused in a circular form round the globe, at first
 expanding until it had got half round the earth, and then again con
tracting till it was again concentrated at the antipodes, from which
again it would be thrown back, and so pass backwards and forwards
till it was obliterated.     It might also have- been expected that such a
wave would travel with the velocity of sound, being probably of the
same nature as that which causes sound, though the vibrations             had
not the peculiar character that affects our organs of hearing.         It has,
however, been suggested to me that the wave may rather have had
the character of a solitary wave produced in a liquid, the velocity of
which in the air would not materially differ from that of sound.
     A rough examination of the facts at first made known by the obser
vations recorded in Great Britain indicated that there was prima faoie
strong evidence in support of this view, and that the phenomena
would be approximately explained by the passage round the earth of
a series of waves travelling at the rate of about 700 miles an hour
in opposite directions from the place where the volcanic eruption
occurred. The records since procured from other places, and the more
careful examination     of the facts, has quite confirmed this conclusion.
     Although wo may expect to obtain additional data from other parts

 remarkable phenomenon more complete, yet those we now have are

   As the earlier disturbances, on the 27th and 28th August, extend
over several hours, it became necessary to fix on certain sufficiently
well-defined points in the curves representing the barometric pres
sure, from which to measure the epochs of the passage of succes
sive disturbances.    The first and second of the series are, in almost
all the curves, well defined and generally similar in form, commencing
with a distinct rise, which is again followed by a distinct fall, the fall
being shorter than the rise. These features are followed by a less
definite rise succeeded by a shallow fall, after which there is again a
rise, which gradually passes into the more regular trace.
   The third and fourth of the disturbances can be traced in all the
curves, but they no longer exhibit the same characters, and are usually
nothing more than a sudden sharply defined rise, though in front of
some of these there is a more or less distinct trace of a hollow.

1883.]                 On a Series          of Barometrical                      Disturbances.                         145
turbauce, as a shallow hollow, can be traced in a few of the curves,
after which nothing can be distinguished.
  By a comparison of the time intervals between the first and third,
the  third and fifth, and the fifth and seventh disturbances, and
assuming (which the facts seem to justify) that the velocity of the
wave has remained unchanged in its passage from east to west, it
would appear that the first well-defined rise in the first of the series
corresponds to the rises which are prominent in those succeeding it.
And the same conclusion has been drawn from an examination of the
second and fourth compared with the fourth and sixth of the
series.
     Adopting              the times of the successive passages of
                      these conclusions,
the initial rise have been measured   from the curves, suitable
allowance having been made where the rise was difficult to trace, or
assometimes happened, a hollow appeared corresponding     in position
with the hollows in the earlier form of the disturbances. There     of                                             is,
course, some doubt attaching to these measurements, but their general
consistency seems to indicate that they may be accepted as fairly
representing the facts under discussion.
   The following table gives the results of these estimates of the
times at which the successive waves passed the several stations,
reckoned from midnight of the 26th August, in Greenwich mean

   From the results thus obtained it would follow that the wave
travelled round the earth from east to west in 36 h. 57 m., being at the
rate of -1026 hour for one degree of a great circle of the earth, and
from west to east in 35 h. 17 m., being at the rate of "098 hour for one
degree.     From the velocities thus determined the probable time of
the origin of the wave has been calculated from the known distance
of each place from Krakatoa, the time occupied in the passage of the
wave from Krakatoa to the place of observation, and the observed
time of the passage of the waves.
   The mean value thus obtained from the waves moving from east to
west for the time of the origin of the disturbance at Krakatoa is
2-52 h. Greenwich mean time, or 9"53 h. local time, that is 9 h. 32 m.
a.m. of the 27th August.
   In like manner the waves travelling from west to east will give the
following results (Table V) .—
   The mean value of the time of the origin of the disturbance
obtained from the waves moving from west to east is therefore 2"20 h.
Greenwich mean time, or 9-21 h. local time, that is 9 h. 13 m. local
time.

   The mean between the two values obtained from the waves travel
ling against the earth's motion of revolution and those travelling with
it is 2 h. 24 m. Greenwich mean time, or 9 h. 24 m. local time,
27th August.
   The velocity of the waves in miles will be for those which travel
from east to west 674 miles per hour, and for those passing from west
to east 706 miles per hour.    The velocity of sonnd is for a temperature
of 50° F. 757 miles an hour, and for 80° F. 781 miles an hour.      With
a temperature as low as zero F. the velocity will only be reduced to
 723 miles an hour, which is still considerably in excess of the greater
of the observed velocities.     The excess of the velocity of the waves
which travelled in the same direction as the earth's motion of revo
lution, that is, from west to east, over that of those which passed in
the opposite direction, is about 32 miles an hoar, which might be
accounted for by the circumstance that the winds along the paths of
 the waves would, on the whole, be from the west, which would cause
 an increase in the velocity of the one set, and a diminution in that of
 the other, so that the observed difference of 32 miles would correspond
 to an average westerly wind of 16 miles an hour, which is not im
 probable.
    It should be observed that the path of the wave which passed
 Toronto approached very near to the North and South Poles, and that
 the  velocity in both directions appears to be somewhat less than in
 the waves which passed over central Europe. The wave which passed
 northwards over Asia travelled at the rate of about 660 miles an
 hour, or about 15 miles an hour slower than the wave which passed
 over Great Britain from east to west.         This reduction of velocity
 seems to be within the limitR of what might be due to the low tem
perature of the regions.
    The wave travelling from east to west having been perceptible on
the barometer traces at several of the stations until about 122 hours
after its origin, and its velocity having been 674 miles an hour, it had
travelled before its extinction more than 82,200 miles, aud had passed
3 \ times round the entire circuit of the earth.
    It is further worthy of notice that during the 30th and 31st of
August and 1st September, a very severe cyclonic storm was crossing
the North Atlantic, and that the wave comi»g from the westward
early on the 31st, No. VI of the serres, must have passed on in front of
the cyclone, and that its next transit would have carried it into the
very centre of the cyclone near the British Isles on the afternoon of
the 1st September.      This perhaps accounts for no trace of it being
found, though the wave coming from the eastward on the morning of
that day, just before the cyclone had arrived, No. VII, was discernible.
    There is no definite statement, so far as I am informed at present,
of the true time of any particularly severe shock or explosion at

Krakatoa excepting that which is contained in the letter of Mr.
Watson (published in " Nature," Gth December, 1883), whose ship
was within a few miles of the volcano on the morning of the
27th August.      He refers to an unusually severe explosion as having
occurred at 11 h. 15 m. a.m. local time, which is nearly 45 minutes
later than the time, 9 h. 32 m., arrived at in the foregoing discus
sion. The point of the disturbance (as indicated by the baro-
grams) which has been taken as the front of the wave is the highest
point of the first abrupt rise of the trace, and is perhaps on an
average not far from one hour after the first signs of disturbance,
the increase of pressure having been very rapid during the interval,
but broken into two or three steps or oscillations.           Daring the
following    half-hour  there  is  usually a large  decrease  of  pressure,
succeeded by another abrupt rise lasting about half an hour.          Then
follow a fall of about an hour, then a rise of an hour and a half, and
then a fall of an hour and a quarter.        The whole length of the dis
turbance on the time scale is between five and six hours, corresponding
to an actual distance of between 3500 miles and 4000 miles.            The
length of the first main wave of the disturbance is about one hour on
the time scale or about 700 miles in length over the earth's surface.
   In the present position of our knowledge of the facts, it can only
be surmised     that the shock of 11 h. 15 m. a.m. of the 27th August
observed by Mr. Watson corresponds to the second main feature
of the disturbance.      That the wave which forms the first feature
would have originated at 11 h. 15 m. a.m. is apparently inconsistent
with the observed velocities, which it has been shown are remarkably
consistent, and indicate without much doubt an origin at 9 h. 32 m.
A.M.
   The barometric disturbance at Mauritius noted by Dr. Meldrum is
said to have begun soon after 11 a.m. local time.       The distance from
the  volcano  to  Mauritius  being  about 3450 miles, the wave at the rate
of 674 miles per hour would have reached the island in 5 h. 7 m.
Taking the great shock at 2 h. 32 m. Greenwich mean time, as before
reckoned, the wave would reach Mauritius at 7 b. 39 m. Greenwich
mean time, or adding the allowance for difference of longitude,
3h. 50 m., the local time would be 11 h. 29 m., which agrees satisfac
torily with the facts as recorded.
   In  conclusion, it may be noticed that the sea-waves produced by
this volcanic disturbance, assuming the time of its occurrence to have
been 2 h. 32 m. Greenwich mean time of the 27th August, were propa
gated with an approximate velocity of 480 miles an hour to Mauritius,
of 430 miles an hour to Port Elizabeth near the Cape of Good Hope,
and 420 miles to Galle, and a somewhat slower rate to Aden.            The
details of the occurrence of these waves on the coasts of India will
shortly   be laid before the Society by Major Baird, who     has  informed

 1883.    J    Electric Discharge with Chloride          of Silver Battery.     151
 me that the velocity     of the wave between Galle and Aden was 378 miles
an    hour, and the lengths of the great waves from 287 to 630 miles.
     Postscript, December 15. — Since the above was read before the Royal
 Society, a copy of the barometric trace from New York has been
received, which shows disturbances very similar to those recorded at
 Toronto, and at times which are quite in accordance with the conclu
 sions stated in the paper.

                                   Striking Distance.
     In a postscript to Part IV of our researches,* we stated that, with
 14,400 cells, partly of the rod form, partly of the chloride-in-pow der
form, the length of the spark between paraboloidal points was 0" 7 inc h
 (17-8 millims.), and between a point and diskO-62 inch (15*7 millims.),
and that it does not appear, therefore, that the law of the spark being
as the square of the number of cells holds good beyond a certain
 number.
     These    results were obtained at the Royal Institution ; since the
removal of the battery to our laboratory we had not, at the date of
the postscript to Part IV of our researches, charged up the whole of
it.     Recently, however, we have put the battery in thorough order,
by scraping the zinc rodst of the cells already charged up and added
newly made up cells to bring up the total to 15,000 cells, all of the
rod form.
    Having the whole 15,000 cells in perfect order, we thought that it
would be desirable to make fresh determinations of the striking dis
tance, increasing the potential a thousand cells at a time, between two
very slightly convex disks (planes), a point and disk, and two para
boloidal points. These points are one-eighth of an inch (3'1 75 millims.)
in diameter, and three-eighths of an inch (9-525 millims.) long.                 In
the case of a point and disk, the point was like one of those used for

The two planes used were 1^ inch [3-334 centims.] in diameter.
   As the points, particularly the negative, are deformed at each dis
charge, the precaution was taken to touch up the point after each
discharge in the shaping-tool, screwed to the mandril of the lathe,

   These several results, the different sets being distinguished by plain
crosses or crosses with a dot, are laid down on the diagram, Fig. 1, to
which are also added other results already published from former
experiments   ; these latter have a ring on one of the members of the
cross.  The crosses for two disks, up to 11,000 inclusive, are taken
from the table in Part        III of our researches,* those for the point and
disk from Table XI in Part I, p. 84, and the table in the same part,
p. 116; those for two points, from Table XMa, Curve XVa, p. 86,
separate copy p. 32, and the table, p. 118, separate copy p. 64, of Part        I
of our researches.t
   Through the absolute observations, curves were drawn as on the
diagram to represent the mean of the experiments in Tables I, II,
and III, represented on the diagram by plain crosses (without a ring).
From these curves were deduced the numbers given in Tables IV, V,
and VI, in C.G.S. units.

    An inspection of the diagram, drawn on a reduced scale from the
curves as originally laid down, shows that the curve for approximate
planes (slightly convex, to ensure the centres being the most promi
nent) is continuously concave, whereas those for both point and disk
and two points are concave only for a certain distance, and then turn
off and become convex.              Moreover, that the intensity of force per
centimetre       decreases continuously up to 15,450 volts in the case of
planes   ;  but   that, in the case of a point and disk, and also in that of
two points, the decrease ceases after a certain potential has been
reached, and that then it increases so as to become nearly a constant
quantity. Between a point and a disk the potential per centimetre at
9,000 volts and beyond is very nearly 9,200; consequently, if the
law holds good, to produce a spark 1 decimetre (3'94 inches) long,
92,000 volts, one 1 metre (39 37 inches) long, 920,000 volts,* and a

920,000,000 volts would be required, but this potential would be
lessened by the diminution of the atmospheric pressure at the height
of a kilometre, namely 607-4 millims. (799,210 M), or a mean pressure
of 713 8 millims. (939,211 M) between 1 kilometre and the earth.
Taking the mean pressure 939,211 M, it would require 864,000,000
volts to produce a discharge between a cloud (regarded as a point)
1 kilometre high and the earth.
   It is extremely difficult to conjecture how a cloud can become
charged to such an enormous potential, unless the charged molecules
balance each other (as those of a stratum in a vacuum tube may be
conceived to do) until a disturbing cause breaks up the arrangement ;
and then the whole of them are discharged                  in one direction with
their aggregate potential.
   We may add that less than 1 5,000 cells would not have sufficed to
 make out the fact that the intensity of force to produce a discharge
between a point and disk or two points becomes a constant after 9,000
 to 11,000 cells has been reached.
    The following table gives the ratios of the striking distances be
 tween a point and a disk and two points respectively, taking those

IV. " On the Figure of Equilibrium of a Planet of Heterogeneous
    Density." By G. H. Darwin, F.R.S., Plumian Professor of
    Astronomy and Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.
      Received December         3, 1883.
  The problem of the figure of the earth has,           as far as   Iknow, only
received one solution, namely, that of Laplace.* His          solution involves
an hypothesis as to the law of compressibility of the matter forming'
the planet, and a solution involving another law of compressibility
seems  of some interest, even although the results are not perhaps so
conformable to the observed facts with regard to the earth as those of
Laplace.f
  The solution     offered below was arrived at by an inverse method,
namely, by     the  assumption of a form for the law of the internal
density of the planet, and the subsequent determination of the law of
compressibility.     One case of the solution gives us constant compres
sibility, and another gives the case where the modulus of compressibility
varies as the density, as with gas.
  It would be easy to fabricate     any number of distributions of
density, any one of which would lead to a law of compressibility
equally probable with that of Laplace ; but the solution of Clairaut's
equation   for the ellipticity of the internal strata of equal density
seems  in most cases very difficult. Indeed, it is probable that Laplace
formulated his law because it made the equation in question integrable,
and because it was not improbable from a physical point of view.
   The following notation will be adopted : —
   For an internal stratum of equal density let —
                   r be the radius vector of any point.
                   a the mean radius of the stratum,
                   ethe ellipticity,

                   p the hydrostatic pressure at the point       r, 0.
   For the surface let r, a, t, to denote the similar things.
   Let M be the mass of the planet, p its mean density, to the angular
velocity of rotation, m the ratio ar/f
   * Since this rapcrwas presented     I
                                       have seen a reference to a paper by the late
 M. Edouard Boche, in vol. i of the Memoirs of the Academy of Montpellier (1848),
 in which the problem is solved, when the rate of increase of the density varies as
 the square of the radius. Sec Tisserand, " Comptes Rendui," 23rd April, 1883.
  f  Laplace's hypothetical law of compi essibility arises from a law of internal
 density for which the problem had previously been worked out, as an example, by
 Legendre. See Todhunter's "History of the Figure of the Earth," vol.     ii,

   It is well known that Laplace assumed that the modulus of com
pressibility of rock varies as the square of the density.       Since this
modulus is wdp/dw, Laplace's hypothesis makes xs proportional to w,
and the equation (8) is at once soluble.
   After the determination of to as a function of a, the solution of      all
the other equations follows.
   In this  paper  I propose to find a new solution, and to compare the
results with those of Laplace.
   In order to simplify the analysis let the unit of length be equal
to the mean radius a of the planet, and the unit of time be such that
the surface density to of the plant is also unity.
   Now let us assume that the law of internal density is —
                                  w=a~"                                 (9).
   Then the mean density of all the matter lying inside of the stratum
a is a~"l(l — %n).    Hence, by definition we have —
                                  k=l-in                               (10).
   Thus we see that & is a constant for all strata, and therefore also
for the surface. In Laplace's theory k is variable. With our assumed
law of density and the special units, p the mean density is equal to
the reciprocal of /;.
   It is clear that n must be positive, otherwise heavier strata lie
above lighter, and it must be less than 3 in order to avoid infinite
mass at the centre of the planet.
   Now let us find the law connecting pressure and density, and the
modulus of compressibility.
   Equation (7) becomes

    Integrating this, with the condition that the pressure vanishes at
the surface, we have,

    The case of n—    is interesting ; it gives a constant modulus of
                              1
compressibility equal to 2tt, and the law of pressure p=2tt log w.
  If O be less than unity the compressibility, or reciprocal of the
modulus, increases with the density, which is of course physically
improbable.    If n be greater than unity and less than 3, the com
pressibility becomes less the greater the density.   The assumed law
probably does not give such good results as those of Laplace, because
the decrease of compressibility with      increasing   density is not
sufficiently rapid.
  The range of n=3 to                     n=l     gives the results which possess most
physical interest.
   In comparing results with those of Laplace there will be occasion
to express the modulus as a length ; that is to say, we are to find the
length of a column of unit section whose weight (referred to the
surface       gravity of the planet) is equal to the force specified in the
modulus.

  In Laplace's theory poz (w3— 1), and the modulus of compressibility oc to3. In
the present theory the modulus o< to*.
  The value It = -667 corresponds to constant compressibility, and it = -333 to
gaseous compressibility.
   One of the grounds on which Laplace's solution is held to be satis
factory is that if we take the value of ce, as determined by the known
angular velocity and mean density of the earth, and the value of t as
determined by geodesy, and find the value of     the ratio of surface to fe,
mean density, which corresponds with the ratio ce/t, this same value
of      found to give a proper value to the coefficient of —        so as
      it

to obtain the observed precessional constant.  To be more precise, m
is found to be 1/289-66, which gives cb=1/231-7, and has been found              t
to be approximately 1/295.    These give ee/e=l-273, and this corre
sponds with ft=l/2-06="49.      This value of with the same values      6,
of   and m, gives the precessional constant as "0033, and Leverrier
     t
and Serret give its value as -00327.
     Now  appears remarkable that almost as good a correspondence
             it
isobtainable from my solution.   The value ce/t=l-273 corresponds
with fe=-675, and when fe=-675 the coefficient of t— \m in the pre
cessional constant               is   T99, which gives the same precessional constant
•0033.
     This value of           corresponds very nearly with constant modulus of

    It is claimed in favour of the Laplacian hypothesis that it corre
 sponds to a surface density which is nearly a half of the mean
density of the earth, and that we know that average rock has a den
sity of about 2"8.        Also it is pointed out in Thomson and Tait's
 " Natural                 " that the
              Philosophy                length modulus of compressibility
of the surface rock is about l/4-4 of the earth's radius, which is
very nearly the observed length modulus of iron.
    These conditions are not well satisfied by the present solution, for
 the surface density is found to be "675, or 1/1/48 of the mean density
of the planet, whence the specific gravity at the surface is 3" 7; and the
length modulus at the surface is equal to the planet's radius.       It is to
be admitted that this density is large, and that the substance is also
 highly incompressible.
    Thus in these respects the Laplacian hypothesis has the advantage.
It seems to me, however, that too much stress should not be laid on
 these arguments.      We know nothing of the materials of the earth,
excepting    for a  mile or two in thickness from the surface, hence it is
not safe to argue confidently as to the degree of compressibility of
the interior.     T here seems reason to believe that there is a deficiency
in density under great mountain ranges, and this would agree with
the hypothesis that our continents are a mere intumescence of the
surface layers.
   According to this view we might expect to find a rather sudden
change in density within a few miles of the surface.           Now in any
theory of the earth's density such a sudden change in the thin shell
on the surface could not be taken into account, and the numerical
value for the surface density should be taken from below the intu-
mescent layer if it exists. Hence it is not uureasonable to say that a
solution of the problem, which gives a higher surface density than
that of rock, lies near the truth.     I do not maintain that my solution
is as likely as that of Laplace, but it is not to be condemned at once
because it does not satisfy these conditions as to the density and com
pressibility of rock.
   The two cases which are given at the foot of the above table each
possess an interest, the first of constant compressibility,       because it
corresponds with the case of the earth, and the second of modulus of
compressibility varying as the density, because this is the gaseous
law.
    With constant compressibility the internal ellipticity varies as the
•562 power of a, or nearly as the square root of the radius; with
gaseous compressibility it varies as the l-562 power of a, or nearly as
th e square root of the cube as the radius.
    A numerical comparison of the case of constant compressibility
w ith Laplace's solution for lt=£ gives the following results : —

   Thus the Laplacian solution attributes much higher ellipticity to
the internal strata.      The solution with constant compressibility in
fact gives so large a proportion of the mass in the central region, that
attraction has a greater influence compared with rotation, than in the
solution of Laplace.
   [P.S. — If, as is not improbable, the increase of density in the interior
of the earth is due rather to the heavier materials falling down to the
centre than to great pressure compressing the material until it has a
high density, then the determination of a modulus of compressibility
would be fallacious, and it would be more logical to leave the
expressions for the pressure and the density both as functions of the
radius,  without proceeding to eliminate the radius and to form an
expression for the modulus of compressibility.       I  owe this suggestion
to a conversation with Sir William Thomson.       — December 19, 1883 ]

 pering, upon the magnetic capacity of sixty varieties of iron and steel,
 ranging from the softest Swedish iron to the hardest tempered cast
 steel.
    We know already that soft iron will take          a  higher   degree of tempo
rary magnetism than steel, and that tempered steel retains magnetism
more than soft iron ; consequently, we might believe that by the aid
of an instrument which should give correct measurements, we might
be able to include all varieties of iron and steel between the two
extremes of softness, as in annealed iron, and hardness, as in high-
tempered cast steel. This proved, however, not to be the case, if the
iron and steel were not all annealed to one absolute standard, and if
magnetised to or near saturation.
    In a late paper upon the theory of magnetism,t said : —    I

magnetism, viz., that not only can the molecules be rotated through
any degree of arc to its maximum, or saturation, but that, whilst it
requires a comparatively strong force to overcome its rigidity or
resistance to rotation, it has a small field of its own through which it
 can move with excessive freedom, trembling, vibrating, or rotating

through a small     degree  with infinitely   less  force than would be
required to rotate it permanently on either side. This property is so
marked and general that we can observe it without any special iron
or apparatus."
   In  order to observe this in electro-magnets, we must employ an
extremely feeble current, such as from one Daniell cell, with an
exterior resistance of from 10 to 1,000 ohms, and we then find the
following laws hold with every variety of iron and steel : —
   1st. That its magnetic capacity is directly as its softness or mole
cular freedom.
   2nd. That its resistance to a feeble external magnetising     force  is
directly as its hardness, or its molecular rigidity.
   This has proved to be the case upon sixty varieties of iron and
steel furnished me direct from the manufacturers, and it was remarked
that each variety of iron or steel has a certain point, beyond which
annealing cannot soften, nor temper harden ; consequently, if all
varieties were equally and perfectly annealed, each variety would have
its own magnetic capacity ; or, its specific degree of value when
perfectly annealed or tempered, by means of which, we could at once
determine its place and quality.
   If in place of several varieties we take a single specimen, say hard-
drawn Swedish iron wire, and note its magnetic capacity, we find that
its value rises rapidly with each partial annealing, until an ultimate
softness is obtained ; being the limit of its molecular freedom.      We
are thus enabled to study the best methods of annealing, and to find
at once the degree of softness in an unknown specimen.          A similar
effect occurs in observations upon tempering ; from the softest to the
hardest temper, until we arrive at its ultimate molecular rigidity.
   We have thus in each piece of iron or steel a limit of softness and
hardness.    In soft Swedish iron tempering hardens but 25 per cent.,
whilst mechanical compression (such as hammering) hardens it 50 per
cent.    In cast steel tempering hardens it 400 per cent., whilst
mechanical compression gives but 50 per cent. Between cast steel and
Swedish iron we find a long series of mild steel and hard iron,
varying in their proportionate degree between the two extremes
mentioned.

   In order to carry out these researches, constructed an instrument
which 1 have called the magnetic balance. It consists of a delicate
silk fibre suspended magnetic needle, 5 centims. in length, its pointer
resting near au index having a single fine black line or mark for its
zero, the movement of the needle on either side of zero being limited
to 5 millims. by means of two ivory stops, or projections.     When the
north end of the needle and its index zero are north, the needle rests
at its index zero, but the slightest external influence, such as a piece
of iron 1 millini. in diameter 10 centims. distant, deflects the needle

 to the  right or left according to the polarity of its magnetism, and
 with a force proportional to its power. If we place on the opposite
 side of the needle at the same distance a wire possessing similar
 polarity and force, the two are equal, and the needle returns to zero,
 and if we know the magnetic value required to produce a balance we
 know the -value of both. In order to balance any wire or piece of
 iron placed in a position east and west, a magnetic compensator is
 used, consisting    of a powerful bar magnet free to revolve upon a
 central pivot, placed at a distance of 30 or more centims., so as to be
 able to obtain delicate observations.     This turns upon an index, the
 degrees of which are marked for equal degrees of magnetic action
 upon the needle.
    A coil of insulated wire, through which a feeble electric current is
 passing, magnetises the piece of iron under observation, but as the coil
 itself would act upon the needle, this is balanced by an equal and
 opposing coil on the opposite side, and we are thus enabled to observe
 the magnetism due to the iron alone. A reversing key, resistance coils,
 and a Daniell cell are required. Great care must be taken so that the
 electromotive force remains a constant, as a small variation in the
 electromotive   force gives large variations in the readings, and many
 important   details  of construction are required, in order that it shall
 give perfect readings for extremely small magnetic force.            Still
 greater care is required that each specimen of iron or steel shall be
 annealed to its maximum.
    Several methods of observation        have been employed with the
 magnetic    balance,  the usual one being the one described, but inte
 resting results are attained by observing the influence of earth's
 magnetism alone on the iron or steel, or we may magnetise all speci
mens to the same value, and note the amount of current required.
We may observe the remaining magnetism after the cessation of the
current or the influence of a weak current after the passage of a
strong magnetising force. These are more applicable to researches
upon the cause of magnetism.
    By meanB of this instrument      I have tested sixty varieties of iron
and steel, mostly in the form of wires, a wire 1 millim. diameter,
10 centims. long, being the standard used.       In all comparative expe
riments we require one standard form, to which all the rest must be
similar in form and size; at present, we cannot readily compare a
square or flat bar with a piece of wire, but if all pieces have the same
form, and all are annealed to the same standard, then any difference
observed between them must be due to their comparative softness,
from which we can deduce its quality and place on the line from soft
iron to cast steel.
    Annealing not only produces softness and consequent molecular
freedom, but it entirely frees it from all strains previously introduced

by drawing or hammering.    Thus a bar of iron drawn or hammered
has a peculiar strncture, say a fibrous one, which gives a greater
mechanical strength in one direction than another.       This bar,
if thoroughly annealed at high temperatures, becomes homogeneous,
and has no longer even traces of its previous strains, provided that
there has been no actual mechanical separation into a distinct series
of fibres.

  From the above table, we notice that a regular increase of softness
occurs, as the temperature at which it is annealed increases, the
maximum being at a point under that of fusion.
  Numerous    methods of annealing were tried, the highest results
being obtained when the iron or steel was heated as rapidly as
possible to a high temperature, and cooled in a nentral surrounding or
atmosphere.    The facts regarding annealing as pointed out by the
measurement of the magnetic capacity of iron, have, no doubt, been in
great measure perceived by ordinary mechanical methods ; the results
of my own researches may be thus formulated : —
   1. The highest degree of softness in any variety of iron or steel is
that obtained by a rapid heating to the highest temperature less than
fusion.
   2. The time of gradual cooling required varies directly as the
amount of carbon in alloy.
  Thus in chemical pare iron rapid cooling, as in tempering, would
not harden     it,
               whilst steel might require several days, even for pieces
only   1millim. diameter. Slow cooling has no injurious effect upon
pure iron when cooled in a neutral surrounding, consequently where
time    no object, we may employ slow cooling in every case.

   A wire or piece of iron, thoroughly annealed, must not be bent,
stretched, hammered, or filed, as the hardening effects of   bend area
most remarkable, and the mere cleaning of its surface by sand paper
hardens its surface several degrees.

   The above series contains representative irons and steel of all
classes, all other varieties yet tried stand between cast steel and Swedish
iron, generally classed as hard cast steel, hard steel, mild steel, hard
paddled iron, soft iron, Swedish charcoal iron.
   From the above table it will be seen that every wire rises greatly in
value by annealing, and that we could not estimate the true magnetic
capacity of any iron or steel unless special attention was given that all
should be annealed to their maximum.
   The influence of tempering upon the magnetic reteutivity or
molecular rigidity has been shown in every piece of iron or steel
examined, the molecular rigidity of tempered cast steel being pro
portional to its species of temper as shown in Table III.

   Table   IV  gives the complete results of the mechanical, chemical,
and physical tests upon a series of wires furnished by Messrs. Fre
derick Smith and Co., of Halifax.
   The tensile strength and electric conductivity are those furnished
me by Messrs. Smith and Co.         The chemical analyses by Mr. Heury
S. Bell, of Sheffield, the magnetic capacity of the bright hard drawn,
annealed, and tempered wires, were determined by myself by the aid
of the magnetic balance.
   In the above Table IV there is a complete relation between electric
conductivity and magnetic capacity, both progressing in a similar
ratio and agreeing in a most remarkable manner.
   We see here that the electric conductivity and magnetic capacity
have a complete relation to each other, but while in every wire
measured     I have found this true, it is only so when the wire has been
completely annealed and free from mechanical strain, and a feeble
magnetic force employed, thus the relation exists only in the limited
sphere of elastic rotation already mentioned.
    I believe the relation here shown between electric conductivity and
magnetic capacity to be of theoretical importance and of practical
utility, as we at once find not only the electric conductivity of iron
and steel    from a simple reading of their magnetic capacity, but also
the   iron most suitable for the cores of electro-magnets.
 II. " Report on the Circumpolar Expedition to Fort Kae."               By
        Captain H. P. Dawson, R.A. Communicated by Professor
        G. (x. Stokes, Sec. R.S. Received December 12, 1883.
    On the 14th   April, 1882,  I was  informed   that I  was appointed to
 the command of the Circumpolar Expedition.          I at once proceeded to
 London, and was occupied until the day of sailing in practice with the
 magnetic instruments at the Kew Observatory, and the purchase of
 stores, Ac., for the expedition.
    On the 1st May, Sergeant F. W. Cooksley, Royal Horse Artillery,
 and Gunner C. S. Wedenby, Royal Artillery, and on the 6th May
 Sergeant Instructor of Gunnery J. English, R.H.A.. reported them
 selves to me, and commenced attendance at Kew for instruction.
                             Journey to Fort liae.
    We sailed from Liverpool on the 11th May, and arrived at Quebec
 on the 23rd. Here I spent some days finding that the steamer for the
 north did not leave Winnipeg till the 10th June, and my party was

  174                          Capt. H. P. Dawson.                      Pec.   20,
  very kindly afforded quarters in the citadel by Lientenant-Colonel
  Cotton, commanding the Canadian Artillery at that place.
      Having obtained a free pass for oar baggage on the Grand Trunk
  Railway,     I started at once for Winnipeg, proceeding by the lakes,
 that being the cheaper route, and the one which on the whole exposed
  the instruments to the least knocking about.
      We reached Winnipeg on the 9th Jnne, and left on the following
 day by the Saskatchewan steamer.              On the 26th June we reached
 Carlton, where it was necessary to engage carts to take our baggage
 to Green Lake, a distance of 140 miles.
      On the 29th the carts were taken across the river, and on the 30th
 we started for Green Lake, which we reached on the 9th July,
 having been delayed by the extreme badness of the road.                      The
 heat of the weather rendered a long halt necessary in the middle of
 the day, and the flies also prevented our animals from feeding pro
perly, incapacitating them for long marches or fast work, and on
 one occasion forcing us to halt for a whole day, the oxen being so
worried by them as to be unable to march.
     At Green Lake we entered upon the system of water communica
tion that forms the only roadway in the north, and by way of Portage
la Loche and the Clearwater and Athabasca rivers we reached Fort
 Chipewyan on the 30th July.             Here we had to await the Macken-ie
River boats, there being no other means of reaching Fort Rae, and
it was not until the 17th August that we were able to start on this
last stage of our journey.           We reached Great Slave Lake on the
22nd, on the evening of which day a gale arose which stove in and
sunk our boat, damaging most of our provisions.                 Fortunately we
were able to repair the boat, but it was not until the 25th that the
weather allowed us to proceed, and on the 27th we were again detained
by a fresh storm, so that it was not until 10 p.m. on the 30th August,
that we arrived at Fort Rae.
                                      Fort Rae.
     Fort Rae is situated in lat. 62° 38' 52" N., and long.     115° 43' 50"  W.,
at the south-west extremity of a peninsula that juts out from the
north-east shore of a long gulf extending in a north-westerly direc
tion more than 100 miles from the northern shore of the Great Slave
Lake.       It is almost entirely surrounded by water, as shown in the
annexed plan.* The formation is limestone. The land rises to a height
of some 200 feet, and is covered in part with moss, in part with pines
and scanty brushwood.          A  few vegetables are grown    in the summer in

 the garden attached to the Roman Catholic Mission, but for food the
inhabitants chiefly depend upon the produce of the nets, and on deer,
 which are brought in by the Indian hunters attached to the post.
   On arrival it was found that the magnetic instruments required a
good deal of setting to rights, their boxes being tilled with water and
 the fittings loosened, so that not a single instrument was quite in
working order. There was, moreover, no building ready for their
reception, so that it was not possible to keep the 31st August —
1st September as a term day, but we succeeded in getting the
meteorological instruments into position so as to commence observa
tions with them at midnight on the 31st.
   We were fortunate in finding a building that admitted of con
version into a magnetic observatory, it only requiring a floor, fire
place, door and windows to be habitable.         This work was at once
commenced, and on the 3rd September the declinometer, on the 4th
the bifilar, and on the 6th the vertical force magnetometer were
mounted in their places. This observatory was finished on the 10th
September, and another one commenced for astronomical and absolute
magnetic observations, the continual wind rendering out-door obser
vations unsatisfactory.
   The men of my party were accommodated in the house of one of
the sub-officers  of the fort, and   I had a room in the house of the
Hudson's Bay Company's officer in charge.
   The instruments, on the whole, suffered but little from the journey.
One   barometer and one thermometer were broken, and the object
glasses of the telescopes of most of the magnetic instruments were
nearly opaque, the cement joining the two lenses having from some
cause or other melted on the journey.        Our provisions were more
damaged, 190 lbs. sugar, 30 lbs. of tea, all our rice, and most of our
baking powder having been destroyed.
   The observations were then carried on without interruption until
the 31st August, 1883.
                          Magnetic Observations.
   The balance magnetometer       was the only magnetic instrument
whose performance    was  not satisfactory, as not only did it frequently
get out of adjustment, but in times of magnetic disturbance it often
vibrated through so large an arc that exact reading was im
possible. The other instruments were remarkably free from vibration,
and there was never any difficulty in reading them, but it was found
necessary to extend the scale of the bifilar on the side of decreasing
force, owing to the great movements of this instrument.
   The greatest magnetic disturbance was on the 17th, 18th, and 19th
November, 1882, when all the instruments moved at times beyond the

176                       Capt. H.   P. Dawson.                      [Dec. 20,

between the extreme easterly and westerly positions of the declino
meter magnet exceeded 10°.
                                Aurora.                          •
   Aurora was observed on almost every clear night, and was usually
attended by more or less magnetic disturbance.  It did not appear to
me, however, that the two phenomena stood in the relation of cause
and effect, but rather that they were both due to a common cause.
The most marked instance of connexion between the two phenomena
consisted in a rapid decrease in both vertical and horizontal magnetic
forces which attended a sudden outburst of aurora in the zenith. This
was observed on several occasions.    The bifilar almost always shewed
a reduction of horizontal force during a display of aurora.        I also
think that the declinometer magnet tended to point towards the
brightest part of the aurora, but I have not yet had time to make
that careful comparison of the auroral and magnetic observations
which will be required to decide this point.    It was found impossible
to obtain photographs either of the aurora or of its spectrum — the
latter invariably presented the characteristic yellowish-green line, and
occasionally but rarely several other bright lines were visible for a
few moments towards the violet end of the spectrum, and once a
bright band was seen in the red.
   1 was also unsuccessful   in my attempts to measure the height of
the aurora, chiefly from the want of a well-defined point to measure
to, also from the fact that some hours were required to prepare for
this observation, whereas the appearance of a suitable aurora could
not be predicted, and was, in fact, not of frequent occurrence, and
then often only lasting a few seconds.       For this observation two
stations some miles apart should be connected by telegraph and
occupied for many days, or even weeks in succession.
   Although  I  paid attention to the point,   I never heard any sound
from the aurora, save on the occasion mentioned in a former memo
randum, but I made many inquiries on the subject from residents in
the country, both English and French, and their statements agree so
well, both with one another and with what I myself heard, that am         I
forced to conclude that the aurora is at times audible, and that on
these occasions it appears to be, and probably            is,
                                                           very near the
earth.
                      Meteorological Observations.
  With regard to the meteorological       observations,     the station
                                                                    was
somewhat unfavourably placed for observations of wind, on account
of the hill to the north-east, but as winds from this quarter were rare
the effect on the results will not be great, especially as one of the

  1883.]       On  the Circumpolar Expedition     to Fort Rae.       177
 anemometers     was on an island    in the lake, in an entirely open
 situation.
    The anemometers did not work quite satisfactorily, being at times
 choked by ice ; but I hope by the comparison of the two satisfactory
 results may be attained.
    The wind was usually either South-east or North-west ; and even
 when it blew from the former quarter, the motion of the upper clouds
 often showed the existence of a North-westerly current.
    The hair hygrometers were found to be useless out of doors in cold
weather, on account of the formation of ice on the hair.
    The earth thermometers were read every alternate day : the obser
 vations were interrupted by a carcajou, or other animal, which
 extracted the thermometers from their tube for the sake of the fur in
 which it had been found necessary to envelope them, and broke them all ;
 other thermometers were, however, substituted, and the observations
 continued.    It was found impossible to obtain the temperature of the
 soil at a greater depth than four feet on account of the rocky nature
 of the ground.
    A series of observations of terrestrial radiation was made by means
of a thermometer placed on the surface of the suow, but the almost
continual wind detracts much from the value of these readings.
    I was told by the residents of the country that the year was an
unusually dry one, and certainly the rainfall is remarkably small;
they also said that the winter was particularly mild and free from
storms, which, from all accounts, and from the journals kept at the
fort, seem to be both frequent and severe; as it was, we only expe
rienced one, in February.
   A plan is annexed, showing the position of the meteorological
instruments, and their relative heights.
                         Astronomical Ohservations.
    My first determination    of the longitude was made by means of
lunar distances,   and time  was found by the method of equal altitudes,
but after the observatory was finished both these points were deter
mined by transits, and the first value of the longitude found to be
more than a minute in error.      The latitude was determined by transit
observations    in the prime vertical, and is probably within a few
seconds of the truth. The longitude may be ten seconds in error.
The time was generally correct to within three or four seconds.
    A more solidly constructed transit instrument would have been
desirable, as it was found that in the cold weather it required so
much force to move the telescope of the transit theodolite on its axis,
that there was great risk of disturbing the adjustments of this instru
ment, composed as it is of so many parts.

                                Food,   fyc.
   Our supply of provisions proved quite sufficient.        I had brought
enough flour to admit of my issuing the usual ration of £ lb. per
diem, and tobacco 1 lb. per month to each man.             We also had a
Bupply  of Chollet's preserved vegetables,   and a reserve  stock of bacon,
besides tea and sugar.    Of the latter we were somewhat short, owing
to the loss sustained on the journey up. We usually had fresh meat
throughout the winter ; in the summer we were occasionally reduced
to dried meat. During the journey there and back we chiefly lived
on pemmican.      The Rev. Pere Roure, of the Roman Catholic Mission,
most kindly furnished us with fresh vegetables and potatoes through
out the summer.
   The conduct of the men under my command was everything that
could be desired.    They took great interest in the observations, and
did their best to carry them out with accuracy and punctuality, and
were always contented and cheerful, in spite of the inevitable dis
comforts of their winter quarters and the occasional hardships of the
journey.
                             Return  J ourney.
   We were running great risk of being overtaken by the winter, and
therefore lost no time in our departure.
   The last hourly observation was made at midnight on the
31st August, 1883, after which the instruments      were dismounted and
packed, their  cases  having been  previously  arranged   in readiness out
side the observatory.     The remainder of the baggage was already in
the boat, so that by 2.30 a.m. on the 1st September we were en
route, and reached Fort Chipewyan on the 17th September, and
Portage la Loche on the 4th October, having experienced some delay
in surmounting the rapids of the Clearwater, the hard frosts having
frozen all the small tributary streams, thus considerably lowering the
water in the river.
   The boat awaiting ns on the south Bide of the portage was frozen
in, but fortunately the wind changed and the ice broke up before our
arrival. Had it been otherwise we must have waited until the rivers
were thoroughly frozen, and travelling with dog trains possible.         In
that case we should have been compelled to abandon our instruments
and baggage.
   On the 21st we reached       Carlton on the      Saskatchewan,    where
we were detained      a day, the man engaged to transport our bag
gage across the prairie having refused to proceed. Another man
was engaged, and on the 31st October we reached the railway at
Qu'Appelle, arriving at Winnipeg the following day. We were fortu
nate in crossing the prairie with so little difficulty, as at the same
time Inst year  it was covered with three feet of snow.

III. "On     the Changes in the Gland-Cells of Dioncea muxcipula
       during Secretion."       By Walter Gardiner, B.A., Scholar
      of Clare College, Cambridge.            Communicated by W. T.
      Thiselton-Dter, C.M.G., F.R.S. Received December 18,
       1883.
   The following observations were made upon leaves of Dioncea mus
cipula which had been fed with the bodies of wood-lice, from which
the chitinous coat had been previously removed.            The leaves were
then placed in absolute alcohol.
   It is well known that shortly after the application of animal matter
the leaves close, and may remain shut for a period varying usually
from ten to twelve days, when they open spontaneously.               When,
however, the leaf is not vigorous or when the amount of animal
matter is somewhat large, the leaf may not open at all, but remain
closed until its death.
   There appear to be four periods which attend the phenomenon of
digestion in such a leaf, viz., the resting, the secretory, and the absorp
tive periods, and the period of recovery.         These periods are fairly
well defined in Dioncea on account of the slowness with which they
proceed.
   In the resting state the gland cells (fig. 1) exhibit the following
structure: — In each cell, the protoplasm closely surrounds the cell-
wall, leaving one large central vacuole, which is filled with the usual
pink cell-sap.     The protoplasm is extremely granular, especially
around the nucleus, which is, in consequence, almost entirely obscured
from view.     The nucleus is situated at the base of the cell, and is
shown by reagents to be large and well-defined.
                                    Fig. L
   At the end of the secreting        period, which appears to be about
twenty-four    hours  after  stimulation,   the following changes have
occurred (fig. 2).   Movements of the protoplasm have taken place, in
consequence of which the nucleus now occupies the centre of the cell ;
numerous strands of protoplasm radiate from the nucleus to the
parietal protoplasm of the cell, in consequence of which several

1883.]     Changes in the Gland-Cells      o/Dionsea muscipula.       181
vacuoles, instead of one large one, are present.     The protoplasm now
exhibits bat little granularity, and may be described as clear and
hyaline.    The nucleus is clearly brought into view, and appears to
have undergone a very considerable diminution in size.
                                   Fio. 2.
   Passing to the phenomena of the ordinary leaf tissue, it may be
remarked that definite special cell-contents make their appearance after
the absorption   of the digested food.
   Sections of leaves which were placed in alcohol thirty-six hours
after feeding, show that the cells contain a very large number of tufts
of crystals, which are present in the cell-vacaole and adhere to the
inner surface of the cell-protoplasm.       The tufts are formed of fine
acicular crystals which crystallise ont with great regularity and radiate
from a central point.    The tufts are of a yellow-green colour. They
are insoluble in alcohol, in 1 per cent. acetic acid, and in 1 per cent.
hydrochloric acid ; and soluble with difficulty in 5 per cent. solution
of potash.    The formation of these crystals may be artificially pro
duced by wetting the surface of a fresh leaf with the fluid from a leaf
which has fed for a period of from thirty-six to forty-eight hours.
   After forty-eight hours the cell-contents are of a different nature.
The cells now contain numerous bodies which present the appearance
of flat sphaero-crystals. They are usually perfectly circular in outline,
and are clear and colourless.       They are insoluble in alcohol but
extremely soluble in water.
   In Drosera the changes take place much more rapidly, the pheno
menon of digestion usually extending over a period of from three to
five days.    The gland-cells in the resting state were seen to be much
more  granular before, than after secretion. In consequence of absorp
tion the cells contain a large quantity of a substance which is precipi
tated in dense granules by alcohol, but is readily soluble in water. The
author has not yet worked out Drosera in detail.

IV. "   On the Continuity of the Protoplasm through the Walls of
      Vegetable Cells." By Walter Gardiner, B.A., Scholar
      of Clare College, Cambridge.           Communicated by W. T.
      Thiselton-Dyer, C.M.6., F.R.S. Received December 13,
      1883.
   Since the communications of November 11th, 1882, and April 16th,
1883, the author has been chiefly employed in testing and improving
his methods, and adding to the number of plants in which he has
been able to demonstrate the existence of a continuity of the proto
plasm   between    adjacent  cells.   In  certain  endosperm   cells, e.g.,
Bentinckia Conda-panna, where the protoplasmic thieads traversing
the cell walls are particularly well developed, it is possible to see the
threads perfectly clearly by merely cutting sections of the endosperm,
and mounting them in dilute glycerine.          Taking the structure dis
played by such a preparation as normal, the author has compared it
with the preparations obtained after the action of Chlor. Zinc. Iod.
and sulphuric acid.    He finds that his method of swelling with Chlor.
Zinc. Iod., and staining with Picric-Hoffmann Blue, is in every way
perfectly satisfactory, since but little alteration of the structure
occurs, and the staining with the Picric-Hoffmann Blue is limited to
protoplasm.     The sulphuric acid method is in the main unsatis
factory, althongh it is valuable in the case of thin-walled tissue,
where violent swelling must be resorted to ; and it is also valuable as
affording most conclusive evidence of the existence of a protoplasmic
continuity in those cases where the protoplasmic processes of pits cling
to the pit-closing membrane.        He believes, however, that the results
obtained can only be rightly interpreted in the light of the results
obtained with Chlor. Zinc. Iod. The possibility of seeing the threads
depends upon their degree of tenuity and upon the thickness of the pit-
closing membrane, and in extreme cases and in what are by far the more
general cases, the only evidence of such perforating threads is afforded
by the general staining of the pit-closing membrane.          Every tran
sition between clearly defined threads in the substance of the closing
membrane and the mere staining of that structure as a whole occurs.
   The author has found that in all pitted tissue a pit-closing mem
brane, which is made evident by staining thin sections with iodine
and mounting in Chlor. Zinc. Tod., is uniformly present, and that open
pits do not occur.   The continuity of the protoplasm is always esta
blished by means of fine threads arranged in a sieve-structure, and
not by means of comparatively large processes which the occurrence
of open pits would necessitate. He cannot therefore agree with ob
servers whose statements necessitate the existence of such open pits.
   Since the last communication the author has been able to observe

  1883.]          Note on  the Constitution   of Chlorophyll.            183
 that a continuity of the protoplasm between adjacent cells occurs in
 Dioncea muscipula, being especially pronounced in the most central
 layers of parenchymatous cells.
     The parenchyma cells of the petioles of certain plants which, as
 H. von Mohl showed, are often thick walled              and   conspicuously
 pitted,   afforded  favourable  material   for investigation.    In Aueuba
japonica, and Prurms lauro-cerasus, distinct threads could be made out
 crossing the pit-closing membrane. In Ilex aquifolium there was a
 doubtful striation, and in the rest examined a mere coloration of the
 pit-membrane.
     Examples of continuity have thus been shown to exist in ordinary
 parenchymatous tissue ; and this materially strengthens the belief that
 the phenomenon of the connexion of cells with one another is one of
 universal occurrence.
     As to the function of the filaments, the author believes that in
 sieve- tubes and in endosperm-cells they may make possible a trans
  ference of solid materials, besides establishing a protoplasmic com
 munication; but in ordinary cells the only significance of the threads
 is, that by their means the protoplasm of isolated cells becomes con
 nected, and that thus the communication of impulses from one part
 of the plant to another is insured.
     Finally, the presence of these minute perforations      of the cell-wall
 need not lead to any modification of our general            ideas as to the
 mechanics of the cell.
 V. "Note on the Constitution of Chlorophyll." By Edward
             Schunck, F.R.S. Received December 6, 1883.
     An examination of    some  products derived from chlorophyll, which
 has occupied     me for some time, has led to the question of the true
 nature and constitution of chlorophyll, a question on which widely
 different opinions prevail.      Without entering into matters which
 concern the physiologist only, it may be said that to the chemist
chlorophyll is simply an organic colouring-matter, the substance to
which the green colour of leaves and other parts of plants is due.
Now colouring-matters are of three kinds. To the first class belong
such as occur ready formed and in a free state in vegetable and animal
organisms, such as the colouring-matters of turmeric and saflflower.
The second class comprises those that are formed from colourless
chromogens by the combined action of alkalis and oxygen, the
colouring-matters of log-wood and archil being well-known examples
 of this class. These colouring-matters change rapidly when exposed
 to the further action of oxygen in the presence of alkali, but are quite

stable when in contact with acids.           The third class consists of
glucosides,   bodies  which  do  not  undergo any considerable change
under the influence of alkalis, but are rapidly decomposed when acted
on by acids or ferments, yielding, on the one hand, some kind of
glucose, and, on the other, substances in which the tinctorial pro
perties of the parent substance are much more pronounced.             To this
division belong the colouring- matters of madder, quercitron, cochineal,
Ac.    Now chlorophyll in its general properties so much resembles
the members of the last class that one cannot help suspecting that to
this class it may belong — that it is in fact a glucoside.    It shows con
siderable stability in the presence of alkalis, but acids decompose it
rapidly, giving rise to substances which are intensely coloured and
show a power of absorbing particular parts of the spectrum much
more strongly than chlorophyll itself.     Whether, along with the latter
bodies, it yields by decomposition with acids some kind of glucose,
seemed to me a question worthy of attention.
    If it was possible to obtain chlorophyll in a state of purity, it
would be veiy easy to settle this question ; unfortunately all attempts
hitherto made to separate and purify chlorophyll have ended in its
decomposition.     I consider it as certain that the so-called crystallised
chlorophyll which has been described by several authors is in fact a
 derivative of chlorophyll formed during the process employed for
preparing it. It is, however, very easy to obtain a solution of chloro
phyll which shall be quite free from everything soluble in water
extracted at the same time from the plant, and therefore free from
ready-formed glucose.      In order to effect this, I proceed as follows : —
Having extracted leaves of any kind with boiling alcohol,        I  allow the
extract to stand for some time, filter off the deposit which usually
forms, and then mix it with its own volume of ether and with about
two volumes of water, shaking up well. The liquid now separates
into two layers, an upper green one, containing all the chlorophyll
of the extract, and a lower bright yellow one, which contains tannin,
a yellow colouring-matter,     a substance giving the glucose reaction
with Fehling's solution, and probably other substances besides. The
two liquids are separated in the nsual way, and the uppor one is
shaken up with fresh water, which now usually only shows a trace of
colour.    This process of washing may be repeated, adding each time
a little fresh ether, until the lower layer ceases to give the glucose
reaction. The upper liquid leaves on spontaneous evaporation a bright
 green residue, which, though far from being pure chlorophyll, is free
from everything soluble in water, and may therefore be employed to
 determine whether anything soluble in water, such as glucose, is
 formed by the action of acids on it. If some of the residue be
treated with concentrated sulphuric acid in the cold it dissolves,
 forming a green solution, which, after standing for some time, gives,

ou the  addition of water, a dark green precipitate.     This precipitate
consists essentially of two substances, the phyllocyanin and phyllo-
xanthin of Fremy, which are undoubtedly          products derived from
chlorophyll, showing the absorption     bands  of  what is usually called
"acid chlorophyll."     The liquid filtered from this precipitate, when
mixed with copper sulphate and an excess of canstic alkali, becomes
blue, and the mixture, on boiling, deposits cuprous oxide.           The
experiment may be made in a slightly different manner.               Tho
residue left by the green ethereal solution of chlorophyll having been
dissolved in alcohol, sulphuric or hydrochloric acid is added to the
solution, which is then boiled for some time, evaporated so far as to
drive off most of the alcohol, filtered from the products insoluble in
water, made alkaline, then mixed with Fehling's solution and boiled,
when the usual glucose reaction takes place. In order to make sure
that the reaction was not due to ready-formed glucose,       I
                                                       took in every
case the precaution of testing a portion of the green chlorophyllic
residue with Fehling's solution before acting on the rest with acid.
This was easily done by treating with weak alcohol, to which a little
alcoholic potash and some Fehling's solution were added, and heating,
when the whole dissolved easily, giving a green solution, which, on
boiling, in no case deposited the least trace of cuprous oxide, whereas,
after adding an excess of hydrochloric acid to the liquid, boiling,
filtering off the insoluble products, again making alkaline and boiling,
the glucose reaction took place in a marked manner.
   This experiment has never in any case failed, and it would follow,
if uniformly successful, that the green leaves of all plants contain a
glucoside insoluble in water, but soluble in alcohol and ether.    That
this glucoside  is,  in fact, chlorophyll seems to me highly probable.
Nevertheless, absolute certainty cannot be attained, because the matter
experimented on   is  mixture, and
                      a              it  possible that one plant out of
                                          is
many might give a decidedly negative result, which would upset tho
conclusion drawn from the rest. Assuming, however, that the pheno
mena will always occur as above described, and that the reaction with
Fehling's solution indicates the presence of some kind of glucose,          it
would follow either that chlorophyll   isglucoside, or that
                                          a                      it

accompanied in the vegetable cell by a glucoside of very similar pro
perties.

 I. " On the Transfer of Energy in fhe Electromagnetic Field."
       By J. H. Poynting, M.A., late Fellow of Trinity College,
       Cambridge, Professor of Physics, Mason College, Birming
       ham.    Communicated by Lord RAYLEIGH, M.A., D.C.L.,
       F.R.S. Received December 17, 1883.
                                 (Abstract.)
    A  space containing electric currents may be regarded as a field
 where energy is transformed at certain points into the electric and
 magnetic kinds by means of batteries, dynamos, thermoelectric
 actions, and so on, while in other parts of the field this energy is again
 transformed into heat,. work done by electromagnetic forces, or any
 form of energy yielded by currents.       Formerly a current was regarded
 as something    travelling along a conductor, attention being chiefly
 directed to the conductor, and the energy which appeared at any part
 of the circuit, if considered at all, was supposed to be conveyed
 thither through the conductor by the current.          But the existence of
  induced currents and of electromagnetic actions at a distance from a
  primary circuit from which they draw their energy, have led us,
  under the guidance of Faraday and Maxwell, to look upon the medium
  surrounding the conductor as playing a very important part in the
  development of the phenomena.          If we believe in the continuity of
  the motion of energy, that is, if we believe that when it disappears at
  one point and reappears at another, it must have passed through the
 intervening space, we are forced to conclude that the surronnding
 medium contains at least a part of the energy, and that it is capable
 of transferring it from point to point.
     Upon this basis Maxwell has investigated what energy is contained

1884.]            Some Experiments on Metallic Reflection.              187
in the medium, and he has given expressions which assign to each
part of the field a quantity of energy depending on the electromotive
and magnetic intensities, and on the nature of the matter at that part
in regard to its specific inductive capacity and magnetic permeability.
These expressions account, as far as we know, for the whole energy.
According to Maxwell's theory currents consist essentially in a certain
distribution of energy in and around a conductor, accompanied by
transformation and consequent movement of energy through the field.
     Starting with Maxwell's theory we are naturally led to consider the
problem, how does the energy about an electric current pass from
point to point ; that is, by what paths and according to what law does
it travel from the part of the circuit where it is first recognisable as
electric and magnetic to the parts where it is changed into heat or
other forms.
     The aim of this paper is to prove that there is a general law for
the transfer of energy according to which it moves at any point per
pendicularly to the plane containing the lines. of electric and magnetic
 force, and that the amount crossing unit of area per second of this
 plane is equal to the product of the two intensities multiplied by the
 sine of the angle between them divided by 4nr, while the direction of
 flow of energy is that in which a right-handed screw would move if
 turned round from the positive direction of the electromotive to the
 positive direction of the magnetic intensity. After the investigation
 of the general law several applications are: given to show how the
 energy moves in the neighbourhood           of various    current-bearing
 circuits.

         Sir John Conroy, Bart., M.A. Communicated by Professor

     In  a paper which Professor Stokes did me the honour of communi

 vol. -66, p. 26,  I gave an account of some experiments    I had made on
 the amount of light reflected by polished        metallic   surfaces  when
 ordinary uupolarised light was incident upon them.
     The light of a paratliue lamp fell either directly, or after reflection
 from the metallic surface, on a photometer, and the readings were
 made by altering the distance at which another similar lamp had
 to be placed from the photometer in order to produce an equal
  illumination.

known as the " Sciopticon
                                  "
                                      being used) was substituted for the
paraffine lamp carried by the goniometer.             It was fixed on a wood
stage   fastened    to a  stout board    about  80   centims.   long; a screw,
which passed through the board near one end and was fixed in a
table, formed an axis about which the board could rotate            ; the gonio
meter was fixed to the board with its centre vertically over the axis
of rotation.
   A black card, with a slit 54 millims. by 4 millims., was placed in
the slide-holder of the lantern, and a Nicol in the collimator tube of
the goniometer, and the image of the slit focussed on the paper of
the photometer.
   The metal plates were clamped to the vertical stage, and their
adjustment examined by placing a second, or analysing, Nicol in the
path of the reflected light and crossing the Nicols, the former being
placed with its principal section either in or perpendicular to the
plane of incidence, and adjusting the stage screws till the light re
flected from the plate was completely extinguished.
   The experiments were made in the manner described in the former
paper, the light being polarised in, or perpendicularly to, the plane of
incidence by the Nicol. It was found that the illumination of the paper
varied with the position of the Nicol, being always greatest when the
light which fell on the paper was polarised in the plane of incidence.
   Table   I   gives a series of observations made with the steel plate
with light polarised in the plane of incidence.            The numbers in the
first column are the distances,     in  centimetres,   of the sliding lamp from
the photometer when the light from the lantern fell directly on the
paper; and those in the third when the light was reflected by the
mirror. The means of these observations are contained in the second
and fourth columns, the angles of incidence in the fifth, and the
ratios of the reflected to the incident light — the latter being taken as
100 — in the sixth column.
   As the intensity of light varies inversely as the square of the dis
tance from the source, the percentage reflected by the plate is obtained
by dividing the numbers contained in the second column by those in
the fourth, squaring, and multiplying by 100.
   Table   II   gives a similar series of measurement s with the same
plate  and   light polarised perpendicularly to the plane of incidence.
   Three other similar series of observations were made, the actual
determinations being about as concordant as those contained in the
tables.   The four sets of observations, and their means, are given in
Tables   III and   IV.

    In addition to the actual numerical differences between the values,
the two sets of observations appear to differ fundamentally, for whilst
the numbers in the second and fifth columns diminish slightly, and
then increase again, as the angle of incidence increases, those in the
third and sixth increase with the angle, a result that, as was pointed
out in the former paper, is not in accordance with either theory, or
previous observations, and which, as was stated in the paper, if
erroneous,      must have been caused by some defect in tbe method
employed, and therefore common to all the determinations.
    Further consideration showed that such was really the case, and
that the defect in the method was the one pointed out by Professor
Stokes in the note appended by him to the paper (" Proc. Roy. Soc,"
vol. 35, p. 39).      As has already been stated, the apparent brightness
of the paper varied with the polarisation of the incident light, or, in
other words, the amount of light irregularly reflected, or diffused, by
the paper was different for light polarised in, or perpendicularly to,
the plane of incidence.          The light being incident upon the paper at
an angle of about 30°, whilst the line of sight formed an angle of

about 60° with        the normal, no regularly reflected light could reach
the observer.
    The terminal      faces of the polarising Nicol were perpendicular to its
long diameter,        and   it was of a nearly circular section, so that the
amount of light       transmitted by the Nicol must have been very nearly,
if  not absolutely, the same in both positions.
    Table IX gives observations made to determine the amount of
illumination in both cases, the numbers in the first column being the
distances at which the sliding lamp had to be placed when the light
was polarised in the plane of incidence, and those in the second, when
it was polarised in a plane at right angles to this; each determination
being the mean of four observations.

    Calling the light diffused by the paper when the incident light was
polarised in the plane of incidence 10i), it would appear that when the
light was polarised perpendicularly to that plane only about 63 per
cent, of the light reached the observer.
    Tho very considerable difference in the amount of light diffused in
the two cases seems the more remarkable, as previous to the publica
tion of the former paper the illuminated surfaces of the photometer
were examined with a bi-quartz, and although they showed traces
of polarisation it was only, apparently at least, to a very inconsiderable
extent.
    This experiment has been recently repeated, and with the same
result   ; the lamp light diffused by the paper of the photometer
showing hardly any, if any, traces of polarisation, whilst that reflected
obliquely from the blackened surface of the board along which the
lamp was arranged to slide, when examined in the same way, was seen
to be strongly polarised.*
   •
      [Of the light falling on the paper, a considerable part would be reflected at
various depths before it had lost, through the various irregular reflections and
refractions, all traces of its original polarisation, and consequently light derived from
that which was originally polarised in the plane of incidence would be more
copiously reflected than light derived from that which had been polarised in a per
pendicular plane.     But the light so reflected would have to make its way among
the fibres of the paper, especially as the angle of emergence was considerable, and
in so doing would be pretty well depolarised by the irregular reflections and
refractions which it would have to undergo. This accounts for the circumstance

   Owing to the nnequal reflection of light polarised in and perpen
dicularly to the plane of incidence, the experimental results contained
in the paper published in the "Proc. Koy. Soc." vol. 35, p. 26,
cannot be the true values of the amount of light reflected by the
mirrors.
   The lamp light which was incident upon the mirrors, being equivalent
to two beams         of half its intensity polarised in and perpendicularly to
the plane of       incidence,   and light polarised in and perpendicularly to
this plane being unequally diffused by the paper, as well as unequally
reflected by the mirrors, the observed intensity must, as Professor
            ^

with     polarised light, and the value of r from the measurements

different      incidences    were calculated out,* and the numbers thus
obtained       are given in the fourth and seventh columns of Table
VIII.
   In the case of the steel mirror the observed and calculated numbers
agree      tolerably, as well, perhaps, as could have been expected,
recollecting the nature of the determinations, but with the speculum
metal mirror the results are discordant, the calculated results being
in all cases too low.           The observations with uupolarised          light were
made immediately            after the mirror had been polished,             whilst an
interval of several months             elapsed before those with polarised light
were finished.         Although the mirror was kept in a dry warm room,
and in a closed case containing lime, its surface was usually found to
be covered with a slight film ; this was readily removed by rubbing it
gently for a few seconds with a piece of wash-leather, and the surface
then appeared perfectly bright.
   After the conclusion of the experiments with polarised light, the
photometer was rearranged in its original form, and three observations
were made        of the amount of uupolarised light reflected by the mirror
at an    angle of 30° in order to ascertain whether the reflective power
that the illumination    was so different that was produced by light polarised in    the
two ways, even though the polarisation of the light coming from the paper was
Tery feeble when the light incident was common light.         I overlooked this when    I
proposed      (" Proc. Roy. Soc.," vol. 35, p. 39) to measure r by measuring the
polarisation of the Tight coming in this case from the paper, and regarded r as only
" a little "
              greater than J on the strength of the author's assurance that the polari
sation was so slight. — Ot. Or. 3.]

    The mean of these three observations agrees very fairly with the
 value deduced from the observations with polarised light, and it
therefore seems probable that the diSerences between the numbers
 contained in the sixth and seventh columns of Table                VIII    are due to
 an alteration in the surface of the mirror, analogous possibly to the
surface changes that Seebeck found with freshly polished transparent
bodies.
    The values obtained for the principal incidence, and principal
azimuth, with the freshly polished mirror, and with the same mirror
at the conclusion of the experiments with polarised light, differ bXt
little from each other, as is shown in Table VII. The first four
observations with the speculum metal mirror were made at the end of
the experiments, and their means 75° 35' and 33° 12' agree very
closely with the means of the last two observations 75° 29' and 32° 57'
made with the freshly polished mirror.
    The amount of light which, according to Cauchy's theory, ought to
have been reflected by the mirrors was calculated out by the
formulae —

   As far   as the general character        of the phenomena the agreement is
 complete and in accordance with the observations of M. Jamin, but
the actual values of the observed intensities always fall short of
the calculated intensities, the difference being least with the steel
 mirror.
   The probable errors of the values of the principal incidences and
azimuths having been ascertained, the theoretical intensities of the
light reflected at an angle of 30° were calculated for the two values
obtained by adding and subtracting these sums from the means.
The probable errors       of the photometric measurements for the same
angle were      also determined, and Table          XII  gives the values thus
obtained.

   These   numbers     seem      to show that the differences between the
calcnlated and observed        results  are not merely due to errors of obser
vation, a conclusion that is rendered the more probable by the fact
that the difference is always in the same direction.
   The polish of the mirrors was examined at the end of the experi
ments by the method suggested by Professor            Stokes, and described       in

198            On the Volcanic   Eruption in Sunda Strait.       [Jan. 10,
the paper already referred to ; both the mirrors stood the test
satisfactorily, the polish of the steel being very slightly the best.
   These experiments appear to show that the generally received
formulae for metallic reflection are approximately correct, but that the
actual intensity of the reflected light is always less than the theoretical
intensity, and that therefore, unless this be due to defects in the
metallic surfaces, the formulae do not completely express the laws of
metallic reflection.   If, as appears to be the case, a change in the
reflective power of a plate can occur without any change in the values
of the principal incidence and azimuth, it is necessary to regard the
formulae as only approximately true, and there is additional reason for
thinking that, as Professor Stokes has suggested, three constants are
required to define a metal optically.
   I hope hereafter to determine the amount of light reflected by films
of silver chemically deposited on glass, and also to make some
determinations of the amount of radiant energy reflected by metallic
surfaces at various angles, the experiments of MM. de la Prevostaye
and Desains on this point having been but few in number.

   * * * On the 18th instant I entered Sunda Strait, passing east of
Thwart-way Island. This island had been reported to be split by the
eruption into several portions.    This is incorrect.
   The island is intersected by low valleys in several places, these
being covered with tall trees did not show so prominently formerly'
as they do now.      The whole of the vegetation having been swept
away by    the tidal wave the island at a short distance off is apparently
divided, the low necks joining the higher portions being only visible
on close approach.
   The surface of the Strait in this neighbourhood is covered with
extensive fields of floating pumice stone, often in one to two foot
cubes, through which the ship easily forced her way.
   I inclose sketches which   I trust will convey the general appearance
better than a written description.     The whole of the neighbourhood
is covered with greenish-yellow mud, and all traces of vegetation
are everywhere destroyed.

him that the changes are considerably more extensive          than was at
first thought, and that Verlaten Island is still in a state   of activity as
well as Krakatoa itself.
    From observation he thinks that another eruption is impending, but
that Verlaten Island will be the centre of disturbance.

    The two new islands are low mud and pumice banks, their con
figuration is continually altering, and     I was informed that they are
gradually subsiding.
    It is still  impossible  to examine Lam pong Bay, but the pumice
stone is now beginning to float out.
    The light on Fourth Point (Java) has been temporarily replaced by
one of the 6th order, visible five miles, but beside this there are no
signs of life on the Java shore. The whole coast is covered with the

all lies a thick incrustation of volcanic mud.

 fierce south-westerly   gale, apparently local, was experienced.

     Sunday, 26th August. — Left the roadstead, Batavia, at 8.10 a.m.,
 and steered through the inside channel.         At 9.30 a.m., steering be
 tween the islands Great Kombuis (or Lantjang) and Pulo Lakki (or
  Mometer     or Cannibal Island), sighted the Kombuis red buoy due
 north, while at 10 a.m. the white Cannibal buoy lay due south.
 Rounded Point St. Nicholas, and taking our bearings from the land
 proceeded through Sunda Strait to the roadstead of Anjer, where we

     At Anjer we took on board    111 passengers, coolies and women bound
 for Sibogha, and left Anjer roadstead again at 2.45 p.m., and taking
 our bearings from the land we ran past Pulo Soengjan, or " Right in

 English mile to the west of as. Were steering then N.W. ^ N. (time
 bearing).       At 6.15 p.m. the southernmost of the Chandon Islands was
 bearing north-east.
     Laid the course next for the roadstead of Telok Betong, which we
 reached at 7.30 p.m., and where we anchored in six fathoms of water
 with thirty fathoms shackle outside the hawse-pipe.
     From    6  o'clock we had rain of ashes and small bits of stone, and
 there was a stiff breeze from the N.W. and W.N.W.
     Monday, August 27th. — Finding that at midnight on the evening of
 our arrival there was still no boat come off to us from the shore, and
as the weather was now much calmer,                 I sent the first mate in the gig
 with a crew of six men to find out what was the reason of this.
 About 1 a.m. he returned, and stated that it had been impossible to
 land on account of the heavy current and surf ; also that the harbour
pier-head stood partly under water.
     The Government steamer "Berouw," which lay anchored near the
pier-head, hailed the mate as he was returning on board, and the
people on board her then stated to him that it was impossible to land
anywhere, and that a boat which had put off from the shore had
already been wrecked.             That by 6 p.m. on Sunday evening it had
already begun to be stormy, and that the stormy weather had been
accompanied by a current which swept round and round (apparently a
sort of whirlpool).          When the mate had come on board, we resolved
to await daylight before taking any further steps ; however, for the
sake of security, we steamed several ships' lengths outwards, because
the sound of a ship's bell which seemed to be approaching us made us
snspect that the ship must be adrift, and wishing therefore to avoid
a    collision we re-anchored           in   nine   fathoms with thirty fathoms
shackle outside the hawse-pipe.                We kept the ordinary sea-watch,
and afterwards heard nothing more of the bell.                   When day broke, it
appeared to us to be still a matter of danger to send a boat ashore;
and we also discovered that a revenue cutter was foul of a sailing-
vessel which lay in the roadstead, and that the " Berouw
                                                                           "
                                                                              lay very
close in shore. Later we found that the "Berouw" was stranded.
However, owing to the violent winds and currents, we did not dare to
send a boat to her assistance.
    About     7 p.m.   we saw some very high seas, presumably an upheaval
of    the sea, approaching us up the roadstead.                   These seas poured
themselves out upon the shore and flowed inland, so that we presumed
that the inhabitants who dwelt near the shore must be drowned.                      The
lighthouse       was  altogether     carried   away,   and  the "Berouw" then lay
high upon the shore among the cocoanut trees.* Also the revenue

cutter lay aground, and some native boats which had been lying in the
neighbourhood at anchor were no more to be seen.
    Since it was very dangerous to stay where we were, and since if wc
stayed we could render no assistance, we concluded to proceed to
Anjer under steam, and there to give information of what had taken
place, weighed anchor at 7.30 a.m., and             following the direction of the
lay steered thereupon southwards.                 At 10 a.m. we were obliged to
come to anchor in the bay in 15 fathoms of water because the ash
rain kept continually growing thicker and thicker, and pumice-stone
;ilso began to be rained, of which some pieces were several inches
thick. The air grew steadily darker and darker, and at 10.30 a.m. we
were in total darkness, just the same as on a very dark night.                    The
wind was from the westward, and began to increase till it reached the
force of a hurricane.           So we let down both anchors and kept the
screw turning slowly at half speed in order to ride over the terribly
high seas* which kept suddenly striking us presumably in consequence
of a "sea quake," and made us dread being buried under them.
    Awnings and curtains from forward right up to the mainmast, three-
boat covers, and the uppermost awning of the quarter deck were blown
away    in a moment.       Some objects on deck which had been lashed got
loose   and   were carried       overboard ; the upper deck hatchways and
i hose on the main deck were closed tightly, and the passengers for
the most       part were sent below. Heavy storms. The lightning
struck the mainmast conductor six or seven times, but did no damage.
The rain of pumice-stones changed to a violent mud rain, and this
mud    rain was so heavy that in the space of ten minutes the laud lay
half a foot deep.
    Kept steaming with the head of the ship as far as possible seawards
for half an hour when the sea began to abate, and at noon the wind
dropped away entirely.           Then we stopped the engine. The darkness
however remained as before, as did also the mud rain. The barometer
at that time stood again at 763-25 millims. Sounded the pumps.                      No
water.     Let the crew and also such passengers as were on deck work at
throwing the mud overboard.               At 2 p.m. the barometer was 763"30.
The mud rain changed into a light ash rain.
    The darkness remained the same until the following morning at
4 A.M.     At daybreak began to get the chain clear and weigh the
anchor; got under steam at 6.30 a.m.; made out then Tims Island,
bearing S. by "W., and Pulo Soengal Island, bearing S.W.                            W.
Held on our course for Pulo Tiga Island and fell in with much ash
and   drift-wood.
    When we got about two English miles off Pulo Tiga, it appeared
that a connexion had been formed between the islands just mentioned

stretching to Seboekoe Island, and thence to the mainland. Whether
this connexion was formed out of solid ground or only ont of pumice-
stone and trunks of trees is not known. What is certain is, that at
the distance at which we then lay, it looked exceedingly like solid
ground, and so we thereupon turned back in order to look for another
passage.    The very same phenomenon as had revealed itself near
Pulo Tiga was discovered also between Tims Island, Seboekoe, and
Pulo Soenchal, and we, therefore, resolved to make our way out
through the Strait of Lagoendie.      This channel we found relatively
clear, that is, in comparison with the other part of the bay. Having
got outside we discovered that here also we were entirely shut in ; so
steamed very slowly, stopping every now and then close by the
so-called layer, and made it out at last to be floating pumice-stone,
through noticing that the layer was heaved up and down by the
motion of the surf.
  Now steamed somewhat faster, and when we got into the middle of
the layer before referred to found it to be 7 or 8 feet thick. It took
us ten minutes to get clear of   and then we held our course south of

Krakatau, the serang* being in the fore-yard, a man on the look out
forward, and the captain and first mate on the bridge.
  Wednesday,  August 28th, 1883. — As we steamed past Krakatau we
noticed that the middle of the island had disappeared, and that no
smoke was to be seen in any direction.  However, when we got east
of Krakatauf we discovered that between that island and Sebisie reef        a
had formed, and that various craters planted on that reef were now
and then sending columns of smoke on high.        As we neared the
coast of  Java we observed that here, too, everything had been laid
desolate.
  We also perceived that the lighthouse on Java's Fourth Point was
entirely washed away     ;   nothing remaining except       a   stump some feet
high.
  At    4o'clock reached Anjer roadstead, and although there was
nothing more to be seen of the place itself the captain and the first
engineer went ashore to learn what information was to be obtained.
   Ashore we met the Resident of Bantam, and concluded to return
straight on board in order to convey his Honour to the roadstead of
Bantam, and this because the Resident assured us that       was of very
                                                                    it
great importance in the public interest that such should be done.
   We left Anjer Roads at 10 minutes to        o'clock, steamed round
                                                   5
St. Nicholas' Point, and went on taking our bearings for the Island of
Pulo Pundjang, and steering into Bantam Bay.

pat him on board a ship which lay in the roads there, and after having
done    this at 7.30 we got under steam again and made for Kroe

   The telegraph buoys in the neighbourhood of Anjer may possibly           .
have been somewhat shifted, but they were found not to have been
carried away.
   The town of Tjiringen (Java) ha- been destroyed.
   At Anjer, besides many natives who are supposed to have perished,
the Assistant Resident, the harbour master, and nearly all the other
Europeans were destroyed.
   The lighthouses at Java     First Point and Flat Cape (Sumatra) are
still standing.
   At Padang from the afternoon of the 26th of August for the suc
ceeding twenty-four hours re-echoing sounds made themselves heard
like the noise of distant and heavy cannonading.
   The air now and then was red-coloured, while during the afternoon
of the 27th thirteen bores or tidal waves rushed up the harbour, the
third and highest of these waves rising to about ^\th of a metre
below the crown of the quay on which the harbour master's office
stands.
   The   strength of these waves varied for the most part between that
of   a  four-mile and of a six-mile current, but the third wave was
estimated to be running at a speed of about tw-lve miles.
   Beginning at 12.50 p.m. they recurred at intervals till nearly mid
night.     The average pause between the flow and the ebb of these
waves was about four seconds.
    It will be seen from the foregoing that three lighthouses are known
to have been destroyed, vi-., the harbour lights at Anjer and Teluk
 Betong, which were small, and the big lighthouse on Java Fourth
 Point.
    It is worthy  of note also that on the morning of the 27th of August
                                                           " Devonhurst,"
 before  daybreak the master of the British steam-ship
 which was then off the North Coast of Acheen steering for Olehleh,
 was woke by a shock which led him to think that the steamer had
 stranded.
    He rushed on deck to learn what had happened, but found his
 vessel  in deep water in her usual course.
    One or two superstitious ideas which revealed themselves among
 the  native population in consequence of the disaster are not unworthy

rain* which covered the masts, rigging, and ducks, was phosphorescent,
and on the rigging presented the appearance of St. Elmo's fire. The
natives engaged themselves busily in putting this phosphorescent light
out with their hands, and were so intent on this occupation that the
stokers left the engine-rooms for this purpose, so that the European
engineers were left to drive the machinery for themselves.                     The
natives pleaded that if this phosphorescent light, or any portion of it,
found its way below a hole would burst in the ship : not that they
feared the ship taking fire, but they thought the light was the work
of evil spirits, and that if the ill-omened light fonnd its way below
the evil spirits would triumph in their design to scuttle the ship.
    Recent telegrams from the scene of the disaster describe the native
population as hostile, and inclined to attribute the catastrophe to the
vengeance of heaven pursuing the Dutch for their conduct in Acheen.
Such Europeans as escaped the eruption are now reported to be in
danger of being murdered by the natives.
    These accounts are, however, possibly exaggerated.                The Dutch
officials make light of them, and deny that there is any ground for
political disquietude.
    Krakatau Island before the eruption was 822 metres high.
    Pulo Bessi, the neighbouring island, was 849 metres high.
    The earthquake waves which deluged Anjer and the neighbouring
coasts were two in number ; the second was higher than the first, but
 the first was reckoned to have baea 13 feet high when it touched the
land.
    There was an hour's interval between these two waves.
    The shock of these waves (or of one of them) drove the ships and
 the dry-dock in Ourust Island, near Batavia, from their anchorage.
    The earthquake wave was still as much as 6 feet high when it
 struck the shore at a place called Sembilangan Laoet, more than
 2  English miles to the eastward of Batavia, and there it killed                 at
 least seven people.
    At Tjiringen, on the        Sunda Straits, the earthquake waves are
 reckoned to have killed 10,000 people, and it is also known that these
 waves have flooded the coasts further southward, as far as Paniem-
 bang river, in Pepper Bay (how much further has not yet been ascer
 tained).     To the eastward a reference to the map will show that the
  promontory ending in St. Nicholas Point, and which shelters Bantam
  Bay, is mountainous, containing two peaks, 640 and 634 metres high
 respectively.
     Hence, as far as   I  can gather from the recent reports, the earth
  quake waves appear not to have done much damage to Bantam Bay,

direction south, and to have struck Tanara, a town near the coast on
the river which separates the provinces of Serang and Batavia.        In
the  Tanara district 704 corpses have already been found.     The wave
did immense damage at Kramat, a coast village about 2 miles east
ward of Tanara, and killed many people there. It struck the land on
the east side of the bay in which Batavia lays with a column of water,
which was still 6 feet high; and somewhere about this district the
force of the flood seems, as far as is at present known, to have
expended itself.
   The first eruption on Krakatan Island took place about the 23rd of
last May, and continued at intervals for a day or two.         It is not
without interest to note that Captain Gibson, commanding the steair-
          " Crocodile," on its way to Australia, was, on August 2lst,
dredger
in latitude 7° 30' S. and longitude 90° 30' E. There he found his
vessel amid great quantities of floating pumice-stone, some of which he
brought on board and has preserved.       He attributed the presence of
this pumice-stone to some volcanic eruption, which he supposed had
taken place among the Eastern islands.
   The current at that time was setting westward, at the rate of about
a knot and a half per hour.    There were barnacles and shells on some
of the pumice-stone, showing that it must have been for some time in
the water.    Most probably this was the debris from the May eruptions
on  Krakatan.
   There may possibly be questions connected with the migration of
animal or vegetable life, or with the duration and drift of oceanic
currents on which the above incident may have an important bearing,
or perhaps would have if it were possible to trace what ultimately

                        Plasticity and Viscosity of Strata.
  During our experiments we have often been struck by the evident
plasticity of strata whose form at times becomes modified when they
meet with an obstacle or are influenced by other causes, as, for
example, the crossing of other strata produced by a separate dis
charge ;* and we have stated in Part IV of our researches that " one
cannot but be impressed from this (an experiment therein spoken of)
and others before, t and herein described, by the apparent plasticity of
the aggregate     assemblage of molecules which constitute a stratum."
In all probability    the molecules are being continuously thrown off
and are replaced by others which become controlled and held in
position by the same balance of forces as those they replace.
   One of our tubes, No. 9, with a residual hydrogen vacuum, has a
diaphragm in the centre             \
                            of an inch, 0-63 centim., thick, through
the centre of which there is a hole                     \
                                       of an inch, 0 63 centim., in
diameter.  To the end of the tube is attached a potash absorption
chamber, the heating and cooling of which causes a change iu the
number of strata ; when the number of strata increases they approach
closer and closer to the diaphragm, and occasionally one threads itself
through    it,
            as    squeezed through, and its form
                 if                                 gradually changed    is
thereby;   when by      change in the temperature of the absorption

chamber, the number of strata becomes less, the stratum which had
been forced through the hole in the diaphragm returns through     its                        it,
form becoming modified to enable it to do so.

       Stokes, Sec. R.S. Received September 30, and Decem

   In 1863 Deville and Troost announced their discovery that certain
metals were permeable by hydrogen at a red heat.                This discovery,
as is well known, was verified by Graham, who made extended
researches on the subject.
    About three years ago      it occurred to the author that          a red-hot
platinum plate, through which hydrogen was passing, might be made
to serve as an element of a galvanic combination, and early in 1881
some experiments were tried with this object.
   These were continued from time to time up to the present, and in
this paper it is proposed to give some account of the experiments and
their results.    The subject appears to the author          to require much
more extended researches in several directions than          he has been able
to make, but it is hoped that by giving an account          of the researches
hitherto made, the points which require further             investigation will
suggest themselves to physicists and chemists.         ,
    In the earlier experiments the author constructed            small tubes of
 platinum foil. These were sealed       up at one end by the oxyhydrogen
 blowpipe,   and to the open ends        glass tubes were fused. Platinum
 conducting wires were fastened to      the tubes. By means of the glass
 tubes gases could be conveyed           to   the interior   of   the platinum
 tubes.
    A platinum crucible was used as the other element of the cell, it
 had a platinum conducting wire attached, and was supported over a
 Bunsen burner.       A small platinum foil tube was then held in the
 centre of the crucible, and the cell was completed by putting the
 transmitting medium into the crucible.         After unsuccessful trials with
 alkaline nitrates,  4c, glacial phosphoric acid was       selected.    Some of

1884.]       On a New Method     of   Generating     Electricity.    209
this substance was put into the crucible and fused so as to nearly
immerse the platinum foil tube.
   On connecting the two wires with a galvanometer no deflection was
observed when the crucible and contents were heated to redness in the
oxidising flame of the Bunsen burner.  When, however, hydrogen gas
was supplied to the inner platinum tube, an immediate production of
electricity was perceived.    The tube of platinum foil containing
hydrogen was seen to correspond       to the zinc element in an ordinary
galvanic cell.
  This experiment being verified other substances were tried instead
of phosphoric acid.
   Sulphuric acid nearly at its boiling point gave a slight current.
   Chloride of sodium in the fused state gave a very good result.
Then the chlorides of potassium, calcium, and the alkaline earth
metals were tried with similar results.
   As might be expected the production of electricity increased with
the temperature.
   It was, however, soon found that the production of the current was
stopped if the flame of the Bunsen burner did not ensure perfect
combustion on the exterior of the platinum crucible.
   Experiments showed that if a reducing flame was applied to the
crucible while the small tube contained air, then a current of electricity
in the reverse direction was obtained.
   Tubes of palladium foil substituted for the platinum tnbes gave
similar results.
   After a number of trials with tubes of platinum foil, an apparatus
was constructed of two platinum tubes closed at one end.
   The inner tube was 4 inches long and          inch internal diameter,
                                               •§.
while the outer tube was 3f inches long, and       inch inside diameter.
                                                     §
The thickness of metal was        inch in both tubes.
   The two tubes when used for these experiments were arranged
upright in a small Fletcher's gas furnace, the inner tube being
supported at any desired height in the centre of the larger tube and
connected with a supply of hydrogen.
  Numerous experiments were made with this apparatus.                 The
temperature   could be easily regulated from  a dull red heat to a white
heat, and various saline substances could be tried as media.
  The fused sulphates, carbonates, and nitrates were found to be
unsuitable for the production of the current.     The results obtained
with fused chlorides, &c, showed that the hydrogen not only passed
through the metal of the inner tube, but also through the fused saline
medium and then through the outer platinum tube.
  In recent experiments with this apparatus       appears that when
                                                     it                 a
good transmitting substance      used between the tubes, and when
                                is
about 3*3 square inches of the inner tube are in contact with the

medium, the amount of hydrogen gas which passes through the metal
at a nearly white heat is about 07 cub. centim. per minute.            This
volume    of course  refers  to hydrogen   at ordinary temperatures.
   The use of this apparatus led to the discovery of a large number of
substances which would serve as media by allowing the transmission
of hydrogen.
   The list of saline bodies was extended to the bromides, iodides, and
fluorides of the alkaline and earth metals, but the most important
discovery in this direction was that vitreous bodies such as glass, and
even vitrified bodies as porcelain and earthenware, acted as media
when at a red heat.
   Attention was then directed to the      use of vitreous media for several
reasons.
   In experiments with fused saline bodies the       use of common    metals
was    precluded owing      to their   being corroded by fused salts, and
although iron is known to be permeable to hydrogen at a red heat,
yet its oxidisable qualities prevented any satisfactory results being
obtained when it was substituted for platinum.
   However, when vitreous matters were used instead of fused salts,        it
became possible to use other metals for these experiments.
   A  number of trials were made by taking tubes of fusible soda glass.
A   small tube of the metal to be tested was then placed inside the
glass, and while passing a slight current of coal-gas to prevent
oxidation of the metal, the glass was carefully fused on to the metal.
The external surface of the glass while soft was then coated with thin
platinum foil or with other metals.
    On connecting the inner and outer coatings with a galvanometer,
 passing hydrogen through the tube, and then heating it to redness, the
usual current of electricity was produced.
    The quantity of electricity generated both with these cells and with
 the platinum tubes was in proportion to the surface heated.
    The most powerful effects were obtained when the metallic coating
was in the pulverulent form.         Spongy platinum, for example, when
made to adhere closely to the glass gave a strong current with
              •
hydrogen.
    When using thin metallic plates in the interior of the tubes it was
found necessary to employ very thin platinum foil on the exterior, as
the hydrogen otherwise accumulated to some extent on the inner plate,
 thus spoiling the cell.
    A good result might often be got by painting the external surface of
 the glass with an alcoholic solution of platinic chloride, and then
igniting.     By this means a very thin film of metallic platinum was
 left on the glass, and by means of a spiral of platinum wire also put
 round the glass, sufficient conduction was obtained.
    As glass exerts only a slight action on metallic iron at a red heat,

1884.]       On a New Method       of Generating Electricity.          211
thin sheet iron (xms inch) was used in numerous experiments, but
this does not make a perfect arrangement when glass containing
alkali is used, as the alkali metal appears to be liberated at a very-
strong heat.
   A number of metals were tried either in the form of sheet or as a
powdery deposit.
   This latter form    might frequently be obtained by coating the
interior of the glass tube with the oxide of the metal to be tried, and
then reducing the metal by hydrogen or coal-gas upon the surface of
the glass.
   The following metals were tried and found to transmit hydrogen
and cause the production     of electricity : —
                    Platinum.             Molybdenum.
                    Palladium.            Copper.
                    Gold.                 Silver.
                    Iron.
                    Nickel.
   The relative transmitting powers were not, however, ascertained.
There can be little doubt that the property of transmitting hydrogen
at a red heat belongs to most, if not all, metallic bodies.
   In the course of the experiments it was observed that the glass
used was practically a non-conductor of electricity from one or two
galvanic cells when it was heated to redness in an oxidising flame.
   When, however, hydrogen was supplied          to the glass either inside
or outside   of the tube   it at once    became    a good conductor  of the
current.
   It was found necessary to avoid using glass containing metallic
oxides reducible by hydrogen, as these oxides by reacting upon the
hydrogen on the surface of the transmitting plate cause frothing of
the glass, thus destroying that absolute contact between the metal
and the glass which is required for the production of the electric
current.
   Experiments were made with tubes of Berlin porcelain, and satis
factory results were obtained. It was found convenient to cover the
surface of the tube both inside and out with melted glass and then to
carefully lay platinum foil upon the glass, so as to get as perfect an
adherence as possible.    It appears to be best to have a much thicker
metallic plate on the inner side -of the cell than on the outside. The
author has not determined the most advantageous conditions precisely
as yet.   Cells were also constructed of clay, containing a percentage
of glass, porcelain of various kinds, <fcc.
   The amount of hydrogen transmitted in a given time through the
arrangements described varies greatly according to the nature of the
medium and the nature of the metallic layer.

    With pulverulent metals and a medium of soft glass the rate of
transmission of hydrogen may be as high as 0 6 cub. centim. per
square inch per minute at a full red heat. With Berlin porcelain
tubes, however, the transmission does not usually exceed 0-2 cub.
 centim. per square inch per minute, even at a white heat, while at a
red heat the rate is much lower.           With platinum tubes of y-Jy inch
 thick the transmission       may    be from      0-l cub. centim. to 0-2 cub.
centim. per square inch according to the temperature.
    The electromotive force of the new cells varies according to the
media used, and this subject will of course require further investiga
tion.   It was found, however, that the platinum tube cell gave, with
borate of lime at a nearly white heat, an electromotive force=0-36 of
a Daniell, whilst a cell constructed of Berlin porcelain tube -jL. inch
thick gave an electromotive force=0"7 of a Daniell when worked at a
nearly white heat.
   Although many gaseous mixtures containing                  free hydrogen will
serve to produce the electrical      reactions, yet experiments with carbon
monoxide have given no similar result in conjunction either with iron
or platinum plates.
   In conclusion, the author has to thank Mr. S. A. Sadler, of Middles
brough, for having put at his disposal various facilities for prosecuting
his later experiments.

   Before describing further researches which the author has made on
the subject of electrical currents produced by hydrogen, it may be
well to mention that the galvanometer generally used in the experi
ments yet to be described, as well as in the former experiments with
metal tubes, &c, is one adapted for rather strong currents and it has
very slight resistance.      It has been graduated by means of a volta
meter.
   As these experiments must be regarded more as qualitative than
quantitative, it will perhaps be sufficient to give four points of deflec
tion with the corresponding liberation of hydrogen in a voltameter.

heated hydrogen may give rise to electrical currents under a variety of
circumstances.
    Small cells were made hy nearly covering short wires or rods of
metal with melted glass. The glass was then covered with platinum
foil and   the-. two metals were connected by wires with the galvano
meter. On heating a cell of this construction in an oxidising flame an
electrical current was almost invariably produced, due to the with
drawal of hydrogen from the inner wire or rod. When the current
diminished in force a reducing flame, containing free hydrogen, was
applied to the cell. This immediately caused an energetic reverse
current, accompanied by the re-absorption of hydrogen by the inner
metal.    Then with an oxidising flame the original effect could be pro
duced.    These results were obtained with wires of platinum, nickel,
iron, and copper. In working with cells of this description made with
iron rod, it was found that a current of electricity of long duration
could be produced by the oxidising flame.     This restdt appears to be
due to the continuous absorption of hydrogen liberated from aqueous
vapour by that portion of the iron which was not covered by glass.
   When the entire surface of the iron was covered by glass (with the
exception of the conducting wire, which was away from the heat) then
the deflection of the galvanometer gradually came to zero when the
cell was heated in an oxidising flame.
   Recently experiments have been made with a differently arranged
apparatus, as follows r—
   A platinum tube, 5^ inches long and 1 inch diameter, was set
upright in a Fletcher's gas furnace and nearly filled with a fusible
glass composed of the diborates of lime and magnesia. This apparatus
being heated to bright redness, a plate of platinum, 2 inches long and
0-6 inch wide, suspended by a platinum wire, was immersed in the
fluid glass.     The platinum tube and the plate being connected with
the galvanometer, the phenomena of alternate electric currents could
be produced with great facility by altering the nature of the flame in
the furnace.      When the platinum tube was surrounded with a visible
pale flame there was an electrical current from the tube to the plate
until the plate was apparently saturated with hydrogen.       When more
air was supplied to the furnace, so as to cause more perfect combus
tion, the needle of the galvanometer was violently reversed.        The
deflection produced on the galvanometer by either the " normal " or
" reverse " current was at first 18° or
                                         20°, and it fell to nearly zero
within ten or fifteen minutes.
   These effects could of course be repeated as often as required.
   It appears quite plain that the hydrogen in flames has a powerful
molecular or atomic action.
   If glass be fused in a large platinum crucible heated by flame as in
 a Fletcher's furnace, bubbles of hydrogen may be observed forming

214            On a New Method     of Generating Electricity.     [Jan. 17,
and rising from the sides       of the crucible,   especially at the hottest
parts.
   If a platinum tube like that used for the experiments with the
suspended plate be somewhat cooled while nearly full of melted glass,
so that the glass becomes very viscous, then by applying a flame con
taining free hydrogen to any spot on the lower part of the tube the
latter may easily be burst by the bubble of hydrogen which is formed
on the inside of the tube.
   Experiments have also been tried in which the hydrogen coming
through a cell was removed by means of a Sprengel pump.              One
experiment may     be described  : — A platinum tube 2f inches long and
| inch diameter, closed at one end, was soldered to a strong iron tube
and fixed vertically.   The platinum tube was immersed for 2\ inches
in fused glass  contained  in a platinum cell. This latter was 2£ inches
deep and 1 inch diameter.
   The two platinum tubes were connected by platinum wires with the
galvanometer, and the iron tube was connected with a Sprengel
pump.
   The cell being heated to bright redness in an oxidising flame, a
good vacuum was produced by the Sprengel pump. Then, while no
bubbles of gas came down the fall tube of the pump, the galvano
meter showed no deflection.
   The cell was then heated by a reducing flame.  The galvanometer
soon gave a steady deflection of 15°, and bubbles of hydrogen came
down the fall tube of the pump. The experiment was continued for
half     an hour, and   during fifteen minutes the hydrogen coming down
the fall tube was collected.  It measured 1'33 cub. centims.
   From occasional experiments with several vitreous mixtures the
conclusion formerly arrived at by the author regarding their electric
conductivity is confirmed, viz., that these fused vitreous matters do
not conduct electricity of low tension unless hydrogen bo present.
When working with large cells it         is,
                                         of course, difficult to avoid the
presence of hydrogen      the cell be heated by flame.
                          if
   It appeared desirable to try whether any hydrogen could be made
to pass through the walls of a porcelain tube either under the influence
of oxygen or by means of a vacuum.
   A glazed Berlin porcelain tube 20 inches long and inch diameter
                                                            \
was sealed up at one end and connected with     Sprengel pump.
                                                    a            The
closed end of the tube exposing      surface of
                                       a           square inches was

heated to whiteness in the gas furnace, but no hydrogen could be
drawn by the Sprengel pump when the porcelain tube was heated in
a reducing flame.
   After this the porcelain tube was filled with hydrogen, and the
same part as before was heated in an oxidising flame, but no loss of
hydrogen from the tube could be perceived during half an hour.

    Somewhat similar experiments have also     been made  with glass tubes
with    negative results.
    The author has also made a few          experiments  to  ascertain the
influence of a voltaic current in increasing or diminishing the flow of
hydrogen through the medium, but so much depends upon the struc
ture of the metallic surfaces in contact with the medium and their
relative sizes, as well as upon the electromotive force, &c, of the
battery used, that this subject would probably require somewhat
elaborate researches.
    The author, however, hopes to make further investigations into the
nature of the movements of hydrogen produced in vitreous matters
and in metals.
 II. " On    the Electrolysis of Dilute Sulphuric Acid and other
       Hydrated Salts." By J. H. Gladstone, Ph.D., F.R.S., and
       Alfred Tribe, Lecturer on Chemistry in Dulwich College.
       Received December 20, 1883.
    On the 1st of March last a communication was presented to the
 Royal Society by Professor Frankland, in which, among other things,
 the reactions we had described as taking place in the charging and
 discharging of secondary batteries were confirmed.           The author
 expressed   these reactions,   however, by formula  founded  on the elec
 trolysis, not of H2S04, but of hexabasic sulphuric acid, H6S06, in
 accordance with the views of Bourgoin.
    The point of difference is a small one, but it led us to look into the
 papers of Bourgoin, and to examine the evidence upon which his
 views were based.      The French chemist ("Ann. de Chimie," 1868)
 treats of the electrolysis of sulphuric acid merely as an illustration of
 his method for determining the composition of hydrated salts in
 solution generally.      This method consists in electrolysing a given
 solution in a divided cell, analysing the liquid in each compartment
 at the close of the experiment, and, in the case of dilute sulphuric
 acid, collecting the hydrogen set free.       In the case of a solution
 of sulphuric acid, of course, the positive compartment may be ex
 pected to increase in strength as a consequence of the electrolytic
 action, and the negative compartment to decrease in strength in the
 same degree.     Bourgoin calls the increase of the acid in the positive
 compartment «, and concludes that 2a represents the amount of sul
 phuric acid electrolysed.      This conclusion rests on the well-known
  theoretical views  of   Grotthuss, and, did his theory express all that
  goes on in the electrolytic process, the method would readily dis
  criminate between the actions represented by the following formulae :

  Bnt it was pointed out by          ReuRS, as   far back    as 1807,    that   when
electrolytic action occurs across a permeable diaphragm, a portion of
the liquid may travel from the positive to the negative compartment
of the compound cell by what is now called electrical endosmose.
Daniell and Miller (" Phil. Trans.," 1844) pointed out that in elec
trolytic action there was also an unequal transference of the ions. It
is evident that each of these actions must introduce additional terms
into the formula with which Bourgoin worked.          Moreover, Daniell
(" Phil. Trans.," 1839) investigated the electrolysis of sulphuric acid
of very different strengths by a similar method, and in a review of the
evidence (" Phil. Trans.," 1840) concluded that for each equivalent of
hydrogen liberated, the acid which passed across the diaphragm was
not more than one-fourth nor less than one-fifth of an equivalent.
Most of his experiments incline to the former.       Did 2a, therefore,
represent the amount of sulphuric acid electrolysed, it would appear
from his results that tetra-, and not hexa-, basic sulphuric acid was
decomposed by the current.       Again, Hittorf, in 1853 (vide Wiede
mann's " Electricity," vol.    ii,
                                p. 589), observed that for one equiva
lent of hydrogen liberated, the amount of sulphuric acid which was
found in the positive compartment varied, but not regularly, with the
strength of the acid.    These discrepancies, both of observation and
deduction, led us to make some experiments on the subject ourselves.
  The apparatus we employed consisted of       -shaped tube of about
                                                   a   \J
70 cub. centims. capacity, having    stop-cock in the centre of the
                                         a
horizontal part. The vertical parts of the apparatus were divided
into millimetres, and the hole in the stop-cock packed with               asbestos.

We found that the closeness of the packing could                      be    so nicely
adjusted    as scarcely to     allow mechanical admixture         of the fluids, on
the one hand, or electrical endosmose on the other.                 In our experi
ments we varied the current density, and, unlike Bourgoin ("Annales
de Pharmacie," vol. xv), found that the increase of sulphuric acid
in the positive compartment per equivalent of hydrogen set free
decreased along with the decrease in the current density.                        The
strength of acid was 4-2 per cent. The results are set out in the

    It  is necessary also to bear in mind the remarkable phenomenon
 called by the Germans "Wanderung der Ionen." Daniell long ago
 described an experiment in which he placed dilute sulphuric acid in
  the positive compartment and a solution of sulphate of copper in the
 negative.      He found that when 15"5 grs. of copper had been depo
 sited on the negative electrode there were 23 grs. of sulphuric acid in
  the same compartment.          Now, as 15"5 grs. of copper are equivalent
 to 24 grs. of sulphuric acid, and as Bourgoin's formula allows for the
 formation of only half an equivalent of sulphuric acid, that is 12 grs., it
 is evident that there was a considerable accumulation of that substance
 unaccounted for. In two similar experiments made with our apparatus,
 we obtained for 0-147 and 0125 grm. of deposited copper respectively
 0-209 and 0-180 grm. of free sulphuric acid.              The half equivalents
 would be 0*114 and 0-097 grm. respectively.             The excess of acid in
 all these cases is due to the " unequal transference of the ions." If
  both compartments had been filled with sulphuric acid, some similar
  transference would doubtless have taken place, in addition to what is
 expressed in Grotthuss' chain of decomposition.
     We conclude, therefore, from our own results, as well as from those
  of previous experimenters, that the method employed is incapable of
  determining whether it is H2S04 or some hydrate which yields to the
  current.

                                Copper Sulphate.
   A  careful    examination of the chemical changes which, accompany
the electrolysis of a solution of copper sulphate appeared, however,
capable of throwing additional light on the value of this electrolytic
method for ascertaining the composition of hydrates in aqueous
solution.     It is well known that water forms with CuSO^ a definite
hydrate, CuSO.t5H.20.         The anhydrous salt is white, the hydrate blue.
It is reasonable to suppose that the blue solution of this salt contains
molecules of this or of some higher hydrate.               Now, if in the electro
lytic process the water of hydration suffers decomposition along
with the CuS04, the primary chemical changes might be expected
to be —
                                           Positive pole.    Negative pole.
             (A.)    CuS045H20        =     SO^+O-            Cu + 5H3.
But,  if  the water of hydratioa takes no more part in the electrolysis
than the water of solution does, then the chemical changes would
manifestly    be —
                                            Positive pole.    Negative pole.
                 (B.)    CuS04        =        SOs +   0         Cu.
Of course the collateral action —
                                 Positive pole.
                                 =0

                          H*0                             Ha
might also take       place,  hut this would oocur only with currents of
considerable density.        The method is obviously capable of discrimin
ating between these two actions, even supposing a considerable
quantity of the electrolyte travelled unchanged fi<om one compart
ment of the apparatus to the other. For, in the first case, either free
hydrogen would be liberated at the negative pole, or free acid formed
in the negative compartment, equal to five-sixths of the total copper
deposited ; the free acid, and the five-sixths of the total copper, to
which it is equivalent, being produced by the chemical action —
                                                                 —

         CuSO^HaO + SCuSO^             =     SOs + 06         Cu6 + 5H3S04.
   On the other hand, if the action was in accordance with B there
would be only a deposition of copper on the negative electrode, and
no formation of free acid in the negative compartment.                        In the

   In  none   of these experiments      was there any trace of hydrogen
visibly escaping from      the negative electrode, while, as will be seen
from the table, there was no free acid formed        in the negative compart
ment till two hours or more had elapsed.           By that time some admix
ture in the horizontal part of the apparatus might reasonably be
expected, and even in the greatest instance it is small as compared
with the amount of salt decomposed.
   Similar experiments were made with the sulphate of zinc, with
similar results, no hydrogen being evolved, and little or no sulphuric
acid appearing in the negative compartment.-
   We conclude, therefore, that it is not possible to determine the
composition,      or even to show the presence of a hydrated salt in
aqueous   solution   by means of this electrolytic method.

      Professor of Pure Mathematics in the University of Cam

   This paper is an attempt to work ont the theory of the motion of a
rigid body under the action       of any forces, with the generalised con
ceptions of distance of the so-called non-Euclidean geometry.                  Of
the three   kinds of non-Euclidean space, that known as elliptic space
has been chosen, because of the perfect duality and symmetry which
exist in this case.     The special features of the method employed are

the   extensive   use  of the symmetrical    and homogeneous system of
co-ordinates given    by a quadrantal  tetrahedron, and the use of Pro
fessor Cayley's co-ordinates, in preference to the " rotors " of Professor
Clifford, to represent the position of a line in space.
   The first part, §§ 1-21, is introductory ; in it the theory of plane
and solid geometry is briefly worked out from the basis of Professor
Cayley's idea of an absolute quadric.     By taking a quadrantal triangle
(i.e., a triangle self -conjugate with regard to the absolute conic) as
the triangle of reference, the equations to lines, circles, and conies are
found in a simple form, and some of their properties investigated.
   The geometry of any plane is proved to be the same as that of a
sphere of unit radius, so that elliptic space is shown to have a uniform
positive  curvature.
    The theory is then extended to solid geometry, and the most
important relations of planes and lines to each other are worked out.
    The next part treats of the kinematics of a rigid body. The possi
bility of the existence of a rigid body is shown to be implied by the
constant curvature of elliptic space, and then the theory of its displace
ment is made to depend entirely on orthogonal transformation.         Any
displacement may be expressed as a twist about a certain screw.         A
rotation about a line is shown to be the same as an equal translation
along its polar 5 so that the difference between a rotation and a trans
lation disappears, and the motion of any body is expressed in terms of
six symmetrical angular velocities. An angular velocity a, about a line
whose co-ordinates are a, b, c, f, g, h, is found to be capable of resolu
tion into component angular velocities au, bio . . . hw, about the edges
of the fundamental tetrahedron.
    The theory of screws is next considered. A twist on a screw can be
replaced by a pair of rotations about any two lines which are conju
gate to each other in a certain linear complex.         The surface corre
sponding to the cylindroid is found to be of the fourth order with
a pair of nodal lines.      Lastly, the condition of equivalence of any
number of twists about given screws is investigated.
    In kinetics, the measure of force is deduced from Newton's second
law of motion, and the laws of combination and resolution are proved.
The consid-ration of the whole momentum of a body suggests the
idea of moments of inertia, and a few of their properties are investi
gated.    The general equations of motion referred to any moving axes
are then found, and in a particular case they reduce to a form corre
sponding to Euler's equations ; these are of the type
                   A^- (B-H)u,^6-(G-C)a.5O3=Q1.
    The last part is occupied in the solution of these equations when no
forces act, in terms of the Theta-functions of two variables.      A solu
tion is obtained   in the form

    In this paper the author describes a fragment of jaw with teeth of
a  fossil from the pleistocene deposits at the " Cuddie Springs," New
South Wales, transmitted by E. S. Wilkinson, Esq., of the Depart
ment of Mines, Sydney.
    A series of comparisons are detailed with known recent and fossil
Saurians, and the microscopic test is applied to the tissues of the bone
and tooth.
   The conclusion arrived at is that the fossil was part of a lacertian
reptile, equal in size to the Megalemia, but of carnivorous habits ;
distinct from the largest existing toothed and pleurodont          lizard
(Hydroeaurus giganteue.)       For the much larger extinct pleurodont
Saurian the author proposes the name Notiotaurus deatatus.

    This paper contains a detailed account of a series of observations on
 the effects of localised lesions of the brain of monkeys, made partly by
 Drs. Ferrier and Yeo, and partly by Dr. Ferrier alone.
    The operations were performed under anaesthetics, and according to
the rules and methods of antiseptic surgery.
    The experiments are illustrated by photographs, showing the posi
tion and extent of the lesions and general condition of the brains,
together with sun-prints and microphotographs               of sections of the
brain and spinal cord, showing the structures            primarily involved or
 secondarily degenerated.
    As the paper is mainly an anatomical description of the lesions
 delineated and record of the effects produced, it scarcely admits of
 condensation in the form of an abstract.            The lesions are classified
according to their position in the occipito-angular, temporal, Rolandic,
 frontal, and hippocampal regions respectively.

1884.]      The Effects of Lesions    of the Cerebral  Hemisplieres.   223
    Among the more important results arrived at are the following : —
    Lesions of the occipito-angalar region (occipital lobes and angular
gyri) cause affections of vision, without affection of the other sensory
faculties or motor powers.
    The only lesion which causes complete and permanent loss of vision
in both eyes is total destruction of the occipital lobes and angular
gyri on both sides.
    Complete extirpation of both angular gyri causes for a time total
blindness, succeeded by lasting visual defect in both eyes.
    Unilateral destruction of the cortex of the angular gyrus causes
temporary abolition or impairment of vision in the opposite eye — not
of a hemiopic character.
    Deep   incisions  may be made in both occipital lobes at the same
time, or the greater portion of one or both occipital lobes at the same
time may be removed without any appreciable impairment of vision.
    Destruction    of the occipital lobe and angular gyrus on one side
causes temporary       amblyopia of the opposite eye and homonymous
hemianopia of both eyes, towards the side opposite the lesion.
    As in none of the cases recorded, either of partial unilateral or
bilateral destruction of the occipito-angular region, were the amblyopic
or hemianopic       symptoms permanent, it is concluded that vision is
possible  with both eyes if only portions of the visual centres remain
intact on both sides.
    Destruction of the superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution on both
sides causes complete and permanent          loss of hearing, without other
sensory or motor defect.       Hearing is not impaired by lesions of any
other part of the temporal lobe.
    Destructive lesions of the Rolandic zone (convolutions bounding
 the fissure of Rolando) cause motor paralysis, without loss of sensation,
limited (monoplegia) or general (hemiplegia), according to the posi
tion and extent of the lesion.
    Lesions of this region are followed by descending degeneration of
 the pyramidal tracts of the spinal cord.
    Lesions of the frontal region vary according as they affect the post-
 frontal (base of the frontal convolutions) or pre-frontal (anterior two-
 thirds of the frontal convolutions) region.
    Lesions of the pre-frontal regions alone do not produce any dis
 coverable physiological symptoms.
    Lesions of the post-frontal regions cause temporary paralysis of
 the lateral movements of the head and eyes.
    As the symptoms are only temporary so long as any portions of the
 frontal lobes remain intact, it is concluded that the post-frontal and
 pre-frontal regions have essentially the same physiological significa
 tion, and that portions only of the frontal lobes are sufficient for the
 exercise of their functions.

224       Effects of Lesions of the Cerebral   Hemispheres.     [Jan.  24,
   Lesions of the frontal lobea are followed by descending degeneration
of the mesially situated tracts of the foot of the cms cerebri and cor
responding fibres of the internal capsule, as seen in transverse sections.
The ultimate destination of these tracts is uncertain.       They cannot
be traced in the anterior pyramids.
   Lesions entirely destroying the hippocampal region (the hippo
campus major and gyrus hippocampi) and neighbouring inferior
temporosphenoidal region (without implication of the crus cerebri,
basal ganglia, or internal capsule) cause complete anaesthesia — cuta
neous, mucous, muscular — of the opposite side of the body, without
motor paralysis.
   The degree of impairment of tactile sensibility in those cases
where it is not entirely abolished, is in proportion to the amount of
destruction  of the hippocampal region.
   Lesions of the cornu ammonis alone, or gyrus hippocampi alone,
do not cause permanent impairment of tactile sensibility.             Tho
duration   of the   effects of  total destruction   of   the hippocampal
region has not been determined.
   No impairment of tactile sensibility     has been observed     in con
nexion with any of the other cerebral lesions described.

   The investigations which      I  have the honour to submit in this com
munication have been undertaken to furnish data to engineers and
others   who are concerned with the erection of structures which have
to sustain pressure upon floors and       retaining walls, and also to further
the objects of science   in a  field that is believed to be new.
    Store-houses have been erected, both in this country and in America,
which consist of rectangular cells, called bins, and are filled with
grain to a height of 50 feet and upwards above the ground.
    Diligent inquiries have been made for any scientific data or rules
by which the necessary strength of the walls and floors of such
structures could be computed, or, for instance, what would be the
 vertical and lateral pressure of a column, say of wheat, 14 feet square
 at its base and top, and 60 feet in height.        It was generally assumed
 to be something less than the pressure of a similar column of water,
but how much less did not appear to be known either in England or
 America.
    Last year  I made  experiments to obtain data, by employing models
 of square  and hexagonal bins, particulars of which were communi
 cated in a paper read in Section G, at the meeting of the British
 Association for the Advancement of Science, held at Southampton.
 I give briefly, in tabular form, the results.

area   isequal to 122'8 square inches. All pressure upon the bottom
ceased when the wheat was 24 inches in height, and the mean pressure
upon the bottom then was 48 lbs., which      very nearly the weight                   is
of1   cubic foot of wheat when loosely filled.   Then 122-8 square
inches X 24 inches = 2947-2 cubic inches, but the pressure was only
equal to 1728 cubic inches of wheat   cubic foot) and, therefore,              (1
the pressure-form  must be some figure containing approximately
1728 cubic inches of wheat.   We have three dimensions of the figure
ascertained by experiment, namely, the area of its base, its height,
and its cubical capacity, or, 122'8 ins. the base, 24 ins. the height,

    The actual pressure was ascertained by weighing to be 48 lbs., and
this was the total mean pressure upon the bottom of the cell, though
it was filled with wheat that weighed 202-8 lbs.             I  now know, and
will give the particulars later on, that if this cell had been lengthened
to 60 ft. or any other height, the pressure upon the bottom would not
have exceeded 48 lbs.
    The investigations could not be considered conclusive if left at this
stage, since they in a remarkable manner appeared to be contradictory
to all our generally received knowledge of the laws governing the
flow and pressure of fluids.         It was also reasonable to doubt their
reliability   if   applied on a large scale, notwithstanding their close
agreement with each other in all the experimental cells. Besides,
there was no evidence furnished by the experiments to show what
 pressure the sides of the cells would have to sustain, although it
might be inferred that the side pressure upon a unit of surface, would
 be  less than that upon a similar unit of bottom surface, but how much
less, if any, was not indicated.        I  therefore decided to try the expe-
 ments on a large scale, and to include in them determinations both
of the vertical and lateral pressures.              These  I   now proceed to
describe.
    Mr. Paul, the well-known corn-merchant of Liverpool, at the sug
 gestion of Mr. Grayson, architect (both of whom took great interest
 in the inquiry), placed at my disposal part of a warehouse at the
 Duke's Dock, together with the use of grain, men, and machinery for
 manipulating with. In one corner of the warehouse I constructed a
 rectangular bin, two sides of which were formed with spruce deal
 planks, 3 inches in thickness, placed on end, so that they were sup
 ported only at the level of each floor, and had a clear bearing in
 the ground storey, of 9 ft. 3 ins.          The other two sides of the bin
 were the walls of the warehouse.           On plan the bin measured inter
 nally 6 ft. 9 ins. by 6 ft. 0 in., and 52 ft. 2 ins. in height, and it con
 tained when filled 2112 cubic feet of wheat, weighing 111,976 lbs.
     The weighing apparatus consisted of two graduated levers, one for
  weighing the vertical, and the other for weighing the lateral pressures.

228                             Mr. I. Roberts.                         [Jan.  31,
They were made according to my directions by the well-known
machine makers, Messrs. Heury Pooley and Sons.                   Each lever was
capable   of weighing  with    great accuracy      from   one  pound weight to
1800 lbs., advancing one pound at a time, by a sliding weight,
which was caused to run along the graduated edge of the lever by
the pulling of a cord.    The woodcut on page 236 shows the levers and
the other adjuncts placed in position for weighing.            The upper figure
shows the     machine   for  weighing      lateral    pressures, and the lower
figure that for weighing vertical pressures.            Both levers were tested
by  me  with  standard  weights   up  to  800   lbs., and  half a pound weight
would clearly move the lever when any part of the 800 lbs. was
applied to the machine.       I  now proceed to describe the methods of
weighing.
   The bottom of the bin was formed 4 feet above the basement floor
of the warehouse, and an opening 3 feet square was made in it
centrically.   Beneath this opening a slide was placed which could be
forced through the grain by means of a powerful screw-jack, or be
withdrawn from beneath the grain by means of ropes and pulley-
blocks as might be required.         Beneath this slide were grooves into
which   a frame  could be  inserted,  and when so placed it would be con
centric with the 3-ft. aperture already described in the bottom of
the bin.     Three frames were made to fit into these grooves, with
apertures of 1 ft. by 1 ft., 2 ft. by 2 ft., and 3 ft. by 3 ft. respectively.
Beneath any one of the apertures when placed in position in the
grooves, was the board which formed the top of the weighing-
machine, and the arrangements were such that a column of grain
measuring 1 ft., 4 ft., or 9 ft. superficial area, and of any height, up
to 51 ft. 9 ins., could at any time be weighed upon the lever of
the machine, without the necessity of emptying the bin to insert
the aperture frames after each weighing had been completed.                     It
was also necessary, in order to insure accuracy, that all pressure
should be taken off the machine before proceeding with each succes
sive weighing, and these conditions were attained by opening and
closing the slides in manner already referred to.
   The weighings of the lateral pressures were accomplished in
manner slightly different from those of the bottom or vertical.              The
lever of the  machine   was   placed   at   right angles    with  the side of the
bin, in the way shown on the figure.              The pressure-receiving top
of the machine, and its bracket, were suspended by a chain from
their common centre of gravity, and when placed in their position for
weighing, they just touched (without exerting any pressure) the
knife-edged fulcrae of the lever, and a pressure equal to less than
one pound weight would always be indicated by the lever rising off
its rest.
   Three apertures of the respective areas of 1 ft., 4 ft., and 9 ft.,

1884.]       Determination of Pressures      of Granular  Substances.     229
were employed in weighing the side pressures, and the slide for
admitting and stopping the grain between the weighing-machine and
the bin was similar to that described for bottom pressure, only that
it ran on edge instead of horizontally.           The details are shown on
the figure.
    The method       adopted in weighing both the vertical and lateral
pressures was the following : On three sides of the bin, painted gauge
boards were affixed and marked in feet, and each foot was subdivided
into spaces of 3 inches.      These boards extended from the top of the
weighing-machines to the top of the bin, and tne quantity of grain
          I
which desired to weigh was put into the bin and carefully levelled at
the desired height, by the aid       of these marks.    Then three or more
weighings were taken at that level.           Afterwards the height of the
grain in the bin was increased to the next desired stage, and then
levelled and weighed three times, or more, and so on, stage by stage,
until the bin was filled.
     Before the grain was allowed to come in contact with the weighing-
machines, care was taken always to place an excess of weight upon
the levers, and this was rednced to indicate the pressure by moving
the sliding weight by means of the cord along the graduated edge of
the lever.       The reduction of the weight on the weighing-machine
 was therefore steady and gradual.
     I had not proceeded far with the process of weighing, when              I
 observed a constantly recurring stiffness in the rising of the levers off
 their rests.     They would rise, say one-fiftieth of an inch off the rest,
 and there    remain for an indefinite length of time without the least
 further movement ; but as 1 lb. weight after another was removed off
 the lever,    it gradually rose until the balance was finally overcome,
 when     the lever would rise and touch the check which           prevented
 further motion upwards.        The difference between the first  movement
 and the final rise of the lever frequently equalled one-half     the whole
 pressure.     This condition invariably accompanied every         weighing.
 The machines were carefully examined, bat no fault lay            there, and
 I infer   that the difference here referred to represents the elastic force
 of grain when it is subject to pressure, and that this elastic force
  expends itself before the mass of the grain comes into the state of
  mobility.
      In the following tables, which contain the results of each reliable
  weighing which was made,      I  distinguish between the first small move
  ment of the lever and the final movement which represents the grain
  in motion, by the words Dormant and Active pressures.             I call the
  pressure   dormant when the lever has been lifted off its rest to the
  extent   that   a beam of light can be seen between the lever and its
  rest  ; and   the  pressure active, when the lever has risen about three-
   fourths of an inch above its rest up to the check.

    In  the experiments made with the model bins, which have been
already referred to, the bottom of the model was formed by a loose
board, which rested upon an ordinary weighing-machine, and it only
just touched the lower edges of the boards forming the sides. The
weights were removed a pound at a time off the machine, and the
pressure of the wheat was indicated by the bottom falling away, and
the wheat consequently running out ; but in the large bin the bottom
measured 6 ft. 9 ins. by 6 ft. Oin., and therefore it was not practicable
to weigh the whole of the pressure upon the bottom in the manner
adopted with the models.             I therefore decided to weigh columns of
grain within the bin, having            a base of 9 ft.,   4ft., and      1 square foot
respectively.      These columns were formed of the mass of the grain
contained within the bin, and being coincident with its centre, were
not subject to any friction against the sides, but only to the friction
amongst the particles of the grain.
    Referring now to Table I, it deals with a column of wheat having a
base area of 9 square feet.          The mean dormant pressure when 6 ft. in
height was 1157 lbs. ; when 8 ft. in height it was 1159 lbs. ; when
8 ft. 9 ins. in height it was 1146 lbs. ; and when 51 ft. 9 ins. in height
it was only 1172'67 lbs. One of the weighings at 6 ft. in height
showed the pressure to be 1202 lbs. ; but the greatest pressure indi
cated with the height or head of 51 ft. 9 ins. was only 1191 lbs.
   The active pressure is in every case less at the height of 51 ft. 9 ins.
than it is at any height below that.               At 6 ft. it reached 1034 lbs ;
 hut at 51 ft. 9 ins. it did not exceed 832 lbs.
    The actual weight of the column of wheat that indicated these
 pressures was, in the case of 6 ft. in height, 2862 lbs. ( = 6ft. 0 in. x
 9 ft. 0 in. x 53 lbs.) ; and in the case of 51 ft. 9 ins. in height, 24,685 lbs.
 = (9 ft. 0 in. x 51 ft. 9 ins. x 53 lbs.) .

 1884.]     Determination     of Pressures of Granular     Substances.   235
   In Table     II the column of wheat had a bottom area of 4 square
feet, and with the height of 51ft. 9 ins. would weigh 10,971 lbs.=
 (4 ft. 0 in. x 51 ft. 9 ins. X 53 lbs.) ; but the mean dormant pressure
upon the bottom was only 681-5 lbs., whilst at only 4 ft. in height the
mean dormant pressure was 592 -5 lbs.
   The active pressure, as will be seen in this table also, is less when the
column of wheat is 51 ft. 9 ins. in height than it is at any lower level.
   In Table     III  the aperture had an area of 1 square foot, and the
column of wheat 51 ft. 9 ins. in height, indicated a mean dormant
pressure of 216 lbs., and in each weighing an active pressure of only
50 lbs., even at the height of 2 ft. 4 ins., this amount of active
pressure was indicated.          The total weight of a column of wheat
1 foot square and 51 ft. 9 ins. in height would be 2742 lbs., but the
maximum dormant pressure did not exceed 229 lbs., and the active
pressure was only 50 lbs.        If now we formulate the results obtained
and recorded in Tables I, II, and       III in terms of those obtained by the
model bins already referred to, we have: —
   a=area of column of wheat in square feet.
   d= diameter of inscribed circle in feet.
   c= constant determined by experiment.
   w= weight of wheat in pounds per cubic foot.
   p= pressure upon the bottom.
   c is found to be variable within certain limits.       With the aperture
of 9  square feet, according to Table I, it is 0-84.       With the aperture
of 4 square feet, according to Table II, it is l-66, and with the aper
ture of 1 square foot, according to Table III, it is 4-32.
   It, therefore, appears that the apex of the paraboloid which repre
sents  the pressure upon 1 square foot area at the centre of a bin full of
wheat, is higher relatively with its inscribed circle, than it is relatively
with the inscribed circle which has its diameter eqnal to the bottom
of the bin.
   We shall now proceed to consider the lateral or side pressures, and
by referring to Tables IV, V, and VI, it will be seen that in each of
the weighings, irrespective of the height of the wheat in the bin,
there is a dormant and an active pressure both considerably less than
the corresponding vertical pressure.          With the aperture of 9 square
feet the maximum dormant pressure of 385 lbs. was attained at the
height of 7 ft. 3 ins. above the lower edge of the aperture, and at the
height of 45 ft. 6 ins. the maximum pressure was 367 lbs.               With
the aperture of 4 square feet the maximum dormant pressuro was
238 lbs., at the height of 45 ft. and at the height of 6 ft. 9 ins. the
pressure reached 170 lbs. With the aperture of 1 square foot the
maximum dormant pressure at 44ft. 6 ins. in height was 47 lbs.
   With the aperture of 2 ft. by 2 ft., and the wheat only 2 ft. in height,
 that is to say, level with the top edge of the aperture, the dormant

pressure was 96 lbs., and when a man whose weight was 170 lbs.
stood upon the wheat, close to the aperture, the pressure was 127 lbs.,
being an increase of 31 lbs. only beyond the pressure of the wheat
without the man.
   It therefore appears by the weighings of the lateral pressures
given in the Tables, that in no case is the maximum dormant pressure
in a bin measuring 6 ft. 9 ins. by 6 ft. on plan, and 45 ft. 6 ins. in

height, greater than 60 lbs. on the square foot of side surface, and
that this pressure is nearly uniform between the bottom and 6 ft. off
the top, about which point it diminishes gradually to the top.
    That the lateral or side pressure cannot be represented, like the
bottom pressure, by a parabolic figure, the respective weighings prove,
for with the aperture of 1 square foot, and a head of wheat 44 ft. 6 ins.
in height, the maximum dormant pressure was 47 lbs.                     With the
aperture of 4 square feet, the maximum dormant pressure with a head
of 45 feet was 59"5 lbs. on each square foot.             With the aperture of
9 square feet and a head          of  45  ft. 6 ins. the maximum    dormant pres
sure was 40-81bs. on each square foot.
    With the data given in the foregoing pages, we are now in              a posi
tion to compute both the vertical and lateral pressures, and to deter
mine the distribution of the pressures of the wheat contained in a
bin of the dimensions given.          They are as follows : —
    Length of bin, 6 ft. 9 ins. ; breadth of the bin, 6 ft. ; height of the
wheat,     51   ft. 9 ins. ; weight of the wheat, per cubic foot,        53  lbs.  ;
weight of the wheat contained in the bin, 111,080 lbs.
    Bottom pressure       computed by the formula, axdxcXw=p, or the
bottom area       in square feet into the diameter of the inscribed circle in
feet, into the constant, into the weight of wheat in pounds per cubic
foot, equal the pressure upon the bottom in pounds.              If we substitute
the dimensions we shall have (6 ft. 0 in. X 6 ft. 9 ins.) =40 ft. 6 in. X
6 ft. 5       ins. x0-84x53 lbs.=ll,569 lbs., the pressure upon the
bottom.
    The side pressure will be the superficial area in feet of the inside
of the walls of the bin multiplied by 43 lbs., or, 25 ft. 6 ins. X
51   ft. 9 ins. x43 lbs.=56,744 lbs., the pressure        on the  four sides.     I
adopt 43 lbs., the constant of pressure as shown by the weighings
with the 9 square feet aperture, in this calculation, for the reason
that it more closely approximates the size of the bin than the smaller
apertures do. The difference between the sum of the vertical and lateral
pressures and the whole of the weight of the wheat contained in the
 bin would be 42,767 lbs., and this would represent the friction of the
wheat against the sides.         This frictional pressure added to the lateral
 pressure     would represent the weight sustained by the side walls.
 The wheat is formed into an elastic plug, fitting closely to the shape of
 the bin, and each grain is held in sensitive equilibrium by the
 resultants    of the vertical, lateral, and frictional resistances.
    If   a slide valve were opened      in the bottom or Bide of the bin when
 it is full of wheat, the equilibrium of the grains would be disturbed
 to the extent of a vertical column having a sectional area somewhat
 larger than the aperture of the valve, and its height equal to the head
 of wheat.       It would be a vortex      column fed mostly by the wheat at
 the top   of the bin sliding into it down slopes formed by the angle of

towards the outlet.
   The flow of the wheat through an aperture, say of 80 square inches
area, can easily be stopped by a board held in the hand against                        it,
though the head may be 50 feet or more.

containing wheat 37 ft. in height, and they passed through the body of
wheat and out at the bottom when 20 ft. of wheat still remained in
the bin. On another occasion,           am informed by a credible eye-witness,

the bin. The body of wheat through which                  passed exceeded 20 ft.

I  think, in practice safely adopt 50 lbs. upon each square foot of side
as the constant for the lateral pressure of wheat.
    We shall now consider the pressure of peas.
    Those selected for the experiment were dry, hard, and round.
They weighed, when pressed into the measure, 54 lbs. per cubic foot,
and the determinations of the vertical and lateral pressures were
made precisely in the same manner, and with the same weighing-
machines and bin that were used in determining the pressures of
wheat.    I    need not, therefore, repeat any part of the descriptions
which have been already given, and will now discuss the tables which
embody the results obtained.          They are numbered respectively VII,
VIII, IX,       and   X.

                   of   9
of peaa to be 1391 lbs., and with the head of 9 ft. the pressure of
1323 lbs. With the bottom aperture of 4 square feet (Table VIII)
and the head of 49 ft. 10 ins.,                              dormant pressure of
                                                   the maximum
726 lbs.was indicated,                and with the head or height of 6 ft., 723 lbs.
The apex  of the pressure paraboloid is therefore at the height of three
diameters of the inscribed circle of the base or aperture, and is greater
by one diameter      than the wheat paraboloid.        The constant (c) for
peas      inis,the case  of the    ft.  aperture,
                                           9         96   the corresponding

constant for wheat being 0"84.
   The lateral pressures are given in Tables IX and X, where, with
the aperture of      square feet and
                            9            head of 43 ft. 10 ins. of peas, the
                                                   a
maximum dormant pressure was 242 lbs., and with the head of                ft.     9
251 lbs. With the aperture of         square  feet
                                               4   and head  of 43 ft.   ins. 9
the maximum dormant pressure was 121 lbs., and with a head of              ft.     6
97 lbs.  It therefore appears that all lateral pressure ceases at a
height equal to three times the breadth of the aperture as indicated
by  the   ft., and that the pressure
            9                              slightly greater as indicated by
                                                    is
the   4 ft. square aperture.
     With the     ft.   9  27*89 lbs. on each square foot, and with the
                            it   is
4   ft. it   30-251bs.
              is        The pressures of wheat corresponding with these
(Tables IV and V) were 4278 lbs. and 595 respectively.
   The conclusions to be drawn are, that the vertical or bottom pres
sure of peas is greater than that of wheat in the ratio of 0-96 to 0"84r
or of 173 to T66; but that the lateral or side pressure of peas is
less than that of wheat in the ratio of 27-89 to 4278, or of 30"25 to
59-5.
  The constant (c=0-96) for computing the vertical pressure      safe         is
for the equilibrium of peas, wheat, or any other grain, but the safe
permanent sustaining powers of any floors or walls should be at least
four times the constant.
   For the lateral pressure, 50 lbs. upon each square foot of retaining
wall    safe for the equilibrium of all grain
         is                                     but the safe permanent
                                                            ;
resistance to pressure in any wall or partition should not be less than
four times  that, or 200 lbs. upon each foot.
    Itwill have been observed that the maximum dormant pressure has
been adopted in the formulae for both the vertical and lateral pres
sures, though the active     pressure     that which would cause the
                                                       is
breaking down of the structure, and, as shown in the tables,                   it      is
considerably less than the dormant.
   Seeing that the constants for the vertical pressures of both wheat
and peas are so near unity, one being 0-84 and the other 0"96,                     I
propose to adopt unity in the formula, which will then stand finally

         F.R.S. Received January 25, 1884.
      During his adventurous journey in the Andes of Ecuador in Decem
  ber, 1879, and the         earlier months of 1880, Mr. E. Whymper succeeded
  in ascending several of the highest mountains, and collected a con
  siderable series of rock specimens, which he has entrusted to me for
  examination.          Although descriptions of rocks from this district have
  already been published by some eminent petrologists on the Continent,
  yet, as Mr. Whymper's collections were made with great care, and
  specimens       were taken          in numerous      instances from localities never
  before touched        by  the   hand     of man,   I have thought it better to make
  my notes as far as possible complete, and so have occasionally included
  specimens of which some account may have appeared in foreign
  scientific periodicals.
      Probably no cojlection has hitherto been described which either has
  been so extensive           or has consisted of specimens with the localities
  more exactly determined.
      In making these notes               I  think it better to group the specimens
  geographically rather than mineralogically, so as to give successively
  a synoptic      view of the products of each volcano, and              I select as the
  subject of the first of a short series of papers the rocks from Pichincha,
  although from its proximity to Quito, and its accessibility, it is one of
  the best known of the Ecuadorian Andes, because the collection from
  this mountain is a comparatively              large one, and contains a considerable
  number of well-preserved               specimens.
      Pichincha, according             to Mr. Whymper, is a dormant          and nearly
• extinct volcano, lying to the north-west of Quito, which city is built
  almost on the extremities of its eastern slopes.                 To quote his words,
  " From
             the south, north, and east (I have not seen the mountain from
  the west) Pichincha has the appearance of a range rather than a cone.
   It rises into several well-marked, but not bold, peaks, the principal of
  which are Guagua-Pichincha, the highest point, which by my baro
   metrical-mercury observations is 15,918 feet (15,706 Reiss and
   Stilbel A), and Rucu- Pichincha, which is only a few hundred feet lower.
       "The summits of the mountains Pichincha, Atacatzo, and Corazon
   lie almost     in a direct line, and Illiniza* is only slightly out of it.

The two northern mountains in themselves assume the appearance of
small ranges.     The two southern are peaked, but have not the cone
like aspect of Cotopaxi or Sangai (the only really active volcanoes of
Ecuador). Each mountain is separated by well-marked depression,
the lowest points of which in each case lie about midway between thf
summits.      Thus, thongh the four mountains may be considered part of
a range, they are all well marked off one from another, and are inde
pendent ; the two northern being sufficiently large to assume for them
selves the aspect of small ranges. The base of Pichincha, for instance,
from north to south extends over well-nigh 20 miles.
   " Pichincha is said
                          (at Quito) to have several craters.    I  did not
see any, though     I was possibly in one.      We were two days camped
close to the top of the mountain, but were in a fog for almost the
whole time, so that we had no little difficulty in making sure that we
were on the true summit, and wholly failed to see the crater or
craters, though perhaps we clambered down the sides of one for about
1500 feet.      I believe that every person who has ever been up
Pichincha, or anywhere near the summit, has been much troubled by
want of clearness in the atmosphere.         There appeared to me to be
strong grounds for believing that there were two principal craters on
the highest parts of the mountain, but some persons would have it
that there were more than two. Whatever the number of craters, they
must be tolerably central, as I have seen all the slopes of the mountain
on the south and east of the two summits mentioned above, and there
are no craters upon them.
   " If  I had not had experience with other mountains, which rendered
me    cautious, from knowing how easily a cloud may mislead an
observer,   I should  say that  I have seen steam rising from behind the
summit of Guagua-Pichincha while           I  have been viewing it at a
distance.    There was, however, a considerable amount of evidence
from natives living around in different localities that Pichincha is seen
to 'smoke,' and various persons of greater or less credibility have
affirmed that they have been to the bottom of the craters, and have
       '
seen fissures, smoke, and fire.'
   " Snow-beds of considerable size remain
                                               upon Pichincha permanently;.
but these lie in deep fissures and ravines, and are not noticed at a
distance ; hence    I  should scarcely think it proper to term it a snow
mountain."

   The specimens from Pichincha which have examined are twenty-
eight in number.       Of these, eighteen were obtained by Mr. Whymper
from a collector at Quito, and were presented to myself, the remainder
were collected by him during his ascent of the mountain. The localities
are affixed to the former set of specimens, but as some of the names
are unknown to Mr. Whymper, the spots whence these specimens have
been taken     cannot in every case be precisely determined.       Hence   I

1884.]        Microscopic Structure of   some Rocks     from tlie Andes.       243
shall describe the two collections separately.       It may be remarked
that the labels indicate that in the opinion of the native collectors
there is undoubtedly a crater on Gnagua-Pichincha.
   Of these eighteen specimens, all but one would, without hesitation,
be described in general terms as " Trachytes," and that, though
rather a dark grey in colour, could hardly receive any other name.
The others are either light grey inclining to a yellowish tint, or shades
of a pale red inclining to purple.
   Four of these specimens bear in common the designation Guspide
del Rucu-PicMncha, August 24, 1879. Rucu-Pichincha, as has been
said, is the lower or middle summit, whose height, according to
Reiss and Stiibel, is 15,542 feet. Mr. Whymper informs me that the
term Cuspide in Ecuador is applied equally to the bond fide summit of
a mountain, or to the general culminating mass. These four speci
mens have a compact-looking matrix of a pale-reddish colour, in which
are scattered numerous little crystals of a whitish felspar. All evidently
are rather decomposed.      The first bears the additional label Tioloma
chiquito paso   de la Ouibrada " Rumi-huaico."     The matrix is a warm
pinkish-grey in colour, containing numerous felspar crystals, seldom
exceeding 0"125 inch in longer diameter, and often less, together with
a few specks of a dark mineral.      To the earlier stage of consolidation
belong  the following  minerals : (1) Felspar, commonly in crystals about
0-04 inch to 0-02 inch in longer diameter, frequently containing
numerous comparatively large, rounded and slightly lobed inclosures
of a brown glass, and an occasional speck of ferrite.          Oligoclase,
sometimes showing zonal banding, is present, but the large extinction
angles of many of the crystals indicate that labradorite or anorthite,
 probably the former, is also abundant.       (2) A pyroxenic mineral in
 well defined crystals ; some of these exhibit the usual outline,
cleavage, and characteristics of normal augite, but several in their
form, pleochroism, and mode of extinction agree with the orthorhombic
mineral, lately recognised as hypersthene.*         The former are fre
quently stained of a dark brown colour towards the exterior.
 (3) Some ill-defined ferruginous spots may also be seen, which
sometimes appear to replace a crystal          of augite, hornblende       (in one
instance), or mica.
   To the later stage of consolidation    belong fairly numerous micro-
liths of a plagioclastic felspar in a grey granulated base.       This, by
remaining   dark  in all positions between  the crossed  Nicols, is proved
to be a glass, though somewhat modified by decomposition.
   The rock then is an augite-andesite with some hypersthene, and it

La Guardette, Cantal, figured by MM. Fouque and LeVy, Roches

   Two other specimens, labelled respectively " Puerto, de Tanguieta
Encillada para Nina-urcu and " Machai Grande, subida al fichaco de
                               "
Puguampa, lado norte," exhibit only varietal differences, so that it is
needless to enter into the details of their microscopic structure. The
fourth specimen, labelled Tioloma grande paso a vintunillas, is a rock of
similar character to the other, but it incloses an oval mass of darker
colour and more granulated structure, which has a fairly sharp
boundary, so that it somewhat resembles an inclosed pebble.                 The
latter is composed of a clear mineral, generally polygonal (approxi
mately hexagonal) in outline, containing some minute microlithic
inclosures.     This mineral gives occasional indications of zonal banding
and oscillatory twinning ; if a felspar it is difficult to assign the species ;
there is also a fair amount of a pale augite (which has subsequently
consolidated), and of an iron peroxide in irregular granules, and as a
staining in what appears to be the sparse remnant of a glassy base,
which gives a faint indication of a fluidal structure. I am disposed
to regard the mass as a node rather than an included fragment,
caught up by the melted lava.
   The next group of nine specimens all             bear the label Grater of
Quagua-Pichincha,       the   more   precise  localities   being (I translate
the Spanish terms) (re) Ascent of the Crater, N. W. slopes ; (6) Idem ;
(c) Idem; (d) Edge of Grater, N.W. side; (e) Idem, N.E. side;
(/)    Commencement        of  the  Descent   of   the    Crater,    S.E.  side;
(g)  Slopes  of  the Crater,  N.E. side; (h) Bottom of      the Crater, near the
ancient fumaroles (a very decomposed specimen) ; (i) Bottom of the
Crater, brink of the inferior Crater.          These specimens all bear a
general   resemblance     to  one  another,  and, as most of them are not
very well preserved,     I have had only two of them cut for microscopic
examination,     as  I felt certain that the differences which the others
might present       would    be only varietal, and that it was doubtful
whether some would be in a fit state for examination.              These are the
specimens    marked     (re) the  best preserved   of  the series,  and (e) that
from the summit rim of the crater, which may be regarded as about
in an average state of preservation.
   The former of these specimens (a) has a compact pale-grey matrix,
in which are scattered little crystals of whitish felspar and rather
elongated prisms of a mineral resembling a black hornblende, which
do not exceed about 0'2 inch in length, and are often less.
   In the first stage of consolidation are: (1) Crystals of felspar,
with regular outlines, probably in most instances labradorite ;
they generally contain, though in variable quantities, microlithic
inclosures.     These sometimes have a rough zonally banded arrange

 meat,     sometimes are collected in the inner part of crystals which
have     a  clear external band.        They are mostly a brownish glass, in
 which gas cavities are rather frequent; others are belonites of a
pale     colour; (2) hornblende         in fairly regnlar crystals, with well
defined cleavage, mostly of a rather dark greenish-brown                  colour, but
occasionally paler; (3) granules, rather rounded in outline, of an
iron oxide.       In the second stage of consolidation are microliths of a
plagioclastic felspar in a glassy base stained with opacite.
    The second specimen presents only varietal differences from the
above, but is less well preserved.              We may accordingly name this
series hornblende-andesite.
    The next two specimens are labelled Sistemade Pichincha (massif of
Pichincha), and are distinguished from the other by having a dull-grey
matrix, in which crystals of whitish felspar, not exceeding 0"2 inch
(and generally less), are scattered.              The better suited for examina
tion has tho additional indication Penoneo de Pamescucho, abajo de
Nina-urcu.*        In  microscopic structure this rock is not unlike the first
described : it has a glassy base, rather darkened with ferrite and
opacite, and crowded with minute crystallites of felspar, in which
 are   scattered crystals of a plagioclase, probably labradorite, with augite
and hypersthene.          It is, therefore, like the rock from Rncu-Pichincha,
a  hyperstheniferous augite-andesite.
    The other specimen from Pichacho de los Ladrillos has a general
resemblance to the last, except that it is more scoriaceons and
decomposed.         I have not thought it needful to have a section made.
It   is  probably an augite-andesite, and very possibly contains a little
hypersthene. The last two specimens are both from Nina-Urcu. They
resemble one another and each of the other groups in some respects.
The matrix is compact, is a dull reddish colour, and in it are scat
tered crystals of a whitish felspar, as in the last group, and of a pyro-
xenic mineral, somewhat as in the second, the general colour coming
nearer to that of the first group.
    The better preserved one, which             I have examined microscopically,
is labelled Cerro de Gandela,        Encillada     entre Rucu y Ouagua-Pichincha,
the other Encillada al Rucu y Ouagua-Pichincha.                   In the former are
seen,    in the first stage of consolidation, (1) crystals of a plagioclastic
felspar, most, if not all, of which, from its extinction angles, is
probably labradorite ; (2) crystals of normal augite ; (3) crystals of
hypersthene, as above described.                Cavities and what appear to be
glass inclosures       are rather numerous in both the felspar and the
augite. The ground-mass appears to be a dark-brown glass, all but
 opaque ; but as the slide has offered difficulties to the workman, and is
    • Famascucho, below Nina-urcu.       The latter name is applied by Reiss and Stiibel
 to a point    in the ridge connecting Guagua-Pichincha with Rucu-Pichincha,         the
 elevation  of which they  give as 14,472 feet.

thicker than the rest, it is not in a very good state for examination,
and crystallites may be more numerous than appear.
   The collection made by Mr. Whymper himself consists of a series of
specimens taken during his ascent of the highest peak or cone, Guagua-
Pichincha, including a specimen broken off the actual summit, and
one specimen broken from the summit of Rucu-Pichincha, the middle
or second peak of the mountain, by one of his guides, Louis Carrel.
The specimens from the slopes of Gnagua-Pichincha form one series
¦with the summit rock and with the second group, described above,
from the same part of the massif. Some, as might be expected, are
rather decomposed,* others are vesicular — pumiceous or slaggy
varieties of the rock of which those already described are the more
compact form. There are minor differences in the quantity of felspar
and of the black pyroxenic mineral scattered through the matrix, bat
these appear to me merely varietal; hence            I  have only had a slice
cut from the specimen which was broken from the topmost crag of
Gnagua-Pichincha, for this, though generally resembling the specimens
described above, exhibits some slight differences.            The external .sur
faces of the fragment have a slightly scoriaceous aspect, and where the
lichen-growth is chipped away, are of a dull grey to rusty brown
colour.    The fractured faces show the matrix to be of a dull, but not
dark, colour, in places slightly vesicular, the walls of the hollows
being coated with a pellicle of iron-rust. In the matrix are scattered
pretty thickly whitish felspar crystals, not generally exceeding 0-2
inch in diameter, and granules or crystals of a black mineral, less than
0-125 inch in diameter, the former being rather larger, and the latter
rather smaller than the corresponding minerals in the group of speci
mens already described from Gnagua-Pichincha.                 Under the micro
scope we find that    (1) felspar crystals of very variable size are scattered
throughout the slide, the majority exhibiting polysynthetio twinning.
The boundaries generally are sharply rectilinear, but not a few of the
largest have evidently been broken, and one or two show signs of
external corrosion.       Microlithic inclosures are frequent, but very
variable in amount.        Some of the crystals contain a considerable
number of irregular bits of brown glass, with or without granules of
 pyroxene ; others cavities, in which are bubbles, apparently fixed,
occupying about one-eighth of the whole volume ; others aggregates
of exceedingly minute granules, like the finest dust, possibly augite, of
which mineral, if       I mistake not, belonites occur.          As a rule, the
smaller   crystals are clearer than the larger, and the inclosures are
more numerous in the inner than in the outer part, but there is
so much variation observable that no law can be established.                     It
is difficult to settle the precise species of the felspar, but the general
   ¦ Mr. Whymper in all his collections endeavoured to bring away a fair repre
sentation of what he saw on the mountain, rather than a series of choice specimens.

results         of   my observations        are in favour of the            majority being
labradorite.
   (2.) Hornblende. This mineral occurs in crystals, sometimes rather
more than 0-05 inch diameter. It is usually of a strong olive-green or
brownish-green      colour, showing a very marked dichroism, often not
conspicuously    cleaved,  but occasionally exhibiting in cross-sections a
very characteristic cleavage.       Not seldom the crystals have their out
lines rounded, as if worn or somewhat corroded, and are black-
bordered.     Microlithic inclosures of felspar and of opacite are rather
frequent.     (3.) A much paler and less dichroic mineral occurring
rarely,  not black   bordered.   In one case a crystal of it appears to grow
on to the broken face of a hornblende crystal.        It contains microliths
of opacite but not of felspar.     The extinction angles indicate that this
also is hornblende, but I consider it to be formed subsequently to the
dark variety. (4.) Two or three clusters of a granular mineral of a
pale colour, which I believe to be augite.        (5.) One or two crystals
which, from their dichroism and extinction, I consider hypersthene.
(6.) Granules of iron oxide, probably magnetite.             The interstitial
matter is of a dusty grey-brown colour, and, when examined with
high powers, appears to consist of a transparent glass crowded with
minute earthy particles and specks of ferrite.        The rock then which
forms the topmost crag of Guagua-Pichincha            as our previous inves

   The specimen broken from the highest point of Rucu-Pichincha              a            is
compact grey rock, in very fair preservation,          containing scattered
crystals of a glassy felspar up to about 0"2 inch in diameter, and
smaller specks of       black pyroxenic mineral.

specimen, except that cavities with bubbles are almost wholly want
ing.    Other inclosures are frequent, especially nearly colourless
belonites.   The pyroxenic mineral        rather abundant

    At the request of Major A. W. Baird, R.E.,               I herewith    forward   for
presentation to the Royal Society, a report which he has prepared on
the Tidal Disturbances caused by the now famous volcanic eruptions
which occurred on the 27th and 28th August last year, in the Island of
Krakatoa and the Straits of Sunda, between Sumatra and Java.                        For
   •  I  have  seen, in collections of rocks  from Hungary, specimens bearing con
siderable   resemblance   to  those  from Pichincha : for instance, an " amphibol-
andesite" from Altsobl is like those of Guagua- Pichincha, and ono from Blanfuss,
Kremnitz, like specimens from Nina-urcu and Rucu-Pichincha.

1884.]      Tidal Disturbance* caused by Eruptions at Java.             249
some years past      it has been Major Baird's special duty, as an officer
of the Great       Trigonometrical Survey of India, to supervise the
operations for the investigation of tidal phenomena which have been
carried on under the orders of the Government at a number of points
on the Indian coast lines from Kurrachee round to Moulmein, and
also at Aden.      A tidal observatory, containing a self-registering tide-
gauge, and     all  the necessary meteorological      instruments, has been
established at each of these points ; every observatory has a man in
charge who      tends the instruments,     sets the diagrams to true time as
received   telegraphically from       Madras, and submits daily reports to
Major Baird.
   After the occurrence of the eruptions at Krakatoa, Major Baird
made a careful examination of the diagrams at the whole of his tidal
stations, seventeen in number, and at twelve of them he found more
or less  distinct evidence of tidal disturbance.        In the accompanying
report he sets forth this evidence, and gives such further facts as he
has been able to collect from information supplied by eye-witnesses
of the disturbances        on the coasts of Ceylon and at other localities
where as yet     tidal stations have not been established.     He also gives
                             "            "
the magnitudes of the          supertidal   waves and the intervals between
them ; shows by calculation the probable time of the great eruption
at Krakatoa ; and then deduces the velocities of the waves which
reached each station.        He furnishes copies, on a much reduced scale,
of the original diagrams of the tidal registrations of the 27th and
28th August which were made at each of his own stations ; and he
also gives a chart of a portion of the Indian Ocean which he has
prepared to illustrate the course of the first great supertidal wave.
    The testimony of the diagrams of self-registering tide-gauges must
ordinarily be expected to be much more precise and reliable than that
of eye-witnesses.         This may be more particularly claimed in the
present instance ; for the clocks of the gauges were carefully super
vised, and their times checked daily, at every station but Port Blair,
by Madras time        signals, and the diagrams are on so large a scale,
 60 inches in length by 24 in breadth, that any sensible variation of
sea-level is measurable on them ; for it is depicted on the full natural
 scale wherever the tide range does not exceed 5 feet, and on half
 that scale where the range exceeds 5 but does not exceed 10 feet, tho
 corresponding time scale being in all cases 1 inch to an hour ; and as
 the stations    at which the range of tide is less than 10 feet happen
 to be   those   at which the disturbances were greatest, very exact
 measures of the times and amplitudes of all the supertidal waves,
 whether small or great, are forthcoming for all the more important
 stations.    The diagrams accompanying Major Baird's report were
 intended for illustration rather than for measurement ; thus they have
 all been drawn on a much smaller scale than any of the originals,
                                                                   s 2

   250              Major A. W. Baird.     Report on   the       [Jan.  31,
  viz., the uniform scale of 1 ineh=3 feet for height and=6 hours for
  time.    The original diagrams are too bulky to be reproduced to full
  scale for publication ; but Major Baird presents in his report all the
  details which they furnish by giving the numerical elements of the
  time and height of every appreciable supertidal .wave, remarking,
  with characteristic modesty, that thus the whole of the facte will be
  available for the further treatment of the subject by more competent
  hands.
      The principal facts set forth by Major Baird are the following : —
    . 1st. The primary effect of the great eruption    at Krakatoa was a
  marked fall in the sea level — or in other words, the formation of a
  negative supertidal wave — at each of his stations.
      2ndly. This negative wave was succeeded by a great positive wave
  at an interval ranging from seventy-five minutes at Negapatam, the
  station nearest Krakatoa, to twenty-four minutes at Aden, the most
  distant station.
      3rd. Supertidal wavelets of greater or less magnitude were regis
  tered at the whole of the Indian stations some hours, more or less,
 before the effects of the great eruption ; they are evidences of ante
 cedent minor eruptions, the occurrence of which they would establish
 even in the absence of all other information on the subject.          The
 intervals between these warnings and the great eruption which they
 heralded range from about three hours at Aden, the most distant
 station, to eighteen hours at Negapatam, the nearest station. This
 shows that the explosions were at first comparatively faint and feeble,
 being felt only at the nearest stations, but afterwards they increased
 in intensity, becoming sensible      even at the most distant station
 three hours before the effects of the great eruption.
     4th. Great supertidal waves of amplitudes ranging from a maxi
 mum of 22 inches at Negapatam to a maximum of 9 inches at Aden,
 were registered at all the stations which were in a position to receive
 the full force of the eruptions at Krakatoa, unobstructed by the con
 figuration of the foreshore.    Other waves of less magnitude, ranging
 down to half the maxima values, occurred at these stations at intervals
 of one to two hours for about twelve hours after the first great wave.
     5th. The secondary     great waves were succeeded by wavelets
 gradually diminishing in size, but continuing for some time ; they
are traceable on the diagrams for the 29th and 30th August, the
 second and third days after the great eruption ; they cease first at
Port Blair about 8 P.M. of the 29th, at Negapatam at 4 a.m. of the
30th, and, lastly, at Aden at 5 p.m. of the 30th.
     6th. Loud reports resembling the firing of distant guns were heard
at Port Blair and on the Nicobar Islands on the 26th and 27th
August, and being supposed to be signals from a vessel in distress a
steamer was sent out in search of the vessel; similar reports were

  1884.]       Tidal Disturbances caused by Eruptions at Java.                   251.
 heard at two places on the coast         of Ceylon on the 26th, first at      6 p.m.
 and afterwards       at midnight.*
     These facts show clearly that the terrible eruption at Krakatoa,
 which carried desolation over the surrounding regions and was
 attended with such an appalling loss of life, was preceded for some
 hours by      minor eruptions which were insignificant only by comparison,
 for they produced effects which were sensible even at Aden, a distance
 of upwards of 4000 miles.             It is possible, therefore, that some at
 least of the       subsequent supertidal waves may be due to eruptions
 occurring subsequently to the great eruption.
     It is a singular fact that we are still without any precise and definite
 information of the time at which the great eruption took place.                   In
 a very interesting and suggestive note on the Barometrical Disturb
 ances    which passed over Europe between the 27th and 31st August —
 communicated to the Royal Society on the 12th December — General
 Strachey gives an investigation of the speed of barometric waves
 travelling from Krakatoa ronnd the earth, some from east to west,
 others from west to east, and he estimates that the great disturbance
 which caused the initial barometric rise probably occurred at 9 h. 24 m.
 local time on       the morning     of the 27th August. Now Major Baird
 nhows      that    the   primary effect of the groat eruption was to
 produce a recession or fall of the sea-level at each of his tidal
 stations, and this was also noticed at the Mauritius.                     It seems
 probable that the initial barometric rise occurred at the same time
 as the initial oceanic fall or great negative wave, which is shown to
have preceded the first great positive wave by an interval ranging
from 75 minutes at the nearest Indian station to " about a quarter of
             "
an hour         at the Mauritius. Major Baird has ascertained from Her
Majesty's Consul at Batavia that the first great positive wave reached
Batavia at 12 h. 10 m. mean local time on the afternoon of the
27th Angust ; he infers from the table of the velocities of free
tide waves in Sir George Airy's article on Tides and Waves in the
"Encyclopedia Metropolitana," that as the distance from Krakatoa
to Batavia is about 105 miles, and the average depth of the sea
between them 186 feet, the wave must have taken about two hours to
travel    that distance. Thus, allowing five minutes for difference of
longitude, the local time of the occurrence of the first great positive
wave at Krakatoa would be 10 h. 5 m. a.m., or about 1 h. 40 m.
later    than     General   Strachey's estimated time of the initial baro
metric      rise.    If, however, we assume this time to have been
identical with that of the initial oceanic fall, and to have preceded
the first great positive wave by an interval somewhat greater at
    * The
           times throughout Major Balrd's report are referred to the meridian of Port
BUir, in lat. 11° 41' N.. and long. 92° 45' E. of Greenwioh, the easternmost tidal
 station at which the tides were disturbed.

252         Tidal Disturbances caused by Eruption at Java.
Krakatoa than at the nearest Indian station — an inference to be drawn
from the fact that all the recorded intervals between the negative and
positive waves increase as the distances from the centre of disturbance
diminish — the difference between General Strachey and Major Baird
will practically disappear.        When we consider the absolute inde
pendence of the two methods of deduction which they have respec
tively employed, the facts of the one being derived from the atmosphere,
while those of the other are derived from the ocean, the coincidence
between the two results appears very striking.
    The Admiralty chart of the Eastern Archipelago shows that
Krakatoa is situated at the focus of what may be regarded as a
parabolic figure formed by the configuration of the contiguous
portions of the coasts of Java and Sumatra ; the axis of the figure is
directed westwards towards the Indian Ocean, and nearly at the apex
there is an opening to the north-east formed by the Straits of Sunda.
Thus the waves generated by an eruption at Krakatoa would be
mostly propelled towards the Indian Ocean, both directly and, though
in a minor degree, by reflection from the coasts ; the rush of waters
towards the coasts would only have one outlet, namely, the Straits of
Sunda, through which, as is well known, a great wave passed, carry
ing widespread destruction for some distance beyond, along the
contiguous coasts of Java and Sumatra.          This wave may possibly
have impinged with great force on the south-west coast of the island
of Borneo, which is on the prolongation of a straight line drawn from
Krakatoa through the Straits of Sunda.          But to the north-west, at
Singapore,    no   trace  of tidal disturbance appears to have been met
with ; a self-registering tide-gauge is established there, and the dis
tance from Krakatoa is less than one-third of that of the nearest
Indian station ; but the Master Attendant reports that the gauge
records " no difference whatever in the tide."       This may be due to
the fact that the wave through the Straits of Sunda, when it bent
round to the north-west towards Singapore, had but a shallow sea to
advance over, and its course must have been greatly impeded by the
numerous islands and shoals and the narrow straits and passages
between them     ;  thus it may have well broken up and disappeared     at
 some distance   short   of Singapore.
    In an appendix to his report, Major Baird gives the respective
 velocities with which the great primary positive wave travelled to
 Galle, the Mauritius, the coast of Africa, and three of his own
 stations.   He necessarily assumes that the as yet unknown time at
 which this wave issued from Krakatoa is to be fixed from the known
 time of its advent at Batavia, by deducting two hours from the latter
 in accordance with the velocity table in Airy's Tides and Wavrs
 already referred to.        He obtains for the maximum velocity 467
 statute miles per hour, both for Port Louis, in the Mauritius, distant

                                   Presents.                            253
3400    miles,   and for Port Elizabeth, in South Africa, distant 5450
miles ; that the same value should be obtained for two places, one of
which is 2050 miles further from the origin than the other, shows
that there is not likely to be any gross error in the time adopted for
the starting of the wave from Krakatoa ; the value is, moreover,
interesting in that it is practically identical with Airy's velocity of a
free tide-wave over an ocean 15,000 feet deep, which is approximately
the depth of the ocean on this line ; in other directions the velocities
are less, namely, towards Galle, 397 ; Negapatam,          355 ; and Aden
371 miles.       In the calculations the velocity has been assumed
 uniform in each instance, as a matter of convenience, but it must
in    reality   have  been   greatest wherever the ocean depth was
 greatest.     The greatest depth is known to occur on the lines to
 Porta Louis and Elizabeth, for which we have the greatest velo
 cities ; but the wave which impinged on the Indian stations, and
 eventually reached Aden must for a considerable portion of its
 course have been identical with the wave which impinged on Ports
 Louis and Elizabeth, and then it must have travelled with the same
 high velocity ; afterwards,      on passing over shallower oceans, its
 velocity must have been materially retarded, and may have fallen
 much below the averages, 355 to 397 miles, for the whole course.
 This appears probable, moreover, from the evidence of the earthquake
 in the Bay of Bengal on the 31st December, 1881, of which an
 account — communicated      by myself  — was published in the " Proceed
                                                 " for March, 1883. The
 ings    of the Asiatic    Society of Bengal
 position of the centre of impulse has been fairly well fixed at a point
 nearly on the line between Port Blair and Negapatam, and the time is
 known within a few minutes.         The supertidal waves caused by this
 earthquake at the contiguous tidal stations much exceeded in magni
 tude the waves caused at the same places by the eruption at Krakatoa,
 but their velocity was found to range between 240 and 120 miles an
 hour, varying with the general depth of the water traversed and the
 configuration of the foreshore at the respective stations.       It is pro
 bable, therefore, that for the latter portion of its course the wave from
 Krakatoa to the same stations travelled with no greater velocity than
 on the occasion of the earthquake     in the Bay of Bengal.

" On a New Standard of Illumination and the Measurement of
      Light." By William Henry Preece, F.R.S. Received
      and read June 21, 1883.
   1.  The present position of photometry as practically applied to
electric lighting is by no means in a satisfactory condition.           Mathe
matical accuracy in the measurement of the intensity of the light
emitted by a given source is unobtainable owing to the numerous
disturbing influences of quality and quantity which render impossible
any graduated scale of light. An absolute standard of light has not
yet been obtained.     I have long felt that to meet the case of electric

                  Illumination and       the Measurement  of Light.            271
light illumination we must not depend upon any direct comparison
between       the    light emitted by the source to      be measured and any
given recognised standard of light ; but that we should rather make
our standard of comparison an area illuminated to a given intensity
whatever be the source of light.                 We do not want to know so
much the intensity of the light emitted by a lamp, as the intensity
of illumination of the surface of the book we are reading, or of
the paper on which we are writing, or of the walls upon which
we hang        our pictures, or of the surface of the streets and of the
pavements upon which the busy traffic of cities circulates.                Illumi
nation of this character depends not on one source only, but on
many sources of light distributed in innumerable ways.                  Hence, I
propose to measure the illumination of surfaces quite independent of
the sourc-s of light by which they are illuminated.              The difficulties
hi comparing the illumination of spaces have hitherto been insur
mountable, but now, thanks to the beautiful little glow lamps intro
duced by Mr. Swan, these difficulties have disappeared.
     The standard I propose is the space illuminated by 1 British
standard candle at 12-7 inches distance, which is the same as the
illumination given by 1 French standard " bee
                                                         " on the same
                                                                          space at
1   metre distance.
     2.   The principle of measurement which guides us in nearly all the
methods at present in practical use is to compare two surfaces equally
illuminated to the same intensity by lights placed at different dis
tances, and to compare them by the law of inverse squares determined
by Kepler.         This law, however, assumes a clear space through which
the     light is transmitted,      and the emission of this light from a point.
Distance therefore          becomes essential, and the error introduced by
large flames or by the         diffusion of light becomes difficult to eliminate ;
indeed, by the present system it is well-nigh impossible to measure
 satisfactorily the light-giving power of several lamps distributed over
 a room or large area.           Moreover, the principle ignores the presence
 of different colours, and it involves the necessity, with electric arc
 lamps, of taking measurements at different angles.
     Up to the present time, the simplest and perhaps the most favourite
 mode of measurement is Rumford's plan of contrasting shadows, but
 Bouguer's method of comparing equally illuminated surfaces, as
 carried out by Ritchie and Bunsen, is also in great favour.
     3.   All these plans, however, are dependent upon the establishment
 of a uniform standard        of light. Although in England, Parliament has
 legalised    the standard candle, it has been found so inconvenient in
 practice, owing to its want of uniformity, that Mr. Vernon Harcourt
 has felt it advisable to replace the standard spermaceti candle with a
  flame resulting       from the combustion of pentane.       In France, again,
  the   standard is the Carcel      bee,  burning at the rate of O0042 kilo. of

272          Mr. W. H. Preece.       On a New Standard      of
pure colza oil per hour, with a flame of 40 millims. ; while Draper
 (1847), Zolluer (1859), and Schwendler (1879) proposed a given
length or surface of platinum raised to incandescence by a current of
electricity as a useful standard.    At the Congress held in Paris last
year it was suggested that a convenient standard would be the light
emitted by a square centimetre of incandescent platinum maintained
at its fusing point, but up to the present moment no one seems to
have devised what really may be called an absolute standard of white
light. The question is now being considered by a Committee of the
British Association.    If it were possible to find a convenient, simple,
fixed, and uniform material which, having a resistance of 1 ohm,
could be raised to incandescence by 1 ampere flowing through it, we
should have a convenient        standard, but this has not yet been
obtained.
    As I have said, the standard of comparison   I propose is a uniformly
illuminated surface.    I thought at one time that we might have made
use of sunlight for this purpose, but I find that sunlight and moon
light are even more variable than the light produced by artificial
means, and, after innumerable trials, I have come to the conclusion
                           I
that the standard which have proposed is one very easily obtained,
and though not absolutely fixed, can be made as nearly uniform and
reproducible as any standard hitherto suggested.      It is true that it is
of a secondary character, and dependent primarily upon a recognised
standard source of light ; but this primary standard remains in the
laboratory, while the measurement can be made in the streets, on
board ship, or wherever the surface of illumination may be.
    4. Having thus fixed upon a standard of illumination it became
desirable to devise an instrument that would enable us to compare
areas differently illuminated.

secondary battery (e, fig. 2) which enables us to transmit a current of
any desired strength through the glow lamp (L).           A rheostat (R)
is fixed in circuit with this battery, and enables the current to be

   For laboratory purposes a more accurate mode of measuring the
intensity of the current is the following :* —
   G is a galvanometer wound with two coils, one (s) consisting of a
short length of thick wire, and the other (r) of a long length of thiu
wire.   In circuit with the latter coil is a resistance, p, and a standard
battery E.
  The relative deflective values of the coils                      s   and   r for similar currents
being as 1 to n, then when balance is obtained on the galvanometer,
the current C flowing through the coil * will be —
r being the resistance of the galvanometer coil and battery, and E the
E.M.F. of the battery E.
   Thus if the relative deflective values of the coils s and r are as 1 to
473, that     is,   if   n=473, then           if   E consist, say, of a 5-cell Daniell

by means of the rheostat (R) to lower or increase the current passing
through the lamp until the grease spot, when viewed through the
eyepiece, becomes invisible, then the light reflected on the diaphragm
and transmitted through the grease spot by the distant surface of
drawing paper will be equal to the light thrown upon the opposite
side of the diaphragm by the glow lamp.     The current producing
the light thus becomes      measure of the illumination of the
                                        a
screen.
   The following measurements were made to determine the current
that gave various degrees of illumination — the source of light being
a   standard candle.

    From these experiments it appears that the illuminating power of
the glow lamp increases in tho ratio of the sixth power of tho current.
Hence it is only necessary to read the current that gives the necessary
equivalent to determine the degree of illumination.
    The current in amperes thus gives, for the particular glow lamp
employed, a number whose sixth power expresses the amount of the
illumination measured.
    The apparatus works with ease and regularity, but it has this
difficulty — that it is dependent upon the constancy of the lamp, a
point not yet absolutely attained.               The glass envelope of the lamp
becomes deadened by use ; the carbon fibre of the lamp gradually
becomes        deteriorated ; and the vacuum sometimes fails.                      These
operations, however, are very slow ones, and it is only necessary
occasionally to compare either the light given by unit current with
that in the laboratory thrown upon a surface by a standard candle or
by one of Mr. Vernon Harcourt's pentane lamps.
    It is, however, certain from numerous experiments and practical
trials that the light produced by the incandoscenco of a given carbon
filament due to the passage of a given current is more easily repro
duced from one time to another, and is more uniform                    than probably
any other artificial standard of light.

    Suppose that in any of these cases any particular integral of the
 equation in X is taken.
    It is shown that the components of the velocity can be expressed in
 terms of X and differential coefficients of X, and that the current
function is also known.
     In the case of a fluid, part of which is moving rotationally and
 part irrotationally, the boundary surface separating the rotationally
 moving fluid from that which is moving irrotationally contains the
 same vortex lines, and may be taken as the surface X=0.
    Now, if the integral taken of the equation in X do actually corre
spond to a case      of fluid motion in which part of the fluid is moving
 rotationally and part irrotationally, the most obvious way to find the
 irrotational motion will be to find its current function from the con
ditions supplied by the fact that the components of the velocity are
continuous at the surface X=0.             If after taking any integral of the
equation     in  X  it  be  found  theoretically impossible to determine the
current function of an irrotational motion outside the surface X=0,
which shall be continuous with the rotational motion inside it, then
the integral in question does not correspond to such a case of fluid
motion.
    In this method no assumption is made           as to the distribution of the
 vortex lines (as in the method of Helmholtz) before commencing the
determination of the irrotational motion.
    On the other hand, it is not a particular case of a method applicable
to motion     in space of three dimensions.
    But it can be shown that Clebsch's forms for the components of
the velocity do also lead to a method which is applicable to the deter
mination of the irrotational motion when the rotational motion in
space of three dimensions is known.
    For the rotational motion being known, the components of the
velocity are known for this part of the fluid.             Let the components
of the velocity be expressed in Clebsch's forms, so that x.

  The most obvious way of obtaining the velocity potential will be to
apply Helmholtz's method of finding the components of the velocity in
terms of the supposed distribution of magnetic matter throughout the
space occupied by the rotationally moving fluid.
   It must, however, be remembered, as     remarked by Mr. Hicks in

the velocity of  arotational motion, satisfying the equations of motion
throughout   afinite portion of the plane of x, y, are found.  Thus the
distribution of vortex lines, and, therefore, that of the supposed
magnetic matter over     finite portion of the plane of x,

   One set of the surfaces which always contain the same vortex lines
is given by ar2(z— Z)3 + 6(r2— a*)s=const.
   If the constant be                  the equation represents ring-shaped
surfaces.
   The   above expressions   for the components of the velocity determine
a possible case of rotational motion inside the hollow smooth rigid
surface of annular form whose equation is at3(z — Z)J+6(ra—
const., and which moves parallel to the axis of z with velocity Z.
   The values of x¦ ^, ^ of Clebsch's forms of expression for the com
ponents of the velocity are calculated, but the writer has not succeeded
in finding an irrotational motion outside one of the above annular
vortex sheets continuous with the rotational motion inside it.
   Could the solution be completed it would amount to a discussion
of the motion of an annular vortex, all of whose parts are of finite

II. " Supplementary      Note on the Constitution of Chlorophyll."
    By   Edward Schunck, F.R.S. Received February 6, 1884.
    After the reading of the note on  chlorophyll at the meeting of the
Society on December 13th, I was reminded by Professor Stokes that
he and others had succeeded in separating the complex to which the
term chlorophyll had previously been applied into two substances, or
rather groups of substances, one characterised by its green colour and
red fluorescence, the other showing a more distinctly yellow colour
without fluorescence, and he suggested to me that it would be advis
able to ascertain whether the property of yielding glucose by decom
position with acids might not belong to one of these substances or
groups of substances only. Professor Stokes at the same time kindly
communicated to me the details of the process whereby he succeeded
in effecting the separation referred to, a process depending on the
action of carbon disulphide in removing some of the bodies contained
in an alcoholic solution of crude chlorophyll in preference to others.
The process employed for    the same purpose by Mr. Sorby is essentially
 the same.
    Before applying disulphide of carbon to an alcoholic extract of green
 leaves according to the process of Professor Stokes, it was necessary
 first to remove the ready-formed glucose, tannin, and other matters
soluble in water, which almost always exist in such extracts, and
 which would by their presence have rendered the result of the experi
 ment quite uncertain.     This was done in the way      I  have already
 described.     An ethereal solution of chlorophyll prepared by my
 method was evaporated, and the residue having been dissolved iu
alcohol, the solution was mixed with a quantity of carbon disulphide
larger than the alcohol would dissolve, and the mixture well shaken.
 The carbon disulphide acquired a dark green colour, while the super
natant alcoholic liquid, containing principally the xanthophyll of
 Professor Stokes and Mr. Sorby, was yellow with a tinge of green.
 The two liquids having been separated, the lower dark green one was
 washed several times with alcohol to remove any of the xanthophyll
 that might still be present, and having then been mixed with a large
 quantity of alcohol, a current .of air was passed through it to remove
 the excess of carbon disulphide as directed by Professor Stokes.      In
 this way I obtained two liquids, one intensely green, the other deep
 yellow with only a tinge of green. The two liquids were fonnd to
 contain    substances essentially different   so far as regards     their
  products   of decomposition  with  acids.  The   yellow liquid having
  been mixed with dilute sulphuric acid was evaporated in the water-
  bath, water being added during evaporation, until the liquid had lost
  nearly all its colour.  A quantity of yellow fatty matter separated

 286       Mr. E. Schunck.     Constitution of Chlorophyll.      [Feb. 7,
during evaporation, and this having been filtered off the liquid was
found to contain an abundance of glucose. The yellow fatty matter ,
insoluble in water, dissolved easily in alcohol, but the yellow solution
showed none of the characteristic absorption bands of " acid chloro
phyll." The dark green liquid, treated in exactly the same way,
yielded a dark green product insoluble in water.       The filtrate from
this gave a slight reaction with Fehling's solution, but so trifling
comparatively that I am inclined to attribute it to the presence of
some substance not completely removed from the disulphide of carbon
solution by washing with alcohol.       The dark green product of tbe
action of acid insoluble in water was soluble, though with difficulty,
in boiling alcohol, the solution being dull green and showing the
                            " acid chlorophyll." If, therefore, chloro
absorption bands due to
phyll be defined as the constituent of the green parts of plants, which
gives a spectrum showing the well-known bands at the red end, and
yields by decomposition with acids the product or products going by
               "
the name of acid chlorophyll," of which Fremy's phyllocyanin is the
most important and most characteristic, then chlorophyll is not a>
glucoside.    The glucoside which accompanies it and resembles it as
regards solubility in various menstrua may have to be sought among
the group of bodies to which the generic name of xanthophyll has
been applied.

 I. " On a New Reflecting Galvanometer of Great Sensibility,
      and on New Forms of Astatic Galvanometers."       By
      Thomas Gray, B.Sc, F.R.S.E., and Andrew Gray, M.A.,
      F.R.S.E. Communicated by Prof. Sir WTlLIAM THOMSON,
      F.R.S. Received February 5, 1884.
   The object of this paper      is,
                                 first, to describe a galvanometer in
which a principle which    is,
                            we believe, novel in its application to this
particular purpose, has been employed to give an instrument of very
great sensibility and, second, to describe some forms of astatic gal
                   ;
vanometers which are, we think, improvements on astatic combina
tions as ordinarily made and arranged for use.
   Fig.   shows in elevation and horizontal section the coils and
          1
arrangement of needles adopted in an instrument of very great sensi
bility which we designed in the summer of 1882, and which with
assistance from the Government Research Fund, we have had con
structed for use in our experiments on the Electric Resistance of
Glass and Allied Substances.     Itconsists of two pairs of coils,          c
                                                                            c
                                                                            c     c,
with hollow cores, arranged   so that the axes of each pair are parallel
and in a vertical plane.    Each pair       carried by a vertical brass
                                               is
plate, and the two plates are inclined to one another at an angle of
about 106° and thus the vertical planes containing the axes of the
              ;
coils are iuclined to one another at an angle of about 74°.        Two
horseshoe magnets, to, to, made of steel wire of about      millim. in  1
diameter, are connected together by a very light frame of aluminium,
and are at such   distance apart as to hang, when the needle system
                  a
is  in equilibrium, with no current in the coils, freely within and
nearly along the axes of the cores of the coils.   The horseshoes are
not plane, but are bent round so that they form approximately
portions of one vertical cylinder of which the suspension-thread   the      is
axis, and to which the axes of the coils form horizontal tangents near
their middle points at the approximate positions of the poles of the
needles.   This form was given to the needles to lessen the chance of

their extremities    coming into contact with the sides of the cores,
in the case    of large deflections ; and it was intended to curve the
axes of the coils similarly, to allow of the use of, as short               as
possible,  a connecting-bar    of  aluminium.     Straight   cores  are  more
easily made ; but the diagram shows clearly that in this case, since it
is advantageous to have the cores of the coils as small as possible,
it is necessary to curve the needle.          The needles are at present
arranged with their unlike poles turned in similar directions, and are
hung by a single fibre of unspun silk from the square screw-pin, p.
A nut, n, working between two fixed projecting pieces raises or lowers
p, and therefore the needles, without giving any twist to the thread.
   The four coils are at present arranged in series, and have a com
bined resistance of 30,220 ohms made up of 5,392 yards of copper-
wire of No. 50 B.W.G., laid on in 62,939 turns in all, approximately
equally divided among the four coils.              The distributing plate,
described below, admits of ready joining of the coils in such a way as
to diminish the sensibility or resistance of the instrument.          When a
current is sent through the instrument, the poles of one horseshoe are
pulled farther into the corresponding coils, and the poles of the other
horseshoe are pushed out of the coils.        A couple tending to turn the
system    as nearly   as  may  be  round   the  axis of suspension is thus
applied ; and a mirror attached to the upright piece of aluminium, a,
reflects a beam of light to a scale in the usual manner, to give o
means of measuring the deflection.       According to one arrangement of
the instrument, the magnet M, carried in a horizontal position by
the brass rod above the needles, is used to give a return couple,
and to control the zero conveniently can be turned in azimuth by
means of the tangent-screw t.         The instrument is fitted with three
terminals    T, Tlt Ta,  so that  it can  be used as described     below as a
differential galvanometer.       These terminals and the connecting-wires
are carefully insulated by vulcanite.          As thus arranged we can
easily give this instrument a sensibility so great as to give a deflection
of one   division (^-millim.) on a scale at a distance of rather more
than a metre, with one Daniell's cell and a total               resistance of
10n ohms in direct circuit ; a degree of sensibility which, we think,
could not be reached with the most sensitive astatic instruments as
ordinarily constructed.      "With special adjustments of the needles, we
can obtain still greater sensibility, but the period of oscillation of the
needles becomes then so great as to be troublesome when results have
to be   rapidly obtained. The instrument, however, has a very high
sensibility for most purposes to which it can be applied, with at the
same time a period of free vibration which is not inconveniently         long.
We have found it very convenient in our experiments on the resist"
ance of glass at different temperatures, in the course of which, though
 not arranged for very high sensibility, it has been used with a battery
                                                                 I  2

  of about 120 Daniells to measure resistances         of from 10* to 10s
  megohms.
     To increase the rapidity with which observations can be taken, the
  instrument can be fitted with a vane immersed in a liquid ; or placed
  in a nearly closed air-chamber of proper dimensions.
     In another form of the instrument (fig. 2), of which an example is
  being completed for Sir William Thomson for use as a ballistic
  instrument, the four coils are arranged symmetrically in one plane,
  and a horizontal curved (slightly S or Z shaped) bar or frame of
  aluminium used to carry the vertical horseshoes. This frame passes
  through from one side to the other of the plate carrying the coils, so
  that one horseshoe enters its pair of coils from one side, and the other
  horseshoe its pair of coils from the other side. The coils are joined
 so that when a current is sent through the instrument both horseshoes
 are dragged further into their coils, or both pushed out at the same
 time. The needle system is thus turned round the suspension fibre, and
 the deflection is measured by means of a mirror and scale as before.
     This form of the instrument has the advantage of being more
 compact and more easily constructed, and of admitting of readier
 adjustment of the magnets relatively to the hollow cores of the
 bobbins.     The cores are made somewhat " trumpet-shaped " where
 the needles enter. Of course as the instrument which is being made
 is to be used for ballistic experiments, the cores have not been
 formed of metal tubes as in the instrument already described.
    The chief advantage of the arrangement of coils and needles
 described above is that a great portion of the wire of the coils is
 placed very near to the poles of the needles, and in a very favourable
 position for exerting the electro-magnetic        action required.     The
 instrument, particularly the form shown in fig. 2, is very easily made,
and does not cost more than an instrument of the ordinary kind.           Of
course a single horseshoe, or S or Z shaped bar, might be placed
horizontally, and acted on by a pair of coils, and the principle thus
applied to a single needle non-astatic instrument.        In astatic instru
ments, however, of this form it is decidedly preferable, as shown
below, to use vertical needles.
    It is to be observed that if the line joining the poles or centres of
gravity of magnetic polarity in each horseshoe be vertical, the system
is perfectly astatic for a uniform field, for each vertical horseshoe is
itself perfectly astatic.     The pair of horseshoe needles can thus bo
adjusted to have as nearly as may be perfect astaticism in a uniform
field, and thus made to preserve a nearly constant zero when under
directive force, a result which it is exceedingly difficult to obtain in
the ordinary arrangement of horizontal needles, and which certainly
rarely exists when    a horizontal  magnet or magnets placed above or in
an unsymmetrical       position  relatively to the needles is employed to

regulate the sensibility, as then one of the needles most be magnetized
and the other demagnetized to a greater or less extent, depending on
the position of the magnet.        According to this latter arrangement,
if we suppose the needles to be parallel or nearly so, and           I  to be
the magnetic field intensity at the upper needle, I' that at the lower
needle in the same direction, m the magnetic moment of the upper
needle, m! that of the lower needle, C the current flowing, 0 the
deflection produced, and K a constant, we have —
                                tt-Ito — I'm' tan
                                              ,   .

                                     ni+m
    Slight changes in m or ml or in both may, therefore, affect the con
stant of the ordinary instrument very seriously, and as a matter of
fact its constant has to be continually redetermined, and instead of
preserving a practically constant zero, it is very sensitive to magnetic
disturbances in the neighbourhood.
    In the case, however, of needles adjusted to be accurately vertical
these disadvantages do not exist.         The needles cannot be affected in
the same way by directing magnets and retain their astaticism for
uniform field, I, I' being the horizontal field intensities at the upper
and lower extremities of the needles, C the current strength, 0 the
deflection of the needles, and K a constant depending on the coils,
 we have approximately    —
                             C=K(I-I')       sin0.
    The sensibility of the instrument can, therefore, be increased to
any desired extent by placing the magnet M at a greater distance
from the needles (or by counteracting its action by a smaller magnet
                                                      I
 placed nearer to the needles) so as to make — I' sufficiently small.
 Further, variations of the strength of the horseshoe needles produce
 no effect unless    they consist of changes of magnetic distribution,
 which may produce a deviation from perfect astaticism.           When the
 instrument is properly adjusted and the needles are as nearly as
 possible uniformly magnetized, but little disturbance of this kind can
 be produced by the magnetizing action of the coils, since both poles of
 each have their magnetism augmented or both diminished at the same
 time in the arrangement of fig. 2, or both poles of one are magnetized
 more intensely in some degree, and both poles of the other weakened
in the arrangement of fig. 1.
    Another possible arrangement of such a system of needles is with
 like poles turned in similar directions.       The system will still be per
 fectly   astatic if  properly adjusted ;     and   to give a return couple

 horizontally in the vertical plane at right angles to the front of the
 instrument, in a line passing through the suspension thread.          If this

magnet be placed nearer to say the lower ends than the upper ends
of   the needles, and the polarity of the end turned towards the needles
be of the same name as that of the nearer ends of the needles, they
will have a position of stable equilibrium when no current is flowing,
with a horizontal line joining a pole of each needle at right angles to
the direction of the magnet. The accurate law of variation of deflec
tion with current is, however, in this case more complicated, and the
instrument in some cases might have to be graduated by experiments
with known currents of different amounts. Any change also of the
magnetic distribution of the controlling magnet would affect the
indications       of the instrument.
    We propose in          some cases to hang the needle system                 in a uniform
field,      and   to use a small needle rigidly connected with it, but
placed so as not to be perceptibly affected by the coils, to give direc
tive force to the magnetic system.                          This arrangement, of course,
would not be astatic, but would give great sensibility on account of
the leverage of the horseshoe needles as arranged.
    Thus if m denote the magnetic moment of the small needle, H the
horizontal component of the earth's magnetic force, k a constant
depending on the coils, 0 the strength of pole of each of the horse
shoes (supposed of equal strength), and d the distance of these poles
from the suspension thread, we have, since the deflection is small, for
the turning couple exerted by the coils 4,Gk<fjd, and for the return
couple niELO, and therefore             —
                                                    4,k<fid
     Of course this arrangement is applicable whether like or unlike
poles are turned            in similar directions.            It has the disadvantage that
any change          of   m    or  0  or  of  both     would     affect the constant of the
instrument.*
     The sensibility of any of these arrangements might also be increased
by bringing out a very light arm, say from the middle of the cross
bar connecting the horseshoes, or from any other convenient point,
and hanging the mirror by means of a bifilar, one thread of which
    • Note added March 20, 1884. — Wo propose to mount this small needle in such
a way that it can be turned round a horizontal axis at right angles to its length, and
also round a vertical axis, so that by means of this needlo alone both the sensibility
and the zero of the instrument can be adjusted.                 When the galvanometer is not
 intended    for ballistic   experiments,   the frame on which the small needle is mounted
 may conveniently be immersed           in a liquid and made to act as a vane for bringing
 the needle system quickly to rest.
    It  is to be observed that, in consequence        of the horseshoe needles being placed in
 these instruments at a considerable           distance    from the axis of suspension, a very
 small value of I— I' is sufficient to give the needle system such a directive force
 as to prevent any great error due to the rigidity or the viscosity of the suspending
 fibre.

   lastly, we desire to propose one or two modifications of the instru

cores and horseshoe needles as described, eight coils might be used —

needles,  if their like poles are turned  in dissimilar directions, or any
other arrangement may be used, and a current is sent through the
 coils in any desired way by means of a distributing plate or other
wise.
   We think that for cable-testing instruments of high resistance, or
for ballistic instruments, an instrument of this form, or of the follow
ing still simpler form, might be found advantageous.
   Astatic galvanometers of Sir "William Thomson's pattern are
usually made with two coils, one above the other, split into four by a
narrow vertical space in which the needle system is suspended, and
which admits of the ready removal of the needles for adjustment.
We propose to hang in this space, in a plane nearly parallel (when no
current is flowing) to the two coils, two thin magnetic needles of steel
wire side by side, kept with their lengths accurately vertical, and at a
short distance apart (say     J or § of an inch) by light aluminium, or
other non-magnetic bars. Such a system of needles with unlike poles
turned in similar directions would plainly experience a similar electro
magnetic action to that exerted by the coils on the needles in the
ordinary so-called astatic combination.       But two straight vertical
needles would plainly be perfectly astatic in a uniform magnetic field ;
and this astaticism for uniform field would not be liable to disturbance
from any arrangement of magnets applied to give directive force to
the system, as for example one or more magnets directing the system by
means of a more powerful action at one end of the needle system than
at the other as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, or magnets arranged symmetri
cally with respect to both ends of the needles. An instrument with
such a system of needles ought therefore to be subject to but slight, if
any, disturbance in ordinary circumstances of sensibility when masses
of steel or iron are being moved about at some little distance, and
would we think be found useful in such cases, as for example in cable
testing rooms.
   We may, perhaps, be allowed to state in conclusion that with the
instrument described above and shown in Fig. 1, we have been able
to measure the resistance at temperatures of from 100° to 150° C.
of small globular flasks (about 3 inches in diameter) of good flint
glass of considerable thickness.        Some of these flasks have been
analysed    under   the superintendence of Mr. James J. Dobbie, D.Sc,
Assistant to the Professor of Chemistry in the University of Glasgow.
Dr. Dobbie has joined us in our experiments on the Resistance and
Specific Inductive Capacity of Glass and Allied Substances; and we
have in preparation a joint paper embodying the results of our
preliminary experiments, which we hope soon to present to the Royal
Society.

 II.  " A New Form of Spring for Electric and other Measuring
       Instruments." By Professors W. E. Ayrton, F.R.S., and
       John Perry, M.E. Received February 6, 1884.
    In steam and   gas engine indicators, the pressure of the fluid on a
 piston  produces  a  slight shortening of a spiral spring which is mag
nified by a lever, and so the pressure of the steam or gas is recorded.
 In what are usually known        as  spring balances there is also occasion
ally a magnification of the elongation of a spiral spring effected by the
use of a rack and pinion.        Such magnifying arrangements, however,
not only introduce inaccuracy by the bad fitting of hinges or of teeth,
an inaccuracy   which is aggravated by wear, but they increase the cost
of measuring instruments and their liability to get out of order.
   And, as an example of the difficulty of using a wheel and pinion
for the magnification of an angular motion produced by a small force,
we may mention that although we used this plan for a year or more
in our electric measuring instruments, and although the wheels and
pinions were made by a good watchmaker, still the friction involved
in such a plan has induced us to abandon it in favour of the new
arrangement which is the subject of this communication.
   The telescopic method employed by Weber, and the spot of light
method due to Sir W. Thomson for magnifying the effect of an
angular motion are, of course, unequalled for stationary measuring
instruments, but for instruments which must be carried about and
used quickly without the necessity of adjustment, these most ingenious
reflecting methods are quite unsuitable.
   With an ordinary cylindric spring, having a small angle between
the osculating plane and a plane perpendicular to the axis, as is the
case with all spiral springs such as are in practical use, and of which
fig. 1 is an example,    it is well known that but very little rotation is
produced between its ends by the application of an axial force.         Con
sequently with such springs, it is only possible to obtain magnification
by the employment of a system of levers, or of a rack and pinion.
It occurred to    us,   therefore,   to consider whether it would not be
possible to make a spiral spring of such a nature that for a com
paratively small axial motion of its ends there should be considerable
rotation of one end relatively to the other, and by the employment of
which all levers, racks, and pinions could be dispensed with, so that
no error could be introduced       by wear and tear, or by want of fitting
of joints, and further so that the temperature correction shonld be
merely one affecting the rigidity of the material used as a spring,
and not a correction such as has to be applied in consequence of the
contractions and expansions of the various parts of an ordinary
magnifying apparatus.

   In  order to ascertain this fact, it is necessary to consider what are
 the general laws governing the behaviour of spiral springs.       Let the
 centres of all cross sections of the wire, or strip, forming the spring
lie on a right circular cylinder of radius r, let the spiral have every
where an inclination * to the plane perpendicular to the axis of the
 cylinder, and let a force F act at one end of the spring along the axis,
 the other end of the spring being fixed.
    In the cross section of ihe wire at any point P (fig. 2), we have,
 due to the axial force F, tensile stress whose effect in deforming the
spring may    be neglected in comparison with the      other effects to be
described, and we have the stresses produced by        a couple  Fr acting
about the axis PM. PS, PM, and PU are all in a         plane tangential  to
the cylinder at the point P, PM being drawn in         this plane perpen
dicular to the axis of the cylinder, PU tangential      to the spiral line,
and   PS perpendicular to PU.
   This couple is equivalent to the couple   Fr cos «, which is a twisting
couple about the axis PU, and to Fr sin «, a bending couple about the
axis PS.    If now B is the flexural rigidity of the wire in the oscu
lating plane, and if A is the torsional rigidity about the spiral line at
P  we have —
                                  Fr cos a.

at their ends is investigated, and we might have obtained equations
(1) and (2) from the general result of that investigation given in
Article 607, but we have preferred to deduce these two equations from
first principles.
   The general expression worked out by M. de St. Venant for A
for a prism of rectangular section involves an infinite series, and
its use would give rise to mathematical expressions of an unwieldy
character in an investigation      like the present.   We have, there
fore, decided     to consider our strip of which  the new   spring is to
be made as having an elliptic section.         We may mention, how
ever, for the benefit of students, that an examination of the expres
sion given by Thomson and Tait, "Nat. Phil.," vol. i, for the tor
sional rigidity of a prism of rectangular section has led us, we
believe, to detect two errors in it ; one is a misprint of no6, for nab5,

   The twisting torque to which the spring is subjected is Fr cos c,
and the bending torque to Fr sin a. But the twist must be multi
plied hy sin a, and the bend by cos a when we project these motions
on a horizontal plane. So far then as the total rotation in a horizontal
plane of the free end of the spring relatively to the fixed end is con
cerned, it may be regarded as being produced by equal twisting and
bending torques, each of them equal to Fr sin a cos a ; and the total
rotation of the free end of the spring relatively to the fixed end, -which
is the special feature of the springs we are considering, is proportional
to the difference between the two angular rotations produced in the
wire by these equal bending and twisting torques.        The twist alone
would cause an increase in the number of coils, that     a rotation in the
                                                        is,
direction of coiling which  is what we call positive, while the bending,
or rather the unbending, alone would cause a negative rotation, or
one tending to uncoil the spring.     When both occur together in the
actual spiral spring subjected to an axial force the total rotation     is
positive or negative, according as the angular twist or the angular
bend  isthe greater.  Hence the flexural and torsional rigidities of the
wire alone determine whether the rotation    positive or negative.
                                             is
  It well known, for example, that when a wire of circular section
      is
issubjected to equal twisting and bending torques the twist     is
                                                                 greater
than the bending for almost all substances, that is, substances in
which the ratio of the modulus of rigidity to Young's modulus           is

between    one-third and one-half.       Hence we may expect that in a
spring made of round wire, and with the spires making an angle of
45° with a plane perpendicular to the axis, the total rotation will
be positive for an axial force applied so as to lengthen the spring.
And experiment shows that this is the case.
    If the wire be flattened and bent so that the flat side of the strip
touches the cylinder on which the wire is coiled, as shown in tig. 3,
then the arrangement is such that the bending is greater than the
twist. Hence an axial force applied so as to lengthen this spring
causes a negative rotation, whereas if the strip be coiled as in fig. 4,
so that the edge of the strip lies against the cylinder on which it is
coiled, an axial force similarly applied will now cause a positive rota
tion. It is almost certain that for any strip of material the positive
value of <p obtained with the latter form of spring is likely to be
greater than the corresponding negative value with the former kind,
but the difficulty of manufacturing the second form of spring, where
k has a very small value, has compelled us to confine our attention to
the former type.
    Permanent Set. — Having constructed some very delicate springs of
this kind, one of the first difficulties which we met with arose from
their liability to acquire a permanent set, so that it has been necessary
to determine the dimensions of the spring which will give the largest
amount of rotation with tho minimum amount                   of stress in the
material.

   We have already seen, from (3), that to merely make 0 a maximum
for a given axial force, a ought to be 45°, and I and r as great as
possible.
  We are therefore led from three considerations                                     —
  1.   That an axial force shall produce a maximum relative rotation ;
  2.   That the rotation shall be great without producing permanent
      set in the material ;
   3. That the rotation shall be great in comparison with the elonga
      tion of the spring ;
to make the angle of the spiral about 45°.
   Further, to produce the first two of these conditions, it will be
observed that the length of the wire forming the spring ought to be
great, while the third condition is independent of the length.
   Next, with regard to the proper radius r to give to the coils of the
spring.          <jj   increases with r,         -     is    independent            of   r,     and   ^   varies in-

to enable us to determine readily the ratio of the modulus of rigidity,
N, to Young's modulus of elasticity, E, for any material.               It is well
known that the celebrated conclusion of MM. Navier and Poisson
from Boscovich's molecular theory requires that the ratio of E to N
 should be 2-5 for all solids.        Professor Stokes showed that this con
clusion was impossible if its authors supposed it to apply to jellies
and to india-rubber, and that it was probably untrue in the case of
metals ; and Wertheim, Kirchhoff, Thomson, Everett, and others have
experimentally shown its untruth in the case of brass, iron, copper, and
glass.      In pursuance of the present investigation it has struck us that
this ratio may be most conveniently determined by the use of our
 springs from one experiment.

to the framework of the instrument.      The rod attached to the glass,
and to which the upper end of the spring is attached, also serves as a
gnide to the top of the iron tube. In the space FF a solenoid wire or
strip is wound, its ends being attached to the terminals shown. Hence
when a current is passed through the wire, the iron tube is sucked
into the solenoid, and its lower end G, to which the spring is attached,
receives a large rotatory motion, which is communicated directly to
the pointer attached to the top of the iron tube.    Parallax in taking

   o btain a large          rotation with minimum      stress, and with not too
   much axial motion of the free end of the spring, we have succeeded
  in obtaining deflections up to 270° directly proportional to the
   current, and without any permanent set being given to the spring.
       To prevent a spring taking a permanent set for a large deflection, it
  is of great importance            that the spring after being delivered by the
   maker should receive a large degree of permanent set in the direction
   in which we wish it to be afterwards strained in ordinary working.
     -In spite of the fact that Professor J. Thomson in the " Cambridge
  and Dublin Math. Journ.," November, 1848, explained the importance
   of initial strains in materials, the reason is not yet sufficiently well
   understood why when a round bar has been well twisted beyond the
  limit of permanent set in a certain direction it has twice as much
  elastic strength to resist torsion in this direction as in the opposite
  direction.         Now in the very act of manufacturing our springs, that
  is in the bending of the strip, the material acquires strains which are
  just opposite in character to the initial strains which we wish it to
  possess, for, as already explained, if the spring be constructed as in
   fig. 3, an extension of the spring produces a rotation tending to
           I it.    Hence a spring must not be regarded as ready for use until
                  : a good set by means of a weight hung from its end.
      Theory of the Solenoid Spring Ammeter or Voltmeter. — If C is the
 current        in amperes flowing through the coil, the attractive force on
 the    iron core is
                                          l+sc'
 where S is a constant, which is the greater as the current is smaller
  for which the iron tube AA, fig. 7, becomes saturated with magnetism.
  The position of this iron core in the solenoid is so selected that K
 remains practically constant throughout the small range of downward
 motion of the core.
      Since the rotation 0 has been produced by an axial force, we know
 from the theory of the spring already given, that this axial force is
jxj>,  where jp       is some constant.   Hence

adopted a different and somewhat special form of construction, which
is shown in fig.    by means of which the instrument

extent shielded from even powerful external magnetic fields.     In this
instrument   the electromagnet consists of      hollow core, part of

lated wire in electrical connexion with the terminal, so that when a
current    sent through the instrument an intense magnetic field is

formed between D and E, which are the poles of the electromagnet.
To the iron tube AA, also made of charcoal iron, the spiral spring, in
this case made of extremely thin hard steel, is attached, the other end
being attached to the piece F, which is fixed relatively to the bobbin.
The spindle GG, which is fixed to the moving iron core AA, moves
freely in bearings HH, so that the only movements of which A is
capable are one of rotation and one parallel to the axis of the bobbin.
As the iron core A projects into the strong magnetic field between D
and E it is strongly attracted towards E when the current flows, and,
as before, causes a large rotation of the pointer P over the scale.      As
a means of varying the power of the instrument an adjustable iron
piece K is provided, which can be screwed nearer to or farther from
the core A, and by the use of which the sensibility of the instrument
can be adjusted so as to make the instrument " direct reading," that
is to say, each division of the scale can be made to correspond with
1 ampere of current, or 1 volt difference of potential, and the employ
ment of a constant such as T34 amperes, or volts, per degree, which
has hitherto been necessary with our measuring instruments, is now
avoided.     This power of adjustment produced by the use of the
movable iron piece K, combined with the ease with which more or
      wire can be wound on to the instrument, which also constitutes a
second adjustment of sensibility, is of considerable importance, since
the employment of a constant has not only led to error and delay in
measurements made in electric light factories, but has caused the
breakage of the pointer or the destruction of an instrument from a far
too powerful current being sent through it by an observer (often a
man with little experience in the employment of instruments) having
confounded the constant of some other instrument with that of the
 one he was using.
    The steel strip used in the construction of the spring for these
 shielded instruments is 0'0017 inch thick, and in a book just pub
 lished on "Steel and Iron," by Mr. Greenwood, he mentions that
 some specimens of remarkably thin steel, y^j of an inch, were shown
 in the Paris Exhibition, so that steel we are using is nearly as thin as
 that referred to by Mr. Greenwood.      But within the last few days we
 have received from Mr. Charles    Jowitt, of Sheffield, a specimen of steel
 rolled for us only just over 0'OOl inch in thickness, which is perhaps
 the thinnest steel yet made .
    We have to thank one of our assistants, Mr. Bower, for so earnestly
 carrying out a long series of experiments on these very delicate springs.
     Weighing Machines. — Another class of instruments        in which we
 have practically employed this spring are weighing machines, and
 fig. 9 shows one of the arrangements we adopt.           The scale-pan is
  prevented from turning by the part AB being square and fitting very
  loosely a square hole in C.   This arrangement introduces practically

load interfering, by means of a rotatory motion, with the rapidity with
which the pointer comes to rest when a load is pnt into the pan. The
position of the pointer P, which revolves when a weight is placed in
the scale-pan, is read off upon the spiral scale, D, which, in this
specimen, we have graduated in pounds.        In another of these weigh
ing machines, shown in fig. 10, the arrangement is the same with the
exception that a cylindric scale D is fixed to the end of th e spring
and tarns with       it,

                                        P
points to an indication of the weight on a spiral line drawn on the
cylinder D. This second arrangement allows us to employ springs
whose ends have      relative motion of five or six revolutions.

placed on a pan resting on the top of a rod passing up through the
spring, and attached to the bottom of the spring, but hitherto we have
found that this arrangement introduces too much friction.
   When a very long spring       required for any purpose, and where the
                                      is

   [1.] The magnetic balance recently described by Professor D. E.
Hughes* promises to be so convenient and useful an instrument in
the laboratory, that the theory of its action and graduation deserves
attention.      In
                the actual instrument constructed by Hughes the
graduation   was empirically determined for     number of values, the

a small suspended needle lying in the magnetic meridian provided
with   zero- mark placed upon
       a                         platform in which

position               (" end on "), within its magnetising coil, a second
coil being added on the other Bide of the suspended needle to
compensate the action dne to the coil alone. At a certain distance
along the platform, and having its centre upon the line of the plat
form groove, is set a magnet — called by Hughes the "compensator"
—of considerable magnetic moment. The compensator is so pivotted
as to bo capable of being rotated round a vertical axis through its
centre over a scale ; and, according to the original design of the
instrument, the compensator and scale are provided with an arrange
ment whereby they may be shifted along the platform, so that they
can be made to approach nearer to the suspended needle when a more
powerful compensation is desired, or removed further away when a
more delicate magnetic force is to be compensated.           In practice the
balance was obtained by fixing the central pivot of scale and com
pensator at a distance of 30 or more centims., and turning the
compensator upon its pivot until its magnetic force on the suspended
needle, or rather its resolved part in the axial line of the platform,
was exactly equal and opposite to that of the piece of iron or steel.

   [2.] Theory of    the Magnetic    Balance. — In fig. 1, let the line AX
represent    the central    line  of the platform of the balance lying
 magnetically   east    and   west. The point M is the centre of the

  compensator NS, which has been turned through an angle OMS=0
  in order to balance the magnetic force exerted on the suspended
  needle at B by the specimen of iron or steel placed at A.               It is
  required to determine the relation       between the angle of turning 0,
 and the magnetic force thereby       brought to bear along the axis AX at
  B tending to thrust back the suspended needle to its zero point. Let
 the length   of the compensator be called 21, and the distance of B from
 M= r. It is evident that, in general, the resultant magnetic force at
 B due to the compensator will not be along the axis AX, but may be
 resolved into a part acting at right angles to that axis, and a part
 parallel to it. The former part will be parallel to the magnetic
 meridian, and, therefore, when the needle is at zero, this part will not
 tend to move the needle to either side.        Its only action is to increase
 or diminish (according to circumstances) the directive force of the
earth's magnetism upon the needle, and render it either more or less
sensitive.    The other part is that which acts along the axis and
 balances the magnetic force of the iron or steel bar at A. When the
 compensator lies at right angles to AX this component of the force
 vanishes by symmetry : consequently the zero of the scale lies in this
line.    If the compensator be turned through an angle 0, the com
 ponent of its magnetic force in the line AX will increase to a
 maximum when 0=90°.            The values of the force for different angles
may be calculated as follows : —
                                 Call      BS=r',

   The values of      P  set down as observed         in the last column of the
preceding tables were obtained by noting the deflexions produced on
a tangent magnetometer, with very small needles, by a magnet placed
at the requisite distance (measured horizontally at right angles to the
magnetic    meridian), capable of rotation in a vertical plane passing
through its centre and through that of the magnetometer.                      The read
ings were then multiplied by such a constant as would make the value
at 44°-427 coincide with the calculated value at the same angle.                    The
departures at other parts of the scale are partly due to errors of
observation, partly due to the fact that the distance between the poles
of the magnet is less than the distance between the ends.

    The calculated values of P       are   plotted out in the two sheets of
curves (figs. 2 and 3) accompanying the tables. The curves for n=4
and n=5 are given twice, being drawn again with enlarged ordinates
to show on a larger scale their close approximation to straight lines
up to about 50°.
    [3.] From the foregoing        tables, and from the curves appended,
several conclusions may be immediately drawn with respect to the
design of the magnetic balance. A simple inspection of the curves
will show that they belong to a family in which, in general, there is a
concavity near the origin, and a convexity as the limiting value is
approached at the point corresponding to the 90° position of the com
pensator.     Those curves for which w=3, or less than 3, show the
convexity very markedly.         In those for values of n higher than 7
(only   one  has  been   drawn, namely, that for n=10) the convexity of
the upper portion asserts itself.        The curve for n=10 approximates
very nearly to a curve of sines, as indeed might be suspected from the
equation.
    For those values of n which lie between 4 and 6 inclusive, the first
half of the curve is very nearly a straight line, so nearly so that for
the curves n=4 and n=5 the values of the ordinates do not differ
by 1 cent. from those which they would have for actual straight lines
lying along the mean slope of the respective curves as far as 45°. In
other    words, for angles less than 45° the magnetic force exercised
along   the axis of the balance by the compensator when it is turned is
proportional, within 1 per cent. of accuracy, to the angle through
which it has been turned, provided the distance of the compensator from
 the needle be not less than four and not greater than five times the half-
 length of the compensator.
    This result may be verified from equation (2) by finding what

be double the force at 30°, we get          n=4.28.     Here, however, the errors
near the intermediate        angle of 45° are not inconsiderable, exceeding
4 per cent. In any case we shall not be far wrong if we adjust the
balance so that n=4"5, and confine our readings within 45° of -ero.
For purposes where great accuracy is not essential the readings might
be extended as     far as 60°, since the curves for n=4 and n=5, show
how very little the straight line is departed from up to that point.
In the original balance of Hughes, the values of r and I are about
30 centims. and 7*5 centims. respectively, so that n=4.
    [4.]  I now proceed to the consideration of the action of the com
pensator    in affecting in different positions the sensitiveness of the
needle.
    In  the original instrument of Hughes, the compensator turned in a
horizontal plane ; and therefore in every position, save only when at
90° to the zero of its scale or when end-on to the indicating needle,
the force exercised by it on the needle would have a component in the
magnetic meridian.       As remarked above, the effect of this component
wonld be to increase or diminish the directive force of the earth's
magnetism      upon the needle, according as the               S pole of the com
pensator pointed northwards, or southwards.                   The sensitiveness of
the indicating needle will, of course, be affected             by this component ;
being a maximum when the component is such                    as nearly to astatise
it.    But it is evident that if the needle          be nearly astatised when the
compensator is at zero, it will not be               so astatised when the com
pensator is moved right or left. The sensibility of the needle will
diminish as the effective force of the compensator increases by its
being turned.      The calculation for the component of the force at this
point is sb follows : —

Assuming that the balance is adjusted for the case n=5, we get the
following values for this complex function of 0 : —
                         0=0,       T=^ x -01508.
                         0=30°,     T=^x P

                                    T=J-x0.
   The needle, therefore, if nearly astatised when 0=0, will still be
nearly astatised when 0 does not exceed 30° ; but beyond this value
the meridional component of the force falls off greatly, and the
sensitiveness   alters correspondingly.
   [5.] Suggested Modifications in the Magnetic Balance.
                                                           — The preceding
investigation has. led to the following suggestions :    —
   lstly. The compensator should be set so as to revolve against a
vertical circle placed at right angles to the magnetic meridian, having
its centre on the same level as the indicating needle, and magnetically
east or west of it. In this position, which was that chosen for the
experiments in which the values of P were observed for the purpose
of comparison with the calculated values in the preceding part of
these notes, the magnetic force of the compensator has no resolved
part in the magnetic meridian at the point where the indicating
needle is placed.      The sensitiveness of the needle is, therefore, the
same in all positions to which the compensator may be turned in its
own plane.
   2ndly. A small magnet lying magnetically north and south of the
indicating needle is used to astatise it to the required degree.
   3rdly. The compensator is placed so that the distance between its
centre and that of the indicating needle is about 4-6 times the half-
length between the poles of the compensator.         If the latter be a not
very thick flat straight magnet, it may be approximately assumed
that the poles are abont one-tenth of the whole length from the ends,
so that no very important error can arise if a distance equal to five
times the half-length between the ends of the magnet is selected.
When this is done it is safe to assume that for all positions of the
compensator within 55° on either side of zero, the magnetic force
which it exerts on the pole of indicating needle is proportional within
2 per cent. to the degrees of the scale through which the compensator

 330        Theory   of the Magnetic Balance    of Hughes.       [Feb.  14,
 has been turned ; and is proportional within 1 per cent. for angles
 less than 45°.     For the practical purposes for which the magnetic
 balance is designed there will therefore be no need of a special
 calibration table.
    4thly. As it is inadmissible to obtain a great range of compensation
 for both large and small magnetic forces by diminishing or increasing
 the distance of the compensator from the indicating needle, it is pro
 posed to obtain this range by placing over the compensator a second
 magnet, capable of rotating round the same axis and having the same
 length between its poles. A third magnet may be added, similarly, to
 increase the magnetic moment of the compensator.
                                     Fig. 4.
    5thly. In the preceding investigation it has been assumed through
out that the length of the indicating needle was small relatively to
r and /, so that the terms of the second and higher orders due to its
length might be neglected. This was not the case in the original
instrument of Hughes, in which the needle was 5 centims. in length.
The use of a very small needle is open to the objection that it is not
so sensitive as an index.     It is therefore proposed to substitute as an
indicating needle one of the type sometimes termed " unipolar," that
is to say, having one pole set in the axis of rotation, so that only one
pole has a moment of couple about the axis of suspension. A steel needle
about 5 centims. long has abont l-5 centims. of its length turned up
at right angles, the suspending fibre of silk being attached to the
turned-up end ; a counterpoise is added behind, and a small addi
tional weight is placed below on a brass wire attached immediately

  effective pole in the axial line of the balance, level with the centre of
  the compensator.

     The following Papers were read     : —
   I. " On some Relations of Chemical Corrosion to Voltaic Cur
        rent." By G. GORE, F.R.S., LL.D. Received February 11,
        1884.
    The chief object of this research was to ascertain the amounts of
 voltaic current produced by the chemical corrosion of known weights
 of various metals in different liquids.     The research was also made to
 throw light upon the conditions which determine the entire conver
 sion of potential     molecular energy into external (i.e., available)
 electric current. The method adopted was to take about six or eight
ounces    by measure of a corrosive electrolyte and divide it into two
equal volumes     in two similar glass vessels.    Two pieces of metal of
equal dimensions were then cut from the same sheet, cleaned perfectly,
and weighed.       One of the pieces was employed as the positive plate
of a voltaic   cell in one of the portions of liquid, and the other as a
comparison corrosion sheet in the other portion.        The negative metal
of the voltaic cell was in nearly all cases a large cylinder of sheet
platinum, and surrounded the positive one.               The positive and
comparison plates were wholly immersed in the separate portions of
liquid, except that the former had a narrow exterior projecting strip
for connexion in a circuit.      The current from the cell was passed by
means of a small sheet silver anode         inch by £ inch), and a smaller
silver cathode      (\ inch by   f  inch) in a third vessel, through a
cyanide of silver plating solution containing the least practicable
proportion of free potassic cyanide in order to obtain the maximum
amount of silver deposit.
    During each experiment observations were made of any liberation

of gas or formation        of solid coating upon the plates, and of any
other circumstance which appeared likely to affect the speed of
corrosion, or weight of the plates, or of the deposited silver ; and in
any case where any solid coating was found, it was entirely removed
after the experiment, and previous to ascertaining the losses of weight
by corrosion.    After the experiment the plates were well washed and
carefully dried between hot sheets of filter-paper before weighing.
The metals and liquids employed were as pure as could conveniently
be obtained, and    distilled water was used for all the solutions.     The
sample   of potassic cyanide usually employed    was  found  by analysis to
contain 89-14 per cent. of the actual substance.            Nearly all the
liquids were at the atmospheric temperature, and in nearly every case
the comparison sheet was employed.
   As the proportion of silver deposited to the amount          of external
current generated, and therefore also to the amount of positive metal
corroded, varied to a very small extent with the density of the current
                                                    "
at the cathode in the depositing solution (see        Electrolytic Balance
of Chemical Corrosion,"        "  Proc. Birm. Phil.   Soc,"  vol. iii, 1883,
pp. 278-304), the amount of cathode surface was usually varied
according to the apparent strength of the current and rate of
deposition, being smaller as the strength of current was less.
   The degrees of electromotive force were measured by the aid of
two thermoelectric batteries, each consisting of about 300 pairs of
iron and German silver, together with a Clark's Standard cell (see
" Proc. Birm. Phil. Soc," vol. iv, Pt.
                                           I).
   The following table exhibits the results.      In the table the number
of square inches given includes in each case the immersed portion of
both surfaces of the positive metal and comparison plate.         The losses
of the plates, and the weight of deposited silver, are in every instance
expressed in grains, and the rates of loss of the positive plate are
given in column 6 in grains per square inch per hour.         If the whole
of the corroded portion of the positive metal produced external
current, consistent in amount with the atomic weights and valencies
of the metals as given in the table, and if that amount be called 100,
then the proportions        of such current actually obtained in the
experiments are those given in column No. 9. The quantities of
substance mentioned in column No. 1 were in each case per ounce of
water.

   Only those results which appeared reliable are inserted in the table ;
many uncertain ones were omitted.         In some cases coatings of solid
matter formed either upon the positive or comparison plates, or gas

perfectly removed were rejected.         With magnesium in solutions of

solid deposit containing black suboxide of magnesium formed upon
the positive plate only.*             And with aluminium in solution of
iodic acid a compound of iodine was absorbed, and both the plates
increased about 16 per cent. in weight.f                   In seven cases (Nos.
6, 7, 14, 28, 65, 67, 81),      from   causes    which  were   not very apparent,
the comparison sheets lost weight more than the positive ones.                The
considerable degree of variability of rate of ordinary corrosion
detracted greatly from the usefuluess of the comparison sheet.
    The results show that the proportion of loss of the positive plate by
" local action " to that by corrosion attending external current varied
greatly in different cases ; with silver in a dilute solution of ferric
sulphate, the latter amounted to only about l-3 per cent. of the total
 corrosion, whilst with tin in weak hydrochloric acid it was as much as
95-25 per cent.      In no instance was the whole of the metal dissolved
 by   "local  action,"   and in no case was the whole of the corrosion
 attended by external current.
    The amount of corrosion of the positive plate was in nearly alJ
 cases greater than that of the comparison                  one.    Six cases were
 selected from the table, in which the apparent corrosion of the latter
 sheet was the greatest, and some trouble was taken to ascertain by
 experiment whether either of these was a real one. After varying the
 conditions   of the trial in several ways, with pure copper in a mixture
 of 50 minims of pure nitric acid per ounce of distilled water, it was
 found that in this instance the comparison plate was always corroded
 the fastest.
    As the amount of corrosion of the positive, plate was in nearly all
 cases  greater than that of the comparison one, and the proportion of
 gas to corrosion was also frequently less with the former than with
 the latter, a solid deposit was usually more readily formed on the
 positive   plate than upon the comparison one, and the chemical
 products were not always exactly the same upon the two plates. An
 instance of this kind occurred with amalgamated silver in a solution
 of potassic cyanide ; the positive plate alone became brown. As the
 chemical products of " local action," and of corrosion attended by
 external current, are usually the same, in cases where they are
 different, though resulting from the same materials, the total expendi
 ture of    potential molecular motion would probably be different,
 because the quantities of residual molecular energy of the ingredients
 would not be the same.
     The proportion of corrosion of the positive plate accompanying
 external current, to that produced by "local action," may be approxi
  mately arrived at, either by deducting from the total amount of
 corrosion of that plate the loss by weight of the comparison one, or by
                 ¦ See " Proe. Birm. Phil. Soe.," vol. iv.

 calculating from the quantity of deposited silver, together with the
 valencies and atomic weights of the positive metal and of silver, the
 amount of the positive metal required to produce the current.          Each
 of these methods however is imperfect      ; the second is usually much the
 least so. In several cases, by employing the former one, the amount
 of deposited metal was found to be nearly equivalent to the amount
 of corrosion accompanying external current, after making allow
 ance for a small deficiency of deposited silver caused by a portion of
 the current traversing     the free potassic cyanide     in the depositing
 liqnid.
    That the external current affects in some cases the amount of " local
 action " was shown by the following experiment : — A sheet of platinum
 and one of ordinary zinc, not connected together, were partly
 immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, until a moderate stream of gas
 arose from the zinc.    On now connecting the two plates together by
 means of a wire, the stream from the zinc was conspicuously dimi
 nished.    The contact of a negative metal with the positive one
 usually increased the total loss by corrosion, whilst it commonly
 decreased that caused by " local action."
    The results contained in the table further show that the propor
 tion of corrosion attending external current (as measured by the
 amount of silver deposited) to that by " local action," depends upon
 several conditions : — 1st, upon the kind of metal ; thus it was usually
 greater with cadmium (average 75-63 per cent.) than with copper
 (30" 33 per cent.).  2nd, upon the kind of liquid ; it was greater with
 solution of potassic cyanide (average 63-27 per cent.) than with dilute
nitric acid (31-14 per cent.). And 3rd, upon the degree of concentra
tion of the liquid ; a greater strength of solution frequently increased,
and as frequently decreased, the proportion of corrosion accompanying
external current to that by "local action."          A variation of kind of
metal also was attended by a greater change in the proportion of such
corrosions than a variation of kind of liquid. This latter circumstance
is in harmony with the view that the potential molecular activity of
metals is usually greater than that of electrolytes (see
                                                               " Relations of
Heat to Voltaic and Thermo-Electric Action," " Proc. Roy. Soc,"
vol. 36, p. 50).
    The effect of amalgamation of the plates upon the proportion of
those actions to each other was usually distinct.            In ten cases it
increased, and in five decreased, the proportion of external electric
                             "
current to " local action currents.        With tin in dilute nitric acid, it
greatly   increased  the proportion   of   external  current to total corro
sion, whilst with lead in a solution of potassic hydrate it had the
opposite effect. It appeared to increase that proportion the most in
cases where much hydrogen was evolved, as with zinc in dilute sul
phuric or hydrochloric acid. In seven cases it increased and in nine

340             Chemical   Corrosion and Voltaic Current.        [Feb. 21,
decreased the rate of total corrosion of the positive plate, and the
amount of the latter was five times that of the former ; and in seven
instances .it increased and in eleven decreased the loss of weight of
the comparison plate, and the amount of the latter was fourteen times
 that of the former.
   The rate of total corrosion of the positive plate appeared to be
related to the degree of electromotive force.       By comparing together
Columns 4 and 6 of the table it was found that the instances of least
electromotive force and lowest rate of corrosion coincided in the case
of magnesium, zinc, tin, aluminium, iron, nickel, and copper; and of
greatest coincided in the case of lead and copper.        With magnesium
the order of electromotive force was almost the same as that of total
corrosion, and with copper it was partly so. No. 24 in the table
further illustrates the influence of decreased electromotive force.
   The simple and chief explanation of the great variation in the
                              " local action " to that attended
proportion of corrosion by                                      by external
electric current, appears to be difference of electric-conduction-resist
ance. Where there is no external circuit and the external resistance
is infinite, as in cases of deposit of metal or hydrogen by simple
immersion, the whole of the electricity flows through the local
circuits and deposits its complete equivalent of metal, hydrogen, or
both, on the negative parts of the positive plate ; but when the
external resistance is least, and the resistance to circulation of local
currents is greatest, nearly the whole of the electricity passes through
the external     circuit, and nearly the whole of the deposition of
hydrogen or metal occurs on the negative plate. In either case the
full equivalent of electricity circulates.     With zinc and platinum in
dilute sulphuric acid, the "local action" was diminished by closing
the circuit.   By diminishing also the external resistance in relation to
that in the battery by the employment of two voltaic cells in series,
instead of one (see No. 24), the proportion of silver deposited was
increased from 90'02 to 93-83 per cent. of the theoretical quantity.
   Rate of corrosion depends chiefly upon the particular combination
of metal and liquid, and is limited by the substance of weakest mole
cular action. Thus the rates of corrodibility of magnesium in solution
of potassic cyanide (or in dilute hydrofluoric acid) and in dilute
sulphuric acid, are just the opposite of those of aluminium in the same
liquids ; while magnesium dissolves very slowly in the former liquid
and very rapidly in the latter, aluminium does quite the reverse (see
" Relations of Heat to Voltaic and Thermo-Electric Action," "
                                                                      Proc.
Roy. Soc," vol. 36, p. 50) ; therefore, either a difference of metal or
of liquid in this case reverses the effect. Two of the most extreme
cases of difference of rate of corrosion observed at 60° F. were
aluminium in 3£ per cent. pure hydrofluoric acid, and in very dilute
sulphuric acid.

                  Explanation of Hall's Phenomenon."           By SHELFORD
         Bidwell, M.A., LL.B. Communicated by Professor G.
         Carey Foster. F.R.S. Received February 14, 1884.
     Air. E. H. Hall's first paper relating to what is now generally known
 as   the " Hall effect," appeared in the " Phil. Mag." for March, 1880.
 It was entitled " On a New Action of the Magnet on Electric
 Currents,"     and in   it was described the following experiment : — A
 strip of gold-leaf was cemented to a plate of glass and placed between
 the poles of an electromagnet, the plane of the glass being perpendi
 cular to the magnetic lines of force. A current derived from a
 Bunsen cell was passed longitudinally through the gold, and before
 the electromagnet was excited two equipotential points were found,
 by trial, near opposite edges of the gold-leaf and about midway
 between     the ends ; when these points were connected with a galvano
 meter    there  was, of course, no deflection.    A current from a powerful
 battery being passed through the coils of the magnet, it was found
 that a galvanometer deflection occurred indicating a difference of
potential between the two points, the direction of the current across
 the gold-leaf being opposite to that in which the gold-leaf itself would
have moved across the lines       of force had it    been  free to do so. On
reversing the polarity of the magnet, the direction of the transverse
electromotive       force was reversed ; and when the magnet was
 demagnetised the two points reverted to their original equipotential
condition.       The phenomenon is attributed by the author to the direct
action of the magnet upon the current in the gold leaf.
    In a second paper, published in the " Phil. Mag." for November,
1880, experiments are described in which other metals were used in
addition to gold.       With silver, nickel, tin, and platinum the nature of
the effect was the same as with gold though differing in degree ; but
in the case of iron the direction of the transverse current was found
to be reversed,       a result which Mr. Hall was naturally inclined to
connect     with the magnetic properties of iron, and which he says had
been     predicted by Professor Rowland. But he was greatly puzzled
to account      for the fact that the two strongly magnetic metals, iron
and    nickel, gave opposite effects.
    A third paper contained in the " Phil. Mag." for September, 1881,
confirmed the previous results with regard to nickel, and added that
the direction of the transverse electromotive force in the strongly
magnetic metal cobalt was the same as in iron.
                                                                 "
    Mr. Hall's latest paper on the subject appeared in the Phil. Mag."
for May, 1883, and is entitled, in compliance with a suggestion of Dr.
                   " Rotational Coefficients of various Metals." It is here

as   gold   ;  zinc   gives    the  same     result  as    iron,    and   with lead no
appreciable effect is produced.
   The experimental          results may be stated in a different form from
that    originally adopted by Mr. Hall. The equipotential points on
opposite edges of the plate may clearly be joined by equipotential
lines, and Hall's results may be expressed by saying that in the case
of gold, the equipotential lines are rotated in a direction opposite to
that of the current circulating in the coils of the electromagnet, and
in the case of iron the lines are rotated in the direction of the
magnetising current.            In fig. 1 MNOP represents the metal plate
                                          Fio.  1.
through which        a battery current      is passing from left to right, and AB
is the equipotential line (which, if the arrangement is symmetrical,
as shown in the figure, will be a straight line) joining two opposite
equipotential points.           If now the south pole of a magnet is placed
beneath the plate and the north pole above it (the axis of the poles
being perpendicular to the plate), the equipotential                        line will be
rotated, in the case of gold, counter-clockwise               to the position CD, and
in the case of iron clockwise to the position EF. Mr. Hall distin
guishes the
                 " rotational coefficient " of those metals which behave like
iron by the positive sign ( + ), and those which behave like gold by
the negative sign (— ).*
   Of the thirteen different metals which Hall has tested, three — iron,
cobalt, and zinc — are classed as positive ; nine — gold, Bilver, tin,
copper,      brass,   platinum, nickel, aluminium, and magnesium                    —are
negative;      and one — lead — shows absolutely no signs of rotation.
   • In  the second of Hall's papers the direction of the
                                                                " transverse electromotive
force
      "  is arbitrarily called   + for gold, 4c., and     —  for iron. He subsequently
                                    " rotational coefficients."
adopted opposite signs for their

   The several papers abound in speculations which it is not now
necessary to consider ; bat very great importance has been attached
to the phenomenon in consequence of the opinion expressed by
Professor Rowland and others, that it is connected with the magnetic
rotation of the plane of polarisation of light, and thus furnishes
additional evidence of an intimate relation between light and
electricity.
                                        I
   A number of experiments, which have from time to time made,
convinced me, however, that no direct action of the kind supposed
was ever produced ; and, after several unsuccessful attempts to frame
a hypothesis which would solve the mystery, I finally found that
Hall's phenomenon might    be completely explained         by the      joint action
of mechanical strain and certain thermoelectric        effects.
   The mechanical strain is produced by electromagnetic action. In
fig. 2, let ABCD represent the metallic strip through which a current
                                 Fig.   2.
is passing from left to right.    Suppose that the south pole of a
magnet is beneath it and the north pole above               it,
                                                         then the strip
would,    free
          if   to do so, move across the lines of force in the direction
indicated by the arrow EF.
   But, as arranged for Hall's experiment, the metallic strip    fixed,   is
and cannot move bodily from its position;           will, however, be
                                                       it

metal     (on the whole) subjected to longitudinal traction, while
          is
in the other three, which are shaded in the figure,               it
                                                            undergoes
compression.

344                       Mr. S. Bidwell.         On an                   [Feb.   21,
   Suppose that a current is passing through the plate from C to D,
and that A and B are two points on the opposite edges which, when
the metal is free from strain, are at the same potential.  Then the
                                      Fig.   3.
         Compressed   portions arc shaded.    Stretched portions are black.
ratio of the resistances between the points C and A and the points
A   and D is equal to that between the points C, B, and the points
B, D. And, so far as mechanical strain alone is concerned, this
equality will not be disturbed by placing the plate in a magnetic
field, for the strain produced       will   symmetrically distributed on
                                             be
both sides of the middle line.         At all
                                            events, no strain could occur
  which would in itself affect the resistance of gold and iron in opposite
  ways, for the resistance of both is increased by tension and (pre
  sumably) diminished by longitudinal compression.         But it will be
 noticed that the currents from C to A and from B to D pass from
 regions which are compressed to regions which are stretched, while
 the opposite is the case with currents passing from C to B and from
 A to D. And here the thermoelectric effects above referred to come
 into play.
    Sir William Thomson, in his Bakerian Lecture of 1856 (" Phil.
 Trans.," 1856, p. 711) announced his discovery of the fact that if a
 stretched copper wire is connected with an unstretched wire of the
 same material, and the junction heated, a thermoelectric current will
 flow from the stretched to the unstretched wire through the hot
junction ; while if the wires are of iron, the direction of the current
 will be from unstretched to stretched.          From this it might be
 inferred that a current would flow through the heated junction from
 an unstretched, or free, copper wire to a longitudinally compressed
 copper wire, and from a longitudinally compressed iron wire to a free
 iron wire ; and I have ascertained by actual experiment that this is
the case, though with copper the observed effect was very small. A
fortiori, therefore, the direction of the current through the heated
 junction will be from stretched to compressed in the case of copper
 wire, and from compressed to stretched in the case of iron wire.                 If,

1884.]               Explanation     of Hairs     Phenomenon.                   345
therefore,    a current is passed from a stretched portion of a wire to a
compressed portion, heat will (according to the laws of the Peltier
e ffect) be absorbed at the junction if the metal is copper, and will be
 developed at the junction if the metal is iron. In passing from com
pressed to stretched regions the converse effects will occur.
   Let us now imagine the metal plate to be divided into four equal
regions, A, B, C, D as shown in fig. 4. Let a current pass through
the   plate from E to F and let a force (produced electromag-
netically or otherwise) be applied in the direction HG.                       First,
suppose   that    the  plate  is  of   copper.     Then   the   current   travelling
from E to the line OG passes from a compressed to a stretched
portion of the metal ; heat will, therefore, be developed in the
region A.       Between the line OG and the point F, the current
passes from a stretched to a compressed portion ; heat will, therefore,
be absorbed       in the region B. For similar reasons heat will be
absorbed in C and developed in D. The temperature of the copper
plate will, therefore, not be uniform ; the portions A and D being on
the whole hotter than the portions B and C. But the resistance of a
metal increases with its temperature.               The resistance of A and D
will, therefore, be greater, and the resistance of B and C smaller than
before the plate was subjected to the strain.              If, therefore, GH were
originally    an  equipotential  line,  it is  clear that  it will be so no longer.
An equipotential line through the point 0 will now be inclined to
GH in the direction KL as shown in the figure.*

    Supposing the plate to be of iron instead of copper, the thermo
 electric effects will be reversed, and the regions which in the former
 case were hot, will now be cold, and vice versa.               The distribution of

 resistance  will be changed in a corresponding manner, and the          equi-
 potential line will be rotated in the opposite direction MN.
    The peculiar thermoelectric properties of copper and iron dis
 covered by Sir William Thomson are thus seen to be sufficient to
 account for Hall's phenomena in the case of those metals.
    It has often been said that the best test of the truth of a theory is
 the power it gives of accurate prediction.        If the explanation which
 I have offered of Hall's phenomenon         be the  correct one, it is clear
               "           " metals,
 that Hall's     positive            cobalt and zinc, should when tested
 according   to  Sir William  Thomson's    method exhibit the same thermo

 thermoelectrically in the same manner as copper ; and that lead might
 be expected to be thermoelectrically      unaffected by strain.   It  became
                                     Fio. 5.
exceedingly interesting to ascertain if this was the ease, and        I there
fore proceeded to repeat Thomson's experiment upon all the metals
mentioned by Hall.        When it was conveniently possible to do so, the
metal was used in the form both of wire and of sheet or foil, and
except in the case of cobalt, the following simple method of operating
was adopted.
   A short piece of the wire or strip of the foil to be examined was
held at the ends by two fixed brass clamps, about 5 or 6 centims.
apart,   which were connected with the terminals of a low resistance
reflecting galvanometer.        A point near the middle of the metal
was then gripped by a pair of pincers which had been heated in a
Bunsen flame, and one half of the wire was drawn taut, leaving the
other half slack ; a galvanometer deflection immediately occurred,
which ceased when the tension was discontinued.             The process was
then repeated, the pull being made in the opposite direction, this

resulted in an opposite deflection of the galvanometer.                    The arrange
ment is indicated         in  fig. 5,   where   A   and   B  are   the  clamps   between

   It will   be seen that      in every case, excepting that of aluminium and
one out of five specimens of gold, there is a perfect correspondence
between the direction of the thermoelectric current and the sign of
Hall's coefficient.        The anomalous specimen of gold was supplied by
Messrs. Johnson and Matthey, by whom its purity was estimated at
99-6 per cent.         I do not think that its exceptional behaviour could be
accounted for by its physical condition, because, after being succes
sively annealed, raised to a red heat and plunged into cold water, and
finally hammered until it was quite hard, it invariably gave the same
result.    There are, it seems to me, only two possible ways of account
ing   for it.      Either it behaves as if it were absolutely pure gold, in
which case the professedly purer piece of foil, which gave the oppo
site effect, and all the specimens of gold used by Mr. Hall, were
affected by impurities ; or it is alloyed with some substance which is
capable of reversing the ordinary action of pure gold.                        Since this
specimen     was     unfortunately       in the  form   of  wire,  it was  impossible to
test  it for the Hall effect.
    The aluminium, in the form both of foil and of wire, gave opposite
effects to those indicated by the sign of Hall's coefficient.                    I, there
 fore, mounted a portion of the foil upon glass, and performed Hall's

348          On an Explanation     of HalVs  Phenomenon.      [Feb. 21,
experiment with it. As      I  expected, the sign of the "rotational
coefficient"  proved to be + like that of iron, zinc, and cobalt.
It is probable, therefore, that the specimen of aluminium used by
Mr. Hall differed in its chemical or physical constitution from mine.
Both my specimens were supplied by Messrs. Johnson and Matthey
as pure.
   With regard to cobalt, since it could not be obtained in the form
either of wire or of sheet, it was necessary for the observation of
the thermoelectric effect to treat it in a somewhat different manner
from that previously described.    A rod of the metal about 8 millims.
in diameter and 7 centims. long was firmly held by one end in a vice
and both ends were connected by wires with the terminals of the
galvanometer.    The middle of the rod was gripped with gas-tongs,
which had been previously heated in a B arisen flame, and stress was
prodnced by twisting. It was found that while the stress continued a
current passed from the free to the strained portion of the rod
through the hot part. The direction of the current was the same
whether the torsion was clockwise or counter-clockwise, and it ceased
the moment the stress was discontinued.     For the sake of comparison
a copper rod was treated in a similar manner, and the resultin g
current was in the reverse direction.   There can be little doubt that
in experiments of this kind torsion is perfectly equivalent to traction,
both tending to draw asunder the molecules of the metal.
   I venture to think that the considerations and experiments detailed
in this paper render it abundantly evident that the phenomenon
described by Mr. Hall involves no new law of nature, but is merely
an example of certain thermoelectric effects which had been observed
nearly thirty years ago.

       Human Corpus calloeum."           By   Professor D. J. HAMILTON.
       Communicated by Professor Huxley,                 P.R.S.    Received
       February 23, 1884.
                                   Summary.
    1. The results have been obtained by a special mode of preparation
formerly described by me.
    2. The fibres in the tip of the frontal lobe run almost directly
backwards. A short way behind this they become concentrated in
an oval shaped area. This oval shaped area still further back divides
into three distinct bundles, and these bundles            I have named the
tr actus interims, tractus medium, and tractus externus.
    3. The tractus internus becomes the corpus callosum and contains
two sets of fibres, namely, (a) those coming from the opposite frontal
lobe across the corpus callosum, and (6) those going from the
frontal lobe of the same side.          The fibres which come from the
opposite    frontal  lobe anteriorly do  not, after crossing in the corpus
callosum, proceed to a corresponding situation on the other side, but,
after arching forwards, so as to circumvent the anterior horn of
the lateral ventricle and the head of the caudate nucleus, turn back
to form the tractus medius and externus.
    4. The tractus externus further back divides into the " inner " and
" outer capsules," while the tractus medius joins with the inner
capsule shortly after it is given off from the tractus externus.         The
fibres so derived from the frontal lobe of the opposite side are con
ducted along with the common fibres of the " inner capsule " to the
following destinations.      Some of them (a very few twigs) end in the
head of the caudate nucleus, while the bulk of them are destined to
become    attached to the thalamus      opticus.    One large mass derived

350                On the Human Corpus Callosum.               [Feb. 28,
from this source is the anterior peduncle of the optic thalamus.
 (Vorderer Stiel, Meynert.)
   5. The callosal fibres derived from other regions of the cortex
pursue a similar course : — They sweep downwards into the corpus
callosum, slant somewhat backwards or forwards when they enter
it, pass over to the opposite side, and then instead of becoming
attached to a corresponding part of the cortex in the opposite hemi
sphere, turn upwards, outwards, and downwards, in a dense well-
marked arch, and enter the inner and outer capsules.         This mass
of arched fibres propose to name the crossed callosal tract.
               I
    6.The fibres of the opposite hemisphere, having thus become united
to the inner and outer capsules, terminate in the following manner — :
A few of them enter the head of the caudate nucleus, but by far the
greater number become attached to the thalamus opticus opposite
the bend or knee formed by the junction of the anterior and posterior
divisions of the inner capsule. Those entering the outer capsule become
attached respectively, from before backwards, with the following
parts the inner capsule, the olfactory tract, the temporo-sphenoidal
           :
lobe, and the optic tract. The olfactory and optic nerves are thus,
I believe, connected directly with the cerebral cortex.
      The corpus callosum, therefore,
      7.                              is not an interhemispheric com
missure at all, but  isthe decussation of the cortical fibres in their
progress downwards  to  become connected with the basal ganglia.
   In the human brain     I   have never seen any fibres which pass
directly from one hemisphere to another.
    8.The "corona radiata," as usually described, does not exist. The
only fibres which pass from the cerebral peduncle directly up to the
cortex of the same side are contained in the posterior division of
the inner capsule.      They correspond to those fibres which have
decussated already in the anterior pyramids, and are a mere fraction of
                            "
the whole " inner capsule     fibres. All the other fibres of the " inner
         "
capsule    pass into the crossed callosal tract, and, instead of running
directly up to the cortex of the same side, cross in the corpus callosum
to the cortex of the opposite side.
    9.The same arrangement prevails in the callosal fibres from the
tip of the frontal to the tip of the occipital lobes.
   10. The crossed callosal tract comes so near to the cortex of the
opposite side in arching downwards that injuries or stimulations of
one side of the brain would be liable to affect the fibres coming from
the opposite, and hence to produce a misleading result.

II.  " On the Surface Forces in Fluids."              By A. M. Worthing-
      TON.     Communicated by Professor              B. Stewart, F.R.S.
      Received February 22, 1884.
                                   (Abstract.)
    The object of the paper is to deduce from consideration of the
known thermal and elastic properties of fluids, the fact that at their
bounding surface there is a rapid variation of density, on account of
which the surface layers exert either a tension or a pressure on any
material wall which cuts them transversely, from which action the
phenomena of capillarity are easily deduced ; and to exhibit clearly
the manner in which the intrinsic energy per unit of volume of the
surface layers exceeds or falls short of that in the interior of the
fluid, and also to point ont a certain important change which it is
necessary to introduce into the commonly accepted explanation of the
equilibrium of a fluid in contact with a solid ; and, finally, to show why
the erroneous assumption of a constant density near the surface, made
by Laplace, did not prevent his obtaining the true equation to the
liquid surface, while it did prevent him from perceiving the reality of
the surface-tension.
    The first step is to examine the significance of statical theories of
molecular equilibrium, and to show that a statical theory. if framed in
accordance with the observed phenomena of expansion of the substance
 with heat, and of its elastic resistance to compression or extension, is
 really equivalent to   a statistical description of any internal dynamical
phenomena     that  are  taking place. The value of Poisson's " repulsive
force of heat
                " as a statical
                                   representation of the rate of transfer of
 molecular momentum, or of the internal pressure within the substance,
 is pointed out, and the nature of the equilibrium between this force
 and the force of molecular attraction is examined.
    The relation of the two forces may be advantageously exhibited by
 means of a diagram of two curves drawn to rectangular co-ordinates,
 whose horizontal    abscissae represent the    intra-molecular distance, and
 whose vertical ordinates represent        in  each case the corresponding
value of the force. It is shown that the equilibrium of the substance
is stable only when the tangent to the curve of repulsion slopes more
 steeply than the tangent to the corresponding point of the attraction
curve, and the difference between the ordinates to the two curves
 corresponds to the ordinate of an isothermal curve for the same
substance as usually drawn.
    The equilibrium of a non-volatile        liquid, whose plane surface is
 exposed to a vacuum, is then studied in the following manner : —

distances apart, at which they may be supposed to be situated in the
interior of the liquid, at some given temperature in nature. They
are then supposed to be endowed with the attractive forces which (on
a statical theory) they may be supposed to possess in nature, and the
value of the repulsive heat-force or internal pressure is sought which
is requisite to maintain the existing uniform density.  It is found that
this value increases with the depth up to the limit of the radius of
molecular activity, after which it remains constant, and that con
sequently if such a uniform temperature be assigned to the substance
as shall maintain the existing density of the interior molecules, a
readjustment of the surface molecules will take place, involving an
expansion of the surface liquid and an absorption of heat by    from                       it,
which it    seen that the surface liquid
           is                             in a condition to which the
                                                    is
interior liquid would be reduced by stretching                it,
                                                    and maybe regarded
as a portion of the liquid on which heat energy has been spent in
doing work against the molecular attractions.
    The same treatment     then extended to the more general case, first
                              is
of a liquid in contact with an incompressible and inextensible sub
stance then to two liquids in contact
      ;                                     and then to the contact of a

liquid  with its own vapour    and finally,
                                   ;        to the contact of a fluid and
a  solid with the result that at the surface of contact of two fluids the
      ;
surface layers of each differ from the interior fluid by being in a state
either of tension or pressure, and that the forces which are the subject
of measurement in experiments on capillarity are the algebraic sum of
the two sets of forces belonging to the two fluids respectively.                                      If
this resultant sum   is   pressure, then the surface

shown that the liquid          rarefied at the surface while the gas or

the critical point, to  the rarefaction possible to the one, and to the
condensation possible to the other, and that the two limits are not
coincident, and that consequently up to this point the phenomena of
a  surface-tension are presented, while above the critical temperature
the two limits disappear simultaneously.      The relation of this inter

that the surface force must be a pressure, whence its follows that a
liquid which spreads over a solid in air must really be condensed on
its surface, and the surface force must be a pressure, and not a
tension, as usually supposed — a result which    arrived at in different

is probably of importance when considered in reference to the solution
of a solid in a liquid.
   The iafluence of the curvature of the surface is then considered, and
the connexion between the hydrostatic pressure and the repalsive and
attractive forces that have been spoken of is pointed out, after which
the relation of the investigation to that of Laplace is examined, and
it is shown that in assuming the density to be invariable, Laplace
obliges   himself to neglect the very quantities from whose mutual
relation, established by experiment, the reality of the surface-tensions
and surface-pressures can alone be deduced.

    On a Method      of Tracing Periodicities in a Series of Observa

          Colaba, Bombay.     Communicated by C. Chambers, F.R.S.,
          Superintendent   of  the Observatory.    Received May 30.
          Read    June    15, 1882.
                                            [Plate    4.]
    1.    The object of this paper is to investigate a new method which will
enable us to find out the period      of an unknown inequality, and thence
the      inequality itself, from a series of observations — such as magne-
tical, meteorological,         or astronomical — when they are of                   a periodic
nature.
    2.We assume that there is some large complex period, such that
the observations — which need not necessarily correspond to equidistant
times, but must have the time similarly divided in each general period —
will be exactly repeated after such full period ;* but since we have not
yet found such a period, although we have observations of thirty years'
duration or more, say, of barometer, we may say that such a period is
not yet completed, and we cannot, therefore, apply                            Bessel's method,
which is applicable    to only known periods, to find subordinate
periodic inequalities.  Diurnal and annual periods which have already
been discovered may be considered as subordinate periods of the large
period which we are considering.     Our aim is first to ascertain the
duration of subordinate periods one by one, and then to find out the
amplitude for each period.
    3.    Any observations        of a periodic            nature       may be represented by
the      equation —
        Y=M+O1sin(ui      ?^ Ossin(us
                                    +         +                     +
                                                                        ^+, &c.      .   .   (1),
in which Kj, K2, &c, which are all unknown periods which are in an
ascending order of magnitude, but the relations                             of which with each
other are also unknown ;             Y
                            is the phenomenon,                              and x the variable
time onwhich the phenomenon depends ; O, Mi,                                  and Ui, TJ3, &c,
            ; and 2tt is of course equivalent
are constants                                 to 360°.

that they are both alike, except in subordinate periods which are in
equation (1) in an ascending order of magnitude, and apparently

unknown subordinate periods, that is, those which may really exist in
a particular series of observations.    To illustrate practically the
advantage of the one over the other in point of simplicity, we shall
take   case in which a particular set of observations
          a                                              composed of    is

                                   7,              This can be repre
sented by the form of equation (1) by three terms only, while by the
form of equation (2) 105 are required, although       will prove, after all

the periods are found, that all of them have zero for their value except
the terms whose periods are     -fa,-f,of the full period. On the other
hand, if a particular set of observations     really composed of subor
                                                     is

does not affect the forms but the ideas only.
    Having found the equation for any kind of observations of a periodic
nature, our next step      to see what results take place
                              is                                   certain       if
operations be performed on the observed values of equation (1).
     Before doing this let us prove some preliminary propositions.

 =6tt or =2Ntt, where N is some whole number, the factor has also
 the value zero.

have followed if the second factor had been taken.

  Thus from one series of observations we got two series, one        the                                           is
sum of several mean series, and the other the series of last remainders,
and of course the sum of these series        equal to the observation   is
series thus whenever we want the sum of all the mean series we
      ;

sponding observation series. We shall rewrite these series below and
call them observation series, mean series, and remaining series respec

seen that when m    an even number the results will be quite similar
                               is
to the one when m      an odd number, but the labour of operations of
                                is
taking successive means will be- twofold.     Because the mean of m
values from which the mean        taken will not correspond to any of
                                                   is
the values in the lot, but will correspond to the middle of some two
consecutive values, and for this reason the mean should be written on
the line instead of in the column on our form    and after the opera    ;
tions of these first means are performed, we must take the mean of
two consecutive means found out first, at both sides of any particular
column, and            put     it   in the column.
                                      Then these second means thus
found are to be subtracted from the corresponding valuea from which
the two sets of means are derived.   Similarly from these remainders
new means and new remainders are to be found precisely in the same
manner as spoken of above.                         In
                                  order to keep our language the same
whether m is an odd or an even number, we shall always, in the case
where m is an even number, give the name of first set of means,
second set of means, &c.r to those means found by two of the opera
tions described above.
   21. This suggests that we must always prefer m as an odd                                       number,
except when there     real need of preferring to as an even

Rince the labour of operations, when m     an even number,        is                             is   greater
than when m       an odd   number.

378                Mr. V. N. Nene.            On a Method   of Tracing
  22.  The three results which we have found above are very im
portant, and we shall now show their utility, and discuss some more
cases from them which we have not yet discussed, by taking some
particular examples by which we can show our method of tracing
unknown periods.
   Suppose we have at our disposal a long series of daily means (say)
of barometer observations, and we suspect in it a period of about
25 days.   The first thing that we shall do is, that we shall take a small
series of daily means and curve it on a curve form, and see generally
the period of duration of turning points between successive maxima
or between successive minima. Suppose the duration of the period found
was from 5 to 10 days, then we shall take the least period of 5 days,
that    is,
        we shall adopt    as our working value of to, and work the
                                  5
processes as already discussed with the whole series of daily means,
until generally each mean of the last mean series    less than   (say) in
                                                                is         2
the last place of figures.* We shall take then for further treatment the
sum of all the mean series instead of the original series. The sum of
all the mean series will be found directly by subtracting the last
remaining series from the first daily mean series. We shall take this
series for a second set of operations. The number we shall take for
operations             25
                                       ^=nearly 36, but we shall take 35 because
                  is
                            ^jj^LtZZ
the operations are simpler for odd number than for even number. Now
we shall have 35 as our working value of to, by which we shall con
tinue the operations, say up to 5th, and then curve the 5th remaining
series on     a   curve form.      If there           in the series from
                                              be only one period
about 17 to 35 days, we shall begin to get simple harmonic waves in
the fifth or in some further remaining series but         there be more
                                                            ;         if
than one period the result will be compound, about which we shall
discuss presently.    But first suppose that there     only one period.
                                                                     is
If we do    not find  definitely the duration of simple wave curve in
the 5th remaining series, then we shall continue the process on to
the 6th remaining series and curve on the same curve form and
with the same zero line, until the duration of simple wave curve                    is
definitely found.   It may here be mentioned, that the period notif            is
of an exact number of days, we should have a long series to begin
with, so that we shall take some exact number of waves from the last
remaining series and find the number of days in them, and divide the
days by the number of waves, and the result will be the number of
days in the period.    We must also remark that     there should be no
                                                                if
  • We always have some limit of accuracy of observing the instruments and re
ducing the observed values      for example, we observe barometer to a nearest
                                   ;
thousandth of an inch, and  also  reduce daily means to    nearest thousandth of an
                                                            a
inch. By less than two in the last place of figures, in this case, we mean less than
two thousandths of an inch of barometer, and so on.

 simple harmonic       period of exact duration — 25 days — that we have
 been suspecting and searching for, the process we have been per
 forming will still tell us if there be any simple harmonic period of
 any duration between (say) 20 and 30 days.                           The only difference
 we shall have is in these cases that we shall have to increase

of these and such similar factors increase after a certain number of
operations of the remaining series.
   23. Suppose we have suspected only the period of 25 days, but in
reality there is not any period between 5 and 35 days ; the result will
be, as investigated before, that the range of remaining scries will be
lessened and lessened, until each term of the last remaining series
will be less   than two in the last place of the figures.
   24.  Suppose in the daily mean series we have a real existence of
the two periods (say) 25 and 20 days, we shall still find the existence
of the period of 25 days. Because the numerical value (regardless of

Thus     the compound result in the last remaining series be curved
        if
out on   acurve form the maxima and minima of 25 days' period will
be apparent.    Similarly    any number of compound periods be mixed
                                     if
in the last remaining series, still by sufficiently increasing the number
of operations the 25 days' period will be apparent. In conclusion we
can say that among the periods which may have mixed in the last
remaining series the one of which the factor of the type                                           has the

whether the period     of 25 days or not.
                              is

tinctly apparent             is,
                      that when the two periods are such that their
factors of the first mean series are equal to one. another, and then the
two variations         will continue          combined in the same proportions                       as   in
the original observations.
   26. We have in the above example stated that when we find syste
matic movements in the daily mean curve, of which the duration                                            is
from    5to 10 days, we must first work the series with five day
operations, &c. It     not, however, essential, when the period which
                              is

                             of a considerable
shorter period, then the period can be found without          but when                 it ;

when the limit of the mean series        reduced to less than

process after considering what reduction will take place in the range
of the period we are seeking.      This    merely   process for making

  27.    The process of smoothing                   series generally           in practice    is   to take
the mean of two consecutive numbers, and put     down below and on            it
the line between the two numbers, and so on with each pair                                                of
numbers in succession.  Next from this new series the same thing                                          is
repeated up to a certain number of operations.  One effect of this
                                                                                                          of

of range is shown in the following expression for the series that is
fonnd after S repetitions of such smoothing operations : —

                                                                                 2t
   It  wili  be seen at onca    that as the period is smaller and smaller, we
have greater      and  greater reduction and vice versd.
   28. We shall, however, give a clue when a series contains enormous
irregularities, to the distribution of each number amongst the ad-
jacent columns, that is effected by our two methods of smoothing.
We shall givo this by supposing that we have a series whose terms
are 13, of which each of the first and last 6 has the value zero, and
the 7th has the value G4. The result of six smoothing operations of
the second method gives 1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1.                From this we see that
the reduction for the middle term which occupies the same column as
the number 64 in the original set is rapid, and the distribution
amongst the adjacent terms is smooth-flowing and of a convergent
character.
   29.   We shall now apply our first method to a series whose terms
are 37, of which each of the first and last 18 has the value zero, and
the 19th has the value 343.             Suppose we have a number 7 for a
working     valuo   of m to start   the  operations, we shall after three opera
tions get a series of 19 terms whose values are +1, +3, +6, —11,
 -27, -42, +91, +75, +57, +37, +57, +75, +91, -42, -27,
 — 11, +6, +3, +1.          From this we see also that the reduction is
rapid for the middle term, and the distribution amongst the adjacent
terms is in smooth-flowing waves which grow smaller and smaller and
ultimately vanish.

   31. Suppose that mc=K„ where K„ is a known period and m is some
integral number.       Then using m as working value let us find as
before  the  first mean  series from the observation series, the first series
of remainders, and the second mean series ; but instead of subtracting
the terms of the second mean series from the corresponding terms
of the first series of remainders to get the second series of remainders,
let us add them in the      same order and call this series the first
difference  and sum series.   Again from this series let us find, in the

     33. Now the last factors of all the terms in the series (9) contain                                   a
term of the type                \,      so   that all these factors           are positive,      and, as
                                   2
before,      it     is    easy to see that each of them has a tendency to vanish
as   r    increases, except in the cases where the terms of the type —-
have the value                  zero.        The only terms of the type                  whose values
will      be zero, are those        which are formed from the sines of the angles
mba, 2mba, 3m6»,                   &c, because these angles alone are some integral
multiple of              Ztt.   Thus when     sufficiently great the series (9) will
                                                  r    is
be reduced to —

     If we curved now the first m values in order out of the last
horizontal line of our form which forms our rth difference and sum
series,    will be a variation with its full amplitude of the known
           it
period m, and if the next m values be curved in the same way we shall
have a repetition of the same curve, and so on.
                                                                                                  ^1—
     34. Although we have shown that the factors of the form
when       —      is    not tero, and        r   is   sufficiently great, reduce to zero, yet the
      f
reduction of the factors which are formed for the periods                                     less than
me    is    so much             slower than            the factors which       are formed        for the
periods greater than mc, that    almost impracticable to continue
                                                       it   is
the process to the limit. We shall therefore in what follows, in
vestigate a particular case of a known period, and we shall find                                           it
advantageous to use partly our method and partly the usual method
of combining the series with the known period.

by the method already described.         We shall, first of all, in the
following  table, give factors  of  the kind in series (9) for different
values      of    r     and different values of the periods of the type                  K.

     In the first pair of brackets of the above expression, we have
 arranged those terms of the simple harmonic series whose periods are
 less than the -period of 36 days, but not any of the period of the
            36
form — where             N   is any integral number;               in the second pair of
brackets        of the expression, we have arranged                   those terms        of the

                Periodicities when     the Periods are unknown.              385
                                                                   36
   simple  harmonic    series whose periods     are  of the form       that is, it
  contains   all the harmonics of 36 days; and in the third pair of
  brackets   of the expression, we have arranged those terms of the
  simple harmonic series whose periods are greater than the period
  36 days.    Suppose in the fifth difference and sum series, or in the last
  horizontal line of our form, we have 36M values where M is some
  large integral number.       Suppose we have another table ruled with
  more than M horizontal and 36 vertical lines.          In the first horizontal
  line let us enter 36 numerical values from the commencement of the
 series in order, in the second horizontal line the next 36 numerical
 values, and so on, in the Mth horizontal line the last 36 numerical
 values.    Let the sum and mean of each vertical column be taken in
 the (m + l)th and (m 4- 2)th horizontal lines respectively; then
 these means are the subject of our present investigation.
     37. The general term of the simple harmonic             series in the first
 horizontal line is  —
                                 usin (U+P6);
 the general     term of the same simple harmonic series in the same
 vertical column of the second horizontal line is —
                              wain   (U + P6 4-366);
the general     term of the same simple harmonic series in the same
vertical column of the third horizontal line is —
                            wain  {TJ+P6+2 (366)};
the general     term of the same simple harmonic           series  in the same
vertical column of the Mth horizontal line is —
                         wsin {U+P6 + (M-1)(366)};
thus the mean of this vertical column         will
                              +                              *-

then the    general series may    be  written—
                  Osin
                        j/u+Mz}365)-       /
                                             + P6
                                                  jsin
                                                          -
                                                          M-7T-
                                                              2

    Thus the last horizontal line of means in our new form, which is
composed     of 36 values, will   be of the form —
                                                                   2 d 2

     And it can be shown that the last factors of the terms in the first
 and the third pairs of brackets, where M is sufficiently great, reduce
 to zero (see curve of factors in fig. 1). Thus the 36 mean values
 found in the last horizontal line of our new form will represent the
 variation of the 36 day period.
      38. Next suppose that the period which we have detected is not an
 exact number of days but (say) of 36 4 days, we shall still take the
 nearest integral number, viz., 36, as our working value of m, and by
 it find (say) the 5th difference and sum series as already described.
  In   this case the amplitude of the variation of the period of 36-4 days
  will be slightly reduced in the 5th difference and sum series. The
                                                                  -
  reduction of the 1st simple harmonic variation that is of the period
  of 36 4 days will be (1- 99954), that of 18 2 days will be (1     99954),
  that of 12-13 will be (1 — -99954), and so on. The next thing is to
  show how the series is to be combined, which we are going to show
  in the following manner.
       39. In the first horizontal line of our new form, we shall enter first
   36 values. In the second horizontal line 8 values, from the beginning
   of the next 37 values, will be entered up to the 8th vertical column,
   but in the 9th vertical column we shall enter the mean of 9th and
   10th values out of the 37 values intended for the second horizontal
   line ; in the rest of the horizontal line the remaining values will be
   entered.     The object of combining the 9th and 10th values and
   entering the mean result in the 9th vertical column of the second
   horizontal line is that, since we are dealing with exact days only, we
   must enter the values in the columns in such a manner, that the error

                 Periodicities when     the  Periods are unknown.                 387
  of distribution    must not be greater than half a day, and so the mean
 of the 9th and 10th values, which was found more appropriate to
 9th column than any other column, was entered in the 9th column.
 Similarly up to the ?rcth horizontal line, the values will be entered by
 properly combining two values for entering in one column as many
 times as need be       in the course of entering the series in the manner
 stated above.       Also the sums and means of each vertical column are
 taken in the same way as in the preceding example.                 We will not go
iuto details, as in the preceding example, but can simply say that the
 last numbers of our new form will be the variation of the period of
364 days with its almost full magnitude, and for 36 points, the
intervals between which from point to point will be 1 T\ days.
    40. We should remark that the process of difference and sum series
has also an obvious advantage in separating the observation series
into any number of difference and sum series without affecting the
sories by the process. By affecting the series by the process, we mean
that in the former process for the remaining series and mean series, if
we take any arbitrary number as our working value of to, and if there
should    be    periodicities  lying between       —    and mc, we shall get the
                                                    2
periodicities mixed up in both the series with a greater amplitude
than the original series.         These separations are very useful for the
first trials when suspecting approximate periods.
Application of the Process and Detection of a Period of about 9£ Months.
    41.  For this purpose we have taken means of barometric pressure
at Bombay, from 1847 to 1872 and 1873 to 1878, thus forming our
Table I. The first part of monthly means is also given in Table I,
p:ige 11, of the volume entitled
                                           " The
                                                    Meteorology of the Bombay
Presidency," by Charles Chambers, Esq., F.R.S., Superintendent of
the Colaba       Observatory,    Bombay    ; and the last part at the foot of
Tables    I   to VI,   pages 58 to 63 of the
                                                      "
                                                        Bombay Magnetical and
Meteorological       Observations, 1871 to 1878."          The description of the
barometer and mode of observation, &c, are fully given in both the
volumes.        With the numbers in Table I, we have performed one
operation to get the first difference and sum series by taking 12 as our
working value of to, and the result is entered in Table II.                       The
numbers      in Table    II are subtracted from the corresponding           numbers
in Table    1  and entered in Table III.         At the foot of Table    II we have
entered the mean        for January in the 24 years, 1848 to 1871, the mean
for February in the 24 years, the mean for March, &c, &c, up to
December.*          These means form the annual variation of barometric
    * Properly speaking, we should have taken the means of thirty years, 1848 to
 1877, instead of 1848 to 1871 ; but first of all we have taken for our discussion the

  388             Mr. V. N. Nene.        On a Method     of Tracing
 pressure for the 24 years. If we add the constant 29-808, the annual
 mean of 26 years, 1847 to 1872, to the 12 numbers in our Table II,
 then these numbers will be found almost identical with the numbers
 at the foot of Table         I, given in the Meteorology of the Bombay
 Presidency.        The 12 numbers at the foot of Table             II  were then
 subtracted in order from each of the rows of 12 numbers commencing
 from January, and ending with December for each of the years 1848
 to 1877 of the same table, and the remainders entered in Table IV.
 Again, with the numbers in Table IV, we have performed three
 operations, taking 3 as our working value of m to get the third
 difference and sum. series, which we have given in Table V, then the
 numbers in Table V were subtracted from the corresponding numbers
 in Table IV, and entered in Table VI.
    We need not say that the sum of the numbers in Tables III, V,
 and VI, from July, 1848, to June, 1876, and successive repetitions of
 the corresponding numbers of annual variation at the foot of Table II,
 taken in order, will be equal to the corresponding numbers in Table I.
 The numbers in Tables         III  and VI are curved in figs. 2 and 3 respec
 tively. We presume that the curve of fig. 2 is composed of periods of
 more than 12 months, and that of fig. 3 is of less than 12 months and
 greater than three months.            By looking at the oscillations of the
 curve of fig. 2 we suspect that amongst the periods there are periods
 of 11 or 12 years, 4£ years, and 2 years. By looking at the oscillations
 of the curve of fig. 3, we see that amongst the periods there is a great
 predominance of a 9£-monthly period.            This we have ascertained in
                                —
 the following manner : We have first of all marked by a cross
 (thus x ) all the minima that have their time-interval                  from one
 minimum to next minimum 8 to 11 months, or any integral multiple
 of 8 to 11 months, and then filled up the rest 8 to 11-monthly minima
 that were less marked by a mark (thus 0). It is remarkable that the
 oscillations are more prominent and of greater amplitude from the
 year 1849 to 1862 than from the year 1863 to 1876.              If we count the
 marks     of  minima commencing from July, 1848,              and   ending with
 November,       1876,   they  will  be found   to be 37   ; thus there are 36
 periods in    340 months, i.e., 9£ months, as an average duration          for the
 period.
    42.  Again, we find that there are intermediate minima which are
of   less amplitude      than already stated, and the duration of which is
 also from 8 to 11 months.           These also we have marked by marks
(*  and   0), as  in the  preceding example. In the present case both these
series from 1847 to 1872, and have made all the operations we are going to describe.
But afterwards it was thought proper to add to the above result the six years 1873
to 1878, which were available.       But as the work was far advanced it was not
worth while to go into the trouble of doing the work over again for the sake of
including those six years.

                Periodicities when      the Periods are unknown.            38!)
marks are made on the upper side           of the curve, while in the preceding
case on   the lower side of it, to distinguish them from each other.
   43. We find from May, 1858, to October, 1866, that the occurrences
of these minima have disappeared.               From December, 1848, to May,
1858,   there are 12 periods, that is        W   =H months for a period, and
from October, 1866, to April, 1877, there are 13 periods, i.e., 1iY=9$
months    for a period.    From this we might guess that to form such           a
curve there must be      two prominent periods, which may be as (say)           5
and 9§ months.
   44. To clear     this doubt, we have further taken the numbers in
Table VI, and performed five operations to get the fifth difference and
sum series by taking 5 as our working value of m. These numbers we
have given in Table VII and curved in fig. 4.             Then the numbers in
Table VII were subtracted              from the corresponding        numbers in
Table VI and entered in Table VIII, and curved in dotted lines with
the corresponding      curve of fig. 3, and with the same scale and on the
same zero line.       Now, by looking at the oscillations of the dotted
curve, it appears that it is of a simple harmonic character, and it
confirms the 9^-monthly period as already described.                But in both
these  curves (continuous and dotted) there are a few exceptions to the
confirmation of the 9^-monthly period.               These exceptional periods
are — from March, 1857, to December, 1859; June, 1863, to September,
1866;    April, 1868, to January, 1871; and November,               1872, to the
end.
   45.   We shall now turn to fig. 4. By looking at the oscillations of
this curve     we again see that amongst the periods there is a great
predominance of a 4|-monthly period.               This we have ascertained as
in the case of 9^-mouthly period.           If we count all the marks made on
the curve, we have 65 ; thus there are 64 periods in 302 months (from
                                                                                 *
June, 1850, to August, 1875), and *s°»=472, i.e., nearly 4f months
which is an average duration for the period.
    We should now here remark that, although in the continuous carve
of fig. 3 we found that the occurrences of the subordinate minima
have disappeared from May, 1858, to October, 1866, still they appear
in the 4j-monthly period curve of fig. 4.
     Application of the Method     to find   the Duration of an  exact Period.
    46. The writer had taken a small series of daily means of barometer
observations, derived from hourly tabulations of barograph, uncor
rected to standard barometer No. 58, from 1st December, 1875, to
31st December, 1876, for trial, when the method of detecting any
   * The writer  found worth noticing that the period of 4f months is almost an
exact  multiple of the 36i-day period which he has found further on in paragraph
 50.

  390           Mr. V. N. Nene.       On a Method     of Tracing
  simple harmonic waves of an approximately known period was in its
  infancy. The aim was to see whether on barometer observations there
  was any influence of lunar period, the duration of which is about
  30 days.    The trial which we are going to describe was made in the
  earlier period of 1878, when the barograph tabulation was under con
  sideration.    Daily means of barograph          tabulations,   corrected to
  standard barometer No. 58, for this same period, may be found in the
  "           Magnetical and Meteorological Observations, 1871 to 1878,"
    Bombay
 pp. 60 and 61. The difference between the daily means, corrected and
 uncorrected to standard instrument, is very small, and not varying
 from day to day more than (say) about two or three thousandths of
 an inch.     The treatment which was given to these daily means and
 the results which followed from it may be considered satisfactory.
     47. In order to get the series in smooth-flowing       numbers, we have
 taken 15 as our working value of m, and found first mean series. Then
 this series has been taken for further operation, and by taking 45 as
 our working value of m, we have found first, second, <fec, up to fifth
 series of remainders.    The first, third, and fifth series of remainders are
 curved in fig. 5 in plain, dotted, and interrupted lines respectively,
 with the same scale and on the same zero line. Looking at the plain
 curve, we see that there are nine turning-points of minima, the dura
 tion thereof being moderately uniform. If we take the first minimum
 in the middle of the small gap that occurs in the curve, we have in
 298 days eight periods.      Thus an average duration of one period is
 about 37 days. Again, if we count the days from the second mini
 mum, we have 258 days in seven waves, and thus an average duration
 is still about 37 days. Thus, instead of the lunar period of 30 days,
 we find a 37-day period.     From this it is clear that if there be lunar
period in the series at all, the amplitude of it must be much smaller
 than the 37-day period.
    48. The object of drawing the three curves on the same zero line
and with the same scale is to show graphically the process of swelling
the waves as the operations increase and of their appearance, as in the
case of the third wave, which disappears in the first series of
remainders.     The object is also to impress the necessity of making
smooth-flowing numbers before taking them for operation ; as in the
case of second, third, fifth, and seventh waves, all the irregular move
ments in the first series of remainders are found to appear in the third
and fifth series of remainders. With these remarks we conclude with
out giving the numbers from which the present curves are formed.
                             Second Application.
    49.  In order to test the reality of the period of about 37 days on a
large scale, we have taken a series of weekly means of barometer
observations at Bombay, commencing from 1st January, 1848, and

               Periodicities when    the Periods are unknown.             391
 ending with the 2nd January, 1852, as the year 1848 was the first
 complete    year when the system of hourly observations                began
 without interruption at the Colaba Observatory.          The weekly means
 were chosen in place of daily means for two reasons, first that as
 no  observations   were    made on     Sundays and a few holidays, no
 continuous daily means were available during the period ; second, to
 save comparatively the labour of calculations of the processes.           On
 some occasions    when    there were atmospheric      disturbances,   or  for
 similar reasons, observations were made on Sundays and none on
 Mondays.     For this and similar other reasons the weekly means were
 calculated from all the daily means from Sunday to Saturday.
    These means are given in Table IX, and curved in fig. 6 in an
 interrupted   line. With these weekly means we have performed
 5 operations to get the fifth series of remainders.        The numbers in
the first and fifth series of remainders are also given in Tables X
and XI respectively, and curved with the interrupted line of fig. 6,
and with the same scale in dotted and continuous lines respectively.
   50.  Looking    at the    continuous  curve,  it will be  seen that from
24th   week of 1848 to 8th week of 1849, we have 7 waves of simple
harmonic character, and equidistant in duration.             Thus there are
36 weeks, or 36 X 7 days in 7 periods, so that the average duration
of a period is exactly 36 days.         Again, from 8th week of 1849 to
24th week of 1850 there are 13 waves, also almost equidistant in
duration.     Thus there are 68 weeks, or 68 X 7 days in 13 periods, so
that the average duration of a period is nearly 36-6 days.            Again,
from 24th week of 1850 to 34th week of 1851 there are, we presume,
 12 periods.    It will be observed that out of these there are 7 periods,
viz., 1st and 7th to 12th, whose waves are quite prominent ; with
regard to the remaining 5 periods their waves seem to be almost
obscured by irregularities. Thus there are 63 weeks, or 63 x 7 days, in
12 periods, so that the average duration of a period is nearly 36-7
days.    If we now add all the weeks and periods together, to get the
mean duration of the period we have 167 weeks and 32 periods,
therefore the average duration of the period is nearly 36-53 days.
   51. We should here remark that as we are dealing with weekly
values, there is a possibility of an error, either too much or too little,
of one week in the whole period of 167 weoks.         If we take 166 weeks
for 32 periods, we get an average duration of 36-31 days; and if we
take 168 weeks, we get 36*75 days.        Thus the period we have found
out is approximate to the extent above mentioned.            We shall, there
fore, say that the period is approximately 36J days instead of 36"53
days.

same zero line, and with the same scale, is the same as in the preced

waves of five weekly period of the continuous curve from the numbers
corresponding to the interrupted curve for the periods from 31st to
37th week of 1848, and 13th to 23rd week of 1849 is worth noticing.
It   should also be noticed that the irregular movements that exist in
the interrupted curve for the period from 31st week of 1850 to 15th
week of 1851, also exist in the continuous line curve.
   53. Let us now combine the result by taking 36^ days as an aver
age duration of the period to get an average range or amplitude of
the period, as shown in paragraph 39.

    But we must also notice that tho facts that the period is not an
integral number of weeks, that our method of combination is in
consequence rather rough, and that the number of points in the curve
is too small, tend to reduce the range of the period.           If the process
 had been applied to the continuous daily means instead of to weekly
 means the results wonld have been of a larger and equal amplitude of
 several groups of the period.

 L "Magnetic Polarity           and Neutrality."         By Professor     D. E.
             Hughes, F.R.S. Received February 23, 1884.
    In recent papers upon the Theory of Magnetism,*                 I  gave the
opinion drawn from a long series of personal researches, that mag
 netism in iron and steel is entirely due to the inherent polarity of its
 molecules, the force of which could neither be destroyed nor aug
mented ; that, when we have evident magnetism, the molecules rotate
so as to have all their similar polarities in one direction ; and that
 neutrality is a symmetrical arrangement or a balancing of polar
forces, as in a closed circuit of mutual attractions.             The series of
researches which I now present bear unmistakable testimony to the
truth of these views, showing the opposite polarities which exist in
an apparently neutral bar of iron ; and that it is by this means alone
that external neutrality occurs in the iron cores of an electro-magnet
upon the cessation of the inducing current.
    The instrument used for measurements! consists of a delicate silk
fibre- suspended magnetic needle, always brought to its zero-mark by
the influence of a large magnet at a distance, the angle of which
gives the degree of force required to balance any magnetised body
placed on the opposite side of the needle. It can also employ electro
magnetic effects by the use of two opposing coils on each side of the
needle, balanced so that an electric current passing through the coils
has no influence on the needle, except when a piece of iron or steel is
placed inside one of the coils; this again being balanced and
measured by the large revolving magnet.

  Before  commencing my researches upon neutrality,    felt that it
                                                         I
¦wasnecessary to observe the curves of magnetic penetration, whilst
under the influence of its inducing cause. It well known, however,
                                                is
from the researches of Gaugain, Du Moncel, and Jamin, that the
magnetism does not penetrate to      avery great depth with its full
force, decreasing rapidly from the exterior to the interior. Most
observations have been made by means of tubes of various thickness,
introduced into each other.  These, however, introduce an element of
error, as, in separating them, they are necessarily drawn over each
other.   Jamin's method of dissolving the exterior of a steel magnet
in diluted sulphuric acid gave results free from experimental error,
but this could only be employed after the cessation of the inducing
cause, the observations being really upon the permanent remaining
magnetism.
   The methods employed by myself consisted, first, in superposing
twenty flat iron strips,
                       ^ millim. thick, 20 centims. long, and centims.
                                                              3
in width. These could be built up into a solid rod       1  centim. total
thickness.  Each piece was carefully selected and measured for its
magnetic capacity, so that they should all be equal in value whilst
under the influence of an inducing force, as well as their remaining
magnetism when the influence ceased; the remaining magnetism
being about  ^ of its capacity in the size and kind of iron employed.
   These strips forming a componnd bar were placed in contact with
the poles of a strong permanent magnet, or they could be laid on one-
pole, the object being to polarise the lower bar only by contact, and
observe the degree of penetration.     The upper strip was carefully
separated  whilst the remainder was left under the polarising influence.
We could thus separate each bar while under the influence without
fear of   reactions taking place between the separated bar and its
companions.      We had thus a  bar or strip, separated while under the
inducing influence, and, knowing its coefficient of remaining mag
netism, we could estimate its full power when under the polarising
influence.    By this means the values were plotted graphically,
giving curves of varying degrees, as the inducing force was changed,
or the material of the strip from soft iron to hard steel. These
curves were verified by a somewhat similar method, using a separate
atrip whose coefficient of remaining magnetism was known, and
drawing this over the poles of a magnet, but separated from        itby
different degrees of thickness of iron.
    These again were verified by an electro-magnetic method, in which
a series of concentric tubes divided lengthwise was employed, so as to
allow separation without friction, confirming the numerous curves
obtained by the previous methods, showing that with a limited magne
tising power acting upon homogeneous iron or steel, the penetration     is
inversely as the square of the distance from the inducing power, but

with high powers the exterior soon arrives at its saturation, the
distant layers rise in value, and also if the bar is not homogeneous
there is a consequent deformation, owing to the comparative rigidity
of its molecules.
   In all cases, whatever the force employed, or nature of the iron or
steel, there are no reversals of polarity in the interior, but a constant
diminishing curve of penetration from the outside to the centre.
This changes, however, the instant the exterior polarising force ceases,
the different degrees of force between the external and internal react
upon each other, producing the following results : —
                    Internal Waves of Opposite Polarity.
   All varieties of iron and steel have a high magnetic capacity
whilst under the influence of its inducing force, such as the electro
magnetic coils, or strong permanent magnets, but this power in a
great measure disappears on the cessation of the inducing influence,
a return more or less perfect towards neutrality being the result;
remaining magnetism is therefore a partial neutrality, more perfect in
soft iron, where the molecules are in a greater state of freedom, than
in comparatively rigid cast steel. Our so-called permanent magnets
are simply the remains of a far higher magnetic state, and it is
already in most cases half-way down on its road to neutrality.
   It is absolutely necessary in a theory of magnetism that we should
know the cause of neutrality, for it is really the starting point to
appreciate how polarity becomes evident.       In my previous researches
upon neutrality    I  used the induction balance, but in these      I have
employed more simple      methods, which  allow  of repetition by the most
simple means.
   The first consists in forming compound bars of ordinary hoop-
iron, \ millim. thick, and 30 or more centims. long, twenty or more
of which could be superposed, bound together by a fine copper wire
and forming a rod of any desired thickness ; they were magnetised
by drawing over magnets of various powers, and the degree of
approach to neutrality observed by the amount of its remaining
magnetism.      Now, on carefully separating them, there were invariably
found violent curves of opposing magnetism, previously held bound
by the closed circuit of mutual attractions.
   The second method consists in superposing the divided concentric
tubes, already mentioned, bound together by a fine copper wire, and
magnetising them in the electro-magnetic          coils of the measuring
balance ; by this means we could observe the charge or full magnetic
capacity under the influence of an electric current, the remaining
magnetism upon its cessation, and after taking out the tubular core,
separate it, and observe the polarity of its successive internal layers.
This method is objectionable, as the slightest rubbing of one tubular

408                        Prof. D. E. Hughes.                   [Mar. 6,
 surface against another may alter the true valne.           The electro
magnetic method is however infinitely superior -when observationa
are made on solid bars, or tubes of different degrees of thickness, to
observe the influence of depth or thickness, in producing a perfect
 return to neutrality after cessation of the inducing effect of the
coils.
    The third method was a chemical one, somewhat similar to that
 employed by Jamin, except that as the object was to stndy the curves
of neutrality, the bars were of annealed steel, highly magnetised in
the coils, and afterwards reduced almost to a zero, by vibrating them,
or beating them gently with a wooden mallet. We had by this means
aided the molecules to follow their inclination, as they do in soft iron,
for when a soft steel rod is in a state of vibration, its molecules are
comparatively free ; but they rigidly retain the true curve of neu
trality when not vibrated.      We are thus enabled by dissolving the
exterior in various dilute acids, and by taking repeated observations,
to draw graphically the waves of opposing polarities, which have
produced external neutrality.
   The curves obtained by the different methods are identical in form.
The simplest and most accurate method is the first, as we can choose
a hard variety of iron, such as ordinary hoop-iron, and by slight
vibrations, or blows with a mallet, allow the molecules         sufficient
freedom to form their curve before separating, and as the material is
sufficiently rigid not to be influenced by mere contact, or even
frictional drawings, we have on each strip a perfect record of its
state, and can thus analyse the internal state of a neutral compound
bar.
   If  we take a compound bar of the hoop-iron, and draw the lower side
over the south pole of a magnet, it will be found nearly neutral, or if
not sufficiently so, we can reduce it by slight blows with a mallet :
suppose the united bar gives still a remaining magnetism of 18° on
the magnetic balance, on separating the components and observing the
same ends we find the lowest (or the bar which had touched the
magnet) 150° north polarity, the next may be Blightly north or zero ;
the rest will have varying degrees of south polarity, from 60° to 10°,
the total of which exactly balances the north polarity of 150, less 18°,
which we already observed as the remaining magnetism.
   If we do not wish to approach a perfect neutrality, we should not
vibrate the rods.       In this case we may have 75° of remaining
magnetism,    and  find  on separating the strips, that we have on lower
strip 150° north, and the total opposing south polarity of the interior
but 75° south, leaving the remaining 75° of north polarity first
observed on the compound bar unbalanced.
   The mutual reactions between the magnetic molecules in a solid
bar are precisely similar to those between two or more separate bars.

1884.]               On Magnetic      Polarity and Neutrality.                      409
the reactions      in the solid bar being more pronounced and complete
than those obtained through a separation of air ; the greater the separa
tion the less the reaction, but in no case will the law of neutrality be
changed.
   In homogeneous iron or steel, we have a well-defined curve, the
distance of which can be calculated from observation upon thn
remaining magnetism, but if the interior is harder than the exterior,
the inner portion will from its rigidity preserve its previous magne
tism, reversing entirely the outer portions.              This occurs also in small
electro-magnets where from the small number of molecules in the
interior compared with the vastly greater exterior, and also all the
surrounding inducing lines of magnetic force acting on the centre
from    all   sides,   the outside is completely         reversed to a remarkable
depth.
   I have been        enabled to prove this by the chemical method, em
ploying either      dilute  sulphuric acid, acidulated bichromate of potass,
or dilute nitric acid (1 pint acid to 5 water), the latter being far more
rapid and equal in its action.            The following experiment will show
rapidly the influence of the outside reversal polarity. Let us take a
soft steel wire 1 millim. diameter, 10 centims. long.               Magnetise it in a
coil, or by drawing        over   a  strong permanent magnet, so that it has
perhaps a remaining magnetism of 200°. If we vibrate this rod or give
several blows from a mallet, we can reduce this to 25° ; we have now
almost perfect neutrality, having only a remaining magnetism of 25°,
which remains a constant for years if not remagnetised.                            Place
this rod in dilute nitric acid, and in fifteen minutes it will rise
to 50°, or double its previous value, in one hour to 75°, and two or
three hours to 100°, or four times its previous force ; the increased
force of 75° has been rendered evident by dissolving an equal
opposing polarity of 75°, so that we have already found 75 + 75 + 25
 =175°, or 87 per cent. of its highest force. This is so easily repeated
with soft steels of all sizes and dimensions, that there can no longer
be any doubt         as to the existence        of the outside reversed polarity.
The experiment is more difficult to repeat with soft iron, as from the
freedom of its molecules a fresh outside reversed curve is formed
 anew as the exterior is dissolved, the balancing curves reproducing
themselves until we have almost entirely dissolved the iron ; still with
 care, and iron not too soft, we can render evident all the neutral
 curves seen in steel.*
    The curves obtained by the various methods are so numerous, each
requiring more space than the limits of this paper will allow, that                      I

am forced to give roughly the general outlines, as in fig. 1. Suppose
we take a compound bar of iron, of eleven strips, and draw it over a
permanent magnet, polarising its lower side only, its neutrality may
be found nearly perfect, or 15° of remaining north polarity at the
north end ; now on carefully separating these rods and observing the
same   ends, we have for the lower or the           side which had      been
magnetised, 350° north; the following successively observed would
give 10° south, 35° S., 55° S., 60° S., 50° S., 40° S., 22° S, 10° S., 6° S.,
5°S. ; here all the superposed bars are opposite in polarity to the
exterior 350° north, the total south observed being 292, plus 30° south
obtained from the exterior, by the coating of its lower face with the
TV milim. of iron strip already mentioned.       We are thus enabled to
account for 323° degrees south, and 350° north, leaving a remaining
magnetism unaccounted for of 12°, which was doubtless disseminated
on the surface of each bar on separation.
   The above curves were obtained from the same polar (north) end of
a compound bar of iron, the south or opposite end of the bar would
give reversed curves to these.    The curves are reductions to a similar
force, but do not exhibit the perfection     of the curves obtained on      a
larger scale.
   No. 1 represents the typical curve of penetration of a bar of iron,
whilst under the influence of an exterior polarising force, applied at A,
or only at one side of a bar. When the force is applied to the whole
of the exterior surface (as in a coil), A would represent the polar
force on its surface, whilst B the interior. In all cases there would
be a depression at the centre ; great if the bar is thick, and com
paratively small if the bar is thin. The curve rises with the exterior
polarisation force, but in no case can a reversal ensue whilst under its
influence.    The instant, however, that it ceases, the higher magnetic
power of the exterior layers reacts gradually and successively upon the
weaker interior layers, rotating them through neutrality to a strong
opposite polarity.

 1884.]             On Magnetic   Polarity and Neutrality.                 411
     This is seen in No.  2,  which represents exactly what takes place in
 No. 1 upon the cessation of the inducing influence.          We notice that
the first portion of the exterior has rotated to south polarity, followed
hy an intense north, but not of great density ; its reaction, being more
violent, rapidly rotates all the interior to a sonth polarity, gradually
weakening in intensity as the distance increases from the inducing
north polarity. The exterior, in fact, reacts upon its interior precisely
as before the inducing exterior magnet reacted upon the whole.              In
No. 1 the south pole of the permanent magnet produced a continuous
curve of north the instant this ceased, the north of the exterior
produced an interior south, and if these are perfectly balanced, then
and then only will the bar become neutral.
    When both sides of a bar are polarised at the same time, then we
have two similar curves to No. 2, as shown at No. 3, the diminishing
curves of internal opposing polarity overlapping each other ; the curve
represents those obtained on bars 2 centims. in thickness.              If the
inducing force is great the penetration is greater and more intense,
reacting more violently, and the central depression of the opposing
waves is less pronounced. If we keep the previous force and diminish
the thickness of the bar, the two central waves cross each other, and
at last, as in No. 4, we have only one wave ; this occurs with bars of
but 3 millims. thickness.          We notice here that from a want of
sufficient material in the centre of the iron, it is constrained to
force its central wave to a far higher degree, and that the exterior
now also commences to be reacted upon more violently.               Evidently
the   conditions   are strained, and we   shall  see the  result later.   This
want    of sufficient material to form the internal opposing wave of
polarity is shown when we reduce the thickness of the bar to 1 millim.,
the width being 3 centims., and the length 30 or more, as in all pre
vious cases.     Here there are no traces of an internal curve, the
opposing polarity, as shown in No. 5, being entirely on the sur
face.
    I have shown that we may clearly perceive this curve by dissolving
its exterior in dilute nitric acid, but as        I employed vibrations to
reduce it to neutrality, this might give rise to objections on the score
of mechanical      reactions.    To meet this objection several strips of
magnetised steel of various forms, but all      \  millim. in thickness, were
reduced almost to neutrality by simply heating them to a dull red
heat, allowing them to cool slowly.        These gave remarkable results,
proving that the vibrations caused by heat are similar in results to
mechanical vibrations, and      I found that in most cases their external
evident magnetism was increased 100 per cent. by an immersion of
fifteen minutes, and 600 per cent. in one hour.
    Interesting results can be obtained by this method, but if rapidity
of chemical action is desired we must first remove the scale or oxide

on the exterior by polishing with emery paper, or dissolve this first
in acidulated bichromate of potass.
    A perfect curve of these opposing polarities can be obtained by
placing a glass vessel containing the steel and solvent in the balance
itself, taking continual observations during its solution, and we may
thus observe the gradual rise in force to a maximum, then its fall to
zero, to an opposing polarity, completely verifying all previous obser
vations.
    Supposing the magnetised steel previous to heating gave 200° we
should reduce it to 50° if heated to dall red, a bright red heat would
probably reduce it to 20° ; we should then start from an almost
perfect neutrality to find, on dissolving its exterior (and allowing
for the reversed polarity of the reversed portion), all its previous
polarity.
    Faraday remarked that the magnetic qualities of iron disappeared
 at yellow-red heat (1050° C.), reappearing gradually when cooled to
red heat (700° C.).    I have found that if we heat the steel to yellow-
red heat the whole previous structure disappears, and does not re
appear on cooling.                                             I
                        No satisfactory explanation, as far as am aware,
has been offered relative to the disappearance of the magnetic qualities
of iron and steel at certain temperatures, but noticing that its internal
 structure is also changed, the following hypothesis may explain the
 phenomenon.
    Assuming that increased heat increases molecular vibration, and
 that molecules would oscillate to a degree dangerous for the stability
 of any previous structure, a moment would arrive when the oscilla
 tions were so great that all structural formations disappear ; and
 precisely at this instant there would be no external evidence of
 polarity, or magnetic quality, as the molecules would be oscillating
 through a range on both sides of external neutrality.     On cooling (the
 previous structure having disappeared) they would satisfy their
 mutual attractions by the shortest path, forming probably, if perfectly
 free, a closed circuit of two, grouping themselves as a double mole
 cule ; but if a directing influence, such as a continuous current of
 electricity, was passed through the bar, then they would obey this
 influence, and in the latter case the closed magnetic circuit would be
 in concentric circles, as I have demonstrated in previous papers.
    A similar effect is caused by mechanical vibrations. I have already
 shown that we increase the internal curves by gentle blows of a
 mallet, thus allowing the molecules sufficient freedom to follow their
 path, as in the case of red heat; but if we strike violently upon the
 end of the rod, the whole structure is broken down by the violent
 oscillations of its molecules, and the neutrality now resembles exactly
 that produced at yellow-red heat.
    The theory of symmetrical      neutrality which  I have  demonstrated,

  1884.]            On Magnetic  Polarity and Neutrality.
 requires that there should be a sufficient thickness in a bar of iron or
 steel in order to produce asymmetrical opposing polarity. Coulomb's-
 theory of the neutrality taking place in the molecule itself requires
 no thickness except that of a molecule.          Ampere's theory could
 allow of heterogeneity on the surface as easily as in the interior, con
 sequently thickness of a bar would, according to these theories, have
 no favourable result ; but if the theory that I have advanced is true,,
 thickness should have the greatest possible influence.       An extremely
 thin strip or bar of iron should have an infinitely higher proportionate
 remaining magnetism from the want of interior reaction, whilst an
 extremely large solid bar should have infinitely less proportionate
 remaining magnetism.       This at once allows us to test the truth of the
 theory by an independent method free from all experimental errors,
as we may place in the coil of the magnetic balance bars of iron or
steel of different degrees of thickness, observe their magnetic capacity
whilst under the influence of an electric current, and the degree of
remaining magnetism on its cessation, and note the extraordinary
influence which thickness has in allowing space for the opposing waves
of polarity to produce instantly a higher degree of neutrality than
is possible without its aid.
   The conditions of the experiments are really those of ordinary
electro-magnets, the iron or steel under observation is simply at the
time of observation a core of an electro-magnet.
   Numerous experiments were made on this subject, all confirming
the views advanced.        A few examples will be sufficient to include
them all, for if we place in the coil of the balance different thicknesses
of the same diameter and length of iron or steel, we notice a marked
rise  in its exterior force or magnetic capacity while under the influ
ence   of the electric current, and upon its cessation an equally marked
return to a more perfect neutrality with each increase of thickness.
The table on the following page contains sufficient examples to show
this clearly.
   This table gives the results of round cores ; experiments, how
ever, were also made with flat bars with like results, the form or
length having no direct influence, as the reactions are transversal
and localised from a point in the exterior to one in the interior.
   Comparing No. 1 of the table (consisting of an extremely thin
sheet-iron tube) with No. 2 (a solid bar of iron of exactly similar
size), we have for the thin tube a remaining magnetism of 50 per
cent. of its previous polar force, and in the solid bar we have only
3 per cent. ; whilst in the solid bar, where the opposing waves of
polarity could easily form and produce a near approach to neutrality,
we find that its polar force under the influence of the coil is 400 per
cent. greater than that of the thin tube.
   Although, as well known, hard steel has a higher retaining power,

superiority of thin steel bars over thick where permanent magnetism
is  desired, are fully confirmed, as in order to have raised the cast-
steel    centims. thick bar to a high remaining magnetism, we should
          2
have had to employ at least fifty times stronger inducing force than
that necessary for the thin bars. The proportion of remaining
magnetism in iron or steel to the inducing force           almost similar          is
throughout the entire range up to saturation, where the remaining
magnetism         no longer proportional to the inducing power, but
                     is
remains a constant, no matter how high and powerful the influence
excited.    The molecules have simply then rotated to parallelism and
cannot rotate further without diminishing its force, and the sudden

 being 25 per cent. for iron, and 33 per cent. for steel of its propor
 tionate previous force.
    The most conclusive experiments, however, will be seen in Nos. 8t
 9, 10,  and 11.      No.  8 being a brass tube coated        with an exceedingly
 thin transparent coat of iron (I was unable to measure its thickness),
this thin coating of iron was easily raised to its saturation by a feebl-
 battery, from which point no increase of battery power had the
 slightest effect, giving always 0o.95.              The extraordinary effect of
 thinness was seen on taking off the inducing influence, no perceptible
 movement of the needle on the balance occurred, indicating that its
retaining power was the same as its capacity or 100 per cent. of
retention; vibrations and hammering which reduce a solid bar at
once to perfect neutrality had no effect.             I have, however, marked it
down as 0o-94 as a limit of experimental error ; if we assume only
80 per cent. of its previous force it is still sufficiently remarkable.
At No. 9 where the brass was coated to a measurable thickness of
-jig millim., we already see a better return to neutrality, having now
only 50 per cent. of proportionate remaining magnetism ; at No. 10,
where we have 1 millim. thickness, we have improved our neutrality by
having only 20 per cent., and at No. 11 we have, by means of an
increased thickness of 1 centim., almost completely allowed the
balancing waves of opposite polarity perfect formation, the remaining
magnetism now being only 3 per cent. of its proportional power ; and
if we even neglect the proportional power, we see that the 1 centim.
bar has far less remaining magnetism than that of 1 or                       millim.,
whilst its magnetic capacity is far higher.
    No. 4 shows that while bundles of wires have a higher remaining
magnetism than solid (due to the want of homogeneity allowing
perfect formation of the opposing waves), still from their increased
surface exposed to the inducing effect they give a higher magnetic
effect, the differential effect (as that employed in temporary electro
magnetic and induction coils) is greater, being here for a solid bar
960-29=931, and for the bundles of iron wire 1,268-142=1,126
useful effect.*

electro-magnets    requiring rapid charges, such as those employed for telegraph
relays, large electro-magnets  requiring several seconds to charge them to saturation,
while extremely small electro-magnets       may be saturated in the ttjW V*3^ °f a

   results with thin slices of iron filings as we do with the solid iron in
  •sheets or tubes.
      It would be difficult to explain these effects upon any hypothesis
   except that of molecular rotation.      For, if we regard it as simply a
  •case of magnetic induction, the stronger reacting upon the weaker,
   we fail to explain the perfect spiral form of the opposing waves, and
   above all, the reversal of the exterior, which was evidently the most
   strongly polarised, but if we suppose that the similar polarities of all
   the molecules have rotated, symmetrically           pointing their north
  polarities to the evident north end of the bar, we have only to
  imagine a series of magnetic needles superposed with all their north
  polarities pointing in one direction brought and held there by the
  influence of a strong external magnet.        If this influence was nearer
  the first needle than the last, we should have a slight spiral due to its
  diminishing effect, precisely as we notice in the curve in iron whilst
  under external influence.      Now withdraw the exterior force, the
  needles would react against each other, and as they are free to move
  in all directions, there would be an increased spiral, the outside being
  reversed to its previous position, while the spiral would continue in
  the interior, reversing the larger portion of the needles until they
  all found a position of equilibrium, which would then represent
 neutrality.
     If we had no frictional resistance to molecular rotation, we should
 obtain perfectly balanced curves in comparatively thin iron, but as
 this resistance is great and demonstrated by the loosening influence
 of mechanical vibrations, we require a certain depth of iron so that a
 complete curve shall be easily obtained with comparatively infinitely
 small motion of each molecule.
     That inherent magnetic polarity is a quality of all matter, solid,
 liquid, gaseous, and the ether itself, varying only in degree and not
 in nature, seems demonstrated by a series of researches I have been
 making upon the mechanism employed in magnetic conduction
 through the atmosphere and Crookes's vacuum.
     These researches are being made by means of the induction and
magnetic balance. They prove that the atmosphere, and presumably
the ether as well as all liquids and gases, have their saturation point
similar to iron, that the curve is the same as in perfect soft iron, and
that the highest magnetic capacity of iron does not exceed that of the
atmosphere by more than forty times, consequently we may fairly
assume that the ether may be regarded as an extremely magnetic
body, obeying the same laws as those of iron ; and as           I regard the
symmetrical rotation of magnetic molecules as the cause of evident
magnetism in iron, and as the difference in force between iron, copper,
and ether is simply a differential one, I believe that the neutrality
which appears in all paramagnetic and diamagnetic bodies, wherever

the exciting influence is withdrawn, is formed by mutual molecular
reactions producing closed circuits of mutual attractions as demon
strated in iron.
    A line of force between a magnet and its armature is to me simply
a line of molecular rotation, lines would neither be added nor
subtracted,     they could simply be rotated           from a symmetrical
neutrality to an equal symmetrical point of saturation.
    In my paper upon the theory of magnetism, I showed that there
•were several molecular         arrangements    which produced external
neutrality, the circular chain of molecules, when an electric current
passes through an iron wire, a neutrality produced by an artificial
superposition of a weaker contrary magnetism upon one more
internal, and made the supposition that were it possible to have a piece
of iron free from the influence of tbe earth, then (if there had been no
previous magnetisation directing the structure) the molecules would
short circuit their mutual attractions in the shortest path.
    The experiments cited in this paper are of an extremely simple
nature, and after being verified by independent observers can no longer
leave doubt as to the cause of neutrality.
    Whatever theory we adopt as an explanation of evident magnetism,
it will   be found that neutrality occurring after the cessation of an
external inducing force upon a bar of iron or steel, is the result of
symmetrically opposed polar forces, producing apparent waves of
opposite polarity, or reactions between the exterior and interior of a
bar of iron.

    The " fibrin ferment      which makes its appearance in shed blood is
generally,   I   believe,  supposed to arise from the cellular elements of
 blood, either from ordinary white corpuscles or from some special kind
of corpuscles, the cells so concerned discharging the ferment into the
blood or setting it free by their actual disintegration.      Without wish
ing   to deny  that  this may  be  one  source of fibrin  ferment, I am able,
I think, to bring forward evidence that ferment may make its appear
ance in blood-plasma perfectly free from cellular, and indeed from all
formed elements, in which case it must arise from some constituents
of the plasma itself, and not from cells of any kind.
    It will be most convenient, perhaps, if I state the facts which
I  have to bring forward in connexion with two series of experiments.

418                            Dr. L. C. Wooldridge.                    [Mar. 6,
   I. A measured quantity of blood was received directly from the
carotid of a dog into a vessel containing an equal bulk of a 10 per
cent. solution of common salt, great care being taken that the com
plete admixture of the blood and salt solution was effected as rapidly
as possible.       By the help of the centrifugal machine plasma was sepa
rated from this " salted blood," and this plasma was again subjected
to the action of the machine until all traces of formed elements were
removed.     As is well known, a portion of snch a plasma diluted with
five times its bulk of water coagulates rapidly, whereas the undiluted
plasma remains liquid for an almost indefinite time.
   According to commonly received opinions, such a " salted plasma "
contains all the fibrin factors, including the ferment, the latter having
already passed out of the cells into the plasma ; and the reason given of
the absence of coagulation in such a salted plasma and its occurrence
upon dilution is, that the presence of the salts presents a hindrance to
the action of the fibrin ferment, and that this obstructive influence of
the salt is removed by the dilution of the mass.
                                     I
  No one, however, as far as know, has taken the trouble to ascer
tain whether fibrin ferment is present in such salted plasma.     And,
as a matter of fact, it is not ; whereas it does make its appearance as
soon as dilution with water has taken place, as the following experi
ment shows     :   —
  A portion of the undiluted salted plasma was treated with absolute
alcoholin large excess, and the precipitate after being allowed to
remain under the alcohol for three or four weeks was dried at a low
temperature and extracted with water— that is to say, the plasma
was treated in the way usually adopted for obtaining a solution of
ferment   fairly free from proteids, &c.     A portion of the diluted
plasma,  or rather  of the serum resulting from the coagulation of the
diluted plasma, was treated in an exactly similar manner.
    The aqueous extract of the diluted plasma brought about coagula
tion in specimens of magnesium sulphate plasma (such as is usually
 employed for testing the presence of fibrin ferment) in from ten to
fifteen minutes. The aqueous extract of the undiluted plasma brought
about no coagulation in specimens of the same magnesium sulphate
plasma, even after the lapse of eighteen hours.
    The conditions of each experiment were made as exactly alike as
possible ; and the conclusion seemed inevitable that ferment is present
in the diluted and coagulated plasma, but absent from the undiluted
plasma.
  This conclusion        is,
                        moreover, supported by the following experi
ments: — To    aportion of the undiluted plasma above mentioned a
small quantity of fibrin ferment was added, in the form of the dried
precipitate thrown down by alcohol, i.e.,      mixture of coagulated
                                                    a
proteids and ferment.          Coagulation   took place.   I   have no record   of

 the exact time elapsing between the addition of ferment and the
appearance of the clot, but it was certainly not longer than three or
 four hours.
    II. Of  the so-called peptone-plasma (i.e., plasma of the blood of a
dog after the injection of peptone into the veins, such blood, as is
 well known, coagulating with great difficulty), freed from all cellular
 elements by the    centrifngal machine, two portions were taken.
    To the one (A) a quantity of lecithin was added, the lecithin being
 rubbed up with the plasma so as to be diffused through it ; the other
 (B) was left untouched.
    Through both a stream of carbonic acid was passed, with the result
that while A clotted in about ten minutes, B after the lapse of half
an hour showed no disposition whatever to coagulate.                  Both portions
 were then treated with excess of alcohol for the extraction of fibrin
ferment in the usual way.         The aqueous extract of A proved to be
exceedingly     rich  in   ferment,  producing coagulation in magnesium
sulphate plasma in about ten minutes.                   The similarly prepared
aqueoDS solution of B produced no coagulation at all.
    Now I have elsewhere,* in discussing the action of lecithin in pro
moting coagulation, shown that the coagulation which is brought
about by the addition of lecithin is not due to the lecithin or to any
of its prodncts of decomposition acting after the manner of a ferment,
or to its carrying a fibrin ferment with it. In this case, therefore, as
in the previous case of " salted " plasma, the ferment appears to be
absent before coagulation, but to be present after coagulation.
    I may here call attention to an observation made by Rauschenbach.t
This observer found that the addition of yeast to plasma, prevented
from coagulating by exposure to cold, brought about coagulation, and
at the same time gave rise to the appearance of a large quantity of
fibrin   ferment.     Nevertheless, he completely          failed   to extract any
fibrin ferment from the yeast itself.              Now    yeast    is  very rich in
lecithin, and it seems highly probable that the           coagulation caused by
yeast was due to the lecithin contained in it,            and hence the appear
 ance  of the fibrin ferment after the addition of yeast, and consequent
coagulation, is quite parallel to the result of the experiment with
lecithin and peptone-plasma recorded above.                    In both cases the
ferment appears to have arisen out of the plasma itself.
    It is possible to obtain a coagulation in peptone-plasma without
the addition of lecithin.      For this purpose large dilution is necessary,
followed by the passage of a stream of carbonic acid gas. But in Ruch
a case, however, coagulation is not only long in making its appearance,
but the fibrin is formed, so to speak, in successive crops. Thus a feeble
coagulation first appears, and if the clot so formed be removed, a

 succeeding coagulation is observed some time later, to be followed in
  turn by a third, and so on. When lecithin, on the other hand, is-
 added, without previous dilution, the clotting is speedy and complete.
     If the serum thus resulting from the coagulation of peptone-plasma
 brought about by large dilution and treatment with carbonic acid, be
 examined for fibrin ferment in the usual way, it will be found to con
 tain ferment, though much less than could be obtained from a corre
 sponding quantity of the same plasma coagulated rapidly by the addition
 of lecithin. The relative amount of ferment appearing under different
 circumstances is illustrated by the following experiment : —
     Of three equal portions of the same peptone-plasma, one portion
 was simply treated with a stream of carbonic acid gas, without any
 dilution, and did not coagulate ; a second was treated with a stream
 of the same gas after large dilution, and coagulated slowly ; to a third
 lecithin was added, and a stream of carbonic acid passed through it,
 with the result of producing a rapid and complete coagulation.
     All three portions were treated in the same way for the extraction
of the fibrin ferment, and the activity of the three aqueous extracts
then prepared was tested under exactly the same conditions, with
the help of magnesium sulphate plasma.
     The first produced no coagulation after the lapse of twenty hours.
    The second produced coagulation in four hours.
     The third produced coagulation in five minutes.
     The amount of ferment seems to be in proportion to the energy of
coagulation and the presence of ferment after simple dilution, and the
action of carbonic acid gas shows that the ferment appearing after
coagulation by the help of lecithin does not come from the lecithin
itself.
    Thus there is a remarkable coincidence between the occurrence of
coagulation itself and the appearance of the fibrin ferment, and that
in plasma freed most carefully from all cellular elements.
    I believe, therefore, that I am justified in concluding that though
fibrin ferment does not pre-exist in normal plasma, it may make its
appearance in that plasma in the absence of all cellular elements,
and must therefore come from some constituent or constituents of the
plasma itself.
    I am still engaged in investigations directed to find out what that
constituent is, or what those constituents are.

   This paper includes an introduction recording the methods which
have been proposed by different authors for the quantitative estima
tion of various metallic elements. An account is then given of the
length and strength of metallic lines in solutions of definite strength.
Under given conditions each solution emits a characteristic spectrum.
In the case of magnesium, a minute description is given of the
spectra presented by various solutions containing from 1 per cent. to
O-OOOOOOOl per cent. of the metal, but in the case of other elements
tabular descriptions of the spectra of solutions containing 1, 0*1, and
O-Ol, in some instances 0-001, of metal are given together with care
fully drawn maps. The substances thus treated of are magnesium,
zinc, cadmium, aluminium, indium, thallium, copper, silver, mercury,

of fact, one part of magnesium was detected in 10,000,000,000 parts of
water, the lines seen under these circumstances being those with
wave-lengths 2801-6 and 2794-1.             The spectrum reaction of arsenic
is the weakest, those of antimony and tellurium are also weak,
while that of bismuth is not strong.           In fact it is noticeable that the
more strongly basic elements are those with the most persistent
lines.
    Evidence is afforded in the case of the aluminium spectrum that it
is not invariably the longest or strongest line which is the most
persistent.      The line with wave-length 3584-4 is both longer and
stronger than a pair of lines adjacent thereto with wave-lengths
3612-4 and        3601'1, but whereas      the  first is not seen in solutions
containing 0'1 per cent. of aluminium, the pair are still visible in
solutions containing 0-01 per cent. Under certain conditions this
single line appears the longest in the whole spectrum, whereas other
 wise, and under most circumstances, the lines with wave-lengths
3960-9 and 3943 4 are longest.
    As   a rule, even the longest lines are shortened       by great dilution of
 the solutions,   but there is a pair of lines in the spectrum of copper with
 wave-lengths 3273-2 and 3246-9 which become greatly attenuated, yet
 nevertheless remain long lines till they finally disappear.
    It is shown by one or two examples how the tables of spectra and
 accompanying        maps may be employed in rendering quantitative
 results.    The special applications of this method it is proposed to
 describe in a further communication.

        No. II. Antisana." By Professor T. G. Bonney, D.Sc.,
        F.R.S. Received February 29, 1884.
    Antisana is a much loftier and grander mountain than Pichincha,
for its summit rises to an elevation of about 19,000 feet above the sea,*
and the upper part of the mountain (some 4,000 feet) is covered with
snow and glaciers.        The crevasses on the latter are described by Mr.
 Whymper as being of an enormous size, probably the largest he had
ever seen, and on his first attempt to ascend the peak he was pre
vented from reaching the summit by chasms and cliffs of ice, among
which his party, in consequence of the mists, had become entangl-d.
A second attempt proved successful, but the snowy summit of
Antisana is evidently not one likely to be reached by uupractised
mountaineers.
   The mountain is situated slightly to the south of the equator, to th-
east-south-east of the city of Quito, and nearly due east of the town
                   " The extent of ground covered

ing to Mr. Whymper, is, perhaps, as great as that covered by any of
the Ecuadorian Andes, and more than is occupied by most of them.
From north to south it extends over more than 20 miles of country,
and not much, if at all, less from east to west.               From most point-
of view at a distance, the mountain in form appears more like a ridg-
than a single summit.          A close approach on the western side shows
that this appearance is somewhat misleading, and that Antisana has
two principal summits, the larger and higher being an immense suowy
flat-topped boss, and the second (not less than 1,500 feet lower than
the other) a sharp peak, which is probably at all times completely
inaccessible."
    The lowest point to which the glaciers extend on the western side
is 15,294 feet ; on the northern and southern they descend to about
the same level ; but Mr. Whymper is not able to say how far they
come down on the eastern side.             " In that direction the most notable
feature of the mountain is a very extensive shoulder running out
 from near the summit, at a height of about 17,000 feet above the s-a,
 in an east-north-east direction.          It is singularly level and unbrok-n
 in outline, and is entirely obscured by a suow-covered glacier, sugg-st
 ing by its form that there is an old flow of lava concealed beneath.

  level area which forms the summit is about equal to that of the lip
 of the crater of Cotopaxi.        It is also certain that there is no open
 crater on any part of the western slopes of the mountain."            Of the
 remainder Mr. Whymper says :          " I speak with less confidence of the
 northern and southern sides, as         I  have not seen completely round
 them, and of the eastern side I can only speak of the parts not more
 than 1,000 feet below the summit.           Upon my first and unsuccessful
 attempt to ascend the mountain we were stopped for a considerable
 time (by the difficulties encountered) at a height of somewhat more
 than 17,000 feet above the sea, and, whilst waiting, we noticed several
 puffs  of strongly sulphurous vapour. We did not, however, observe
 either upon the summit, or when viewing it from a distance, anything
 of the nature of an eruption, or learn from the persons living in the
vicinity of the mountain that any eruption had occurred to their
knowledge."
    Mr. Whymper's collection from Antisana consists, as in the case of
Pichincha, of a series of ten specimens obtained in Quito, and
fourteen collected by himself.        Four of the latter shall be described
first, as they come from the lower part of the mountain, from a spot
called   Antisanilla, which however is 12,340 feet above the sea. Here
a hacienda abuts against a great lava stream which has descended from
the mountain, and is the one most familiar to the natives of the dis
trict. Mr. Whymper remarks that it was the only large stream of lava
which he observed on the western side of the mountain running on
                       " Its full extent 1 do not know,
towards the west :                                       owing to mist. We
coasted its southern side for 5 or 6 miles on the way to the Hacienda
of Antisana (13,300 feet), and the small Hacienda of Antisanilla, an
appendage of the large establishment, is built by the side of the lava
stream, which was by various persons several times termed in my
hearing the lava of Antisanilla.            The surface of the stream was
extremely rugged and well-nigh inaccessible."
    Prom this lava Mr. Whymper collected specimens : the one selected
for microscopic examination is a black sub-vitreous rock, containing
small crystals of white felspar, whose diameter is commonly not more
than 0-l25 inch.      The general aspect of the specimen shows it to be
one of the darker varieties of andesite, a member of the group of rocks
that have been variously named melaphyre, pitchstone-porphyrite,          &c.
    The crystals belonging    to  the  earlier stages of consolidation which
are included    in the slide are rather small, no one of the felspars ex
ceeding O-T   inch, and only one or two approaching this size. They are
plagioclastic, but as the majority have broken away in grinding the
slide, one cannot venture to give a more definite name.          The crystals
of pyroxenic minerals are yet smaller ; most of the latter occurring
either in small scattered crystals about 0"006 inch long, of rather

elongated form or in small grannies.            Owing to the smalluess and
rather indefinite character of the pyroxenic constituents it is difficult
to speak very positively about them ; augite, however, is certainly
present, and possibly hypersthene.          Minute crystals and grains of an
iron oxide, probably magnetite, as we might expect from the colour of
the rock, are rather abundant.          The ground-mass appears to consist
of a clear glass, faintly tinged with brown, and densely crowded with
microliths.     These are lath-like crystallites of felspar, generally not
exceeding 0-005 inch long, not seldom composed of two or three
individuals, and belonites, of a very faint green tinge, not exceeding
about O-OOl inch by 0"0002 inch, probably hornblende.         The evidence as
to the felspar is conflicting     ; probably both oligoclase  and labradorite
are present,    but  my observations tend to the conclusion that the latter
is the more abundant species.            The rock on the whole agrees best
with augite-andesite.         Its specific gravity, determined     for me  by
Mr. J. J. H. Teall, is     2 656.
    A second specimen from the same locality resembles the former in
structure, but is of a dull india-red colour.          It is so evidently the
same rock, differently coloured by conversion of the black oxide of
iron into the red oxide, that I have deemed it needless to examine its
microscopic structure.         The two other specimens are simply scori-
aceous varieties of the latter rock.
    It is difficult to fix the precise localities of most of the specimens
obtained by Mr. Whymper from the collector at Quito, as the places
mentioned on the labels are not known to the former, and in most
 cases, he thinks, are of no more general acceptation than the names
attached by Alpine herdsmen to the crags and pinnacles in the
vicinity of their chalets. All, he believes, are from the south-western
 or western side of the mountain and from localities whose height
above the sea is not likely to exceed about 13,000 feet.       Three are pro
 bably derived from some one subsidiary crater on the south-western
 flank of Antisana, named Guagra-ialina, though there is a slight
 variation in the spelling.         The first of these is labelled Corriente
de lava de Guagrahialina volcan, Lado S.O.O. Antisana. It is a dark
 grey rock, of scoriaceous aspect, with many small vesicles, usually less
 than 0-l inch in diameter, and several specks of whitish felspar.          It
 resembles some of the dark grey lavas of Auvergne, and, like them, is
 no doubt an augite-andesite.         As the specimen presents no features
 of special interest,   I have not examined it with the microscope.       The
 next is simply labelled Antisana, Guagrayalina volcan. It is a com
 pact dull grey rock, with a slight purplish tinge, containing occa
sional crystals of glassy felspar, sometimes rather more than O'l inch
 in length. The3e, on examination with the microscope, prove to be
 a plagioclastic felspar, but there is so much variation in the extinc
 tion angles that it is impossible to decide upon the species. They con

 tain, in variable amount, cavities       with bubbles, brown glass enclosures,
 and other microliths, some being elongated prisms which may be apa
 tite; but probably more than one mineral is present.                  There are also
 some small fairly well-defined         crystals   of  augite,   but I have not suc
 ceeded in identifying any hypersthene.               A remnant of a glassy base
 appears  to  be present   in the  ground-mass,       but it is so crowded with fel
 spar microliths, and with granules of iron peroxide and of augite, as
 to be with difficulty distinguished.          The felspar microliths are lath-
 shaped ; they   are a plagioclase    ; but, as  in the case of the larger crystals,
 it is probable that more than one species is represented. The rock is
an angite-andesite, and its general aspect reminds me of some of the
porphyrites of the Cheviots (e.g., a hypersthene-andesite from Coquet,
 near Windy Haugh).            The third specimen, labelled Ouagra-ialina
vohan,    I ado   S.O.  del   Antisana, is a rather duller coloured, less
markedly porphyritic rock than the last, having some minute vesicles.
The microscopic structure does not differ materially from that of the
last described.- Possibly a little hypersthene is present, but this is
not conspicuous ; thus the rock is an augite-andesite,                  and all these
specimens may have come from different parts of the same flow or
from a closely related series of flows.
  . From Quebrada de TJrcucuy come two specimens of pitchstone.                  One,
labelled entre Tablarumi y Urcucuiloma, is a dark greenish-grey rock,
traversed by numerous cracks ; its fracture is very irregular, and it ex
hibits the resinous      lustre characteristic      of pitchstone.      A few minute
scattered    crystals   or grains of a glassy felspar are visible, and there
is a very faint indication of a fluidal structure.                   When examined
microscopically, the rock exhibits as a base a clear and colourless
glass.    In this are scattered a large number of microlithic enclosures
together with some scattered crystals of larger size.                     The general
parallelism of the longer diameters of both of these, and the occa
sional filamentous       streaks    of an aggregated          grey dust render the
fluidal structure more conspicuous microscopically than macroscopi-
cally.     The great majority of these microliths are little prisms or
colnmns,      usually about O-OOl inch long, and commonly about one-
sixth of this in breadth. They are almost colourless, but appear to
have    a   slightly   green    tinge.     I  think it probable that, like the
belonites     in the Arran pitchstones,            to which they present some
resemblance, they are hornblende.                 Besides    these, we find opacite,
with occasionally a fleck of brown mica or felspar crystals of small
size.    The "dusty" bands are found to resolve themselves, when
viewed    with a quarter-inch objective, into streams of microliths, like
to, but perhaps      slightly smaller in size than, those described above.
Among the larger crystals are felspar : of this mineral orthoclase
and a plagioclase are present.           Some of the crystals are rather broken
or rounded in outline, but others have well-defined external angles ; the

latter are generally smaller and clearer, containing a few belonites,
and but little else.        The former are often " dirty," containing glass
enclosures, cavities, and various microliths, as if belonging to an
earlier stage of consolidation.          Besides these are several crystals of
brown mica and a few of hornblende, well defined, together with
scattered grains of magnetite.            The cracks are marked by a pale
green staining,      and   there are no  indications  of a perlitic structure.
    The other       specimen of pitchstone labelled entre Tablarumi y
Chacana      is of nearly the same colour as the last described, but
contains many rounded whitish spots, roughly about                      to  |  inch
diameter, which are seen on examination to be spherulites ; a portion
of the specimen is vesicular.         The description given of the base of the
last specimen will serve for this, except that there is little indication
of a fluidal structure.        There are a few scattered crystals of felspar,
brown mica, and hornblende.             The spherulites are rather peculiar,
they have a rather irregular bluntly lobed outline, are nearly opaque,
but exhibit a faintly fibrous structure, something like that of groups
of blunt-pointed camel's hair brushes.            So far as can be ascertained,
they    consist    of  a   brown   glass   traversed   by belonites of a paler
mineral, and trichites of a darker one, but it is very difficult to
determine their exact structure.              They generally enclose a small
crystal of hornblende or felspar, in one case both are present, but not
centrically disposed. Without chemical analysis one cannot decide
whether these two rocks are glassy forms of the rhyolites or of
the dacites, but         I  should be disposed to class them with the
latter*
    A third specimen from Quebrada de Urcucuy, labelled in addition
Entre Tablarumi y Urcucuy, is a crumbling pale cream-coloured rock,
which, on closer examination, gives indications of having been glassy
and of a somewhat perlitic structure.              This is confirmed by micro
scopic examination, though the nature of the rock has prevented the
preparation of a good slide.           It is evidently a decomposed perlitic
pitchstone, and very probably when in a fresh condition waa nearly
related to the two others from this neighbourhood.t
    From the south western side is a specimen labelled Quebrada azufre
grande, S.O. Reiss and Stiibel, as Mr. Whymper informs me,
mention a " Quebrada azufre grande," giving a measurement Parte
inferior de la Loma al lado derecto de la Quebrada, 8fc, 4,040 metres

altitude is a little lower than the Hacienda of Antisana* (13,300 feet),
and so, if the indication of direction be correctly given, cannot be so
near as it to the summit.
    The specimen is a rather compact cream-coloured rock, at first
sight not unlike one of the South Tyrol dolomites, but slightly
vesicular in places, and spotted here and there with pale yellow
sulphur. It is evidently a volcanic rock from the vicinity of
fumaroles which deposit sulphur, and presents the usual aspect of a
trachyte which has been thus treated.               From the appearance of the
rock, and a certain resemblance to one of those described, from
Quebrada de Urcucuy, I should think it probable it had once been a
pitchstone.
    A specimen is labelled Del Nevado Pic 0, principio del Areiial ; the
"snowy peak" and the "sandy plain" of Antisana are localities un
known to Mr. Whymper. The rock is subvitreous, dark in colour with
slightly redder streaks, and numerous scattered crystals of white
felspar, commonly not more than about O-l inch long, but now and
then twice or thrice as large. In the earliest stage of consolidation
are (1) plagioclase felspar (probably in part at least labradorite), some
times irregular in external form, often crowded with glass cavities,
having fixed brownish bubbles, with microliths of augite (?), aud with
opacite   ; (2) augite ; (3) very characteristic crystals of hypersthene ;
 (4) grannies of iron oxide and a few scales of iron glance. The rock
has a glassy base, but this is crowded with lath-shaped felspar
 microliths (plagioclase), and in most parts is rendered almost opaque
 by dusty opacite and ferrite, the redder streaks being the more
 transparent     parts, in which a glass, now clear, now brown, may be
distinguished. The rock is a hyperstheniferous augite-andesite.
    The locality of the next specimen, labelled Cuspide del AchupaUas
 Lado 0. del Antisana, is also unknown to Mr. Whymper.                   The rock has
a deader lustre, and more scoriaceous aspect than the last described,
 and contains greater crystals of whitish felspar, their diameter being
 sometimes fully 0-3 inch. Under the microscope the larger of these
are seen to contain glass enclosures and other microliths, and are
 probably labradorite ; the smaller, which are more lath-shaped, agree
 better in their extinctions with oligoclase.             There is a fair amount
 of well characterised brown mica and of hornblende, both brown and
 pale green varieties, with some granules of the latter or possibly of
augite, and some grains of iron oxide. There is a clear glassy base,

 western side of Antisana is almost entirely covered by glacier. The nearest to

but it is crowded with microliths of felspar, of a pyroxenic mineral,
of brown mica, ferrite, &o. The rock is thus a mica-hornblende-
andesite.     The last specimen is labelled Ciispide del chusa longo.   It is
a dark grey vesicular rock, the proportion of solid to cavity being
about two to one.      The cavities commonly are not more than 0-2 inch
in longest diameter, irregular in form, slightly drawn out in one
direction, and coated with brown iron oxide.         The rock is compact in
structure, with a general resemblance to the matrix of the last
described, but contains only very minute crystals of whitish felspar,
rather irregular in form, and hardly more than 0"05 inch in diameter.
It  is no doubt an andesite, and is not unlike some of the scoriaceous
varieties of that rock which are obtained from the Auvergne volcanoes.
I have not thought it necessary to examine it with the microscope.
   The remaining ten specimens brought back by Mr. Whymper are
all representative of the highest part of Antisana. They were col
lected from the upper part of a moraine, by the side of which he
encamped for the night, at an elevation of about 16,000 feet above the
sea, or 3,300 below the actual summit.        The materials of this moraine
are derived   from  several rather  small crags of rock which here and there
crop out from the suowy slopes above.        None of them were touched    by
Mr. Whymper during his ascent on the following day, for they are not
numerous and are generally in inaccessible positions.         He was careful
to bring a specimen of every marked variety which caught his eye, so
that the series is probably a fair representation of the rocks which
constitute the Peak of Antisana.
    Of these specimens (1) and (2) are vesicular rocks of a dull reddish
colour, no doubt scoriaceous forms of a rock closely allied in composi
tion to (4) and other dark varieties described below. (3) is a tnff,
consisting of a fine yellowish paste, in which are numerous fragments
up to the size of a small nut of a slightly vesicular, subvitreons,
blackish rock, evidently closely allied to the next mentioned.       (4) is a
blackish    subvitreous  rock,  containing glassy-looking felspar crystals
up to about 0-2 inch diameter.          A  few minute vesicles are present.
The microscopic description is given below. (5.) A very similar rock,
a little lighter in colour, also described more fully below.    (6.) Closely
allied to the last, but paler, probably a little more decomposed. (7.) A
dark compact rock, with some small crystals of felspar ; very like the
specimen from Antisanilla.         (8.) A compact blackish rock, mottled
with small spots of dull gray, in the inner part of which a small
vesicle may be seen ; a very few crystals of felspar, not exceeding
0-l inch diameter, are visible ; its microscopic structure is describ-d
below.      (9.) A rather vitreous, slightly vesicular, rock, a fluidal
structure being indicated by reddish and blackish layers, containing
crystals of a whitish felspar, rarely exceeding 0-1 inch in diameter.
The microscopic structure is described below. (10.) A large fragment

in close alliance with (1) and (2).
   The following is a description of the microscopic structure of
No. (4) . In the earlier stage of consolidation are (a) felspar crystals,
probably in great part labradorite.          The enclosures are frequently
variable in nature, quantity, and arrangement.          Sometimes their dis
position  is zonal  and   external, sometimes   it is central.    Among these
enclosures are pale green belonites (? hornblende), colourless belonites,
pieces of brown glass, often abundant, containing gas cavities and
crystallites of magnetite, cavities containing bubbles, which occupy
one-sixth or one-seventh of the whole space.            The exteriors of the
crystals  are  frequently broken-looking     or corroded.      (b) A pyroxenic
constituent, of which some is certainly augite, but a part (the smaller)
probably hypersthene.        The former rather frequently contains enclo
sures ; among them are magnetite and grains of a slightly irregular
oval outline, sometimes nearly 0-003 inch diameter, occasionally asso
ciated  with gas cavities (? felspar).       (c) Grains of iron oxide, pro
bably magnetite.      The part of later consolidation is a pale brownish
glass, speckled with opacite and crowded with acicular microliths, six
or seven times as long as broad,    which generally do not exceed O-OOl inch
long.    These are colourless and probably to a large extent felspar.
No. (5) differs from the last rock but little in its microscopic structure;
it has a rather clearer ground-mass and perhaps not quite so many
granules of black iron oxide.       The crystals of felspar are similar, but
there is also a large number of well-formed lath-shaped crystals,
measuring in longer diameter above O01 inch.                Two varieties of
augite,  a greenish   and   a brownish,  are  present, together with a little
of the greenish mineral which, as it has an orthorhombic extinction,         I
refer to hypersthene.      Microscopic examination of (8) shows it to be
not materially different from (4), except for the presence of the more
decomposed spots, mentioned above.             The glassy base is perhaps
a shade    more   colourless.   Both  augite  and   hypersthene are present.
No. (9.) In the first stage of consolidation we have rather numerous
felspar crystals, with the usual variablo enclosures — glass cavities
 with fixed bubbles, microliths, nearly all of which exhibit the charac
teristic twinning of plagioclase, though one or two show Carlsbad
twinning and may be orthoclase.          The former usually extinguish at
moderately large angles, ranging from , rather less than 10° to more
than 20° with the twin-plane. In one, where the twinning is sharply
defined, the extinctions are 21° and 30° respectively on either side of
the twin-plane. It is therefore probable that these crystals are neither
ulbite nor oligoclase.     The pyroxenic constituent appears, as above, to
 be of more than one kind.        The most abundant is a brownish, rather
dichroic mineral, black bordered, and sometimes rather " dirty,"
owing to inclusions.       In colour and general aspect it more resembles

434                Prof. F. Elgar.       On the Variation  of      [Mar. 13,
hornblende, but the angles of cleavage (which, however, is in no case
very well defined) and of extinction make it more probable that the
mineral     is angite.     There are two or three crystals of a slightly
greenish colour, which show the characteristic form and cleavage of
augite, and one which in all respects bettor agrees with hypersthene.
The ground-mass consists of fairly numerous, lath-shaped crystallites
of  a plagioclastic    felspar, prisms of augite (?), often darkened with
ferrite, granules of opacite and ferrite, and possibly in some cases flakes
of mica. These are scattered in what may be a glassy base, but it
is so densely crowded with extremely minute acicular crystallites
(colourless, probably felspar), and with a minute dust (ferrite in the
browner streaks, opacite in the darker) that, as the slide is rather
thicker than usual,      I cannot be quite sure. Although, to the unaided
eye,  and   even when      examined with low powers, this rock appears to
differ considerably from (5) and (8), yet with high powers the resem
blance becomes much closer, so that we may,        I think, confidently refer
it to the same group, and regard it as merely a more slaggy variety.
   It  follows, then, from the above examination that the rocks which
form the actual peak of Antisana are augite-andesites, containing
at any rate occasionally hypersthene, and to the same group belongs,
though perhaps it is slightly more basic, the rock of the great lava
stream which has descended to Antisanilla, while the pitchstones of
Quebrada de Urcucuy must be representatives of a group with a higher
percentage of silica, i.e., rhyolites or dacites, probably the former.

       Ships." By F. Elgar, Professor of Naval Architecture in
      the University of Glasgow.          Communicated by Professor       Sir
       William Thomson, F.R.S.             Received March 6, 1884.
                                    (Abstract.)
   Of all the properties possessed by a ship none is more vital to her
safety and efficiency than that of stability. At the same time none is
dependent for its existence and amount upon so many or such diverse
and variable circumstances as it. The stability of a ship, both as
regards moment and range, is affected not only by the position of her
centre of gravity, which largely depends upon stowage, but also by
draught of water. If the centre of gravity be kept fixed in position
at various draughts of water, the stability will still vary very consider
ably with the draught, and often in a manner that contains elements
of danger.
   The usual practice in investigating a ship's stability is to calcalate a
curve of metacentres, and one or more curves of stability at certain

  The curve of metacentres          gives the height at all draughts of watir
 above which the centre of gravity cannot be raised without making
 the ship unstable when upright, and causing her to- lie over more or
  less to one side.     The ordinates of the curve of stability represent the
  lengths of the righting arms, which, multiplied by the weight of the
 ship, give the righting moments at all angles of inclination from the
 upright. The stability of numerous vessels, both of the Royal Navy
 and Mercantile Marine, have been investigated in this manner for
 certain draughts of water, and a great amount of information obtained
 respecting the variation of stability with inclination at such draughts,
 and the angle at which the stability vanishes in many classes of ships.
 The peculiar dangers attaching              to low freeboard, especially when
 associated with a high centre of gravity, have been fully discussed and
 made known.
     Curves of stability having been chiefly constructed for deep and"
 moderate draughts, the character of the stability which is often to be
 found associated with very light draught, appears to have hitherto
 escaped attention.          As a matter of fact, light draught is often as
 unfavourable to stability as low freeboard, and in some cases more so.
 The general opinions that have till recently prevailed upon the subject
 appear to have been based upon a vague impression                that so long as a
 vessel has a high side out of water,           and  any metacentric height, she
 will have great righting moments at large angles of inclination and a
                                                          "           "
 large range of stability. It was shown at the              Daphne       inquiry, held
 by   Sir E.     J. Reed,. in  July  last, that these opinions    largely prevailed
 and were erroneous.
     It fell to my lot to make some investigations respecting the stability
                           "           " at the time of the
 possessed      by the       Daphne                                 disaster which
happened to her,       and    to give  evidence   respecting   the  same.     I after
wards pointed out, by way of explanation of my evidence, in a letter
to the    " Times" of the 1st September last, some of the considerations
which obviously apply to light draught stability. The first, which so far
as I am aware had never before been stated, is that any homogeneous
floating body which is symmetrical about the three principal axes as
the centre of gravity — such as a rectangular prism or an ellipsoid —
will have the same moment of stability at equal angles of inclination,
whether floating at a light draught with a small volume below water,
or at a deep draught with a similar volume above water.                           For
instance,     if  a homogeneous prism of symmetrical cross-section 5 feet
high float at a draught of water of 1 foot, it will then have precisely
the same moment of stability at equal angles of inclination, and
consequently the same curve of stability throughout, as if it were
loaded — without altering the position of the centre of gravity — till it
had 4 feet draught of water, and 1 foot of freeboard.                   From this it

follows that, in such elementary forms of floating bodies, lightness of
draught has the same effect upon stability as lowness of freeboard ;
and if a low freeboard is unfavourable to stability, so also, and
precisely to the same extent, is a correspondingly light draught of
water.     This proposition can be made still more general, as it applies
to homogeneous bodies of any form of cross-section which revolve
about an horizontal axis fixed only in direction.           From this may be
deduced the results given by Atwood in his papers read before the
Royal Society in 1796 and 1798 respecting the positions of equilibrium
and other peculiarities connected with the stability of floating bodies.
    In considering the stability of a ship at various draughts of water,
and comparing it with that of the class of figures above described,
 modifications require to be made for the departure from symmetry of
 form, and for the extent to which the vertical position of the centre
of gravity differs from what it would be if the external surface
enclosed a homogeneous volume.              This has been attempted in the
present paper, and curves of stability, which        I call cross curves, have
been given for various geometrical forms of floating bodies, and also
for a large passenger steamer of ordinary type, showing how the
stability varies with draught of water at constant angles of inclina
tion.    In dealing with these cross curves of stability the curves of
righting moments require to be constructed, and not merely curves of
lengths of righting arm.          The ordinary curve of stability is usually
made for lengths of righting arm, because the displacement is con
stant, and the same curve therefore gives upon different scales, either
lengths of righting arm or righting moments.            In the cross curves of
 stability,  however,   such   as  are  now  being  dealt  with, draught, and
therefore displacement, is one of the variable quantities, and curves
 of righting moments are of a very different character from curves of
 righting arm. The curves given in the figures are therefore, in all
cases, curves of righting moments.         Complete cross curves for a ship,
 from which ordinary carves of stability can immediately be obtained
 for any draught of water and position of centre of gravity, can be
 constructed in a few days with the aid of Amsler's mechanical
 integrator.
    The main object of this paper is to show the necessity of regarding
 the stability of a ship from the point of view of variation of righting
 moment with draught of water, the angle of inclination being
 constant, instead of from that of variation of righting moment with
 angle of inclination,   the draught being constant, as is usually done; or
 rather of considering     the subject from both points of view instead of
 almost exclusively    from   the latter.   It also shows that it is necessary
 to investigate more fully than has formerly hem done, the moments
 and range of stability of ships and other structures that may be
 intended to float at very light draughts of water.

               I. On the Functions of the Marginal Convolution.
                       (Preliminary communication.)
     The present communication is intended to be the first of a series
 giving the results of an experimental investigation which we are at
 present engaged upon, into the physiology of the cerebral cortex and
 its connexion with other portions of the nervous system.     We propose
 in this way briefly to publish any general results which appear to
 us to be well enough substantiated, as they are obtained ; reserving
 most of the details of the experiments for a more complete memoir
 in which the varions facts which may have been accumulated can be
 collated,  and compared with the results obtained by other experi
 menters.
    In the present research we have closely followed the methods
 employed by Ferrier.     The animals used have been monkeys, most, if
 not all, some species  of Macacque.    In some the portion of the brain
 under investigation has been stimulated by the interrupted (induced)
 current, and the resulting movements recorded ; in others (two in
 number) the cortex has been removed over the region in question, the
removal being effected by the aid of the galvanic cautery and under
antiseptic precautions, and the resulting pareses of voluntary move
ment observed.      It was found disadvantageous to attempt both these
observations upon the same individual, partly on account of the
relative prolongation of the operation and the consequent danger of
losing the animal from the resulting shock, partly because the carbolic
spray which is used when it is intended to preserve the animal,
appears    temporarily to depress the functions of the portions of the
cortex    which are exposed to its influence, and either no reaction is
obtained on stimulating them or a stimulus must be employed so

strong as to involve the risk of its spreading to neighbouring parts-
The anaesthetic used has generally been ether, sometimes mixed with
chloroform ; in one case in which morphia had been employed the
results of stimulation were much interfered with by the drug.          The
induction   coil used is of the du Bois-Reymond pattern, with the Neef
interrupter; and the Helmholtz side- wire is always introduced for the
purpose of equalising the effects of the make and break shocks.        The
electrode wires are carefully guarded except at their points, which
project slightly on one side, and the electrodes are so constructed as
to pass between the falx and the mesial surface of the brain with as
little disturbance as possible.
    We have for the most part throughout all our experiments taken
care only to employ an excitation just sufficient to call forth the
activity of the part of the brain immediately under the electrodes.
The best physiological test of the strength of the interrupted current
consists in placing the electrodes on the tongue, and many of our
results have been got with a stimulus which is only jugt perceptible
when tested in that manner. Results so obtained are of the greatest
value for the purpose of localising the function of a part, because
under these circumstances there can be no question that the current
does not spread beyond a very small area ; and with such a minimal
stimulus applied for but a short time it is not unfrequently found that
but a single muscle, or at most two or three, generally in succession, are
called into action.    But for thus exactly localising centres for indivi
dual muscles a much larger number of experiments will be necessary
than we have up to the present been able to make ; we will, therefore,
reserve for a future communication, in which we hope to deal more
fully with this question, the few positive results of this kind that we
have obtained, and here only consider     the more general movements
called forth by excitation of particular parts of the convolution.
    We have in this way explored the mesial surface of the hemisphere,
or rather the marginal convolution of that surface, for it soon appeared
evident that on other parts of the mesial surface positive results were
not to be expected from electrical excitation.      We have ascertained
that the excitation of definite localised portions of this convolution
gives rise to the contraction of perfectly definite groups of muscles,
or in some cases of single muscles, producing more or less co-ordinated
movements of the trunk and limbs, in the same manner as has been
shown by Ferrier and others to be the case with excitation of localised
portions of the external surface of the hemisphere.
    We can best explain the extent of the excitable portion of the mar
ginal gyrus by reference to certain easily recognisable furrows on the
external surface of the hemisphere.      One of the most conspicuous of
these is the furrow of Rolando, which', as in man, terminates superiorlv
near the margin of the hemisphere, a little in front of the posterior

  1884.]      Experimental Researches in Cerebral Physiology.           439
 up-turned end of the calloso-marginal sulcus on the mesial surface.
 Behind the furrow of Rolando and opposite this end of the calloso-
 marginal furrow there is a small, but constant, obliquely-placed
 depression (fig.         which serves to mark the separation between the
 ascending parietal gyrus and the parietal lobule.         In front of the
 furrow of Rolando, and separated from it by the upper end of the
 ascending frontal gyrus, is another small depression (a>), also extremely
 constant in occurrence, although varying considerably in develop
 ment,    having a direction parallel to the margin of the hemisphere,
 from which it is a few millimetres removed.         Still further forward,
 and at a much greater distance from the margin, is the well-marked
 transverse frontal furrow, the antero-posterior limb of which (tr.fr) is
 shown in the figure.       And in front of this again is another small and
 apparently unimportant depression (fig. 1, y), but very constant in the
 Macacques, which has a transverse direction, i.e., perpendicular to the
 hemisphere-margin, and which, in some instances, comes nearly up to
 the margin, conducting a considerable vein towards the longitudinal
 sinus.    The excitable portion of the marginal convolution extends
 from about opposite this small transverse sulcus (F) backwards along
 the whole length of the convolution.         In front of the level of the
 sulcus y no movements are, as a rule, obtained as the result of electri
 cal excitation.
    A   remarkable     relation was found on the whole to hold good
 between     different parts of this convolution and the parts of the
 body thrown into movement by their excitation, to the effect, namely,
that when the stimulus was applied anteriorly the resulting move
 ments affected the upper limbs (and in one or two instances muscles
of the head and neck) ; when applied near the middle of the excitable
part of the convolution, the muscles chiefly or primarily affected were
those of the trunk (erector spinae, abdominal muscles, &c), whilst,
when    applied posteriorly, muscles of the lower limb alone were called
into action.      Indeed, it appears probable that, if we regard only the
results of minimal excitations, and especially if we take into account
only those muscles which are primarily called into action, this rule will
prove to obtain in a still more special manner, and that we may arrange
the movements which are produced by stimulation of points which
succeed one another from before back in the following order, viz. :
1. Movements of the forearm. 2. Movements of the humerus and scapula.
3. Movements, chiefly rotation and flexion, of the upper part of the
trunk.     4. Movements of the lower part of the trunk and abdomen.
5. Movements        of the pelvis. 6. Movements at the hip. 7. Move
ments at the knee. 8. Movements at the ankle-joint.          9. Movements
of the toes.
    The general results of our experiments will best be understood by a
reference to the accompanying figure (fig. 1). Thus, in the part of

     440              Messrs. V. Horsley and E. A. Sclmfer.          [Mar.  20.
     the marginal convolution marked I, I', extending from just in front of
     the small vertical sulcus y to a point on a level with the auterior third
     of the small an tero- posterior sulcus x, excitation is followed by either
     movements of the forearm (flexion or extension) or by adduction of
     the arm and retraction of the shoulder combined with outward rota
     tion, or by any of these movements of shoulder and arm either com
     bined or succeeding one another in definite order, according to tlie
     point in the area which is stimulated.         Retraction of the shoulder
     (combined      with flexion of the forearm) is  alone produced by excita-

     tion of the posterior portion of this area, and when manifested as the
      result of excitation applied here, is apt to be associated with move
      ments of the trunk, pelvis, or hip, which, as the overlapping of the
      contours of the areas shows, may also be called forth by excitation of
      this part.
         In the next area, II, II', we get movements of the trunk muscles as
      the result of excitation, the chief effect produced being a rotation of
      the body to the opposite side to that stimulated, combined with an
     arching of the spine, with the concavity directed towards the opposite
     side. In the anterior part of the area the chief effect is upon the
     dorsal region, but in the posterior part it is upon the lumbar region
     and pel  \ is.

  1884.]      Experimental Researches in Cerebral Physiology.              441
     This area is largely overlapped by the next one, III, III', excitation
 within which is followed by movements of the hip, at some points the
 flexors only, at others the extensors only, at others both sets of muscles
 being   called into contraction simultaneously.        As will appear from
 the overlapping of the areas in the figure, these movements of the hip
 are apt to be associated with the rotatory and bending movements of
 the trunk above mentioned ; but in the anterior part of the area it is
 generally the rotation of the trunk and pelvis which is first seen, and
this is followed by hip movements, whereas in the centre of the area
 movements of the hip may be the first to appear, or with a very weak
excitation may be the only ones visible.
    The next area, IV", IV, is very extensive. It considerably overlaps the
areas II, II', and III, HI', and extends to the posterior limit of the con
volution. Its excitation calls up contractions of the thigh mnscles, and
especially   of the hamstrings, which in     some parts are the   only muscles
affected by weak stimulation     — indeed, in some instances the contractions
of the individual hamstring muscles were perfectly localised.           But in
most parts of the area, as the overlapping of the contours shows,
these movements are associated with those of other muscles, viz.,
anteriorly    with the trunk and hip muscles, and posteriorly with
muscles    which move the ankle and toes.            These associated move
ments may       be simultaneous,    but are most commonly       successive, as
when by    stimulation of    one point there was produced,    first a contrac
tion of one of the abdominal muscles, then of one of the thigh
muscles, and then of one of the mnscles which move the ankle.
    In like manner the area marked V, V, may be looked upon as the
specialised    part from which the movements of the ankle are con
trolled, these being usually the first to appear on exciting the area,
although very generally associated with or followed by movements of
the hip and knee.      And VI, VI', may for a similar reason be looked
upon as specially controlling certain movements of the toes, generally
associated, however, with other movements of the lower limb. As before
mentioned with regard to the other areas, the particular movements
called forth differ according to the point in the area which is excited,
but our experiments do not as yet enable ns to make sufficiently positive
assertions   as to the localisation  of these specialised points.
    In the two animals from which the excitable portion of the marginal
convolution     has been removed, the resulting pareses of voluntary
movement,      so far as these can be determined, are precisely such as
might be expected to occur from removal of those portions of the
cortex by which the voluntary movements of the muscles which aro
called into action by stimulation of this convolution may be assumed
to be governed.      Since, however, as Ferrier has shown, certain of the
muscles are also caused to contract        by excitation of portions of the
 external surface, the paralysis of these would not be so complete as of

 442        The Apex    of  the   Leaf in OsmunJa and lodea.               [Mar. 20,
those which are solely connected with this convolution.                  Accordingly
it is found that there is a considerable difference in the amount of
 paralysis for voluntary movement produced in the different muscles,
and especially that some of them are found to undergo a considerable
 amount of recovery in the course of a relatively short time, while
others remain permanently and completely paralysed.                    The paralysis
 (for volitional impulses) is most pronounced in the muscles of the
toes and    hind feet, and in the hamstrings and glutaei.             The paresis is
sufficiently   obvious,  but   less marked    in the   arm-muscles than in those
of the lower limb, while in the trunk-muscles it is extremely difficult
to determine what movements are purely voluntary, what are asso
ciated movements, and what are purely reflex movements.                       We are
unable, therefore, to say positively how far the influence of the will
over these muscles has been abolished by the establishment of the
lesion.*
    It will, therefore, be more advantageous to defer the complete
account of the condition of these animals until the opportunity is
afforded by post mortem examination of verifying the extent of the
lesion and of tracing the resulting secondary degenerations.

    It  has long been accepted, in accordance with the investigations of
Sadebeck, that there is at the apex of the young leaf of the fern a two-
sided, wedge-shaped, apical cell, and that, after this cell has lost its
identity by periclinal, and subsequently by anticlinal divisions, the
growth of the leaf is continued at the margin by the persistent
activity of a linear series of marginal cells. It is true that this is the
mode of development of many fem-leaves, but, as my observations
¦show, it does not apply for all cases, while those exceptional cases are
particularly interesting as occupying an intermediate position in this,
as also in other, respects between the true ferns, on the one hand, and
the Marathacece      and Cycadea on the other.           It   is among the Osmun-

excitable portions of the external surface, in addition to the excitable portion of the
marginal conTolution. Complete hemiplegia has been the result ; the paralysis
affecting not only the muscles of the limbs but also those of the head and neck and
of the trunk, whereas in animals in which onlv the excitable portions of the external
surface (the motor regions of Terrier) have been removed the paralysis is but partial,
and confined chiefly to muscles of the limbs. — (Note added March 20, 1884.)

dacece that these exceptional cases occur. In the young leaves of
Todea superba and of Osmunda ciimamomea it was found that the apex
is occupied by a well-marked, three-sided, conical, apical cell, from the
three sides of which segments are cut off in regular succession, as at
the apex of the stem of Equisetum.     The apical cell is so placed that
one side faces the ventral side of the leaf, while the remaining two
sides are obliquely disposed with regard to the dorsal side of the leaf.
No clearly marked marginal series of persistently active cells have
been found giving rise to the pinnae, as is stated to be the case for the
typical ferns. Further, there appears to be no strict relation between
the points of origin of the pinnae and the segments cut off from the
apical cell.  The pinnae arise in acropetal order.
   In itself no great importance is to be attached to the difference
between a three-sided and a two-sided apical cell. For example, it
has been clearly shown in a paper by Treub, on the vegetative organs
of Selaginella Martensii, that the two forms of apical cell are to be
found on different shoots of the    same species.           But in the   case of the
leaf of the fern, the whole development, as described by Sadebeck and by
Ruy, is so closely connected with the existence of a two-sided cell that
a departure     from that arrangement is to be regarded as of more
importance than would otherwise be due to      and    it,
                                                      appears to me to

supply an intermediate step towards the more complex leaf of the
Marathacece and Cycadece.
  Finally, it  believed that this
                is                the first desoribed case of clearly

marked, three-sided, apical cell occurring in the leaf of any plant.
Holle asserts that there  a wedge-shaped apical cell at the apex of the
                          is
leaf of Angioptris, and describes                " of

444                   Mr.   J. N. Lockyer.     On the           [Mar. 20.
   When observations of spot spectra were commenced in 1869, tie
original idea was to observe the behaviour of every line widened or
brightened in the spectra of each spot.
    It was soon found, however, that in this climate it was exceptional
to do this completely on any one day.       Still, when it can be done, it
is most important    to secure  such observations, and accordingly a com
plete method of reduction of such observations was suggested, laid
before the Solar Physics Committee, and published by them in their
Report.
    Laboratory observations soon indicated the importance of having
a series of strictly comparable observations.     It became obvious there
fore that the observations would require to be considerably restricted.
    One reason why it was important to obtain such a series was that
they might be compared with the complete records of bright lines
seen in prominences given by Tacchini and others.
    This consideration led to the suggestion that it would be advisable to
take only the most widened lines, by which is meant the lines relatively
the most thickened in the spots : accordingly the six most widened
lines in each of the two regions, F to 6, b to D, have been taken on
every available opportunity. In this way a number of strictly com
parable observations have been obtained.
    Besides these observations, attempts have been made to photograph
the spectra of sun-spots, and several photographs have been obtained.
In all H and K were seen reversed over the spots, just as Young saw
them at Sherman, while the blue calcium line was not reversed.         The
dispersion employed, however, up to the present has not been sufficient.
    Previous researches had shown —
    1. That with increased density in the spot-vapours we might expect
an increase in the number of lines radiated, and therefore absorbed,
either in the case of one vapour or of a mixture of vapours.
    2. That an increased quantity of any one vapour in a mixture would
increase the number of lines visible in the spectra of that substance.
    3. That since absorption will vary with temperature, and as absorp
tion is effected at different heights in the solar atmosphere, where the
temperatures are different, depending upon the height on the average,
the lines observed will vary according to the position of the absorbing
 stratum.
    Information on all these points could be obtained by the method
proposed, if the lines belonging to each substance were separately
discussed afterwards. An individual discussion of each substance then
formed part of the plan of the work.
                          Some General Conclusions.
    1. In the photographs of spectra of sun-spots the H and        K  lines
 were always reversed, while the blue calcium line was not.

    2.   On February 26th, 1880, faint lines not marked in Angstrom's
atlas appeared among the most widened lines.
    3. A change took place in the spectra of the sun-spots in May
and    Jane, 1881, the old lines faded away and new lines appeared.
    3a.   The lines of iron fade away from the spots as the maximnm
snn-spot     period is approached.
    4.  In  October, 1881, a similar change took place, only much more
abrupt.
    5.  During the second hundred observations      a much greater number
of Fraunhot-eric lines have been seen wider than       in the first, but with
less   frequency.
    6.  The most widened lines have shifted towards the less refrangible
part    of the spectrum.
    7.  In  some spots certain lines have indicated change of refrangi-
 bility,   while other lines in the same region have not done so.
    7a. On several occasions certain lines of iron have been seen in
motion, while other lines in the same field of view have been at
rest.
    8.  There are immense inversions in the lines seen widened in the
spots from spot to spot, and from day to day.
    9. There is a great inversion between the iron lines seen among the
most widened lines.
    10.   There are yet greater variations between the lines brightened
in prominences and widened        in spots.
    11.   On comparing Young's chroinospheric lines with the most
widened lines, it is found that the number of common lines increases
till the end of the third period, and then it falls.
    11a. There is a great difference between the lines seen in promi
nences by Young at the maximum and those seen by Tacchini at the
minimum sun-spot periods.
    11s. In the region between F and b there are no iron lines common
to the most widened lines and Tacchini's observations of promi
nences.
    12.   Even with a six-fold complexity      I was unable to classify the
most widened iron lines.
    13.   The spectrnm of iron in the sun is more like that given by the
spark     than that given by the arc.
    14. Of three iron lines at 4918-0, 491 9 8, and 4923" 1 the two former
have been seen in spots among the most widened lines, while Tacchini
and others have seen the latter without the former in prominences.
    15. The prominence line 4923" 1 is sometimes seen under certain
conditions brighter than the longest iron line, in the region at
4956-7.
    16.   The lines of iron, manganese, zinc, titanium, nickel, and copper
most     frequently seen in spots are different from those most frequently

446      On the Most Widened      Lines in Sun-spot Spectra.       [Mar. 20.
seen   in prominences, whilst in cobalt, chromium, and calcium they are
the same.
   17.   The lines of iron, cobalt, chromium, manganese, titanium, and
nickel seen in the spectra of spots and prominences are usually
coincident with lines in the spectra of other metals with the
dispersion employed, whilst the lines of tungsten, copper, and zinc are
not.
   18.   All the lines of titanium seen among the most widened lines
have either been greatly developed in passing from the arc to the
spark, or else have been seen only in the spark.
   19. The lines of titanium, zinc, and nickel, seen widened in the
fourth period, are not the same      as those seen in the first.
   20. Several of the new lines       seen among the most widened       lines
occupy positions near those occupied by titanium lines.
   21. No lines of oobalt, manganese, chromium, copper, or tungsten,
were seen in the fourth period.
   22. A strong barium line has been seen once among the most
widened lines   ; it is a line greatly intensified in passing from the arc
to the spark.
   23. A hundred       and   one lines have been seen among the most
widened lines which have no corresponding lines (so far as is known)
in the spectra of the elements. One of these lines has been seen
frequently in prominences by Yoang.
   24. So far as the observations have gone, there has        been no differ
ence caused by the nearness of the spot to the limb.

         Rayleigh, D.C.L., F.R.S. Received March 17, 1884.
                               (Preliminary Notice.)
     The investigations upon this subject which have been carried on by
 Mrs. Sidgwick and myself during the last year and a half, though
 not yet quite finished, are so far advanced that no doubt remains as
to the general character of the results ; and .as these results have
application in the daily work of practical electricians, it is thought
desirable to communicate them without further delay.
     The currents are measured by balancing the attraction and repul
sion of coaxal coils against known weights, as described before the
British Association in 1882, a method which has fully answered the
favourable expectations then expressed. To what was said on that
occasion it will be sufficient for the present to add that the readings
are taken by reversal of the current in the fixed coils, and the
difference of weights thus found (about 1 gram) represents the
double force of attraction, free from errors depending upon the con
nections of tlie suspended coil, and other sources of disturbance.
     The difficulties which have been experienced, and which have been
the cause of so much delay, have related           entirely to the behaviour of
the silver voltameters, of which never less than two, and sometimes

   1884.]       Electro-chemical Equivalent       of Silver,  <j-c.         449
  as many as   five, have been     included in the circuit of the measured
  current.   In order to render the deposit more compact, and thus to
  diminish  the danger of loss in the subsequent manipulations, acetate of
  silver was added   in the earlier experiments to the standard solution of
  nitrate.  Experience, however, has shown that the principal risk is
  not in the loss of metal, but in the obstinate retention of salt within
  the fine pores of    the deposit, leading to an over-estimate of the
  amount.    When the texture is very compact this danger increases,
  and deposits from a solution containing acetate are often decidedly
  too heavy, even after the most careful and protracted washings.            On
  heating to low redness a portion, at any rate, of the retained salt is
  decomposed,   N03 is driven off, and a loss of weight ensues. With
 pure nitrate, to which we finally recurred, the risk is much less.
     The actual weights of deposited silver were usually from 2 to
 3 grms., and, so far as the mere weighings are concerned, should have
 been correct to roi^ny      Discrepancies three or four times as great as
 this are, however, actually met with, whether due to retention of salt
 or to loss of metal it is difficult to say.   The final number, expressing
 in C.Gr.S. measure the electro-chemical equivalent of silver, is a little
 lower than that (1-I19xl0-8) given on a previous occasion ("Cam
                         " for November
 bridge Proceedings                           26, 1883).     It approximates
closely to 1*118    Xl0~2,   and    is thus in precise agreement with the
number announced within the last few weeks by Kohlrausch, viz.,
11183 x 10-2.      Its substantial correctness can therefore hardly be
doubted, more especially as it does not differ very much from the
number (1-124) obtained by Mascart. In terms of practical units, we
may say that the ampere current deposits per hour 4-025 grms. of
silver.
    When we are provided with means for the absolute measurement of
currents, the determination of electromotive force is a very simple
matter if we assume a knowledge of absolute resistance.             A galvanic
cell is balanced    against the known difference of potentials generated
by a   known current in traversing a known resistance.            The difficulty
relates entirely to the preparation      and definition of the standard cells.
A considerable number of Clark cells have been set up and tested at
intervals during the last six months, and their behaviour has been
satisfactory, the extreme range (after the first ten days) not much
exceeding reW         ^ modified form of cell in which the solid zinc is
replaced by an amalgam, is at present under trial.
    In Mr. Latimer Clark's own determination the B.A. unit is assumed
to be correct, and the     E.M.F. of the cell at     15° C. was found to be
I -457 volt.     On   the same    assumption, we obtain the not greatly
differing value 1*453 volt.      If we take the true value of the B.A. unit
as -9867 ohm, 1*453 will be replaced by l-434.
    Experiments    are also in progress to determine     in absolute measure

  III.   " On the Natural and Artificial Fertilisation of Herring Ova."
         By J. Cossar EwARt, M.D., Regius Professor of Natural
         History in the University of Edinburgh. Communicated
         by The President.        Received March 19, 1884.
     It is well known that for centuries herring have been in the babit
  of congregating on inshore banks around the coast of Britain in order
  to deposit their spawn.
     In 18G2 the Royal Commission       (of which Professor Huxley. was a
'
  member) appointed to report on the trawling for herrings on the
  coast of Scotland, arrived at the conclusion that herring visit our
  shores for this purpose twice a year, some shoals arriving during the
  autumn, while others make their appearance during the winter. The
  herring which spawn during the autumn (and which at another time
  I  shall endeavour to show differ from the winter herring) chiefly
  frequent   banks on the east coast, while the herring which spawn
  during winter are most abundant on the west coast.
     Of the west coast spawning-grounds, the Ballantrae Bank, which
  lies off the coast of Ayrshire, is one of the most important and is
  certainly the most famous. To this bank herring are known to have
  resorted for at least 200 years, always bringing in their train
  numerous codfish, whiting, and sometimes shoals of dogfish, por
  poises, and dolphins, and while on the bank tbey have afforded an
  abundant harvest to the fishermen of the surrounding districts, and to
   the flocks of gannets and gulls which people Ailsa Craig.
     The herring fishery being one of the most important industries in
   Scotland (the autumn fishery engaging nearly half-a-million people,
  and being worth in good years about 2.500,OOOZ. sterling), there has
  been since 1809 a Board specially charged with guarding its interests.
  This Board (formerly kuown as the Board of Fisheries, but since
  1882 as the Fishery Board for Scotland) in 1862-63 endeavoured,
  under the direction of Professor Allman (then a member of the
  Board), to gain some information as to the habits of the herring, and
  more especially as to the nature of the spawn and the spawning
  grounds.     Since 1863 little has been done in this country by way of
  continuing these experiments until last autumn, when the new
  Fishery Board, recognising the importance of the investigations so
  ably initiated by Professor Allman, appointed a Committee of its

   1884.J          Artificial Fertilisation of Herring       Ova.             451
  members to continue        the observations,      and extend   them    so as to
  embrace as    far as possible the consideration of all the food fishes.
      But while little has been done in this country ,to increase by means
  of continuous observations our information as to the habits and life
  history of the herring, important results have been obtained by the
  German Fish Commissioners,           and from observations made for the
  Norwegian and Swedish Governments and the United States Com-
  missioner of Fish and Fisheries.         Nearly all the work hitherto done
  is summarised in the valuable        "  Reports of the United States Com
 missioner of Fish and Fisheries," more especially in Parts          III  and VI,
 where Widegren, Lyungman, and Sar's researches are referred to, and
 a fall account of D. H. A. Meyer and Dr. C. Kupffer's work will be
 found in the " Jahresbericht d. Commission               z. wissenschaftlichen
 Untersuchung d. deutschen Meere in Kiel f. d. Jahre 1874, 1875,

     During the autumn two members of the Fishery Board Committee
 (Sir James B. Gibson Maitland and myself) having had H.M.S.
 "          "
    Jackal     (Lieutenant Prickett, R.N., commander) placed at their
 disposal by the Admiralty, were enabled to examine the more impor
 tant spawning-beds        in the Moray Firth, and to make experiments
 with the view of determining the best mode of artificially fertilising
 and   hatching herring ova.        A preliminary report of the work done
 has   already been presented to the Board (" Nature," 29th November,
 1883), and a complete report will be published at an early date.
     The Fishery Board, keenly appreciating the importance of the
scientific    work   it had instituted last autumn, on learning that the
winter herring       fishery had begun off the Ayrshire coast, requested
me, on the 3rd        March, to join the fishery cruiser, H.M.S. "Jackal,"
at Girvan, with      the view of inspecting the famous Ballantrae spawning
grounds.
     On  reaching the bank     I found   that it was chiefly occupied by seine-
net fishermen, and that, although the bank is about 3 miles in length
and from 1 to 2 miles in breadth, the principal spawning and fishing
ground were confined to a comparatively           limited portion of that area.
There     being,   in addition to seine-net, both trammel- and drift-net
fishermen,     and an abundant supply of mature herring, it was
evident that Ballantrae was not only unique as a fishing ground,
but that it afforded facilities for prosecuting the inquiries which the
Fishery Board had instituted, such as were not likely to be found on
any other part of the British coast.          Accordingly arrangements were
at once made (1) for taking temperatures and examining the nature
of the bottom, and (2) for securing and keeping alive a number of
mature herring to enable us to study the process of spawning, and to
make experiments in artificial cultivation.            At the outset it is only

    Professor    Huxley, in his address at Norwich,                 " The first

 definite and conclusive evidence as to the manner in which herring
 spawn is attached and becomes developed, that                I  know of, was
 obtained by Professor Allman and Dr. McBain in 1862 in the Firth of
 Forth.      By dredging in localities in which spent herring were
 observed on the 1st of March, Professor Allman brought up spawn
in abundance at a depth of 14 to 21 fathoms. It was deposited on the
surface of the stones, shingle, and gravel, and on old shells and coarse
shell-sand, and even on the shells of small living crabs and other
crustacea adhering tenaciously to whatever it had fallen on."*             This
spawn was dredged by the fishery cruiser
                                                   " Princess Royal," Captain
Macdonald, commander.
    There is no record, as far as I know, of herring spawn having been          .
dredged from 1862 until 1872. In a valuable paper on the Norwegian
Herring Fisheries by A. J. Boeck and A. Feddersen (1872), f it is
stated that Boeck " raised with the dredge large lumps of roe and
gravel intermixed." The only other reference to the dredging of
herring spawn I am acquainted with is in the " Report of the German
Commission,      J  where it is mentioned that the eggs of the inshore
herring were found in the Schlei at a depth of 3 feet, attached to a
fresh water pond weed (Potamogeton) . But although no record has been
 kept, herring ova must often have been taken up by our fishermen,
for during the last three months           I  have obtained numerous small
clusters of herring ova attached to sea-firs (chiefly Hydrallmannia
falcata) at all stages of development, which had been brought up by
 the east coast long-line fishermen.             Taking advantage of this
 knowledge, I prepared a number of small grapnels by tying three
 large cod-hooks together and fixed them by strong cords about 6 feet
 in length to a heavy 4-feet iron bar. With this rude instrument, an
 oyster-dredge, and an ordinary naturalist's dredge, we drifted or
 steamed slowly across the bank in various directions, and on several
occasions succeeded in bringing up fine specimens of herring ova
attached to stones, sea-weed, and sea-firs, and portions of trammel-nets.

The cod-hook      grapnels brought up the trammel-nets (in        which were
a few recently canght herring and a large number of              fish, chiefly
herring, in an advanced stage of decomposition), and also        most of the
sea-weed; the oyster-dredge brought up all the stones            coated with
spawn.      These stones varied from 6 inches to 1| inches in length,
and from 4 inches to 1 inch in breadth, but in all cases the eggs were
attached to a comparatively smooth surface (which probably was
uppermost when the eggs were deposited), and they were arranged
either in low cones or in comparatively thin layers, one or two eggs
deep.
    The eggs on the laminaria and other sea-weeds were either lying
separately or in small isolated groups, or embedded amongst tho
roots, while those on the sea-firs were always attached in small
clusters about half an inch in diameter around the stems.
    On the trammel-nets the eggs were scattered in an irregular manner
over several square feet.         They were always most abundant near the
 fish from which they had escaped, and tailed away sometimes to the
right and sometimes to the left, the position having undoubtedly
been determined        by the direction of the currents at the moment they
escaped.
     On examining the spawn found on the stones and sea-weed,
 embryos at various stages of development were at once visible, some
 of them apparently only three days old, while others had distinct
 eyes,   and from their violent movements and their size       seemed    almost
 ready    for hatching.     Some of the egg-coated stones were preserved in
 spirit, others were deposited in the Rothesay Aquarium or retained
 ou board the " Jackal," while others were conveyed to the University
 of  Edinburgh.       I have  not heard what has happened to those left at
               but    those   left  on the " Jackal

  embryos.

 Asterias, Astropecten, Ophiura, Echinus, Antedon, and others — a few
 Crustacea — Pagurus, Nephrops, Palaemon, Cancer, and other crabs; a
few sertularians and actinozoa, chiefly the common AJcyonium.
 Compared with the spawning-beds examined during the antunin in
 the Moray Firth, the Ballantrae Bank is peculiar in having as far as
 our experience went a very limited coating of sea-weed and
 sertularians.    The fishermen at Ballantrae reported that owing to
 recent storms the sea-weed is less abundant now than it was some
years ago.
    The absence of sea- weed cannot be accounted for by beam-trawling,
for so far as I could learn trawlers are careful to avoid the bank lest
they destroy their nets.         Perhaps the spawning-bed      might be
improved if     it were possible to increase the amount of sea-weed   and
sertularians.
   By taking soundings over the bank in various directions it was
ascertained that it consisted of stones, shells, gravel, and coarse sand,
and that the depths varied from 7 to 12 fathoms.            Between the
bank and the shore— a distance of about a mile — the bottom consists
chiefly of sand and broken shells, and the depth, at some points
8 fathoms, diminished sometimes rapidly, sometimes slowly as the
 shore was approached.       The outer edge of the bank shelved at most
points rapidly until a depth of 17 fathoms was reached, and at this
depth the bottom consisted of fine soft mud.
   While, on the east coast spawning grounds examined during the
autumn, the surface temperature in most cases varied from 53° F. to
55° F., and the bottom temperature from 52° F. to 54° F. even at a
depth of 40 fathoms, the temperature at the Ballantrae Bank, during
the early part of March, varied from 42° 8 F. to 43° 8         F. at the
surface, and from 43°5 to 42°-8 F. at the bottom.
   The    corresponding    surface temperature, however, on the east
coast during the week ending March 8th "was from 2° F. to 3° F.
lower than at Ballantrae, and even the water in Rothesay Aquarium
was lower by 1° F. than the water at Ballantrae.       As in autumn the
temperature is believed to have a great influence in determining the
movements      of  the herring, so it may influence the selection of
spawning grounds duriDg the winter.
    During the autumn we found in the neighbourhood of all the
spawning-beds in the Moray Firth a remarkably rich surface fauna,
in fact on fine days the surface literally swarmed with life. In
addition to the millions of medusoids and ctenophora there was an
endless number of crustaceans (some of them at a very early stage of
development), larval echinoderms and molluscs, ascidian tadpoles,
and other minute pelagic forms.        On the other hand, on the Ballan
trae Bank, even when the surface was perfectly smooth, we only
succeeded in taking a few entomostraca with the surface-net.       There

is,therefore, as far as has been ascertained, little or no surface-food
for the millions of herring-fry which will undoubtedly be soon
hatched     on the Ballantrae Bank.            It    may be possible to secure spe
cimens     of the larval herring, and               thus ascertain what they are
feeding on.
                       II.    The Natural Spawning Process.
  The presence of a large school of porpoises and dolphins, and tho
excitement and rocket-like movements of the gannets, taken together
with the calmness of the sea on the afternoon of Friday, the
7th  March, led us to expect that there would be         good night's fish
                                                                a
ing.    We   therefore arranged  to  be on the fishing- grounds early on
the Saturday morning, well provided with large tanks for receiving
live herring, and with hatching and carrying-boxes for their spawn.
Our expectations having been realised, we had at our disposal on
Saturday morning thousands of mature living herring.              Selecting
about fifty of the largest and ripest, they were placed in tanks on
              " Jackal," and
board the                      conveyed as rapidly as possible to the
Rothesay    Aquarium.    On  the way there was time to make a number
of experiments, and to cover several plates of glass with artificially
fertilised ova, but before referring to these experiments, and the
method adopted for artificially impregnating the eggs,                 shall   I
describe how the eggs are deposited and fertilised by the herring
themselves.     This, so far as     am aware, has not been previously
                                     I
observed. In the best account we at present possess of the structure
and habits of the herring, Professor Huxley says,
                                                        " When spawning
takes place- naturally the eggs fall to the bottom and attach them
selves." " But at this time the assembled fish dart wildly about, and
the water becomes cloudy with the shed fluid of the milt.         The eggs
thus become fecundated as they fall, and the development of the
young within the ova sticking to the bottom commences at once."*
Mr. Mitchell, in his book on " The Herring," referring to the once
famous spawning-bed off Dunbar, states that,
                                                     " About the 30th of
August the shoals began to deposit their spawn         short distance from
                                                              a
the harbour, and on the 3rd of September the fishermen fonnd that a
very large body of herrings remained fixed to the ground in the
process of spawning, the ground being of a rocky or stony nature."
It     not added how the fishermen knew the herring remained fixed

                         is

difficult even in a good light to observe what takes place in an
aquarium.      While many fishermen believe that herring spawn on
hard ground, some believe that they also spawn on a clayey bottom,
 and while some think that they spawn near the bottom, others affirm

4,56                Prof.   J.   C. Ewart.     On the   Natural and   [Mar.   27,
that they spawn near the surface, this latter being the favourite
theory of Dutch fishermen.
   In the preliminary report of last antumn's work already referred
to, we give it as our opinion that " The spawn once ripe they congre
gate at the bottom, the females depositing their roe on the rocks and
sea- weeds, to which it at once firmly adheres, and the males fertilising
it with their milt."
   But it will be observed we did not venture an opinion as to how the
spawn was deposited, or how it was fertilised.
   Having secured at Ballantrae a number of live herring, we
selected the largest and ripest males and females, and placed them
in a large wooden tank, into which a number of stones and a quantity
of sea-weed had been previously introduced.   After the fish had been
about two hours in this tank we examined the stones and sea-weed.
Although a few eggs were attached to both stones and sea-weed, it
was quite evident that they had not been deposited in the same
way as those found on the stones dredged on the previous day, but
the presence of the eggs indicated that we had secured ripe females.
We were not surprised that only   a few isolated eggs were found on
the stones, because the fish had been disturbed every few minutes by
the water poured into the tank in order to keep them sufficiently cool
and provided with an abundant supply of oxygen.      Having arranged
a  tent-like covering over the tank, so as to inclose the fish in a dark
chamber, we tried the effect of throwing instantaneous flashes of
light on the surface of the water, but as far as could be observed this
produced no impression whatever, they neither sought the light nor
           it it,
avoided             neither      did they in any way startled, however
                                            seem
 suddenly       was directed across their path.     This led us to believe
 that their natural movements would not be seriously interfered with
 when introduced into the tanks at the Rothesay Aquarium.
     On reaching Rothesay the hatching boxes and live herring were at
 once transferred from the " Jackal
                                        "
                                           to the tanks, a tank into which
 comparatively little light entered being selected for the ripest and
 most vigorous herring. In about half an hour after they were intro
 duced I    noticed a large full herring moving slowly about the bottom
 of one of the tanks, and thinking        had suffered during the journey,

  surprise,it   darted to the opposite end of the tank. Having, however,
  without much difficulty, secured the herring, and having ascertained
 it   was a   perfectly ripe female,     was set at once free.

  minutes I    noticed her moving slowly quite close to the bottom of the
  tank, with four other fish making circles around her at some distance
  from the bottom. Appearing satisfied with some stones which she
 had been examining, she halted over them, and remained stationary
 for a few minutes about half an inch from their surface, the tail

being in a straight line with the trnnk and the pectoral fins near or
 resting on the bottom.      While in this position, a thin beaded ribbon
 was seen to escape from the genital aperture and fall in graceful
curves, so as to form a slightly conical mass, almost identical with
a cluster of ova on one of the stones dredged at Ballantrae.             As
 the little heap of eggs increased, some falling to the left side one
moment, while others fell to the right the next, according to the
currents in the water, the males continued circling round the
spawning female at various distances, while the other females in the
 tank remained apart. The males kept from 8 to 10 inches above the
bottom of the tank and formed circles ranging from 18 inches to
 80 inches in diameter.     Some of the males were swimming from right
 to left, others from left to right, and although there was no darting
about, no struggling among themselves (there is nothing about the
structure of the herring that suggests struggling), no great excite
 ment, there was a peculiar jerking of the tail as they performed their
revolutions. Soon the object of this peculiar movement was suffi
ciently evident.     Three or four times during each revolution each fish
expelled a small white ribbon of milt, which varied from half an inch
to three-quarters of an inch in length and was nearly a line in breadth
across the centre, but pointed at both ends, and somewhat thinner
than it was broad. The delicate ribbons slowly fell through the water,
sometimes reaching the bottom almost undiminished in size, but in
most instances they had almost completely dispersed before reaching
the bottom.      In this way the whole of the water about the female
became of a very faint milky colour, and practically every. drop of it
was charged with sperms, as was afterwards ascertained.        It will thus
be seen that there is no attempt whatever on the part of the males to
fertilise the eggs as they escape from the female. While the female
is depositing eggs at the bottom the males concern themselves with
fertilising the water in the neighbourhood, and it will be observed
that the males are careful to guard against the influence of currents.
By forming circles around the female, and shedding milt on the way,
it matters not how the currents are running, they are sure to carry
some of the milt towards the eggs — the milt, like the eggs, sinking
though not adhering to the bottom.
    This, then, is the natural process of depositing and fertilising the
ova of the herring in comparatively still water.           I  watched the
whole process repeatedly, and the details were always the same.
When the female had deposited a certain number of eggs at any
given spot, she moved forward in a somewhat jerky fashion without
rising from the bottom, and as she changed her position the males
changed theirs, so that the female was always surrounded by a fine
rain of short sperm ribbons. A specimen of hydrallmannia, sent from
Eyemouth,      seems to indicate    that the female moves about amongst

458              Prof.  J.  C. Ewart.     On the   Natural and            [Mar. 27,
sea-firs and sea-weeds in exactly the same way as she does among
stones.     On each stem of the colony there is a cluster of ova about
the size of a small grape, and all the clusters had reached, on arrival,
the same stage of development as if they had been deposited about
the same time and by the same fish.              It is easily understood how
such clusters may be formed if the female is almost in contact with
the stems, and there is nothing easier than to form such clusters
artificially ; the first eggs adhere to the stem, then the others adhere
to the eggs already deposited, but being heavy, some of them roll
over to the under aspect so as to form the lower half of the sphere,
and the result is that partly, it may be owing to the stems moving
slightly, there are as many eggs on their under as on their upper
surface.      It would, however, be extremely difficult to understand
how such clusters or how conical masses could be formed on stones
if the eggs fell several fathoms before reaching the bottom.
    This method of depositing and fertilising the eggs accounts, T
think, for all the eggs, or, at least, for a very large percentage of
those found attached to sea-firs, sea-weeds, and stones, containing
developing embryos.
  III.   Experiments wade at    to the Deposit and Fertilisation      of  the Egg*.
   When a female was depositing her eggs she was very easily dis
turbed ; whenever anything was introduced into the tank she at once
darted off.     When strong currents were made she at first seemed to
apply herself nearer to the bottom to make sure, as it were, that the
 spawn would get fixed before it could be carried away ; but when the
currents were further intensified, she at once changed her position
 and arrested the escape of the spawn.
    A spawning female was held immediately under the surface of the
 water so as to cause the spawn to escape.             When this was don- it
 escaped in long ribbons consisting of a single row of eggs.                So firmly
 do the eggs adhere to one another, that in perfectly still water the
 ribbon was sometimes over a foot in length before it broke. Wh-n
 it had only about 2 feet of water to travel through it fell in wide
 loops at the bottom, but when it had over 3 feet to fall the chain
 broke up into numerous segments which formed an irregular patt-rn
 on the bottom.        From experiments made it seems the further the
 eggs have to fall, and the longer they are in contact with the water
 before they reach the bottom, they are more widely dispersed, and
 have all the less adhesive power.*          When the eggs are expressed in
 water moving rapidly in various directions the chains soon break into
 short segments, and the individual eggs and the small groups are

often carried   a considerable    distance before they reach the bottom.
It will be evident   that if the eggs are shed in strong currents some
fathoms from the bottom, the chances of their being fertilised would
be considerably     diminished.    When the sea is rough the fishermen
seldom expect a good " take," they believe, in fact, that during storms
the herring leave the spawning ground, and if the eggs are always
deposited as    I  have described we can easily understand that this
might well be the case.      Sometimes about the middle or near the end
of the spawning period the whole school disappears in a single night.
This generally happens during or immediately after a storm, or some
other disturbing cause.      It may be accounted for by supposing that
the herring beirg ready to spawn, or having already begun to deposit
their eggs, finding the conditions on their usual spawning grounds
unfavourable, deserted them for banks at some- other part of the coast
or at some distance seawards.
   A number of flat stones and pieces of sea-weed were obtained, and a
spawning female held over th-m at different distances in still water,
in water with gentle currents, and in water with strong currents.       In
this way groups of eggs were obtained whieh mimicked in a very
striking manner all the arrangements of the eggs on the stones and
sea-weeds   dredged on the Ballantrae Bank. When gently pressed a
beaded   ribbon, consisting of a single row of eggs, always escaped.
When there were no gentle currents it formed conical heaps ; when
in a gentle current the ribbon fell in irregular loops, the elements of
which arranged      themselves so as to form a flattened cone ; but when
strong currents acted on it, the ribbon was broken into fragments,
and only a few eggs succeeded in fixing themselves.              When the
currents were Rtrong, the males were seen not only to swim nearer
the bottom, but to expel       longer ribbons of milt which reached the
bottom before getting dispersed, and remained visible sometimes for
ten minutes.      On gently expressing a male under the water, it was
never possible to expel so fine or so short    portions of milt as escaped
naturally, but it was extremely easy expelling a ribbon from 18 inches
to 3 feet in length, measuring two lines across, and one line in thick
ness.   Such ribbons fell to the bottom, and remained almost unchanged
for nearly two hours ; they then assumed a segmented appearance, and
in abont 3^ hours had all but disappeared.
   Eggs were allowed to escape into a vessel containing fine sand, and
into another containing mud.        The eggs after being fertilised under
went the early stages of development, but, either owing to their
moving freely about with the sand particles, or owing to their getting
coated over with the sand and mud, their further development was
arrested.    I have not yet determined finally if the development is
arrested when the eggs are detached, but this seems extremely
probable.

 460           Prof.   J. C. Ewart.      On  the Natural and      [Mar. 27,
    Amongst questions still to be settled are the following : —
    How long does the female require to shed all her ova, and does it
 escape in thick ribbons when she is in an exhausted condition ?
 When the sphincters are relaxed in a dead fish the spawn escapes in
rounded cords about three lines in diameter.
    How long after death are the eggs capable of being fertilised ?
Eggs were successfully fertilised during the autumn from a herring
taken from the stomach of a cod immediately after it was caught.
    How long does the male require to discharge its milt ? And how
long do the sperms retain their fertilising power ?      I  have found that
in   lj  hours the sperms cease moving, and that ribbons of milt
from herring dead 12 hours remain for several days unchanged, the
dead sperms being unable to separate from each other, and diffuse
themselves through the water.
                          I
   When at Ballantrae noticed         that the trammel-nets   secured often
more males than females.      Is this partly owing to the males swimming
somewhat higher than the females, and partly owing to the males
taking longer to shed their milt, and hence remaining longer on the
spawning-ground ? It may be found that while the females discharge
all their spawn in three or four days the males require nearly double
that time to get rid of their milt.          Mr. Wilson, fishery officer at
Girvan, at my request, made a number of experiments with ripe
herring. He found that on opening a female herring after as much
spawn as possible had been expressed by the hand about a fourth of
the roe remained, while on pressing a ripe male in the same way
about a third of the milt remained, and he observed that it was more
difficult to express the milt than the roe. Mr. Wilson states in answer
to other queries : (1) That the ripest fish are caught in the trammel-
nets, while most of the uuripe fish are obtained in the drift-nets ;
(2) That at the end of the fishing season at least there are about
three males taken for every two females, indicating not necessarily
that the males are more abundant than the females, but rather that
the males remain longer on the spawning-grounds.         Boeck states more
females are caught at the beginning of the fishing season, which agrees
with our observations in the Moray Firth.         Mr. Wilson believes that
herring prefer quiet water free from strong currents when spawning,
and that when the weather is fine, the herring remain long upon the
bank, and deposit their spawn leisurely, but when there are strong
currents they either hurry the spawning process, or disappear into
deeper water.
      IV.  The Artificial Fertilisation and hatching of Herring Ova.
   Hitherto, herring ova when wanted for artificial cultivation have
usually been obtained in the following way.              The herring was
removed from the water and gently pressed along the abdomen so as

 1884. J        Artificial Fertilisation of Herring Oca.                461
to expel the eggs by the    genital aperture.    The eggs  as they escaped
were received on a plate of glass, and then spread over the surface       of
the glass by means     of a feather.    Milt -was then added directly from
the male, and spread in the same way.           After immersing the glass
plate several times iu water it was introduced into the hatching or
carrying box. By this method the eggs were often distributed in a
very irregular manner over the surface of the glass, and they were
liable to be over-milted.     The eggs which first escaped collected in a
mass around the genital aperture, and were apt, unless the herring
was retained in a perfectly natural position, to run along the side and
get contaminated with loose scales, &c, and when they fell on the
surface of the glass, or were conveyed to it by the finger or the end
of a quill, they formed irregular lumps into which the sperms could
not easily penetrate.
   I  found, after many experiments at         Ballantrae, that the best
results were obtained when both the male       and female were held under
water while the milt and roe escaped, i.e.,    when the natural process of
spawning (although not known at the            time the experiments    were
made) is followed.
   An ordinary wooden tub was obtained and filled with sea-water.
Into this a small quantity of milt was expressed, the male being held
completely under water while the milt escaped. A glass plate was
then held about    4 inches    beneath the surface of the water and the
female   herring  about   1  inch  beneath the surface, and then under
gentle pressure the eggs readily escaped in the characteristic narrow
beaded ribbon, and by moving the fish over the surface of the glass
either a close or an open network conld be formed.          At first, where
one loop crossed another, the eggs were      two or more layers thick, but
either owing to the weight of the eggs or the gentle currents set up
in the water, before a few minutes had elapsed the eggs usually
formed a single and almost continuous layer, the network arrange
ment having disappeared.        The plate was then allowed to rest for two
or three minutes at the bottom       of the tub and a few short ribbons of
milt were again introduced.        After moving the plate once or twice
across the top of tho tub in order to wash off any scales that were
adhering, it was placed either in a hatching or in a carrying box.
   Many thousands of ova treated in this way on the 8th March contain
extremely active embryos, which are expected to hatch on the 22nd
or 23rd of March.

   We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the President,
Council, and Fellows of the Royal Society of London for the Improve

Tour Majesty and Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Albany and
the nation at large have sustained in th- decease of His Royal
Highness the Duke of Albany.
   That a career so full of promise, and one which seemed likely to
aid in fostering the interests both of literature and science, should
have been so suddenly cut short, only serves to deepen our sorrow.
   That it may please Divine Providence to support Your Majesty and
the Royal Family in this heavy trial is the earnest wish and prayer of
Your Majesty's loyal and devoted subjects,

   for notice at the time, as they were beside the question immediately
   under discussion, namely, the experimental                determination    of the
   atomic      heat of the metal, but from the fact that they have been
   abstracted      for various journals, and that greater prominence has
   been given to- them than was perhaps originally intended                   by the
   author,    I  beg to- be allowed to comment upon them, as my opinions
  have been       entirely misrepresented.       Dr. Humpidge states in allusion
              " This chemist concludes from bis
  to me    :                                           experiments that glucinum
  is a dyad metal, and that its homologues are calcium, strontium, and
  barium, elements with which it has not the slightest analogy." From
  this sentence it appears probable that Dr. Humpidge was not fully
  acquainted with the nature of the evidence advanced, which, how
  ever, might be excusable, since though the two papers in which it
  was contained were read at the meetings of the Chemical Society,
  that " On Homologous Spectra
                                           " on March 15th, and that " On the

  Spectrum of Beryllium             on April 19th, they were not published in
  the Journal in time for him to have consulted them.*
      The statement quoted above is precisely my argument. " The spec
  trum of beryllium exhibits no marked analogy with the calcium, the
  magnesium, or the aluminium spectra, all of which are members of
 well-defined homologous series."
      " There is
                     nothing similar to the boron, the silicon, or carbon spec
 trum, nor to those of scandium, yttrium, or cerium.               The spectrum of
 lithium is the one most allied to that of beryllium in the nnmber, the
 relative      positions, and intensity of the lines. The question, however,
 whether beryllium is a dyad, and ttie first member of the series mag
 nesium,       zinc, cadmium, is complicated, since it would probably present
 a   spectrum of a different character to the succeeding homologues, in
 accordance         with the following equation, which follows from the
 periodic law and holds good for the chemical properties of com
 pounds :" —
                               Li : Mg=Be : A1=B : Si.
     " The relation of the
                                  spectrum of lithium to that of magnesium is
 obscure,      that  of boron  to  silicon less so, consequently we might expect
 that the relation of the beryllium spectrum to that of aluminium
would      not be well defined."
     It is further remarked by Dr. Humpidge : " And it seems strange
that Professor Hartley should consider some slight spectroscopic
resemblance between glucinum and the metals of the alkaline earths
    • The    latter paper, which appeared first, was published in the June number of
the
       " Journal of the Chemical Society,a which reached me tbrough the post on
Jane 7th, its date of issue was therefore scarcely likely to be earlier than the 5th.
The paper
               " On Homologous Spectra" was delayed until September.

  between them."
     The nature of the evidence derived from the spectroscope is here
  quite misrepresented ; probably it was not well understood because of
 its novelty.
     I have found that the spectra of magnesium, zinc, and cadmium are
 the result of three series of harmonic vibrations with similar intervals,
 the fundamental vibrations of which differ only in pitch.      I have made
 some similar observations with regard to copper, silver, and mercury,
 aluminium, indium, and thallium, calcium, strontium, and barium,
 though maps of some of these spectra have not yet been published.            I
 believe that in series of elements such as these, which exhibit grada-i
 tional differences in properties and in the properties of their compounds,
 and approximately equal numerical differences in their atomic weights,
 we are dealing with the same kind of matter in different states of
 condensation, or in other words, with matter having similarly con
 stituted molecules, the vibrations of which are in the same direction
 and at similar intervals but with different velocities.
    If we attempt to classify beryllium in accordance with the views of
 Nilson and Pettersson, the elements scandium and yttrium, with
 atomic weights 44 and 89 respectively, must yield spectra charac
 teristic of the series of which aluminium is the first member, but it is
 not possible to find a place for beryllium in this group, nor in those
 to which cerinm, lanthanum, and didymium belong ; it is, in fact, by
 a process  of exclusion first and selection afterwards   that the element
 falls into the dyad series.
                            I
    In the position which assign to beryllium, we can account for it
 being related, through the properties of its compounds, to magnesium
 and zinc on the one hand, and to aluminium on the other.
    If there is one consideration of greater importance than another
which should lead to the determination of the position of an element
 in a series, it is the mode of vibration of the molecule, and of that we
have evidence in the spectrum.       When the element is one with a low
atomic weight there is no difficulty in interpreting such evidence.
II. "On       the    Heating Effects of Electric Currents."               By
   William      Henry    Preece, F.R.S. Received March 19, 1884.
    The production of heat in electrical conductors due        to the trans
ference of electricity through them has become a matter       of very great
practical importance.      A knowledge of the variation of     the law, due
to the dimensions and character of the conductor, is           essential for
lightning protectors and for the leads of electric lights.

  1884.J               Heating Effects of Electric Currents.                      465
     Atmospheric electricity has proved a great danger to insulated
 wires, subterranean         and submarine, and to telegraphic apparatus
 generally.      Not    only do the direct discharges of atmospheric electri
 city enter      the wires, but very powerful currents are induced in
  neighbouring wires when these discharges take place, either between
 cloud and cloud or between cloud and earth.                 Various plans have
  been devised to protect apparatus and wires from these currents.
  Lightning protectors based on the effect of points, on the facility of
 discharge through vacua, on the low resistance of thin air-spaces to
 high potential, and on the fusibility of thin wires, have been used.
     The most careful and long-continued observations have shown that
 the survival of the fittest is found, in the use of a thin flat air-space
 A (fig. 1), supplemented by a fine well insulated protecting wire,
B, of high resistance, wound around a brass rod in connexion with
earth.     The air-space is obtained by superposing two smooth plane
surfaces of thick brass, separated from each other by a space of -004
of an inch, by means of a frame of mica or paraffined paper.                        It
requires (according to the researches of Messrs. Warren De La Rue
and    Hugo Miiller*) confirmed by my own observations made in
Dr. Warren De        La Rue's laboratory, a potential of 800 volts to strike
 across such an air-space, and when this is done a path of no resist
ance, according to           Faraday, is established for the atmospheric
discharge     to  flow   to earth.t But destructive currents of induction are
often produced in telegraph wires, which have not the requisite
potential to strike across this air-space, and the element of time may
enter to force some of the current into the cable or apparatus so as to

injure it. Hence a protecting wire has been added, which, while it
will allow all working currents to pass without retardation, will not
allow a current strong enough to damage the cable to flow through
without its being fused. It thus acts as a safety valve. The length
and dimensions of this wire have not been hitherto determined by any
stringent conditions.       After having determined the conditions re
                                                                    " plate pro
quired to give the maximum effect with the so-called
tector "*  I became anxious to find out the conditions that would give
a similar result with the

                                       protector."
   Now, the very strongest current that can, under any possible
circumstances, enter a wire from the working batteries is one of
500 milliamperes ('5 B.A. unit current), while atmospheric currents
enter the wires of all strengths from 1 milliampere to 30 or 40
amperes, or even more. Therefore, it was desirable to find that wire
which would not fuse with 500 milliamperes, but would fuse with
 currents of about 700 milliamperes and over.
   Hence,   I  took a source of electricity, which was a large thermopile
of (Diamond's make, which would give the necessary current, a
rheostat by which it was possible to regulate this current to any
strength, a Thomson mirror galvanometer which enabled me to
measure, record, and regulate every change of current, and a dis
charger by which      I   was able to hold, measure, and adjust the wires
to be tested.
   1.  With   a given current and a uniform wire of given diameter and
given   material, the effect, allowing for the cooling effect of the
binding screws, was independent                of the length, for whether
the length experimented upon was an inch, a foot, or a yard, it
always fused when the current reached a certain definite strength.
The point of fusion was irregular, for it simply depended on some
irregularity in the uniformity of the wire, and tho weakest link in
the chain went.
   2. Samples of platinum wire of various diameters, each of 6 inches
in length, were taken, and the current increased gradually until the
wire fused.      The results are given in the following table : —

      The above figures are the average of numerous experiments, and
 they are plotted out in fig. 2.
      The general law governing the ratio between the current strength
 and the diameter of the wire when the latter is raised to a definite
 temperature, and where radiation is free and unchecked by any ather-
 manous envelope, appears to be that the current should vary as the
 diameter X ./diameter ;* this may be proved as follows.
     The heat developed in any cylindrical wire is by Joule's law —
                                  H=C31U,

or   if wc maintain the ratio between the current and the diameter
constant, the same amount of energy will be wasted in the conductor.
   But the temperature of the conductor is dependent on the rate
at which the heat is radiated and conducted away, and when the
heat imparted by the current just balances that lost by radiation

     The results of the foregoing experiments on the current required
 to fuse wires of different diameters would appear to contradict this
 law, and to show that the current varies as the diameter, but there
 are several    elements in the method of making the measurements
 which tend to modify the general law. Platinum wires — especially
those of small diameter — are liable to flaws which practically reduce
their effective diameter to a great extent ; also the larger wires from
their greater weight necessarily tend to part asunder at a lower tem
 perature than those which are lighter and on which the strain is less.
    3. In thermometric       measurements there are only two fiducial
points usually employed, viz., the freezing point, and the boiling
point, but there are two other points equally well marked, though
perhaps not quite so accurately fixed.         These are the points of self-
luminosity and of fusion. The first point has been determined by

    I  was anxious to discover whether the law before stated would
apply in the case of the production of the lowest visible red radiations
by currents.     I therefore took several wires of different materials, and
of different diameters, but all of the same length, and by observing
them in a carefully constructed dark chamber, determined                 the
currents that produced self-luminosity, these currents being measured
by finding the difference of potential at the ends of a thick German
silver wire (R) whose resistance was '0157", inserted in the same

    Having occasion to observe the spectrum of the flash of a mixture
of hydrogen and oxygen fired in a Cavendish eudiometer, we were
struck by the brightness, not only of the ubiquitous yellow sodium
line, but     of the blue calcium line and the orange and green bands of
lime, as      well as of other lines which were not identified. The eudio
meter      being at first clean and dry, the calcium must bo derived either
from the glass or from some spray of the water over which the gases
with which the eudiometer was filled had been confined.           It seemed
incredible that the momentary flash should detach and light up lime
from the glass, but subsequent observations have pointed to that con

about 3 feet long, closed at one end with a plate of quartz, held in its
place by a screw-cap and made tight by leaden washers.     Two narrow
brass tubes wero brazed into the iron tube at right angles to the axis,
one near each end, and one of these was connected with an air-pump,
the other with the reservoir of gas. Into one of these brass tubes was
cemented a piece of glass tube with a platinum wire fused into           it,
whereby the electric spark was passed to fire the gas.
  The tube was placed so that its axis might be in line with the axis
of the collimator of a spectroscope, and the flash observed as           it
travelled along the tube.
   It was seen at once that more lines made their appearance in the
iron tube than in the glass vessel, and one conspicuous line in the
green was identified in position with the line of the solar spectrum.

Several other lines were identified with lines of iron by comparison
with an electric spark between iron electrodes. There could be no
doubt that the flash in an iron tube gave several of the spectral lines
of iron.  We supposed that this must be due to particles of oxide
shaken off the iron by the explosion, and proceeded to try the effect
of introducing various substances in fine powder, and compounds,
such as oxalates, which would give fine powders by their decompo
sition in the heat of the flame. Several interesting observations were
made in this way. When some lithium carbonate was introduced, not
Dnly were the red, orange, and blue lines of lithium very brilliant, but
the green line hardly less so. After the lithium had once been intro
duced into the tube, the lithium lines continued to make their appear
ance even after the tube had been repeatedly washed.           When the
lithium had been freshly put in, the red line was observed to be
mnch expanded, very much broader than the line given by lithium
in Bunsen burner reflected into the slit for comparison.

if  the spark by which the gas was fired was at the distant end of the
tube, so that the flame travelled along the tube towards the slit, there
was a reversal of the red line a fine dark line was plainly visible
                               ;                                         in
the middle of the band. When the spark was at the end of the tube nest
the slit, no reversal was, in general, seen.   Later observations showed
 that some other metallic lines might be reversed in this way, and
photographs taken of the reversals.       These observations with the eye
 on the  reversal  of the red   lithinm line were made with a diffraction
 grating, and were repeated many times. They show that there are
 gradations of temperature in the flame, and that the front of the
 advancing wave of explosion     is   somewhat cooler than the following
part. The combination of the gases      is  not so instantaneous that the
 maximum temperature    is   reached at once. When some magnesia was

  put into the tube the continuous       spectrum was very bright, but the
  iron lines were    still brighter.  No line which could be identified as
  dne to magnesium was observed with certainty;             there was only a
  doubtful appearance of b. With sodium, potassium, and barium car
  bonates, only the lines usually seen when salts of those metals are
  introduced into a flame were noticed ; but eye observations of this
  kind are extremely trying, on account of the suddenness of the flash
  and the shortness of its duration.    Thallium gave the usual green line.
      Subsequently we had the interior of the tube bored out so as to
  present a smooth bright surface of iron, and noted the iron lines
  which were conspicuous in the flash.
     For the purpose of identification the pointer in the eye-piece was
  first placed on one of the strong iron lines given by the electric
 discharge between iron electrodes, and then, the discharge being
 stopped but the field sufficiently         illuminated, the eye was fixed
 steadily on the pointer while the gas in the tube was exploded.           In
 this way it was not difficult to see whether any given line was very
 bright in the flash. The lines thus identified were those having the
 wave-lengths about 5455, 5446, 5403, 5396, 5371, 5327, 5269 (E),
 5167 (64).     These lines were all many times observed in the way
 described, and as a rule were always present in the flash. Lines with
 wave-lengths about 5139 and 4352 were seen, and may possibly have
 been due to iron, and several more lines were seen occasionally, but
 were not so regularly seen that they could be well identified.          The
 lines X4923 and      X  4919 were specially looked for, but neither of them
 could be seen.      A group of blue lines were noticed, and were after
wards     identified by photography, a method much less trying than
observations by eye.          To give intensity to the photographs ten or
twelve flashes were usually taken in succession without any shift of
the instrument, so as to accumulate their effects in one photograph.
For identification the spark between iron electrodes was also photo
graphed, but with a shutter over the lower part of the slit, so that the
image of the spark should occupy only the upper part of the field.

photographed      : —

   As   a  rule no iron lines above O make their appearance ; in a few
plates T is visible, and it is possible that other lines may be obscured
by the water spectrum, which always comes out and extends from
near s to below R. Above T no line at all is visible in any of the
photographs, though the spark lines come out strongly enough, and
several of the strongest groups of iron lines, both of spark and arc
lines, are in the region beyond T.
   The spark by which the gas was fired passed in general between a
platinum wire and the side of the small brass tube, and was out of
view ; but in order to make quite sure that the lines were not due at
all to the spark, the brass tube was lined with a tube of platinum
foil which projected beyond the brass tube a short distance into the
larger tube, and the spark passed between the platinum wire and the
platinum tube. It was found that the same iron lines made their
appearance in the flash whichever way the spark was passed.
    Other experiments were made with explosions of carbonic oxide
and oxygen, and with coal-gas and oxygen.         The explosions of these
gases were     attended   with  much  more continuous   spectrum, and the
metallic lines were not always as well developed as they were witb
hydrogen and oxygen, but on the whole there were as many metallic
lines photographed from the flashes of carbonic oxide as from those
of hydrogen.        There is an uncertainty about the explosion of the
 carbonic oxide mixture which we cannot account for, even when we
 take into account the remarkable effects of relative dryness of the gas
on the explosions discovered by Mr. Dixon. Sometimes the explosions
 were so violent as to break the plate closing the end of the tube,
 though this had resisted the explosions of the hydrogen mixture,
 while at other times the wave of explosion passed slowly along the
 tube.      The gas was in all cases confined over water and passed
 directly from the gasholder into the tube.
    When the iron tube was lined with copper foil, only one copper
lino in the visible spectrum, X =5104'9, was seen, and in the ultra

strong, and the two nltra-violet lines were in some cases reversed.
These lines were also frequently developed when no copper lining
was in the tube, probably from the brass of the small side tubes.
   Copper also gave a line in the indigo, X 4281 about, decidedly less
refrangible than the copper line, X 4275, coincident apparently with
the strong edge of one of the bands developed when a copper salt is
held in a Bunsen burner.

   A lining of   lead gave the lines X 4058, 3683-3 and 3639-3 strongly,
and these lines were frequently developed, though less strongly, when
there was no lead lining ; the metal being without doubt derived from
the leaden washers used to make the ends of the tube air-tight.
   A strip of silver    gave the lines X3381-5 and 3278, and these lines
were sometimes       reversed.     No trace of the channelled spectrum of
silver was developed even when silver oxalate was put into the tube,
and furnished plenty of silver dust after the first explosion.
   A magnesium wire about 2 millims. thick and two-thirds the length
of the tube gave the        b lines very well ; that is to say 6j and b, were
well developed, and b± was also seen, but as the iron and magnesium
components of bi are very close together, and the iron line had been
observed before the introduction of the magnesium, it was not possible
to say with certainty whether or not the magnesium line were present
too. No other magnesium line could be detected. The blue flame line
was carefully looked for, but could not be seen.            The photographs
showed none of the magnesium triplets in the ultra-violet, nor any
trace of the strong line X 2852, which appears in the flame of burning
magnesium, and is yet more conspicuous           in the arc when that metal
is present.
   Metallic manganese, introduced into the tube in coarse powder, gave
the group at wave-length about 4029 with much intensity, but no other
manganese line with certainty.          In the visible part of the spectrum
the channellings in the green due to the oxide were visible.
   A lining of zinc produced no zinc line, and zinc-dust gave only a
very doubtful photographic impression of the line X3342.            A strip of
cadmium gave no line of that metal either in the visible, or in the
ultra-violet part of the spectrum.
   Tin, aluminium, bismuth, and antimony, also failed to produce a
line of any of those substances, and so did mercury which was spread
over copper foil made to line the tube.
   Thallium spread as amalgam over the copper lining gave the lines
X 3775 6, 3528 3    and 3517-8.
   Chromium was introduced as ammonium bichromate, which of
course left the oxide after the first explosion.              This gave the
chromium lines with wave-lengths           about 5208, 5205, 5204, 4289,
4274-5, 4253-5, very well and persistently, also the lines with wave
lengths about 3605, 3592-5, 3578'5.
   Sodium salts (carbonate, chloride) developed the ultra-violet line
X 3301 ; and potassium salts give the pair of lines about wave-length
3445 ; but no more refrangible line of either metal was depicted on
the photographs.       Lithium carbonate gave, besides the lines in the
red, orange, green, and blue, the violet line, X 4135-5        ; but no more
 refrangible line.
    Photographs of     a flame   of mixed coal-gas and oxygen, in which an

 1884.]        Spectroscopic  Studies on Gaseous Explosions.           477
 iron wire was burnt, show, as might be expected, the same iron lines
as are   developed in the flash of the detonating gases, and of the same
relative intensities.    These intensities are not quite the same rela
tively as they are in the arc spectrum.      Thus the lines X 3859, 3745,
3737, 3735, and 3719 come out in great strength, much stronger than
the lines X 3647, 3631, 3618, which are remarkably strong in the arc.
    German-silver wire, burnt in the flame of coal-gas and oxygen,
gave the same nickel lines as were given by nickel in the detonat
ing gases, as well as those of copper and lead.
    Copper wire gave, besides the lines X 3272, 3245"5, a set of bands in
the blue, which correspond        with those given by copper salts in
flames, and are probably due to the oxide.
   The greater part of the lines which we have observed in the flames
of the exploding gases have been observed by us to be reversed when
the several metals were introduced into the arc in a crucible of lime
or magnesia ; which is quite in accord with the supposition that the
metals experimented on are volatile, and emit as well as absorb these
particular rays, at temperatures lower than that of the arc.
   That iron is volatile at a temperature below the fusing point of
platinum, which is about 1700° C., has been pointed out by Watts
(" Phil. Mag.," vol. xlv, p. 86), who observed in the flame of a
Bessemer converter almost all the green and blue lines of iron which
we have seen in the exploding gases, besides one or two lines which
we have not observed or identified.       Having regard to this volatility
of iron, it does not seem so surprising that iron lines should be observed
accompanying those of hydrogen to great heights in the sun's atmo
sphere as that they should not be always seen there.
   It is interesting to note that Copeland and Lohse (" Copernicus,"
Dec. 1882) observed in the spectrum of the great Comet of 1882,
amongst other lines, four lines, X 5395, 5369, 5326, 5269, which are
nearly identical with iron lines observed in the flash of the detonating
gas.
   It is remarkable that     such volatile metals as mercury, zinc, and
cadmium should give no lines in the flame of the exploding gases.
   The gases exploded in the tube were generally mixed in nearly the
proportions in which they combine chemically ; but experiments
were made with oxygen in excess and also with hydrogen and car
bonic   oxide in excess. A small excess of any one of the gases did not
seem sensibly to affect the result, but on the whole the metallic lines
were more certainly developed when there was not much excess of
oxygen, and more constantly developed when hydrogen was used than
when carbonic oxide was used.
   The absence of any metallic lines in the flame of the exploding
gases which are more refrangible than T may be in part due to a
falling off in the sensibility of the photographic plates for light of

shorter wave-length   but as the spark lines of iron seem to be quite
                            ;
as strongly depicted on the plates in regions of the spectrum far
above T as they are in the regions below, we think that want of sensi
tiveness in the plates cannot be the only reason for the absence of
higher lines, but that the emissive power of the metals for these lines
is feeble at the comparatively low temperature of the flame.
   This supposition accords with what we have observed of the lines
seen  in a carbon tube heated by the electric arc (" Proc. Camb. Phil.
Soc," iv, 263). The iron lines photographed as reversed against the
hot walls of such a tube were at certain stages of temperature the
same, speaking generally, as those we have noticed in the flash of
the detonating gases ; but as the temperature of the carbon tube rose,
more refrangible lines, including all the strong iron lines in the
neighbourhood of T, the lines of aluminium near S, and the mag
nesium line   \ 2852, were reversed in the photographs.
   Gouy (" Comp. R.," 1877, p. 232), using a modification of Bnnsen's
burner fed with gas mixed with spray of metallic salts, observed at
the point of the inner green flame three or four iron lines which we
have not observed in the flame of the detonating gas, the lines   and    fcj
b9 of magnesium, two cobalt lines in the blue which we have not seen,
one line of zinc, and one of cadmium, and the two strong green rays
of silver. Can the appearance of these rays under these circumstances
imply that the temperature of the inner green cone of a Bunsen
burner, when the proportion of air to coal-gas      near the exploding

point,  ishigher than that of the explosion of hydrogen and oxygen             ?
   The interesting theoretical questions which are suggested by the
facts recorded in this paper we must leave for future discussion.

     The following    an offshoot from
                      is                  more extended investigation
                                               a
upon  the coagulation  of the blood not yet ready for publication.
   The blood flowing from a leech-bite        not readily stopped, often
                                                    is
flowing for upwards of an hour after the animal has been removed.
The blood within the body of the creature remains fluid for an
indefinite time   and when ejected
                  ;                      found to have lost its
                                               it   is
coagulability.  These are facts known to every surgeon, but they
have received no explanation.
  While endeavouring to solve one very difficult problem,             " why the

1884.]         Secretion obtained   from  the Medicinal Leech.         479
blood does    not coagulate within the living blood-vessels," the above
facts   came to my mind and promised to throw some light on the
general question.
    The explanation which at once suggested itself to me was, that
probably the leech secretes some ferment-containing-juice which
antagonises the blood ferment, preventing coagulation within its body,
enough remaining around the edges of the wound to prevent for
some time the outflowing blood from clotting ; the blood remaining
fluid,  in fact, until the leech ferment is all washed away.
    It will be seen that this explanation is in the main correct.
    In order to investigate its action on the blood, a salt solution
extract of leech was obtained.         In the first experiment the gullets
and buccal cavities of two leeches were removed, cut in small pieces,
and placed in 5 cub. centims. of 6 per cent. salt solution.     The rest of
the alimentary canals were also finely divided and placed in a similar
volume of the salt solution.        The extracts obtained were of a faint
greenish -yellow tint, and alkaline in reaction.        A leech was then
applied to the nose of a young rabbit for a quarter of an hour, then
removed, and held in a salted towel until it had disgorged.          Mean
while the blood flowing from the nose of the rabbit was collected in a
test-tube.
    The rabbit was then killed, and 3 cub. centims. of its blood received
into each    of four vessels A, B, C, and D, which were placed under a
glass shade, the air within being kept moist with blotting-paper
Boaked    in water.
    Vessel A contained      nothing but the blood, which coagulated      in
four minutes.
    Vessel   B   contained  in addition 1 cub. centim. of 6 per cent. salt
solution, and coagulated in four minutes.
    Vessel C contained in addition 1 cub. centim. of 6 per cent. salt
solution     of the alimentary canals (minus the pharynx) of the
leeches.     The blood faintly coagulated in four minutes, setting
completely in half an hour.
    Vessel D contained in addition 1 cub. centim. of 6 per cent. salt
 solution extract of gullet of leeches.     This remained fluid for twenty-
 four hours, a thick clotted scum forming on the surface when the
 blood putrefied.
    The blood collected from the nose of the rabbit and that from the
 iuterior of the leech remained flnid until putrefaction set in, when the
 same   half scum half clot formed on the surface.
    It is evident from this experiment that something retarding or
preventing coagulation may be extracted with G per cent. salt solution
 from the pharynx or mouth of the leech.
    The slight action of the rest of the alimentary canal in retarding
 coagulation, as this and many subsequent experiments indicate, is due

 480            Prof.  J. B. Haycraft.      On the Action  of a      [Apr. 3,
to some of the secretion        diffusing downwards.      Its place of origin
 within the body of the leech is certainly the pharynx or buccal
 cavity, decoctions of which are more than ten times as strong as those
of the rest of the body.
    The next experiment was undertaken to test my supposition that
 this substance belonged to the class of ferments, the most general
character of which is that they are destroyed by boiling. At the
same time solutions' of the leech in distilled water were made in order
further to test its solubility.
   Equal portions of the blood of a sheep were placed in four vessels
containing equal volumes of leech extract.
   Vessel A contained salt solution extract of gullet of leech ; the
blood remained fluid for three hours and was not further observed.
   Vessel B contained distilled water extract of gullet; the blood
remained fluid for a like period.
   Vessel C contained boiled salt solution extract     ; the blood remained
fluid for   a like period.
   Vessel D contained          boiled distilled water extract ; the blood
remained fluid for a like period.
   The blood received in a test-tube from the body of the animal
coagulated in five minutes.          This experiment was repeated with
similar results.
   We have then to do with a substance not a ferment, and soluble in
distilled water, as well as in salt solution.
   It may be noted that when the leech extracts are added to blood the
corpuscles subside to the bottom of the vessel, leaving, in the case of
the salt solution extract, a clear plasma, and in the case of the watery
extract a plasma coloured by the haemoglobin, which is partly dissolved.
   In order to obtain the active principle of the leech extract in a pure
form an attempt was made to isolate it by means of the ordinary
solvents.
   A  watery extract of several leeches was evaporated to dryness, and
divided into portions which were respectively extracted for twelve
hours with chloroform, ether, benzole, and absolute alcohol.            They
were then filtered, and the filtrates evaporated to dryness and ex
tracted again with water.         They had no action whatever on blood,
except in the case of the chloroform extract, and that was very slight
indeed.
   The residues after extraction       with these fluids were dissolved in
water,   and   proved efficacious when added to blood.
   The substance is then insoluble in chloroform, ether, benzole, and
alcohol.
   Its separation in a pure form bekig evidently a difficult matter
owing to its insolubility in the most useful solvents, the attempts at
its isolation were in the meanwhile abandoned.

1884.]          Secretion obtained     from    the Medicinal Leech.          481
   One useful result of this experiment was the preparation of a
much purer solution to be used for experimental purposes.                    The
gullets of the leeches were placed in absolute alcohol for a day or
two, and then extracted         with water. In this way a clear, somewhat
coloured alkaline fluid was obtained, almost free from albumen, and
giving but a very small residue, this, too, of unimpaired strength.
A solution prepared in this way was henceforth always used.
   The next task was to find the exact action of this substance on the
blood,   and in the first case to see if it destroyed or hindered the action
of the ferment.
   After trying in vain one or two methods the following suggested
itself : —
   The blood-coagulating ferment is not very soluble in distilled
water, so    that if a blood-clot containing it be soaked for some time in
the watery leech extract, this can afterwards be removed by distilled
water    without dissolving out the ferment.             On adding the latter to
hydrocele     fluid its activity  can   be  tested (this fluid coagulates on the
addition of active blood ferment).
   The washed finely divided clot from bullocks' blood was dried and
divided into two equal portions by weight. One portion was then
placed in a watery solution of leech, and the other in a like volume
of distilled water.       After twelve hours the clots were removed, dried
with blotting-paper, and carefully washed in distilled water.                The
washing     lasted    for  three   hours,   the  wash   water  being  four times
renewed, each portion of clot being treated with the same volume of
water.     They were then each placed in a few cubic centimetres of
8 per cent. salt solution in which the blood-coagulating ferment               is
soluble.     Five drops of the salt solution extract of the clots were
added to equal quantities (5 cub. centims.) of hydrocele fluid.              The
hydrocele fluid to which the extract of clot, treated with leech extract,
had been added did not coagulate at all, while the other portion
coagulated in ten minutes.
   The action of the leech extract is then seen to destroy the blood-
coagulating ferment.
   The next question is whether the blood corpuscles are in any way
affected by the leech extract ?            A couple of drops of blood were
obtained from the finger-tip, mixed rapidly with a drop of normal
salt solution extract of leech, and a minute drop of the mixture
placed on a glass slide.       This was then covered, and a ring of oil was
painted round the edge           of the cover-glass     to prevent evaporation.
When      this was examined on a warm stage, the red corpuscles rapidly
formed rouleaux         in the ordinary way; and the white corpuscles
 exhibited active ameeboid movements which continued for a consider
 able time — the observations lasted for an hour.              In the meanwhile
 the blood had not coagulated.          It is seen then that the vitality of the

482            Prof.  J. B. Haycraft.        On the Action    of a     [Apr. 3,
white corpuscles is not destroyed, and that the formation of rouleaux
by the red disks is not necessarily a phenomenon of coagulation.
The coagulation of the perivisceral fluid of the sea urchin is, accor
ding to the observations of my friend Mr. Patrick Geddes, not due to
the intercellular formation of fibrin in the plasma, but to active
amaeboid movements of the white corpuscles.               The pseudopodia of
neighbouring cells join, become welded together, and contract so that
all the cells are massed together into a solid clot. Professor Schafer
maintains that there is also a formation of fibrin in the ordinary way
which has been overlooked by Mr. Geddes.*               I have not examined
this fluid myself, and do not feel qualified to speak upon this subject ;
but certainly the blood of crabs, crayfish, and lobsters clots in the
way described by the former of these authors, there being no inter
cellular formation of fibrin. In this case, then, the leech extract
will probably not prevent coagulation.           The blood of a crayfish was
mixed with one-third of its volume of leech extract.               A drop was
examined microscopically at the ordinary temperature.                 The cells
exhibited    normal    amaeboid    movements,    and  coagulation    was appa
rently quite normal.
   Heretofore we have spoken of the extract of leech gullet and
buccal cavity, but it has not yet been shown which is the source of
this excretion.     All that can be said is that it comes from either the
gullet or mouth and sucker of the animal.               Careful microscopical
preparations    were   made  of   the anterior  half of  the leech, to seek for
glandular structures.       The animals were hardened for ten hours in
saturated picric acid solution, and longitudinal mesial sections were
made with a freezing microtome.              The sections were stained with
picrocarmine.      No signs of ordinary glandular structures were to be
observed either opening into the sucker, or into the alimentary canal.
Some of the epithelial cells forming the integument of the leech are
much elongated, passing down even among the subjacent muscular
fibres.   These have been looked upon as unicellular glands (Ray-
Lankester), and in the sucker one may see small collections of these.
If the skin lining the sucker be removed, it is found to be active in
preventing coagulation.        Not in a less degree however is the anterior
part  of a  leech  from  which    the skin of the sucker has been removed.
Probably then the secretion is derived from the epithelial cells lining
the sucker and buccal cavity; it may be that the unicellular glands
of the sucker share in its production.
   The products of the digestion of albumin by pepsin have an im
portant action in retarding coagulation.             Dr. Schmidt-Mulheim,f
working under the direction of Professor Ludwig, has shown that
blood received from an open vein into a solution of peptone does not

  coagulate    with its normal rapidity, being retarded for nine or             ten
  minutes.     If the peptone solution be injected into the veins of a dog,
  and  blood withdrawn from the animal at intervals after the injection.
  it will, if the injection be powerful enough ( 3 grm. peptone to every
  1000   grms. body weight of animal), materially affect its coagulability.
     Dr. Fano# finds    that certain products of tryptic digestion also retard
  coagulation    in dogs ; but curiously enough neither digestion products
  have   any action on rabbits.       It may be mentioned that when injected
  into dogs in larger quantities the blood pressure falls, there being
  great determination of blood to the abdomen and visceral veins ; con
  vulsions are observed, and the animal dies in a state of coma, the
  blood   found within the body being of course fluid.
     The    coagulability of the blood produced by certain poisons is
  altogether a question of great interest ; for instance, most suake bites
  (the cobra is an exception) produce permanent fluidity of the blood,
 and we      know nothing either of the relation of that change to con
  comitant symptoms, or the specific action of the venom on the blood
 itself.
     Now inasmuch        as the    extract of leech is much more powerful
 than the peptone solution            in preventing coagulation outside the
 body,     its effects  when     injected into the system may naturally be
 expected to lead to striking results.
     The difficulties in obtaining a license to perform the experiments in
 England being very great, I availed myself of an invitation from my
 friend Professor Schmiedeberg, of Strasburg, who kindly placed his
 laboratory at my service.            It is with the greatest pleasure that 1
 remember his kindness and courtesy,            I  wanted nothing that his well-
 organised laboratory contained, and to him I owe much personal
 assistance in an attempt to isolate the active principle present in the
 leech's pharynx.         This attempt, although not as yet successful on
account of the great difficulty of the task, will I hope at some future
 time be renewed with more fruitful result.
     In the following experiments the extract of leech was prepared by
 placing the anterior part of the animal in absolute alcohol for three
 days, then evaporating off the alcohol, grinding the leech with broken
 glass, extracting with water and filtering.

     In the case of peptone injection a marked difference between its
effects on dogs and on rabbits is seen.           A rabbit was therefore next
chosen for the subject of an experiment.              A cannula was inserted
into the carotid for the purpose of withdrawing blood at intervals.

      In my first experiments when an animal was allowed to live after
  the operation, the wound in the neck was stitched up in the ordi
 nary way.            When examined next morning a large swelling was
  always observed in the region of the wound.               On observing these
  they were found to consist of imperfectly clotted blood which had
  escaped from the divided capillaries, the fluid unable to clot had con
  tinued to collect often in very large amount, passing down under the
  skin in front of the chest, and often causing death. Subsequently
  the    wound       was carefully painted with perchloride of iron before
  sewing it up, and no after-bleeding occurred.            These facts are not
  without interest, as they throw light upon a similar symptom seen in
  many cases of haemophilia or hemorrhagic diathesis, where the
  slightest wound gives rise often to very troublesome bleeding.
      It was found by experiment that the injection of the leech extract
  has no immediate action on blood pressure. After the injection of the
  substance the animals as a rule appeared somewhat dull, the respira

1884.]         Secretion obtained     from    the  Medicinal Leech.
tions   were somewhat increased           and the temperature elevated, but
they soon    recovered    even after injection of large quantities ; in one
case a rabbit weighing only 1080 grms. was hardly disturbed by an
injection of an extract of twelve leeches. .
   The action of the leech extract, like that of the digestion products
of   Dr. Schmidt-Mulheim,        is not permanent.            In a few hours the
blood   is again normal.      This may be from various possible reasons,
either that more and more blood ferment is excreted, overpowering
as it were the action of the leech extract, or that the latter is
oxidised and    broken up in the tissues, or finally that it is excreted
(probably with the urine).           This latter surmise was from the first
held by my accomplished            friend, Dr. Kobert, and the following
experiments show it to be true.
   The urine was withdrawn from the dog used in the last experi
ment        hours after the injection of the leech extract.               At the same
time urine was obtained from a healthy animal.                  Two drops of each
(hud were added to two equal portions                  (7   drops)  of frog's blood.
Whereas the one mixed with healthy urine coagulated in' 10 minutei?,
the other remained fluid for more than 12 hours.                    Th- experiment
was repeated with a like result.
    Before leaving the action of the leech extract on the blood, it may
be well to contrast its action with the peptone injection of Schmidt-
Mulheim and Fano.          In the first place, I should be inclined to doubt
whether the active substance in these investigations is peptone at all.
It was found that after peptone had ceased to give any reaction in
the blood, it was still uncoagulable ; the conclusion of Dr. Fano being
that it forms some compound with other blood constituents                        which
prevents the coagulation. Is it not more natural to suppose that peptone
has nothing to do- with the question at all, especially as there are
many other digestion- products difficult to separate from the peptone.
Suppose the same substance formed in the leech were present
                                                                               — which
it is not — in the- digestion products, it would not have been separated
from    the peptone prepared by these observers.                   At any rate, the
action    of the injection, whatever it is, shows a marked difference in
its results from the leech extract.             The latter produces far milder
constitutional symptoms, is far more powerful in its action on the
blood, and has- the same action on rabbits as on dogs.*
    Since my return to my own laboratory                  I  have investigated the
   * My friend Dr. Wooldridge believes that in the coagulation of the blood one
factor, at any rate, is the conversion of the white cells into fibrin by the dead
plasma (" Proc. Koy. Soc.," vol. 31, p. 413).     Without discussing the probability of
such a view being correct or not, it certainly is not true in the clotting of the hydn. -
cele fluid by an extract of clot (ferment).      In this case my experiments show a
special action of the leech extract on the ferment, which; when active, converts
large portions of the plasma into fibrin.

  action of the leech extract on the coagulation of milk by rennet and
  on myosin.     Rennet mixed with a watery solution of leech has no
  less power of clotting milk than another portion mixed with water
  alone. The leech extract does not hinder in any way the clotting of
  myosin.     The latter was prepared from frog's muscle in a somewhat
  shorter and, I think, a better way than that described by Kuhne.
  Two mortars containing pounded glass were placed in a freezing
  mixture.     One held a few drops of normal salt solution, and the
  other  a like quantity of normal salt solution of leech extract.    The
  legs of a frog were washed out with normal salt solution, the muscles
  cut out, dried on blotting-paper, placed in the mortar, and ground
  with the glass into a frozen pulp. This was then tied up in a piece
  of calico, and the myosin expressed and filtered. Its preparation
 is most easy, and can be done withont fail in the hottest weather.
 The myosin obtained from the muscle to which the leech extract had
 been added coagulated in 10 — 15 minutes, and the other in from
 20 —25 minutes.      The experiment was repeated with like results. It
 may be remarked that if the clotting of myosin is due to a ferment,
 this has not yet been isolated.
     Inasmuch as during contraction chemical changes occur very
 similar to those seen in rigor mortis, and inasmuch as in the latter
 the coagulation of myosin is a prominent fact, some have held that a
 contraction of a muscle is due also to a partial clotting of the myosin
 This view I have never held to be anything but fanciful, for reasons
 which cannot be stated here. Dr. Lauder Brunton, however, sug
 gested to me, that by soaking rog's muscle in the leech extract, and
studying its contractility, some light might be thrown on the subject.
 I accordingly cut out from the limbs of a pithed frog some of the
 principal muscles, i.e., the sartorii, carefully removing tbem with as
little injury as possible. Those of one side were placed in normal
 salt solution, and those of the other in normal salt solution of leech.
Comparisons were of course only made between the corresponding
muscles of both sides. From time to time the irritability was tested
by currents from an induction coil. In all cases the muscles placed
in leech extract lost their irritability some time before the corre
sponding ones placed in salt solution.      In one experiment with two
sartorii, the left placed in leech extract died in 35 minutes, the right
in 70 minutes. Two pectoral muscles attached to the bone lived much
longer — one longer than I had conceived was possible — that in leech
extract for 12 hours, and the other for 51 hours.
    In these experiments those placed in leech extract almost from the
first contracted more feebly when stimulated.          On more than one
occasion I obtained partial recovery when a muscle was removed from
the leech extract and placed in fresh salt solution.       The only con
clusion one can draw is, that the leech extract somewhat hastens the

1884.]       Secretion obtained  from  the  Medicinal Leech.         487
coagulation of myosin removed from mnscle, and probably when it
causes loss of contractility in a muscle, it is due to the same reason,
inducing, in fact, rigor mortis, the essential phenomenon of which is
clotting of the myosin.
   In conclusion, then, it may be stated that the leech secretes from
its mouth a fluid which destroys the blood ferment without producing
any other observable change in the blood.         This injected into an
animal produces but slight constitutional disturbance, and is elimi
nated by the kidneys.     The action on the rabbit is the same as on
the dog; on crustacean blood it is inert.       It has no action on tho
curdling of milk, slightly hastening       the clotting of myosin,   and
hastening rigor mortis.

      1884.-
   The relation     between the composition of glass and its electrical
qualities has been studied by only a few experimenters, and our
knowledge of the subject is still comparatively small.            With regard
to resistance    to electrical conduction through its substance, Dr.
Hopkinson has found among other interesting results, that potash or
soda-lime glasses have a higher conductivity than flint glasses either
light or   denso  ;  and his   results   as to electrical  resistance  confirm
those given below.*
   That the presence of a large quantity of alkali in glass is
detrimental to its resisting quality has also been pointed out by
Ekman.t      In two papers (" Phil. Mag.," vol. 10, 1880, and " Proc.
Roy. Soc," vol. 34, p. 199), by one of the authors of the present
paper, results are given of experiments on the variation of the
resistance of glass of different kinds with temperature, and, more
particularly in the second paper, with density and chemical composi
tion.
   It  was inferred from the results        of the electrical    measurements
                         • " Phil. Trans.," vol. 167.

1884.]             On the Electrical   Qualities of Glass.
described in the second paper referred to, and the chemical analyses
of the specimens experimented on, that in the case of flint glass, the
electrical resistance increased with the density, and on the other hand
that for potash or soda-lime glass, the resistance increased as the
glass seemed to approach in composition to a definite chemical
compound.      Density, chemical composition, and resistance appeared
all to be so related to one another in the case of the flint glasses
experimented on, that increase of density, as well as approach to
definiteness of composition, gave increase of resistance.
    We offer the present paper as a contribution towards the further
elucidation of this question.        The experiments which are here
described were carried out on glasses which differed considerably
 from those previously used. They were all flint glasses of consider
 able density, and it will be seen that though they differ widely in
 specific resistance, not one can be called a bad glass for electrical
 purposes.    No experiments were made on potash and soda-lime
 glasses, as these are generally low in resistance, and oar first object
 was to obtain definite information regarding comparatively dense
 glasses which former experiments show to be relatively much better
 insnlators.    It is our intention, however, in a continuation of the
 present   research,  to experiment both as to resistance and specific
 inductive capacity on lime glasses of varying composition.

    The density of     each  specimen was carefully determined, and a
  complete chemical analysis made. The electrical experiments were
  made in the physical laboratory of the University of Glasgow, and
  the same general plan was followed as described in the paper
  mentioned    above    (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 34, p. 199).        The
  arrangement     of npparatus, with the exception of reversing key, &c,

490           Messrs.  T. and A. Gray and      J. J. Dobbie.    [Apr.  24,
is   shown in the accompanying       drawing, fig. 1, which is taken
from the previous paper.        The glass which in each case was in
 the form of a small globular flask of about 7 centims. diameter,
and from 2 to 3 millims. thick, was filled np to nearly the
 bottom of the neck with mercury, and immersed to the same level in
mercury     contained   in an outer vessel. This outer vessel was
contained in a sand-bath, which could be heated by means of a
 Bunsen burner placed below.       The flask had in each case a neck
 several inches long, and one extremity of a wire I was passed down
 the neck so as to dip into the mercury within, while the other was
connected through a sensitive galvanometer with a battery of about
one hundred Daniell's cells. The other terminal of the battery was
connected with the mercury in the outer vessel.           To enable the
current to be readily reversed, which was done between every
 successive pair of readings, a reversing key (not shown in the
 drawing) of somewhat novel construction, and of high insulation,
 was placed in the galvanometer stand and interposed in the wires
joining the battery with the apparatus.      It consisted simply of four
slender pillars of vulcanite attached to a base piece of the same
material.    The top of each pillar was thicker than the stem, and had
 a hollow scooped out of it to receive mercury.     In one side of the cup
 thus made, a piece of copper wire was fixed so as to terminate at one
 end in the interior of the cup, and at the other to give a projecting
 piece to which the battery wire could be attached.           The hollows
 were filled with mercury and cross-bridges of copper wire used to
 connect the cups directly or diagonally, so as to give a current in one
 direction or the other as required.
    The galvanometer used was the instrument described in the " Proe.
 Roy. Soc." vol. 36, p. 287, to which we refer for a full descrip
 tion, but the following brief account of the instrument may be
 conveniently given here. It consists of two pairs of coils with
 hollow cores arranged so that the axes of each pair are parallel and
 in a vertical plane. The coils act on a needle system of two horse
 shoe magnets of thin steel wire connected by a very light frame of
 aluminium, and hung with their planes vertical, so that a horseshoe
 corresponds to each pair of coils, and has its poles within the hollow
 cores.   Each pair of coils is in this instrument carried by a brass
 plate, and these plates are set so as to make an angle with one
 another of about 106°. The needles are not plane, but curved round
 so as each to lie nearly in a cylindrical surface, the axis of which is
 the suspension fibre, and which passes through the cores of the coils
 without touching the coils on either side. Thus the needles can
 move in the hollow cores through considerable displacements without
 danger of coming into contact with the coils, and the cores are made
 smaller than would be otherwise possible.        The needles enter the

1884.]             On the Electrical  Qualities of Glass.            491
coils from the same side, and the    current is usually sent through the
coils, so that one  pair cause their horseshoe to move outwards, and the
other   pair their horseshoe to move inwards, thus turning the needle
system round the suspension fibre.        This system of needles when
rightly adjusted is practically astatic in a magnetic field of uniform
intensity. A magnet moved in azimuth by a tangent screw, and
vertically by eliding along the vertical supporting rod, is used to
give a difference of intensity to the magnetic field at the upper and
lower ends of the needles, which are placed with similar poles
turned in dissimilar directions.
    The instrument is fitted with a distributing plate, the construction
of which is fully described in the paper.      By means of this plate the
coils can be joined in series or in multiple arc, or in any possible
combination of these modes of arrangement, so as to give all possible
variations of resistance and sensibility, or can be arranged for use
as a differential galvanometer when required.
    The resistance of the coils when joined in series is slightly over
30,000 ohms, and it can easily be arranged to have a sensibility such
as to give, when placed in series with a resistance of 1011 ohms in
the circuit of a single Daniell's cell, a deflection of one division on a
scale placed     at a distance of a metre from the mirror. The
 instrument can easily be made still more sensitive, but when this is
 done the long period of the needle system renders it difficult to take
 readings   quickly. This disadvantage may, however, be in great
 measure obviated by using a vane wholly immersed in liquid, or
 contained in a nearly closed air-vessel of proper size.
    With a considerably less degree of sensibility we have found the
 instrument very convenient for the measurements described below.
 These were conducted in the following manner.             The flask was
 heated by the sand-bath    to a temperature above 100° C., and readings
 were then taken of the current sent through the glass when the
 battery was applied       by means of the key. That the current
 measured     by the galvanometer might not be affected by leakage
  through the table and other supports of the apparatus, the wire
  connected to the inside mercury coating of the flask was carried
  through air only direct to the galvanometer terminal, and tests were
  made as to whether the whole current shown by the galvanometer
 actually passed through the glass by withdrawing the connecting wire
 from the mercury inside the flask and bringing it into contact with
 the neck of the flask outside by twisting it round the glass.       Such
 tests always    showed that no leakage current existed, and that the
 current measured was really that passing through the substance of
 the glass from one mercury coating to the other.      After a reading of
  the galvanometer    in one direction had been obtained and recorded,
  with the temperature of the glass when the reading was taken, the

492            Messrs.   T. and A. Gray and     J. J. Dobbie.    [Apr. 24.
coatings of the flask were connected together until the next reading
was about to be taken.         For this reading the current was reversed
and the deflection taken with its corresponding temperature, and so
on throughout the series of observations in any particular case.       The
electrification was thus reversed between every pair of readings, and
lasted in most cases three minutes.       The resistances given below are,
therefore, those after three minutes' electrification.     The constant of
the galvanometer for the battery used was determined once or twice
in the course of each day's experiments, so that the resistance of the
glass   might be easily determined in absolute measure from the
known thickness and surface of the flask. These were determined by
weighing the flask, first empty in air, then with the globular part
filled with water, then when immersed in water to a level a little
above the former, to allow for the glass wanting on account of the
orifice of the neck.       The difference between the first and second
weighings gave the capacity of the globe, from which its internal
diameter on the supposition of sphericity could be calculated.         The
difference between the second and third weighings gave         the volume
of the globe from which, as before, the external diameter, and
therefore the thickness         of the glass, could be deduced. The
resistances were then calculated for each specimen and multiplied by
 the mean surface in square centimetres and divided by the thickness
of the flask in centimetres, so as to give the resistance between two
opposite sides of a centimetre cube of the glass in question.
    With regard to the results obtained at different temperatures, we
have only to say that they confirm the conclusion formerly arrived at,
that the conductivity of glass is doubled for every 8-5 or 9 degrees
 Centigrade rise of temperature.          As, however, the object of the
 present experiments was mainly to further investigate the relation
 between resistance and chemical composition, they were not made
 through any very great range of temperatures.
    In the following table we give the resistance, density, and
 chemical composition of each of the specimens experimented on and
analysed.      We give also results for one or two specimens, the
electrical resistance and density of which were determined, but which
 were not analysed.
    The general conclusion      from  a comparison   of these data is, that
 the specific resistance of the glasses increases with the percentage of
 oxide of lead, and also with the density.      With the exception of the
glass marked    XX,   all the specimens which have been analysed follow
 the former law, and, with the exception of X and XX, also the latter
law, as II, I, and   III  have practically the same density.   But the two
flasks X and XX seem anomalous in other respects. They contain for
 one thing a large quantity of lime as compared with the others, and this,
 no doubt, tends to diminish their resistance.          The density of X

seems    high when the quantity of lead oxide is considered, while the
density of     XX seems low for the same reason. Also comparing X
with    XX,   we   see that while XX contains more lead than X, and at the
same time less of impurity, XX has a considerably lower density and
a much lower specific resistance.          The determinations of density and
resistance were repeated for XX and the results found practically to
agree with those previously obtained.           It may be interesting to note
that, while    all  the others   were new  glasses, X and XX were glasses at
least ten years old, which had been made for Sir William Thomson's
experiments on the preservation of electric charges for a long time
in hermetically sealed glass vessels.
   The flask marked VII has a somewhat lower percentage of lead
oxide than any one of the other glasses which are similar in resisting
quality, but it will be noticed that its density is the highest of all.
Only a determination of density and of the percentage of lead have
been made for this glass.           In the case of No. IV, the resistance was
determined, but no analysis was made.                We ought to state that
I,   II,  III, IV,    were   all  made by Messrs. Osier, Birmingham, and
were understood to be from the same pot of glass.
    Referring to the table on page 493, and considering the relation of
the observed resistances to the amount of soda contained in the glass,
we see that, except       II  and the anomalous glass XX, the resistances
decrease as the percentage of soda increases ; and making the same
comparison for the percentages of potash, we find approximately the
same     kind of variation of resistance. This seems to indicate that, if
other things were equal, the resistances would be diminished by in
creasing the proportion of alkali, a result which agrees with previous
observations.        We do not, however, consider the effect of alkali to be
so important as the opposite effect of lead oxide.
    In the paper referred to above (" Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 34, p. 199)
it is stated that a glass which seems to approach in composition to a
 definite chemical compound is also good in point of resistance. It seems
 possible that in the case of those glasses which have approximately
 the same composition but different densities, those having the higher
densities may approach more nearly to definiteness of composition.
 At all events, it is well known that minerals, more or less resembling
 glass in composition, which crystallise, have a greater density than
 substances of similar composition which are non-crystalline.
    It will be seen that the glasses which we have experimented on
 differ very widely from those analysed by Dr. Divers. Although it
 is impossible to say in what proportion the silica is distributed
 among the bases, it may be useful to give the number of combining
 proportions of the oxides present in the various glasses, and the
 simplest formulas which can be deduced from the analyses.

   It is curious to notice with regard to XX, which is anomalous in
most respects, that it gives a chemical formula widely different from
that foond for X.
   We had hoped to be able to include the results of experiments on
the resistances of crystals and minerals.           Several sections of different
substances have been made, and some of these have been already
analysed.      Among them are a plate of quartz, cut parallel to the prin
cipal axis, and a plate cut parallel to the secondary axes of the crystals,
and  by means of these specimens we propose to endeavour to find the
resistance and specific inductive capacity in different directions rela
tively to the crystallographic axes.            The electrical experiments are
not yet,  however, completed, but we hope soon to overtake the work.
   As the surface of these sections is small, we propose to use the
electrometric method by loss of charge, and to eliminate the capacity
of the   condenser formed by the substance under examination and the
electrometer,     by using a sliding cylindrical air-condenser, which will
allow us to vary the capacity by a known amount.
   Our proposed experiments on the specific inductivities of different
kinds of glass have been delayed principally for want of a standard
air-condenser. We propose, however, now to use an air-condenser,
the  capacity of which can be altered by a known amount, and Sir
William Tomson has very kindly placed at our disposal for this
purpose his sliding air-condenser.          As soon as Sir William Thomson's
standard spherical condenser, which is at present on loan, is returned
to the laboratory, we shall be able to verify the results to any neces
sary extent by comparison.
   It was at first our intention to employ the method of electric
oscillations used by Schiller* in his experiments on the specific induc
tive capacity of different substances, but for various reasons we have
decided to employ a different        method.      In the ordinary theory of the
oscillatory discharge of        a condenser      through a coil of large self-
induction, it is assumed that the current at any instant has the same
 strength throughout the whole length of wire in the coil.                    Now,
 although this is no doubt approximately true when the coil connects
 the plates of a condenser of great capacity, it cannot, on account of the
 considerable electrostatic capacity of the coil itself (a capacity which,
 taken per unit length of the wire, must vary along the wire in a manner
 which, so far as we know, has not yet been worked out) be true when
 the capacity of the discharging condenser is small in comparison with
 that of the coil.t      On this theoretical ground, and also because of the
 somewhat elaborate and delicate apparatus for measuring very small

intervals of time which the method renders necessary, we decided,
after all our apparatus and arrangements had been planned, to adopt
some other method, and we are indebted to Sir William Thomson for
the suggestion of a method which promises to be at once easy and
                                                                "
likely to give results nearly or altogether independent of electrifica
tion," and we have made arrangements for using it in our continued
experiments.       One plate of an air-condenser, the capacity of which is
known,     is  joined to the upper end of a fine wire which forms the
thread of a pendulum, of which a small metal ball is the bob.
Another exactly similar pendulum has, connected to the upper end
of its wire, one plate of the experimental           condenser, while the
 other two plates of the condensers are connected to the case of an
 electrometer used to measure the potential to which the air-condenser
is charged. Supposing the air-condenser to be charged, and its
 potential measured by means of the electrometer, and the experi
 mental condenser to be uncharged, the ball connected with either
 condenser is drawn aside, and let go so as to fall against the other
 ball. The balls being of an equal size and of the same material, the
first ball will be brought to rest, and the other ball will immediately
be set into motion, the time of contact being very short and capable of
 being approximately estimated. The second ball is caught, and pre
 vented from returning. The charge of the air-condenser has been
 shared by the contact with the experimental condenser, and the dimi
 nution of potential is read off by the electrometer, and from the result
 the specific inductive capacity of the material forming the experimental
 condenser can be found ; and, as the time of contact is very short,
 the result will be but very slightly, if at all, influenced by " electrifi
 cation." We may easily arrange, in ways which we need not here
 point to, this method for use as a null method.
    We propose in a continuation of our experiments to eliminate the
 uncertainty which still exists as to the etfect of impurities in the
 glass, and to test the effect of varying the proportions of the ingre
 dients, and of adding impurities by making up glasses from pure
 chemicals. The results of experiments, such as those described above,
 are so complicated by the presence of small quantities of what may
 be called
               " foreign " ingredients, that it seems unlikely that more
 definite results than those already obtained can be expected as to the
 exact relation between composition and resistance unless such experi
 ments as we propose be made.
     We are also extending      our experiments to crystals of quartz, fel
  spar, and   other minerals, and  to natural glasses, and further to glasses
  produced by melting natural crystals which are capable of assuming
  the vitreous condition.     We hope to obtain results as to the relation
  »f electrical quality to the crystallograpbic axes of the crystal.

                                     (Abstract.)
      The object     of this paper is to furnish experimental proof of the
   theory  advanced    by Professor James Thomson (" Brit. Assoc. Reports,"
                             " Proc. Roy. Soc," vol. 22,
   1871 and 1872, and                                       p. 27), that the
  pressure exerted      by the vapour of a solid substance at a given tem
  perature   is  less than  that of the vapour of the substance in the liquid
  form at the same temperature.
      This relation was specially sought for by Regnault, and, as shown
  by Professor Thomson, lie unwittingly furnished a proof for it in the
  forniulfD devised by     him to express the vapour-pressures of ice and of
  water.     Regnault himself, however, from the results of numerous
 experiments, came to an opposite conclusion, and this conclusion is as
 yet   generally accepted-
      A graphic representation of the results obtained by us on heating
 camphor in a barometer-tube to temperatures ranging from about
 150° C. to 200° C. shows          (1) considerable irregularity about the
 melting-point, and (2) that a prolongation of the portion of the curve
 representing relation of pressure to temperature above the melting-
 point would intersect the portion below the melting-point.
     With benzene, also, the vapour-pressures of which were determined
 by the method described by ns in a paper shortly to appear in the
 "Transactions" of the Society, the solid-gas curve is evidently not
 continuous with the liquid-gas curve:
     Employing the same apparatus, acetic acid was successfully cooled
 to temperatures far below its freezing-point without solidification,
 and numerous         extremely concordant observations of the vapour-
 pressures both of the liquid and of the solid acid were obtained.
These observations represented graphically, form two widely diver
gent curves which intersect in the neighbourhood            of the melting-
point of the solid acid, 16°-4.
     The barometric method was next employed ; but the results, like
those obtained by Regnault, were capricious.           That this capricious-
ness was not attributable to the presence of air was proved by special
experiments,       and it remains unaccounted for.
      Several very careful determinations of the vapour-pressures of ice
and of water below the freezing-point were made.             A comparative

method was first employed, in which ice, and water cooled below its
freezing-point were simultaneously subjected to the same pressure,
which could be varied at will, and the differences of temperature
noted.
     Anotherseries of observations had reference to the vapour-pressures
of ice alone, at temperatures ranging from 0° to —16°. The numbers
obtained, when represented graphically, proved not to be identical
with those calculated by means of Regnault's formulae D and                                   E
                                                                                              :
accepting formula D, which represents the vapour-pressures of steam
in contact with water, as correct. owing to the greater number of
observations and the greater range of temperature over which they
extend, the ice-steam curve was recalculated by the method given by
Professor James Thomson, and          was found that our observations
                                                   it
agreed much more closely with this curve than with that deduced
from Regnault's formula E.
   In the original paper, figures and diagrams illustrating these points
are given.
   As these substances — camphor, benzene, acetic acid, and water —
are representatives of very different chemical types,  may be held to          it
be   tr   for all stable substances that the vapour-pressure of the solid
          ie
is less than that of the liquid at the same temperature, and that the
differences between these pressures are calculable from thermic data,
where these are known.

the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids, and                 full statement of the

                                      (Abstract.)
  The object of the inquiry is to determine the conditions under
which the Bacillus tuberculosis of Koch grows and multiplies, and to
examine its behaviour under the influence of certain medicinal agents
and reputed antiseptics.
  The sputum of patients in advanced phthisis was used for experi
ment, on account of its abundance, the number of tubercle bacilli
found in   and its being easily preserved from decomposition when
           it,
protected from the air.    It was spread on cover-glasses, due precau
tions being taken to ensure a uniform thickness of the film, and the
staining process used was that known as the Weigert-Ehrlich modifica
tion of Koch's original method.
   Between 200 and 300 specimens were thus prepared and examined
with a Zeiss microsoope with Abbe condenser, under an F. objective
(=TV immersion lens) and No.     ocular, giving a magnifying power
                                         2
of 650 diameters, this being the field generally used for counting the
bacilli, and higher powers, up to 1390 diameters, were employed for
investigating the structure of the bacilli.
   The methods adopted to ascertain the increase or diminution of the
bacilli were — 1st, to count the numbers present in a series of fields
              :
of the microscope, at least six, and often twelve, being counted, and
in doubtful cases the whole slide was carefully gone over before a con
clusion was arrived at; 2nd, to note the length of the bacilli and the
presence or absence of well-marked divisions in these, preceding their
multiplication    ;   3rd, to observe whether       the bacilli are isolated or   in
groups.
  In every case standard for comparison was first taken from the
                      a
sputum, and the number of bacilli counted     the rest of the sputum
                                                      ;
was divided into portions of 20 to 30 minims, mixed with solutions of
various medicinal and other agents, and then kept in a Page's incubator
at a uniform temperature of 38° C., for periods of from forty-eight
hours to eight days. The following cultivation fluids were used —             :
   Syrup solution of the strength of drachms of syrup to
                                             2               ounce of     1
water.
  Hay infusion.

           and Medicinal Reagents on Bacillus tuberculosis.                  511
    Pasteur's solution (without sugar).
    Beef solution,  1 ounce of meat to 2 ounces of water.
       „      „     | ounce of meat to 2 ounces of water.
    Pork broth (Klein).
    Also distilled water and the subjoined medicinal agents in solution
 were mixed, in generally equal proportions,           with the sputum, and
 kept at the same temperature as above.
    Solutions   of quinine in strengths varying from        2 grs. to the ounce
                       to 10 grs. to the ounce.
       „        „   arsenious acid, ^ gr. to the ounce and         1  gr. to the
                       ounce.
       „        „   boracic acid, 1 part in 30 and    1  part in  15.
       ,,       „   iodine, I part in 12.
       ,,       „   pcrchloride of mercury, 1 gr. to the ounce.
    The results were as follows : —
    Syrup. — Cultivation was carried on for eight days. The tubercle
 bacilli were found in diminishing numbers in the first forty-eight
 hours; they afterwards       gradually disappeared, and during the last
 three days none      were detected.      On the first day they were of fair
 length, and some groups      were   noted.
    Hay Infusion. — Four days' cultivation.         Bacilli were present in the
 first twenty-four hours, but afterwards disappeared entirely.
    Pasteur's Solution. — Eight days' cultivation. Bacilli diminished in
•numbers at first and then remained stationary for some days.               They
 showed signs of increase on      the  eighth day.
          Solution. — Two strengths were experimented on during seven
    Beef
 and eight     days.    In the stronger solution the bacilli increased
 enormously, both in numbers and in length, and in some fields of the
 microscope it was impossible to count them.            Groups of five and ten
 were not uncommon, but those of greatest length appeared isolated.
 Some were long and slender, without cross markings, others shorter
 and slightly broader with well-marked spores.            The bacilli were most
 abundant in the neighbourhood of the meat debris, round which they
 swarmed like ants on sugar.           As the solution became decomposed,
 the number of bacilli decreased, but about the seventh or eighth day,
 they were seen increasing by division.       The Bacterium termo and other
 bacilli were also present.      A  weaker   solution  of beef gave the same
 results, though to a less marked extent.
    Pork Broth. — Four days' cultivation. The results were different,
 for the bacilli did not increase in numbers, but rather declined,
 though they did not totally disappear from the solution.
    Distilled Water. — Two to three days.             The sputum of three
 different patients was mixed with distilled water, and in each case no
 growth or multiplication of bacilli was observed.
    Sulphate of Quinine. — A large number of experiments were made

  512     Influence   of certain Reagents on Bacillus tuberculosis.
 with this agent, and resulted in demonstrating that the number of
 bacilli decreases rapidly under its influence, and that the bacilli in the
 sputum after being mixed with quinine could not be cultivated even
 in the beef solution before mentioned, thus showing that this drug
 not only arrests the growth of the bacillus, but destroys its power of
 multiplication. All the solutions of quinine appear to possess this
 property, but the stronger ones to the greatest extent.
    Arsenious Acid. — This exercised no destructive influence on the
 bacilli, which increased sixfold in both strong and weak solutions.
 The rods were generally short, with occasional long ones, and but few
 spores, and the groups were scanty in number.
    Boracic Acid. — The bacilli increased more abundantly in solutions
 of this than in arsenic, and displayed many groups of 2, 5, 7, and 10.
 Rods in couples, arranged at an angle of 45°, were common.           They
 were of fair length and many contained spores. Multiplication by
 division was proceeding.
    Iodine. — This drug reduced the numbers very considerably, and in
many fields of the microscope it was difficult to find any bacilli, in
others a few were present, but these showed no spores or indications
of growth.
    Perchloride of Mercury caused no diminution, but rather a marked
increase in the number of the bacilli. They were longer and with
more spores than in the standard solution.
   The tubercle bacillus is characterised by great durability of
structure, as evidenced by its not being destroyed by the strong acids
used in the various processes for its detection, and by its little
tendency to decomposition.        It does not multiply in distilled water,
but   does so largely in beef solutions.   Arsenic, boracic acid, and per
chloride of mercury do not interfere with its development, but rather
promote it.      Quinine and iodine (especially the former) appear to
entirely  arrest  its growth and destroy its power of multiplication.

         OBITUARY NOTICE OF FELLOW DECEASED.
    In the death of Mr. Charles Watkins Merrifield,         mathematical
 science   generally,  but particularly those branches which relate to
  nautical matters,    have suffered great loss.    Since the deaths of
  Rankine and William Froude, no one has passed away whose presence
 will be so greatly missed at the annual gatherings of the Institution
 of Naval Architects, and that of Section G of the British Association.
    Mr. Merrifield, although essentially a mathematician, and even a
 pure mathematician, was one of the few to whom the revolution from
 the rule of thumb to that of exact science in naval architecture      was
 immediately    due.   The  part which  he undertook   in this movement,
 although of the greatest importance, is from its nature unlikely to
 attract notice.     And for this reason, perhaps, as well as from the
 labour involved, as much as its inherent difficulty, was much
 neglected at the time when Merrifield commenced his work.
    It is a common complaint against pure mathematicians, that while
 they are continually pursuing, or being led by, this subject into
 abstractions which lie outside the region of experience, they neglect
 to develop those branches relating to matters of experience sufficiently
 to render them useful as means of calculation.
    Merrifield was an important exception to this rule. He held him
 self free from the fascination of any line of abstract reasoning which
 his work may have exposed, and devoted his time and energy to the
 not less difficult, but to many less interesting task of increasing the
 usefulness of mathematics by the development and adaptation of
 methods of application, as well as by the extension of mathematical
 tables which reduce the amount of calculation (otherwise often pro
hibitory) immediately necessary for any particular application. To
this work he mainly devoted the time at his disposal throughout his
scientific career, commencing in 1856 ; and in 1880, at the request
of the Committee of Section A of the British Association, he drew up
a report on the entire subject at which he had mainly been working,
entitled " Report on the present State of Knowledge of the Applica
tion of Quadratures and Interpolation to actual Data."        This is pub
lished in the British Association Report for 1880, and is in itself
a work of great and, in all probability, lasting importance.
   But it is not only as chiefly on account of his mathematical work
that the loss occasioned by Mr. Merrifield's death will be felt by those
who     were accustomed    to his  presence at discussions of scientific
matters.     His exact and    wide knowledge of the circumstances of
                                                                  a

                                   ii
applied mechanics, as well as the breadth of his reading and the
extent of his knowledge as to what had been done in the way of
applying mathematics in almost every branch of mechanics, bnt
particularly in matters connected with hydraulics. together with the
interest which he took in, and the ease with which he apprehended,
all abstruse matters that might be brought forward, rendered his
presence as between an author and his audience almost equivalent to
that of a jndge in court.
   The number of Committees of the British Association on which he
sat is some evidence of the number of subjects in which he took deep
interest.  He held decided though liberal views concerning the best
method of education ; these he expounded in his address, as President
of Section G, at Glasgow, which is printed in the British Association
Report, 1876, and is well worthy of the most careful consideration.
He strongly urges more language and less grammar, more drawing
and less geometry ; or, as he himself expresses  it, more marching and
less drill.
   For the following details the author of this memoir        is  mainly
indebted to   a notice which appeared in     " Nature," from the pen of
Mr.J.   W. L. Glaisher :—
   Charles Watkins Merrifield was born at Brighton in 1827, and died
at Hove on January 1st, 1884, in his fifty-seventh year.     His educa
tion was, as he himself describes it  in the address already referred to,
mainly classical and legal. He was called to the bar; but had pre
viously accepted an appointment in the Education Department of
the Privy Council Office, from which he was promoted to the office of
Examiner. His first published paper was " On the Geometry of
the Elliptic Equation," in 1858, and was speedily followed by papers
on the calculation of elliptic functions, two of which were published
in the " Philosophical Transactions." In 1863 he was elected a Fellow
of the Royal Society.   His mathematical work related to the calcula
tions used in naval architecture, and he became a Member of the
Royal Institute of Naval Architects, and contributed    a  paper to their
 "               "
  Transactions    in   1865.
  In   1867 the  Royal School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engi
neering at South Kensington was established, and at the request of the
Government Mr. Merrifield accepted temporarily the office of Vice-
 Principal and on the unfortunate death of the first Principal, Mr.
          ;
Purkiss, Mr. Merrifield was appointed Principal.    This office he held
until, in 1873, the Institution was transferred to Greenwich, when he
resumed his office of Examiner in the Education Department.         His
connexion with the School of Naval Architects added greatly to his
previous interest in naval science. He published many papers on
this subject in the "Annual" of the school, and in the "Transac
      "
tions    of the Institute, of which he had become Honorary Secretary.

                                    iii
In   18G9   he drew  up for the British Association    report on the
                                                       a
stability, propulsion, and sea-going qualities of ships and although
                                                        ;
he retired from the post of Honorary Secretary of the Institute in
1875, when his services were recognised by a handsome testimonial,
he continued regularly to attend the meetings.
  He Rerved on several important Royal Commissions, including one
on the unseaworthiness of ships, of which the Duke of Edinburgh
was President and during the last few years of his life he frequently
               ;
sat as scientific assessor to Mr. Rothery in the Wreck Commissioner's
Court.
   He was at one time President of the London Mathematical Society,
of which he was for a long time a member.
   The Catalogue of Scientific Papers contains twenty-eight titles
under which Mr. Merrifield had published papers between the years
1858 and 1873.     He edited many of the text-books of science pub
lished by Messrs. Longman, and himself wrote a successful treatise on
arithmetic and mensuration in that series. For many years, until
prevented by ill health, he conducted unofficially the mathematical
part of the May Examinations of the Science and Art Department.
He was also, from its foundation, a very active and leading member
of the Association for Improvement of Geometrical Teaching.
   Mr. Merrifield possessed great literary attainments, being thoroughly
well versed in Latin, Greek, French, and Italian.         Appended to  a
translation of his article on Deep Sea Waves, published in the
" Rivista Maritima,"   is  a foot-note, which, after bearing testimony
to the author's extensive knowledge and excellence of style, expresses
the satisfaction of the editor at his adding to those qualifications that
of " writing correctly our language."
   In April, 1882, when in the midst of his work, he was struck by
apoplexy.     From this he partially recovered;   but he suffered another
attack on the 18th October, 1883, which resulted in his death.
