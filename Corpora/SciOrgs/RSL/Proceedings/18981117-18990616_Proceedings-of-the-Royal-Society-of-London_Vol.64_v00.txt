 ''
    Report on the Expedition to Sahdol, Rewak State, Central
        India, to observe the Total Solar Eclipse of 1898, Janu
        ary 22."         By W. H. M. Christie, C.B., M.A., F.R.S.,
        Astronomer Royal, and Professor H. H. Turner, M.A.,
        F.R.S.        Received May 25, 1898.
     The Report is presented in three parts.
    Part    I is a joint Report by the two observers.
    Part    II  is a separate Report by the Astronomer Royal ; and
    Part    III  is a separate Report by Professor Tnrner.
                                     Paet I.
     1.  This expedition    was organised by the Joint Permanent Eclipse
 Committee        of the Royal Society and Royal Astronomical Society,
 funds being provided from         a grant made by the Government Grant
 Committee.
    The Government of India made excellent arrangements for the
 party, and the Surveyor- General of India with the staff of his De
partment rendered great service in selecting a site, clearing the
jungle, establishing a camp, erecting the instruments, and in giving
every assistance in the observations, for all of which the observers
 desire to tender their thanks.
    The observers are also indebted to the Great Indian Peninsular
Railway, the Bengal and Nagpur Railway, and the East Indian
Railway for great liberality in granting facilities and in making
special arrangements for the safe conveyance of their instruments
from Bombay to Sahdol.
    2. Personnel. — The following persons took part in the expedition : —
    W. H. M. Christie, M.A., F.R.S., Astronomer Royal.
    H. H. Turner, M.A., F.R.S., Savilian Professor of      Astronomy at
        Oxford.
    Harold A. H. Christie, who gave the exposures throughout          the
        eclipse for the Astronomer Royal.
    VOL. LXIV.                                                   B

2           Mr. W. H. M. Christie and Prof. H. H. Tumor.
    It -was originally proposed that Dr. A. A. Common, F.R.S., should
also take    part in this expedition, but lie ultimately found that he
was unable to do so, and Dr. Copeland, Astronomer Royal for Scot
land, was invited by the J.P.E. Committee to go in his place.      Dr.
¦Copeland preferred, however, not to join any of the three other
expeditions, but to establish himself independently.
    3. Itinerary. —The observers left Marseilles in the Peninsular and
Oriental steamship "Ballaarat" (R.M.S.), on Thursday morning,
December 16, 1897, their instruments having been put on board
this vessel in London ten days earlier. They arrived at Bombay on
Monday morning, January 3, 1898, the weather during the voyage
being excellent. After a few days spent in landing the instruments
and arranging for their journey to Sahdol, they left Bombay on
Friday evening, January 7, travelling direct to Sahdol by special
arrangements courteously made by the G.I. P.. East Indian, and
Bengal and Nagpur Railways, and arrived at Sahdol in the early
morning of Sunday, January 9.
    4. Selection of a Station. — The J.P.E. Committee originally pro
posed for this expedition a station south of Poona, either near Karad
on the S. Maratha Railway or near Jeur on the G.I. P. Railway,
¦other expeditions occupying stations near Viziadrug on the coast,
and Pulgaon on the Nagpur branch of the G.I. P. Railway.
    The Surveyor-General       of India having offered to give every
assistance to the expeditions, appointed Major Burrard, R.E., to
make all necessary arrangements, including the determination of
exact local time and of the longitude and latitude of the station.
 Major Burrard selected Karad, in the Satara district, as the best
station.     Owing, however, to the outbreak of plague at that place,
and its prevalence in the Bombay Presidency, it was finally decided,
 on the advice of the Bombay Government, to abandon this choice
and to occupy a station at Sahdol, on the railway to the east of
 Pulgaon, connecting Katni and Bilaspur. As this site was in dense
 jungle, it was necessary to clear a considerable space for the camp,
 part of which was to be occupied by a party under Mr. Michie
 Smith, Government Astronomer at Madras. ¦ This clearing, the
 establishment of the camp, and the erection of piers and huts for
  the instruments and of a dark room for photography, were all
 admirably carried out by Major Burrard, R.E., and his assistant,
  Lieutenant Crosthwait, R.E., before the arrival of the observers,
  who thus found everything ready for the setting np of their instru
  ments.
     5. Position of Station. — The observing station was about three-
  quarters of a mile from the railway station, on the south side of
  the line. The position of the centre of the pier on which the
 coelostat used by the Astronomer Royal was mounted is —

             Report on tlie Solar Eclipse Expedition to Sahdol.              3
          Longitude 81° 21' 33" E. = 5h 25m 26"2 E.
         Latitude 23° 16' 453".
         Height above mean sea level 1502'4 feet.
This position was determined after the eclipse by Major Burrard,
R.E., by accurate triangulation, connecting the site with the prin
cipal triangulation of the Survey of India.
    Professor Turner's ccelostat was 20 feet due east of this, and
the transit instrument (used by Major Burrard iu his time deter
minations) 240 feet due north of it.
    This spot is 4 miles towards the south-east from the central line
                                            '
as shown in the ' Nautical Almanac            and ' American Ephemeris,'
                                                '
3^ miles from the line as shown in the Connaissance des Temps,'
and 2 miles from the line as shown in the ' Berliner Jahrbucb.'             It
may    be  remarked   that the data for predicting   the  four contacts given
in the ' Nautical Almanac Circular No. 16 ' were found insufficient,
the nearest points for which approximate formulae were given being
in longitude 79° (Nagpur) at a considerable distance from the
central line, and in longitude 83° (south of* Benares), too far away
 to give accurate predictions.        [See Professor Turner's separate
 Report.]
    6. The Camp.    — The general arrangements of        the camp (see next
 page),   which consisted of more than fifty       tents and huts, were, as
 already mentioned, admirably carried out by Major Burrard, R.E., it
 being necessary to clear a considerable space (about 700 by 300 yards)
 in the jungle by burning and felling trees, in order to set up the nume
 rous tents    of the living camp at some distance from the observing
 huts.    On part of this clearing the Government Astronomer at Madras
 (Mr. Michie Smith) and his assistants erected their camp and instru
 ments, and Major Burrard rendered considerable assistance to this
 party.     There were also several tents for occupation by distinguished
 officers of the Survey, and we had the pleasure of seeing at the camp
 on the day of the eclipse the Surveyor- General (General Strahan,
 R.E.), General Woodthorpe, R.E., Colonel Sir T. Holditch, R.E., and
  other officers, and for a few days preceding the eclipse Colonel
  Gore, R.E., who left us for the Pulgaon Camp on January 19.
     7. Meteorological Conditions. — Prom valuable information collected
 by Mr. Eliot, Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India,
 it appeared that the chances of fine weather were practically the
 same all along the line of totality, there being very little risk of cloud,
 though some chance of dust interfering with the definition. The
  thickly wooded country round Sahdol seemed well adapted for pro
  tection from the danger of dust, and during the days near the
  eclipse the ground near the instruments was covered with straw and
  watered in the morning to prevent excessive heating of the air in the
                                                                    n 2

path of the rays from the sun to the ccelostats, which were placed at
a height of only 2 feet 8 inches from the ground.
   The character of the weather was practically uniform during our
stay at Sahdol.      At night the minimum temperature was about 32°
up to January     20, afterwards a little warmer (not falling below 39°,
on January 23 and 24). At about 7.30 a.m., soon after sunrise, the
temperature began to rise rapidly, attaining a maximum of about
80° at about 2 p.m., and remaining near this point from noon till
about 4.30 p.m., when a fall nearly as sudden as the rise began.               The
air  was  nearly  saturated   with   moisture      at  night  and very  dry in  the
daytime. There was heavy          hoar     frost  at night.
   These    conditions   seriously limited       the   time available for photo
graphy, which could only be carried on conveniently during the hot
part of the day, say from 10 a.m. to 6 or 7 P.M., as there was no ready
means of warming the water in the dark room.
   The first clouds seen since the party landed in India were light
fleecy clouds in the evening of Wednesday, January 19, and more
appeared in the early mornings of January 20 and January 21, dis
persing in each case between 10 and 11 a.m. The day of the eclipse
was perfectly cloudless throughout, and the definition good.

keeper took up the counting,
                                  " one, two, three," &c. By having two
timekeepers, opportunity was given to both to see the eclipse.
   The operations were rehearsed on every day of the week preceding
the eclipse, at the time of totality, and on two days also at dusk;
with lamps.
   A photographic hut with a supply of chemicals was supplied from
the Calcutta office of the Surveyor- General's Department, and Mr.
George, of that department, was told off to assist in the photographic
work.      He developed some of the photographs taken by the
Astronomer Royal during the partial phases.
   11. The Day of the Eclipse. — Perfectly clear throughout.            The
morning was spent in final preparations.                The first contact
occurred at 0 hr. 13'3 mins. local mean time, and the Astronomer
Royal proceeded to take nine photographs of the partial phase,
the first being exposed at 0 hr. 14-6 mins., and the last at 1 hr.
22'2 mins.        Totality commenced at 1 hr. 4T1 mins., and lasted
about 105 seconds, during which time the programmes detailed below
were successfully carried out.      Nine more partial phase photographs
were taken between 1 hr. 59-4 mins. and 2 hrs. 59-2 mins.               The
fourth contact was at 3 hrs. 1-6 mins. (see accurate times below).
   There was a good deal of light during totality, and lamps were
not in any way needed.          The temperature fell 45° between first
and second contacts, and another 3-5° between second contact and
2 hrs.     It had practically returned to its normal value by the fourth
contact (see accurate readings below). But the fall of temperature
did not nearly represent the sensation of chill. At 1.15, when the
air; felt distinctly chilly, the temperature had only fallen 2°.
   There was no appreciable " shadow

                                                          totality, nor was
any   such   effect noticed by two  observers   (General Woodthorpe, R.E.,
and Colonel Sir T. Holditch, R.E.) from the top of a hill a few
miles away, close to the central line. These observers did, however,
                                              "
notice the well known " shadow bands on the table they had pre
pared for sketching, without having previously heard of these bands
in any way.
   We had not many opportunities of observing the behaviour of
animals. Kites which had been circling round the camp flew off to
the surrounding trees some minutes before totality, and about the
same time we heard cries from the village of Sahdol.         We were told
by another observer (Professor E. G. Hill, of Allahabad) that at
Bnxar he had noticed a herd of goats get into line and march home
wards ; that two mongooses in a hole in a bank had seemed very
much frightened ; that squirrels were silent during totality, and that
a kingfisher began catching fish.

      Part II. — Separate Refort          by   Mr. W. H. M. Christie.
   The programme of observation was composed of two distinct parts —
(1) Photographs of the corona on a large scale during totality; (2)
photographs of the partial phase before and after totality for
determination of the position of the moon relatively to the sun.
   The instrument used in both cases was the photographic telescope-
by Grubb, with object-glass of 9 inches aperture and 8 ft. 6 in. focal
length (presented to the Royal Observatory by Sir Henry Thompson),,
to which a concave compound lens by Dallmeyer, of 3 inches diameter
and 12 inches focus, had been fitted as a secondary magnifier, placed
a short distance within the focus.          This combination gave an image-
of the sun 4 inches in diameter, and afield (for full pencils) of nearly
10 inches diameter, so that the corona to a distance of one and a half
radii from the Sun's limb would be included in the field. A ccelostat,
specially designed by Dr. Common, carrying a plane silver-on-glass
mirror of 16 inches diameter, made by him, was employed to reflect
the rays into the Thompson coronagraph, which was firmly mounted
on two brick piers, so as to point to the mirror at an angle of
depression of about 10°, and to be placed in an azimuth of about
17° north of west for the day of the eclipse.                   The camera was.
furnished with eight plateholders, taking 12 X 10 in. plates, seven
being reserved for use during totality, and the eighth fitted with a
Thornton-Pickard instantaneous focal-plane shutter, to take photo
graphs on 8^ X 6£ in. plates during the partial phases, for determination
of the moon's position.
   The seven slides for photographs of the corona during totality
were exposed as below, the exposures being given with a screen held

in front of the object-glass by my son Harold, and the times, reckoned
from the commencement of totality (2nd contact), being recorded
by Mr. McA'Fee, of the Indian Snrvey Department.
   It had been intended to nse Hill-Norris dry collodion " Gazelle "
plates for three of the slides (the fineness of grain as compared with
gelatine plates giving them a marked advantage), but from trials
made before the eclipse it was found that these plates were for some
reason untrustworthy.       I, however, thought it well to expose one of
these plates, but the result is not satisfactory.
   The sky was cloudless during the eclipse, and the programme was
carried out without a hitch, with the aid of two native assistants of
the Survey Department (Mr. V. B. Garnd and Mr. V. Narayen), who
respectively handed me the slides and received them from me, and
there was fifteen seconds to spare before the end of totality, the
duration at Sahdol being 1 min. 45J sees, as observed.
   For the partial phase, nine photographs were taken between first
and second contacts, and eight between third and fourth contacts, as
well as a photograph for orientation (with double exposure)
immediately before and after the eclipse. The aperture of the object-
glass was reduced to 3 inches for these photographs, as it was
found by trials before the eclipse that with the aperture thus reduced
the exposure given by the Thornton-Pickard shutter set to its highest
speed was satisfactory for the slow plates used (Thomas's lantern
plates). The times of exposure were recorded on a chronograph, a
key being pressed by me in the left hand at the same instant as the
exposure was given by pressing a pneumatic ball in the right hand.
The times of the fall of the shutter were also independently recorded
by Mr. McA'Fee with a chronometer carefully compared with the
transit-clock.   All the arrangements for accurate local time, which
was of   vital importance for this part of the programme, and for
determination of the longitude of the station by connection with the
principal triangulation of the Survey of India, were most ably carried
out by Major Burrard, R.E., and Lieut. Crostbwait, R.E. The
position of my instrument, as found by them after the eclipse, was
 Long. 81° 21' 33"= 5h 25m 2G-2 E., Lat. 23° 16' 45'3" N. Altitude
 above sea-level  1502-4 feet.
    The coronagraph was carefully focussed before the eclipse by use
 of the method described in the Report of the Eclipse Expedition to
Japan, 1896,* the image of an object (gauze net in the plane of the
 plate), being photographed by reflection normally from the plane
 mirror of the ccelostat.    A special spare back for the plateholder was
prepared    with a  hole  covered  with gauze net just above the centre,
and one of the 12 x 10 in. plates being cut in two, one half was placed
in the lower half of the plateholder and the reflected image photo-

  graphed on    it at different parts of the field, the source of light being
  a paraffin lantern.     The adjustment to focus was made by moving the
 secondary magnifier, rings of paper placed between flanges on the
 adapter carrying the magnifier and its mounting giving the means of
 doing this with great nicety- By this method, in which the error
 from imperfect focus is doubled by the double passage of the rays
 through the telescope, it was found that a displacement of the
 magnifier through the thickness of a sheet of paper (0'005 inch),
 representing l/20,000th part of the focal length, made a sensible
 difference.'   The focus was thus obtained with great accuracy, as is
 evidenced by the sharpness of the image on the photographs taken
 during the partial phase.
    The photographs with exposures of 8 sees., 10 sees., and 20 sees.
 all show coronal structure up to the edge of the plate, the streamer
 in the S.W. being particularly bright.           A hurried eye estimation
 made by me during the 20 seconds' exposure gave the extreme
 extension of this streamer as about two-thirds of the distance of
 Venus from the Sun's centre, or about 3|° from the limb. The field
 being necessarily limited by the diameter of the concave enlarging
 lens (3 in.), it would be desirable to have one made of larger diameter
 for future eclipses so as to allow of the use of larger plates.
    A comparison of the whole series of photographs indicates a close
 correspondence between the coronal streamers and the prominences
 visible, this correspondence being particularly striking in the case
 of three prominences in the N.W. quadrant from which three coronal
 rays rise, arching over at a distance of about 7' from the limb and
 uniting to form one component of the striking long double ray in
that quadrant.       Other prominences on the Sun's limb appear also to
be associated with extensions of the corona.         The form of the corona
bore a closer general resemblance          to those of 1886 and 1896 as
photographed than would have been expected considering that the
date of the eclipse was so much nearer the epoch of minimum sun-
spots, and in this connection it may be noted that there were three
important groups of spots on the Sun about the time of the eclipse,
and that a series of magnetic disturbances of moderate amount were
recorded at Greenwich just prior to the eclipse, from January 15 to 21
continuously, indicating an unusual state of magnetic activity in
close correspondence with the solar activity as evidenced by the
Sun spots.

            Part   III. — Separate      Report by Professor Turner.
                              Instrumental Equipment.
    1. The    Camera.   — The double camera used in the Fundium Expe
dition of 1893 by Sergeant Kearney, and taken out to Japan in 1896
without result. The tube is of wood, 6 feet long and 14 X 7 inches
in section, divided by a partition into two tubes of 7 X 7 inches
section.      In one of these is placed the " Abney "* lens of 4- inch
aperture aud 62-inch focal length, giving an image of the sun
0-57 inch in diameter ; in the other the photoheliograph objective
No. 2 (used in Transit of Venus expeditions), of 4-inch aperture and
5-feet focal length, with a Dallmeyer secondary magnifier of 7^ inches
focus placed 5 inches within the focus, and giving an image of the
sun 1£ inches in diameter ; the camera furnished with six plate-
holders, each taking two plates of 160 X 160 mm. (as in use for the
Astrographic Chart), both plates being exposed by a quarter-turn of
one shutter.
    2. The Ccelostat. — The camera was pointed to a 16-inch ccelostat.
the mirror of which was made by Dr. Common, the mounting and
clock by Mr. J. Hammersley from designs by Dr. Common.
    3. The Polariscope. — On the tube,              and pointing to the same
ccelostat, was a polariscopic apparatus consisting of an ordinary slit
spectroscope (and telescope), with an Iceland spar double image
rhomb substituted for the ordinary prisms. The instrument in its
normal state had been used by Mr. Maunder in the 1886 eclipse
expedition for photographing the spectrum of the corona.                       It is
fitted with two plate-holders.           The dimensions are as follow :       —
        Objective            3| inches aperture, 18 inches focal length.

     The use of the apparatus will be understood from the analogy of
the ordinary spectroscope, regarding the Iceland spar rhomb as a
prism giving only two colours — the two kinds of polarised light.
We can thus use a wide slit, opening it until the two images of the
slit are just in contact without overlap. This was found to happen
with the apparatus in use with a slit of width 0-19 inch. The
    * One-lmlf of a doublet photographic lens by Dallmeyer, belonging to Captain
Abney, used in the Eclipse Expeditions of 1886, 1887, 1889, 1893, and 1896,
 acquired from him by the Boyal Astronomical Society in 1893 for permanent use
 in eclipse expeditions, in consideration of their replacement by two others.

  diameter of the sun's image thrown on the slit being 0-21 inch, it was
  thought best to take the two photographs, so as to include opposite
  limbs of the eclipsed sun, and as much of the corona as could bo
  got.    The   change   from one portion of the sun to another was
  arranged by having two slits as follows : —
      The two slits were cut in a piece of blackened card, the actual
   size of which is shown in the diagram.                If the line ABCD had
   been diametral to. the sun's or moon's image, half the moon and
   corona would in the first instance have appeared in the middle of the
   lower slit, CD. In this position the first exposure was given, pro
   ducing on the plate two images side by side of the right limb of the
   eclipsed sun, one image being due to light polarised in a plane
  parallel to CD, and the other to light polarised in the perpendicular
  plane. For the next exposure the card was slipped down in the
  groove in which it fitted lightly, and the left limb of the eclipsed sun
  fell on the middle of the slit AB ; and sojtwo images of the rest of
  the corona would be obtained. By combining the two photographs,
  we conld get a double picture of a slice of the corona 1*0 inch long
  and 0'40 inch wide, containing the moon centrally ; or, translating
  inches into diameters of the moon's image, five diameters long and
  two diameters wide.        As a matter of fact, the image of the sun was
   not adjusted centrally on the line ABCD, and a good deal more of
   the moon's disc appeared on one photograph than on the other, this
   being deliberately arranged for a special reason, which will appear
   in discussing the photographs obtained.
                            Instrumental Adjustments.
      5. Adjustment of Coelostat. — The adjustment of the polar axis was
   made as described in the Report on the Japan Expedition* by means
   of the attached declination theodolites.

   It will   be seen that the introduction          of the wooden block as a
partial support to the ccelostat disturbed the adjustments slightly,
but it did not seem advisable to attempt to correct these small errors,
which would have been a troublesome process with the stress of the
wooden block to consider.            The block certainly deadened the vibra

rotation the image will not be quite stationary.*               Both instruments
were tested for this error by reversing the mirror and cell in the T's
and noting the consequent displacement of the sun's image on the
ground glass in the focal plane of the telescopes.             The displacement,

  giving   double the inclination of mirror to axis, was found by C. on
  January 19 to be 72' ; and was corrected after several trials to be
  OS', denoting an error of 0'4'.         The correction was made by screwing
  a short screw,      made for the purpose, into one of the holes at the
  back of the mirror cell.
                                  [There are three of these holes, into which
  long  screws    are   screwed    in the operation of inserting the mirror
  into its cell.]   T.'s mirror was examined on the same day, and being
  fonnd to be sensibly parallel to the axis, no correction was necessary.
     7. Focussing
                      of Telescopes.
                                         — The method adopted was that
  described   in the Report on the Japan Expedition.* The telescope
 was pointed normally to the mirror, and the image of a bright point
 or object in the plane of the film was photographed on the film.
    A glass plate being cut in two, one half was blackened with
             and the word " astronomy

 with a needle point.         This was the object photographed in the follow
 ing experiments.         Gauges had been made in England by means of
which the three lenses (the Abney lens, the photoheliograph lens,
and the Dallmeyer           enlarging lens) could be set very accurately to
positions in the wooden tube giving good focus.                           Positions at
definite distances from these could be obtained by unscrewing the
object glasses through fractions of a turn.                    If positions were re
quired within the gauge position, the object glass was first pushed in
slightly ; and then it was noted what fraction of a turn it must be
unscrewed to bring it to the gauge-position.                Designating the gauge-
position by zero, and one turn out by +T0, one turn inside by — TO.
the following positions were tried : —

same    plate, 0-0 the best.
    Plates 2 — 5 were devoted to experiments on illuminants.                   A candle
was found most convenient after all.

of these.

Both 00 exposures were worse than the others.
  Of the others 025 was perhaps best near the centre, and 0'5 (or
0-75?) further from centre.
  Hence 0-5 was adopted, i.e., the object glass was screwed one-half
turn out.  The screw has 12 turns to the inch; and the focussing
was thus correct to 0'02 inch, as far as could be judged.

  This contradicts nothing but plate    on which the exposures may

adopted.

    This clock was in a grass hut and subjected to a daily variation of

    10. Remarks on Formulae           for Prediction of Contacts. — As was men
tioned in paragraph 5 of the joint report of the Astronomer Royal
and Professor Turner, the data for predicting the four contacts were
found insufficient.         This will be seen by comparison of the last two
columns, wherein the times as given by the published formulae most
nearly snitable for Sahdol are given. On application to the Super
intendent of the 'Nautical Almanae,' he kindly supplied the data for
the third column, giving the G.M.T.s of the four contacts, to which
the longitude of Sahdol has been applied.
     [The position of Sahdol is

As his letter contains           a   suggestion which may be useful to other
observers,       I reproduce it here.

         'N.A. Circular No. 16 ' and others) in appendix to N.A. 1836, p. 117.
         These equations will give sensible accuracy for a distance of about
         50 miles from the point for which they are computed.     In this case
         the distance is about 150 miles.
         I find that the most expeditious way of getting accurate results

     in this work, is to use the Besselian Elements (page 4 of circular
     No. 16). You can infer the time of middle of eclipse to the nearest
     minute from tbe Table on p. 3 of circular, and then 10 minutes
     work gives you the times of beginning and ending of totality with
     sensible accuracy.

     contacts (partial phase) special computations for the approximate

            Report on  the Solar Eclipse Expedition to Salulol.         17
 we see   that w is constant when the arc PP„ is constant, i.e., along the
 arc of a small circle described with centre P and radins PP0.
    The bounding lines of the totality belt given us by the approxi
 mate formulae of the 'Nautical Almanac Circular,' are thus portions of
 small circles of the sphere.
    Now, suppose we have formulae given for the neighbourhoods of
 two  points B and 6 on the central line ; for which P0 and p0 are the
 centres of the approximate loci of equal totality.    Then the approxi
 mate formulae for B will give us as the northern boundary of the
 totality zone the circular arc AD, touching the true line at A, but
 falling south of it elsewhere ; and the approximate formulas for b
 will give us the arc ad. Thus at the intermediate point D, both
  formulae give errors in the same direction ; and unless the points
  B and b are tolerably close together we cannot get a good prediction
  for intermediate points by simple interpolation.
    The true lines Aa, B6, Cc, are the envelopes of such circles as AD,
 BE, CF, as we travel along the central line, P„ travelling along the
 path P„p0 in correspondence.
    It is to be noted further,    that the approximate form ala> give a
 constant duration of totality along the line BE, which is the approxi
  mate central line (given by sin u> = 1) : whereas the duration gener
 ally changes as we go east or west.          But interpolation between
  results for B and b would probably give the means of allowing for
 this cb/.nge.
    If instead of the duration of totality, we take the time of one of
 the contacts, the approximate loci are no longer circles, but curves
 of the form
                    (a+6cosPP0)2 + (c-l-dcosPP1)2 = l,
ymd the geometry is less simple ; but these curves will have the true
 line for their envelope just as the circles did.
     Now, if the contact of the circles or the curves with their envelope
  is of the second order interpolation becomes possible, for the circles
  cross the envelope and thus the error introduced is -f to the east

and — to the west.      The test of this is to calculate the contacts
for b with the constants given for B, and compare with true values
for b ; similarly calculate the contacts for B with the constants
given for b and compare with the true values for B. If the errors are
of opposite signs, then the curve crosses the envelope, and the con
tact is of the second order.   A few experimental calculations of this
kind, with the data of NA. Circular, No. 16 ' seem to show, how
                         '
ever, that the contact is not generally of the second order, and the
approximations are thus subject to the disadvantages above indicated.

   The wet and dry bulb thermometers, and the barometer with its
attached thermometer, were read every half hour from 5 a. Jr. till
8 p.m. or later.    The maximum thermometer was read at 4 p.m., the
minimum at 10 a.m.
   On the day of the eclipse, observations were made of wet and dry
bulb and barometer, and also of the standard thermometer (Casella
No. 93,638) every five minutes.
   The barometer was very steady throughout our stay, near 28-6 in. ;
 and it seems scarcely necessary to publish the details.

    [The anomalous readings of dry bulb at 6 p.m. on January 21, and
of wet bulb at G p.m. on January 23, are apparently not mistakes,
unless the neighbouring observations are similarly affected.]
    We may thus take it that the typical curves of the diagram
represent with considerable accuracy what would have been the state
of things on January 22, if the eclipse had not taken place.
    Comparing then the readings during the eclipse with this curve,
we get the following differences, which may be regarded as the effect
of the eclipse.

" Total Solar Eclipse of January             22, 1898.  Preliminary Report
       on Observations made at Ghoglee. Central Provinces." By
       Professor Ralph Copelaxd, Astronomer Royal for Scot
      land. Received May 10, 1898.
   In  the month of August, 1897,       I   was invited  by the Joint Perma
nent Eclipse Committee to take part in observing the total solar
eclipse which occurred in India on 22nd January of the present
year.
   The preparation of the equipment, which will be described further
on, was at once proceeded with, and by the sanction of the Univer
sity authorities and the Secretary for Scotland I was granted the

22                            Prof. R. Copeland.
necessary leave of absence from the         University and the Royal Obser
vatory.
    Having shared      in the general disappointment of the Russian
eclipse   of 1887, and   the no less unfortunate visit to Vadso in 1896,    I
resolved on this occasion to occupy a separate station at some dis
tance from any large group of observers.             My only companion was
our observatory engineer (James McPherson), who on the two pre
vious occasions had shown his skill and energy in setting up and
handling the instruments.
    A grant of £180 was made to me by the Committee. This would
have been amply sufficient had        I dispensed with the services of Engi
neer McPherson, but without his aid 1 could not have carried out my
plan of occupying an independent station and using several instru
ments.
    Our equipment consisted       of —
    (1) A hoi'izontal telescope of 38 feet focus and 4 inches aperture
to be used with a fixed mirror, the image being received on 18-inch
plates moved by clockwork.          This instrument was provided with a
direct vision prism mounted on a slide in front of the object-glass.
which, when drawn into position by an attendant, transformed the
telescope into a prismatic camera.
    (2) A small prismatic camera designed for the investigation of
the ultra-violet rays of the solar appendages.               To this end the
object-glass   was  of quartz   and   Iceland  spar,  the  prism being of the
latter material.
    (3) A slit spectroscope by Grubb, with one componnd prism. (2)
and (3) were carried by a 4-inch equatorial mounting, and served to
balance each other.
    (4)  A 4-inch  camera    with a  doublet lens, by Dallmeyer, of 33-inch
focus, mounted on a 3-inch equatorial stand.              Both the equatorial
mountings were fitted with driving clocks.
    In place of a hut we were provided with a supply of laths, boards,
and brown paper, plain as well as waterproof and blackened, for
building the camera of the 40-foot, which had also to serve as a dark
room.     The hut built with these materials served the intended pur
pose satisfactorily.      It was ventilated by a tin chimney like that of
a magic lantern.
   The instruments were despatched on the 20th November, via
Leith and London, to Bombay. Engineer McPherson left Edinburgh
on the 2nd December to embark in London on board the P. and 0.
s.8.
      " Britannia," while I, leaving on the Sth, was able to catch the
same steamer at Brindisi on the 12th December. Bombay was
reached on the 26th December, and Nagpur, in the Central Pro
vinces, two days later.       Here we were most hospitably received by
Colonel Henry J. Lugard (Madras Staff Corps), and with his help

           Report on    the Solar Eclipse Expedition to Ghoalee.        23
and   that of his  son,  Mr. Edward Lugard, Executive Engineer, Bhun-
dara, a station was finally selected    on the last day of the year, close
to  the village of Ghoglee, 16 miles north-west of Nagpur, and about
2 statute miles south-east of the line of central eclipse.        On New
Year's Day I observed the sun for latitude, time and azimuth, and on
the 2nd January we began our camp life, having lived meanwhile at
Kalmeshwar, in a bungalow belonging to the Department of Works,
three miles distant, on the way to Nagpur.           We found the large
double tent provided by the Government most comfortable. It was
pitched beside a grove of mango trees, under which was a large
well with a plentiful supply of water. On the 4th January concrete
foundations -were begun for the fixed mirror and lens, for the plate-
carrier of the long-focus telescope, and for each of the two equa-
torials.    The latter were placed in line with the dark room of the
horizontal tube, so as to bring the observers within earshot of the
metronome which was used to regulate the lengths of the exposures.
 It is needless to give particulars respecting the adjustments of the
 equatorials, which were considered sufficiently accurate when within
 two minutes of arc of the truth.
    The method pursued with the horizontal telescope was as follows : —
With the theodolite placed on the proposed centre line of the tube,
the azimuth of a distant tree was found from observations of the
 sun, and also of the pole star. Two sets of footholes for the theodo
 lite were made in blocks of cement at different levels, but referred
 to a common centre. By this means the theodolite could be used
 either as a collimator looking through the lens of the long telescope,
 or as a directing telescope to bring the tube, lens, and plateholder
 exactly into the required line. The fixed mirror was roughly
 adjusted as regards azimuth with the theodolite and a reflecting eye
 piece, and as to inclination by means of a gauge and spirit level.
 The final adjustment was given by slightly turning the slow motion
 screws of the mirror until the sun's image ran along a parallel of
 declination drawn on the cover of the plate-holder, and also crossed
 one or other of a set of vertical lines at a given computed time.    The
 tube being set exactly horizontal, the plate-holder was        "
                                                                  squared
     "
 on by viewing the image of the object glass in a mirror held
 against the plate-holder in reversed positions.         The long-focus
 object glass was "squared on" with the help of one of the little
 centering telescopes originally designed by Fraunhof er. The inclina
 tion of the slide on which the plate-holder ran was found from the
 computed altitude and azimuth of the sun's centre two minutes
 before and two minutes after mid-totality.      The same data also gave
  the speed at which the plate had to move— in our case 1'872 inch per
  minute.    No provision was made to counteract the very slight effect
  of the rotation of the sun's image during the period of exposure. Tho

sliding frame was drawn forward by a wire cord and weight, the rate
of motion being regulated by the speed at which the driving clock
"             "
   payed out the cord. A tendency to advance by jerks was alto
gether removed by thoroughly strengthening the clock seat-board
and its attachment to the fixed frame.         The clock, kindly lent by
Lord McLaren, was made by Sir Howard Grubb. We utilised the
slide motion to obtain a chronographic record of the exposures.
Three pencils, in holders hinged to the standing part and moved
by strings, marked the time on a slip of paper pasted on the back of
the moveable frame.
    The distance of the plate-holder from the cell of the lens had
been found in Edinburgh to be 455-27 inches.           This interval was
set off in India with light wooden rods, which were compared with
a Chesterman steel foot-rule.      The photographic focus of the Dall-
meyer    4-inch  had  been found  to agree exactly with the visual focus.
The instrument was focussed in India with the help of a focussing
glass, both in the day-time on an object at a distance of 440 yards,
and on stars at night, in the former case making allowance for the
divergence of the rays by means of the well-known formula for
conjugate foci. The two results were practically identical, but
differed considerably from the scale reading used at home, owing to
the shrinking of the wooden tube, in which the grain runs crosswise.
The tube of the Iceland spar camera, being made of well-seasoned
teak, was found unchanged in length, as proved by the linear
spectra of Sirius and 7 Argfts.
    The greatest difficulty was experienced in filling the plate-holders
of the long-focus telescope.     It was only after many hours spent in
paring and rasping the twisted frames that the plates were adjusted
and ready for exposure.      Two plates were broken in the process.
    Our programme was as follows : — Eight plates, 18 inches square,
to be exposed by Engineer McPherson standing in the dark room,
where he had control of the cord for opening the spring shutter,
were provided for the horizontal telescope, each carried in a separate
holder. The prism was to be pulled into position by our native
butler, Vardhya, at a signal from McPherson.
    Mr. Meehan, Assistant Engineer of the Public Works Department,
had kindly volunteered to work the Dallmeyer camera.         He was pro
vided with nine quarter plates, mounted in three long slides.         The
shutter   was  of the ordinary pneumatic   kind.
    I took charge of the ultra-violet prismatic camera, with six plates
in three reversible holders. I had also one plate (Cadett) in the
Grubb spectroscope, which was to be exposed by simply drawing
back the slide.     Cadett plates were used for the horizontal telescope
and the 4-inch, while partly Lumiere and partly Cadett plates were
to be tried in the prismatic camera.

    Mr. Meehan     came    in good time on the morning of the 22nd in
order to have a final opportunity of practising the management of
the 4-inch.     Everything being prepared to the best of our ability, I
anxiously watched with the finder of the prismatic camera for the
first contact.    The first indentation in the sun's limb was not per
ceived until 11 sees. after the computed time, but as the telescope only
magnified thirteen times, and there was a chance that the prediction
 might be slightly wrong, this agreement was considered satisfactory.
 Ten minutes before the beginning of totality the observers took
their assigned stations, and a little later the metronome was set going
2 mins. 14'6 sees. before the computed total phase, McPherson saw
the following edge of the diminishing sun's image exactly on the line
which had been previously marked on the sliding frame. 20 sees.
later he started the clock in accordance with a signal given by me,
and after about a quarter of a minute had elapsed each observer
made a mark on the chronograph slip in response to the measured
" one, two, three," called out
                                    by me in time with the beats cf the
chronometer.      From this moment, which was 40'8 sees. before the
computed disappearance of the sun, I watched the shortening liue of
light with the finder. It seemed a long time in disappearing, but
 the sunshade was so dark that       I  felt sure that nothing but the photo
 sphere  could   be  seen through it.       I therefore refrained from giving
any signal until the last trace of light had disappeared.              I then
called out  "  totality," as previously arranged, and had the satisfaction
 of hearing the shutter of the 38-foot (which made a rather loud
 noise) closing at the end of McPherson's first exposure.
    The whole of the eight plates were successfully exposed in tiie
 horizontal telescope.

    The five photographs of the corona are much disfigured by an
exhalation thrown off by the bass wood of which the plate-holders
 are made, which has caused the grain of the wood to print itself
 in broad streaks on the pictures. By combining the various nega
 tives in one drawing, however, there is reason to believe that the
 details of the brighter parts of the corona can be satisfactorily
  worked out.     Plates 3 and 4 show very distinct spectral images

of the prominences corresponding to a number of lines in the violet
region of the spectrum. On the last plate, which was exposed very
shortly after the end of totality, there is a broad spectral band full
of bright and dark lines of varying intensities, corresponding to
irregularities in the sun's limb and the presence or absence of promi
nences.    Many of the bright lines run out into the cusps.            The
scale of this -photograph is such that      H  and   K  are  10 mm. apart.
By an oversight the prism was not used with Plates 1 and 2 as was
originally intended.
   Mr. Meehan also exposed the whole of the nine plates allotted to
him. Three of these show the coronal rays during totality.              The
fourth has the coronal streamers quite distinct, although the sun is
already reappearing with a trace of Baily's heads.          The fifth plate.
taken several seconds later, shows the solar crescent still further
disclosed, but with the whole of the moon's disc distinctly outlined
against the background of corona.       In the last plate there is nothing
to be made out beyond the over-exposed solar crescent; the remain
ing three plates are blank.          I am under great obligation          to
Mr. Meehan for his valuable assistance with this instrument, as well
as for help in other directions.
   In the small prismatic camera four plates proved to be as many as
I  could dispose of. The actual exposures attempted were 2'5 secs.t
4-7 sees., 19-6 sees., and 14-0 sees. respectively.   The resulting nega
tives show numerous rings and lines ranging from 1474 K to about
W.L. 3000. The lines are sharpest in the first plate, while the
1474 K ring comes out more fully in the second and fourth negatives.
The third plate is unfortunately blank.
    The plate in the integrating spectroscope, which was used without
a condensing lens, shows a spectrum of three strong bright lines
with a number of feebler ones between them. With an exposure of
about a minute, terminating just before the end of totality, the plate
is decidedly under-exposed.
   The makeshift chronograph, while working well for the other two
observers, failed to record Mr. Meehan's signals distinctly, owing
probably to the greater length of the cord required to reach his
telescope.
    On Wednesday, 26th    January, we broke up our camp at Ghoglee
and sailed from Bombay on the 29th, reaching Edinburgh on the
21st February.
   I wish here to record my indebtedness to all the officials and
private individuals, British and native, by whose kind aid the object
of the expedition was so much furthered and our visit to Central
India made so pleasant as well as scientifically interesting.

"
  Total Eclipse of        the Sun,      January     22,   1898.    Preliminary
      Account of the Observations made by the Eclipse Expedi
      tion and the Officers and Men of H.M.S. ' Melpomene,' at
      Viziadrug."       By Sir Norman Lockyer, K.C.B., F.R.S.
      Received March 28, 1898.
                           Locaf, Arrangements.
   After various inquiries which I had made respecting the suitability
of  Viziadrug for observations of the total eclipse, I informed the
Eclipse Committee that I was prepared to take charge of an expedi
tion  to that locality, and it -was agreed that the observations at this
station should be placed in my charge.
   The latitude and longitude of the part of the fort at Viziadrug
finally occupied were 16° 33' 26" N. and 73° 18' 58" E. respectively,
and the duration of totality was estimated at 127 seconds.
   In connection with the work at this station the Admiralty was
asked for a ship of war to convey the observers from Colombo to
Viziadrug, and to permit the use of the ship, if possible, as a base, to
enable me to repeat the observations attempted in Norway in 1896-
with the assistance of H.M.S. " Volage," which ship supplied twenty-
four assistants during the eclipse and fifty volunteers for general
observations.* As a result of the Royal Society's application,
H.M.S. "Melpomene," in command of Captain Chisholm Batten, R.N.r
was told off to join the expedition.
   The expedition, which left England on December 10, consisted of
Mr. A. Fowler, Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer, and myself, together with the
Marquis of Graham, who joined as a volunteer.                  Some little time
after reaching Viziadrug Professor Pedler, F.R.S. , joined the party
from Calcutta, and shortly before the eclipse Mr. John Eliot, Meteo
rological Reporter to the Government of India, joined from Simla.
On arrival at Colombo we found H.M.S. " Melpomene
                                                                      "
                                                                         waiting
there, and at once proceeded to the selected spot of observation —
Viziadrug.
   During the three days' voyage to our station a call for volunteers-
was made by Captain Batten, and 120 came forward.                  Lectures and
demonstrations were therefore at once commenced by Lieutenants
Blackett, Colbeck, and Dugmore, second engineer Mountfield, and
myself to the several parties of men who had undertaken to perform
special pieces of work.       Twenty-two separate groups of observers
were formed.      On our arrival at Viziadrug we were received very
kindly by Mr. Bomanji, the collector of Ratnagiri, and an Overseer
 of the Public Works Department, who was on the spot in charge of
                 * 'Phil. Trans.,' A, vol. 190 (1897), pp. 1—21.

some most excellent masons           and carpenters, picked men from Rnt-
nagiri    as we  later  ascertained,   and plenty of material for the con
struction of the necessary concrete bases and huts. It was important
to erect the huts as soon as possible, not only to shelter the instru
ments but the observers from the sun.              Several screens were made
which could be moved and placed in any required position ; these
were found to be invaluable while the instruments were being
erected.     A considerable number of coolies was also present to do
such work as carrying packing-cases, sawing wood, clearing the
camp, etc.
    In the fort was also      a police guard sent from        Ratnagiri.  The
camp was watched both by day and night so             effectively by them that
no damage to any instrument was reported.
    On the arrival of the " Melpomene
                                               "  at Viziadrug, Mr. Bomanji
came on board to report the arrangements which had been made for
the expedition by the Government of Iudia.            As these were not quite
completed,    it was   necessary   for  the first  few  days to return to the
ship every evening, but afterwards Mr. Fowler, Dr. Lockyer, and
 myself took up our quarters at the Dak bungalow inside the Fort,
close to the instruments.         Meals were provided at the Collector's
camp, which was also inside the Fort.
    A party was landed at the fort on the afternoon of our arrival to
inspect the site suggested by Mr. Bomanji, and it was at once evi
dent that it would satisfy all requirements, provided the fluctuations
of temperature of the great masses of masonry composing the fort
had no disturbing influence on the steadiness of the air. In order to
investigate this point a 3f-inch telescope was erected, and observa
 tions of the surrounding landscape, and, at dusk, of various stars,
 wero made, from which it appeared that the atmosphere was suffi
 ciently steady for the observations.
     Next morning the instruments were landed and the concrete bases
 for them were commenced.           The erection of the huts was also begun
 by the native workmen and continued without intermission.
     The instruments were set up as soon as their bases were ready,
 and by the end of a week all were practically in readiness for the
 eclipse.    Constant clear skies enabled all the adjustments to be made
 without difficulty.
     During the week preceding the eclipse the adjustments were fre
 quently tested, and a complete system of drills was established.
     As the number of volunteers was so large I pointed out to Captain
 Batten, who had volunteered to aid in a special branch of the work,
 the importance of his taking charge of the whole camp and giving
 all the necessary orders for conducting the operations during the
 general rehearsals, and the eclipse itself.          He eventually agreed to
  this, and the procedure    and  time  signals  were  arranged between us.

     The development of the photographic plates was commenced im
  mediately after the eclipse, and it was found that the results were on
  the whole very satisfactory.              No results, however, were obtained
  with the integrating spectroscope, and the kinematograph films taken
 by   Lord Graham were too badly fogged to serve any useful purpose.
     The dismantling of the instruments was commenced very soon
  after the eclipse, and the packing, together with the development
  and copying       of the negatives, kept the party fully occupied until the
  morning of January 25, when the expedition left Viziadrug.

32                       Sir  J. Norman Lockyer.
   Half of the negatives     and glass copies of the remainder were con
veyed to England in charge of Mr. Fowler, while the remaining half
of negatives and positives were sent home via Bombay.
   The general time signals were given by a bugler under Captain
Batten's orders. The chronometer was in charge of Lieutenant de
Wet, R.N.
   For the work of the prismatic cameras it was important to get a
signal as nearly as possible five seconds before the beginning of
totality, and, in order to eliminate the possible error of the chrono
meter, it was arranged to determine this by direct observations.
Two methods were adopted.         In one of them a boat was moored at a
distance of two miles from the camp, in the direction of approach of
the shadow, which would pass this point five seconds before totality.
This failed because of the indefinite boundary of the shadow.
   The other method was to determine when the visible remaining
crescent subtended an angle of 45° ; calculation showed that this
would occur at the desired interval from totality.         This method was
completely successful.
   The special signals during totality were given every ten seconds,
beginning at 127 — the assumed period of totality — by means of the
                                                         "    "
eclipse clock (which was started at the signal             go   by cutting a
thread thereby releasing the pendulum), by two timekeepers, one
during the first half, the other during the second half of totality.
   In the system adopted not only was the time left called out every
tenth second, but other signals were interpolated to guide the work
in the photographic huts. In order that there might be no mistake
about the calls, a spiral was drawn on the cleck-face and the seconds
left plainly marked at the points which the second hand would
occupy during its two revolutions.
   In consequence of the perfect drill acquired at the rehearsals the
operations went off during the eclipse with absolute steadiness. They
commenced about one and a half hours before totality, ending after
a like interval after totality.    Six volunteers were employed iti the
timekeeping,    including  three  with  lamps which were not wanted.
                    The Chief Instruments       employed.
                          The Prismatic    Cameras.
   In the two prismatic    cameras    no less than fifty-seven photographs
were   secured,    the exposures    varying from one to fifty seconds.
Such a result as this could only           be obtained by a minute sub
division of labour.     In the case of     each of these two instruments
six volunteers were employed, and          they were distributed     in the
following manner : —
   One observer with the finder, his       duty being to keep the image

in  the centre of the field of view which corresponded (by previous
adjustment) to the centre of the plate in the prismatic camera.
He had a timekeeper to record the times of contact.
   A third acted as timekeeper to record the exact moments at
which the exposures were begun and ended.
   A fourth volunteer, by means of a piece of cardboard, covered
and uncovered the front of the prism, from directions given by
Mr. Fowler and Dr. Lockyer respectively.
   In one case two, and in another three, men were required to hand
and receive the large dark slides before and after exposure, taking
them out or placing them back in bags made for this purpose.
                         Six-inch Prismatic Camera.
   This instrument,       the dispersion of which    had been     increased
this year by the addition of a second prism, was worked by
Mr. Fowler, with the assistance of Lieut. de Wet and five men.
Mr.   Fowler's programme was to begin taking a series of ten snap-shot
pictures five seconds before the commencement of totality, to obtain
a  record every second or thereabonts of the spectrum of the chromo
sphere. After this he exposed eight other plates to secure photo
 graphs of the coronal rings, the exposures being of various lengths.
 It was also arranged that at five seconds before the end of totality
 he should commence another series of ten snap-shots, exposing the
 last  of these some few seconds after totality.        On developing the
 plates it was found that everything had gone satisfactorily.           The
 large   plates containing   the ten  snap-shots give   the whole   story of
 the chromosphere during twelve seconds, the time to make the ten
 exposures, and in one of the negatives there are as many as a
 thousand lines (abont).
    The last set of ten exposures did not come out quite as expected,
 for the reason that the duration of totality was a few seconds shorter
 than had been provided for in the time table, so that only two of the
 exposures were made before the end of totality.            The very last
 erposnre, however, taking about nine seconds after totality, shows
 many bright lines.
                        Nine-inch Prismatic Camera.
    This instrument was in charge of Dr. W.       J. S. Lockyer, who was
 assisted by Lieut. Percival Jones, R.N.R., and six men.           This in
strument was also fed by a       siderostat, but the tube was not placed
 horizontally. It was intended with one of the prismatic cameras to
 so mount    the tube that the arcs fo lined on the photographic platu
 should be symmetrical about the direction of dispersion, and it was
 decided that the 9-inch camera should adopt this plan of mounting.

34                       Sir  J.  Norman Lockyer.
   The exact position of the tube to obtain this result was carefully
determined by calculation.        To facilitate the erection of the instru
ment at the station two wooden tops to carry the tube were pre
viously made and taken out.
   It is satisfactory to state that the photographs showed that the
experiment was very successful, the arcs coming out exactly as fore
casted.
   Although this instrument was capable of only giving about half
the dispersion of the 6-inch, the optical parts were better adapted
for recording the ultra-violet region of the spectrum.
   The programme adopted was similar to that of the 6-inch, there
being two large 'plates (16 X 6^) for recording a series of ten snap
shots at and near the times of second and third contacts and nine
smaller plates for exposure during totality.         All the exposures were
successfully   made,  but  the  lines  in the spectrum are not so distinct
owing to warping of the wooden tube by the heat and the consequent
disturbance of the focus.
   I  shall refer to the results obtained by the prismatic cameras later
in this preliminary report.
                          Integrating Spectroscope.
   This instrument consisted        of  a large collimator, two prisms of
60°, and a receiving camera.            It was entrusted to the care of
Lieut. G. C. Quayle, R.N., with two assistants.            The light which
fed this instrument was obtained from a ccelostat, and there was still
sufficient room for another instrument to be utilised, so the corona-
graph was set up in the same hut. Although three exposures were
made, no results were secured owing, it is feared, to an alteration of
the slit, which was found closed after the eclipse.
               Six-inch Equatorial witli Orating Spectroscope.
   This instrument consisted of a 6-inch lens mounted equatorially.
 The small grating employed contained 17,296 lines to the inch, and
in the focus of the eyepiece was placed a small photographic spec
trum of iron for comparison.
    Professor Pedler, who came to take charge of this instrument was
 assisted by Mr. Steele, R.N., gunner, and three other volunteers.
                           I
 Up to the present time have not received Professor Pedler's report
 of his observations, but      I   may say that among his observations
 reported at the time, he recorded the presence of arc lines of iron in
 the lower corona and the absence of the enhanced lines.

                              The Coronagraph.
    All  the more important instruments available for the expedition
being employed in the spectroscopic work         I  could only use a small
ODe for taking photographs of the corona, which were essential for
me in order to make comparisons with the chromosphere and coronal
rings we hoped to get in the prismatic cameras.             The instrument
employed, of 4|-inch aperture, was entrusted to Staff- Engineer A
Kerr, R.N., who was assisted by three volunteers.
    Five photographs were taken. These on development were found
to be exceedingly good, the long exposed           plate showing a great
amount of detail both in the polar rifts and in the streamers.
    There being still a small amount of available surface of the ccelo-
stat for other purposes, this was utilised for the 10 x 8 landscape
camera which was operated by Mr. Turner.              Two exposures were
made during totality, with very successful results.            The longest
exposure shows very well the general form of the corona and the
relative lengths of the extensions, the longest streamer being nearly
three lunar diameters.
                                    Discs.
    The discs, six in number, were put into position by Lieutenant G.
C. Quayle,      R.N., and Lieutenant C. E. B. Colbeck, R.N., being
ranged along the southern wall of the fort, close to the Eclipse Camp.
 The great altitude (53°) of the sun rendered the operation of setting
 them up somewhat difficult.         Their sizes varied from six to two
 inches, and they were so placed that they cut off 3, 5, and 7 minutes
 of arc round the dark moon.
     Each disc occupied the time of three men, so that in all eighteen
 volunteers were employed.       Of each party of three, one volunteer
 kept the eye end in adjustment up to the time of totality, another
 who was blindfolded ten minutes before totality acted as observer,
 and the third wrote down the remarks of the observer.
     A preliminary examination of the drawings shows that no equa
 torial extension was observed.
                      The 3|-iwc7i Equatorial  Telescope.
     This telescope was used by me to observe the exact time of second
  and  third contacts to give the signals " go " and " over " to the time
  keepers.     For the first fifty seconds of totality    I  employed this
  instrument myself to minutely observe the structure of the rifts and
  streamers.    In my absence it was used by Assistant Engineer H. H.
  Willmore for the examination of the structure of the corona.

                      Observations of Stars during Eclipse.
       This party of six volunteers was in charge of Lieutenant Henry
 Blackett, R.N. Each observer was supplied with a photograph of a
 small star chart of the region near the sun, prepared by Dr. Lockyer.
 This was afterwards supplemented by another on a larger scale pho
 tographed at the office of the Trigonometrical Branch of the Survey
 of India at Dehra.
      Two striking observations were made by most of the observere.
 First, more stars were seen just before the commencement of totality
 than during the actual period of totality ; that is, they were logged
 as disappearing just before the total eclipse phase commenced.             A
 similar observation was made by Admiral Don Ulloa in the eclipse of
 1778.*       Secondly : two observers noted on the chart a bright body,
 certainly not a star, midway between the planets Mars and Venus.
 It was seen only for a short time, and that before totality, being
 estimated as of the Second Magnitude.
                           Meteorological      Observations.
     Mr. Eliot, the Meteorological Reporter to the Government of
 India, brought with him several important instruments with a view
of making observations similar to those he had arranged along the
whole line of totality.          The report of his observations   I have not
yet received.        He was assisted by twelve volunteers.
                         Observations of Shadow Bands.
     Staff-Surgeon Nolan, .R.N. , observed these phenomena with the
help of two assistants.         Previous to the eclipse a large white table
cloth was spread      on a flat  piece of ground in front of two walls inter
secting at an angle of 115°, which were whitewashed.               The bands
were well seen before the second and after the third contact.           None
were seen during totality.           Their direction of travelling was before
totality towards the west (N. 88° W.), veering gradually round to
S. 60° W.         After totality they practically reversed their direction,
travelling N. 60° E.            They moved too quickly for their rate of
motion to be determined, but it was noted that their rate of motion
was not constant.
     They were estimated to be about ^ to 1^ inches in breadth,
but this also varied.            The interspaces were gauged at 4 to 6
inches     in breadth.
     Each observer noted, one minute after totality, ajlong intermittency
during which a large band, about 2 inches broad, passed by itself in
a most      striking manner.

   Considerable time must elapse before the complete discussion of
the   numerous photographs taken in the prismatic cameras can be
completed. I therefore give here only some general results which
can be gathered by a preliminary inspection of them.
   I first deal with the determination of the heights of the various
absorbing vapours so far as they can be gathered from the photo
graphs, which, of course, only record for us the brightest lower
portions of the different arcs, and not their complete extension.

some of the most typical lines: —

    A  very noticeable feature of the chromospheric spectra, which the
 photographs enable us to investigate at different elevations, is the
 difference in the behaviour of the gaseous and metallic lines.              In the
 spectrum taken very near the moment of second contact, representing
 that of the lower strata with the spectra of higher ones supei'posed,
the metallic arcs are relatively short and very bright, while in later
photographs, representing the spectra of successively higher strata
free from admixture with lower ones, the metallic arcs are rclatively
feeble.      This is also indicated in another way by the varying effects
 seen   over   the tops of lunar mountains and through indentations in
 the moon's limb.
    Some of the lines are seen to be relatively much brighter in the

38                          Sir  J.  Norman Lockyer.
upper strata than in the lower, such lines showing no notable increase
of brightness at the points where lower strata are revealed through
lunar valleys. Chief among these lines are those of hydrogen, helium,
and calcium (H and K), but there is an additional line at wave
length 4686-2 or thereabouts, which behaves in the same way.
    This line does not appear in Young's list of chromospheric 1ines,
and all attempts to trace it in known spectra have failed.                     A line
apparently     coincident      with   it,  however,       has   been  found   in  the
photographed spectrum of a tube containing helium, which is one of
a series of comparison spectra being taken with the 6-inch prismatic
camera to facilitate the reduction of the eclipse photographs.
   The only recognised impurity in the vacuum tube used is oxygen,
but besides the line to which reference has been made, there are a
few faint lines for which no origins can at present be assigned.
    It is worthy of remark that this line falls very near to the first line
of the principal series in the spectrum of hydrogen, recently calculated
by Rydberg to have a wave-length of 468788.*
   As in the case of the photographs taken with the prismatic cameras
in 1893 and 1896, the spectrum of the chromosphere in 1898 is very
different from the Fraunhofer spectrum, so that we have not to deal
with a mere reversal of the dark lines of ordinary sunlight into bright
ones.     (See fig. 1, next page.)
   Many very strong chromospheric lines, as the helium lines for
example, are not represented among the Fraunhofer                       lines, while
many     Fraunhofer   lines    are  absent  from    the  chromospheric spectrum.
                        2.   Tlie Spectrum of     the Corona.
    The    heights of the chief         coronal     rings    as   photographed    are
roughly as follows : —
      1474  K            60,000 miles     (in lower parts of inner corona).
      3987-4             20,000 miles.
      4231 -3             More than 10,000 miles.
    The coronal rings not only differ from the chromospheric ones in
 regard to the heights to which they extend above the photosphere,
 but also in appearance.
    The outlines of these rings are distinctly not connected with the
 configuration of the chromosphere and prominences.                  In photographs
 taken near the beginning and end of totality, the 1474 ring is
 brightest on the same side of the moon, although the chromosphere
 and prominences are first visible on one side and then on the other.
 None of the rings give any indications of increased brightness at the
 places occupied by prominences.              The green ring, corresponding to

1474 K, which is the brightest of the rings seen, can be traced
completely round the limb, and while in some parts it is very feeble,
in others it is bright enough to show the brightest projections of the
inner corona as photographed with short exposures with the
coronagraph.       The other rings at 3987 and 4231 can also be traced
completely    round  the limb, but they are fainter on the average and
of much more uniform intensity than 1474 K. This latter fact suggests
that the additional rings are produced by a substance which is not
the same as that to which 1474 K corresponds.
   It is interesting to note that the three rings photographed in 1898
were also the most conspicuous in the coronas of 1893 and 1896 as
determined by the use of prismatic cameras.        The following table
gives a comparison of the results obtained in the three eclipses, the
wave-lengths for 1898 of course being only provisional.

                       3. Results regarding             the Corona.
    I looked forward
                   to the corona this year with the greatest interest on
account of the high temperature of the sun as judged by the fact that
scarcely any iron lines have been recorded as most widened in the
spectrum of sun spots since the end of 1892 ; that     chemically, the  is,
maximum sun-spot conditions have been retained since 1893. Hence
I was not astonished to see several large spots on the sun on the days
preceding the eclipse.
    pointed out in 1878,
    1                        year of minimum, that the corona of that
                                    a
year was vastly different from that of 1871, a year of maximum not            ;
only was     very much dimmer, but its spectrum was continuous
             it                                                                   ;
there wero practically no bright lines, while long equatorial extensions
were seen.
  Normally we should have expected an approach to the 1878
conditions this year. But both the photographs and eye observations
show that the only minimum appearance noticeable was the exquisite
tracery near the sun's poles.

to which     Mr. Chree has recently called attention, follow suit with the
chemical      and eclipse observations, and it is important to note, as
Dr. Chree has informed me in a later communication, that there were
less violent disturbances on January 15 — 18 and February 11 — 16, so
that   there have been three disturbances      separated   roughly  by an
interval    of twenty-eight days.
                                 Conclusion.
   The extraordinary interest and the skill displayed by the officers
and men of H.M.S. "Volage" under Captain King Hall in 1896, and of
H.M.S. "
                         " under          Chisholm Batten in the
             Melpomene            Captain                          present
jear, prove beyond all question that in eclipses in which a man-of-
war can be employed the most effective and the most economical
means of securing observations is to depend upon the naval personnel,
one or two skilled observers being sent out to help in the final
adjustments of instruments according to the number it is intended to
employ.
    At Viziadrug, Mr. Fowler     and Dr. Lockyer were enabled to report
all the fixed instruments and huts, eight in number, erected and all but
the   final adjustments made after six days' work, a long break being
necessary in the middle of the day in consequence of the heat.       Such
 an achievement as this is beyond all eclipse precedent and was only
 rendered possible by the help of a large staff of highly trained men.
 Of the 150 engaged in the operations only three originally formed the
 expedition.
    It is, tberefore,   quite inappropriate that I, on the part of the
 expedition, should here tender thanks to Captain Batten, the officers
 and men of H.M.S.
                       " Melpomene " for their assistance, for as matters
 turned out we assisted them ; but we are anxious to place on record
 the kindness we received from them both afloat and ashore, and since
 the great success of the recent observations is due almost entirely to
 Captain Chisholm Batten and the ship's company of the "Melpomene,"
  I trust that the President and Council of the Royal Society may be
  pleased to communicate this fact to the Lords Commissioners of the
  Admiralty.
     Among those to whom thanks are specially due are the following
 representing the Indian Government : —
     E. Giles,   Esq., Director of Public Instruction,      in charge   of
        arrangements made by Bombay Government.
     K. R. Bomanji, Esq., Collector of Ratnagiri.
     J. L. Jenkins, Esq., Collector of Salt.

   Gangadhar Anant Bhat, Executive Engineer, P.W.D.
   Govind Goshi, Overseer, P.W.D.
   Sadashi Govind Joshi, Clerk to the Overseer, P.W.D.
   Thanks are also due to the Officers of the Police, Telegraph, and
Customs Departments, and others representing the Bombay Govern
ment, for their unceasing efforts to help us in every way.
   Everybody was struck by the admirable and smart manner in which
the subordinates of the Public Works Department accomplished their
respective tasks.
   I took upon myself when leaving Viziadrug, to write an unofficial
letter to Mr. Bomanji, thanking him, in the name of the expedition,
for his great personal kindnesses to us as well as for the valuable
assistance we had received from him and the other local representatives
of the Government.
    L. Lee, Esq., Collector of Customs for Ceylon, and other Customs
officials at Colombo rendered valuable assistance to the expedition
by granting special facilities and providing means for transhipping
 the instruments.
    The Orient Steam Navigation Company very kindly conveyed the
instruments free of charge to and from Colombo.
    To W. H. Sinclair, Esq., a former Collector of the district (now
retired),  I was indebted for the supply of much valuable local infor
mation before leaving England.
    My own personal thanks are due to Mr. Fowler and Dr. Lockyer,
who assisted me in the preliminary work of organisation, and who,
while at Viziadrug, worked hard both day and night to further the
objects of the expedition ; and also to Mr. Bourne, Midshipman,
attached to me as Aide-de-camp, who was indefatigable in helping me
 to carry out the various details of the local organisation.

                      By Captain Hills and H. F. Newall.
     This expedition was one of those organised by the Joint Per
 manent Eclipse Committee of the Royal Society and Royal Astro
 nomical Society, funds being provided from a grant made by the
 Government Grant Committee.
     The observers are indebted to the Great Indian Peninsular Bail-
 way Company for the carriage of the instruments at reduced rates
 between Bombay and Pulgaon, and for a considerable reduction of
  fares to the observers for this journey.
      Observers. — The party consisted of : —
           Captain E. H. Hills, B.E., Instructor in Chemistry and Pho
             tography at the School of Military Engineering, Chatham.
           E. F. Newall, Sec. B.A.S., Cambridge Observatory.
      (In what follows       these  will be designated by the initials H.
  and N.)
      It had originally been arranged that Dr. E.          J.  Stone,  Radcliffe
   Observer,   Oxford, should be     a member     of the party. The vacancy
   caused by his lamented death       was not filled, as it was decided to use
   the skilled assistance      which  could be obtained locally in order to
   carry out part of the programme of work that Dr. Stone intended to
   attempt, namely the obtaining of twelve photographs of the corona
   ¦with the double tube camera.
      Local Arrangements. — When the preparations were being made for
   this expedition     the Surveyor-General of India intimated that his
    department would be willing to give what assistance they could.
    This generous offer was gladly accepted          by the Joint Permanent

44           Capt. E. H. Hills and Mr. fl. F. Newall.
Eclipse Committee, and the Surveyor-General was asked       if he could
send —
   (a) An officer who would take general charge of the camp.
   (b) Six skilled native assistants.
   (c) A photographer who would bring with him a suitable dark
room ready for erection, and photographic materials.
   The officer detailed to take charge of the camp at Pnlgaon was
Captain G. P. Lenox Conyngham, R.E., and the observers feel that
they owe much of the success of the expedition to the excellence of
all the arrangements made by him.
   The thanks of the observers are also due to Lieut.-Colonel St. G.
Gore, R.E., Superintendent of the Trigonometrical Survey, for the
continuous interest he took in the work, and to Lieut. G. A.
Beazeley, R.E., for much help in the observations, and in the de
veloping and copying of the photographic plates.
   The observers are also indebted to the local authorities for their
kindness in doing everything that was possible to render the time
spent in the Eclipse Camp, both pleasant and profitable, in particular
to W. A. Nedham, Esq., Commissioner, Nagpur ; S. N. Chitnavis,
Esq., Deputy Commissioner, Wardha ; and A. C. Blennerhassett, Esq.,
I.C.S., Assistant Commissioner, Wardha.         A number of others,
 whose names are mentioned below, took part in the actual observa
tions, and the observers wish to express their grateful thanks for the
valuable assistance thus rendered.
   Selection of Station. — In order that the masonry piers to carry the
instruments might be built, and that all the arrangements for form
ing the camp might be proceeded with before the arrival of the
observers it was considered advisable that the choice of the actual
station, the approximate position of which had been already decided
upon, should be left to the Survey officer in charge.        The place
selected was Pulgaon, on the Nagpur branch of the Great Indian
Peninsular Railway, and the camp and observatory were placed on
an open piece of ground about a mile to the north of the station.  The
position proved excellent in every way.
   Arrival at Station. — N. arrived at the camp on January 10, H.
on January 12.      All the instruments, which had been forwarded
direct from Bombay, had previously arrived, and the necessary piers
and huts for the observatory were found completed in accordance
with the plans prepared and sent by the observers to Captain Lenox
 Conyngham. It was thus possible at once to proceed with the
erection and adjustment of the instruments.
   Meteorological  Observations. — A continuous set of meteorological
observations were made from January 16 to January 23, of which it
may be interesting to give a summary.

                           II. Totality at Pulgaon.
                     By Captain Hills and H. F. Newall.
   The preparations for totality as regards the instruction and drill
ing of the assistants calls for little mention. The skilled native
assistants, provided by the kindness of the Surveyor-General, were
thoroughly accustomed to observing work, and the preparations and
 preliminary drills proceeded with the utmost smoothness.
   The two men selected as timekeepers were instructed to call out
the seconds from the beats of a metronome, which had been pre
viously carefully rated.
   The signal for the beginning of totality was given by Captain
Lenox Conyngham who was making the exposures with the double
tube camera, but it was also necessary for the spectroscopic work to
get a signal at some definite time before totality which was accom
plished by the following method : —
    The length of the diminishing crescent of the sun was calculated
for 15 seconds before totality.       The observer in charge of the double
tube camera watched the image on his ground glass and gave a
signal when the crescent had arrived at the calculated length.               The
actual interval between the 15 second signal and the beginning of
totality was     13 seconds.

     Magnetometer. — Colonel Gore made observations with the magneto
 meter with a view of detecting variation in the horizontal component
 of the    earth's magnetic field during the eclipse.                 No change was
 observed.
     Shadow Bands.  — An attempt         was made to photograph these with a
small camera provided with an excellent Cooke lens of large aperture
 (F/6-3). A white sheet was stretched opposite to the sun's position,
and a series of exposures was made at beginning and end of totality.
Several spectators saw shadow bands, but no trace is discoverable on
the photographs.
                        III. — The    Double-tube Camera.
                                    By Capt. Hills.
    Instrument. — This camera was the one used by Mr. Taylor in Brazil
in 1893, and was taken to Norway by Dr. Common in 1896. The
tube is of wood, 6 feet long,         and 14 X       7  inches    in section,   divided

           Report on   the  Solar Eclipse Expedition    to  Palgaon.      49
by a   partition into two square tabes of 7 X 7-inch section. In one
     these was placed the " Abney
                                       '-
of                                         lens of 4 inches aperture and
5  feet 2 inches focal length, giving an image of the sun 057 inch ia
diameter    ; in the other the photoheliograph objective (used in Transit
of  Venus expedition), of 4 inches aperture and 5 feet focal length,
with a Dallmeyer secondary magnifier of 7^ inches focus placed
5 inches within the focus, the combination giving           an image of the
sun 1^ inches in diameter.          The camera was furnished with six
plate-holders, each taking two plates of 160 X 160 mm., as in use
for the astrographic chart, both plates being exposed \ a quarter-
tarn of one shutter.        The camera was pointed to a 1 i-inch plane
mirror, made by      Dr.   Common, and mounted as a ccelostat by Mr.
Hammersley after a design by Dr. Common, the sun's rays being
thus reflected into the telescope.
    The camera and ccelostat were not placed in a hut, but a screen of
bamboo matting was erected round the whole instrument, to protect
it from the wind, to which the ccelostat is particularly sensitive.
Another portion of bamboo screen was placed horizontally above tho
camera, to protect the observer and the wooden body of the camera
from the direct rays of the sun.
    Mounting and A djustment. — The ccelostat was placed on a masonry
pier level with the ground.        As some trouble had previously been
experienced with the driving clock, owing to the heavy weight neces
sary, care was taken on this occasion that it should be very rigidly
 fixed in position.    The method adopted was to screw the clock down
 on to a stout wooden base-board,          which in its turn was firmly
 bolted to the masonry pier carrying the coslostat, the driving cord
 being led off horizontally under one pulley attached to the base
 board, and over another pulley hanging from the top of a strong
 wooden trestle about 6 feet high.        Railway fishplates were used as
 weights.     With this method no trouble at all was experienced, and
 the clock-driving was irreproachable.
    In order to carry the camera, two parallel brick walls were built
 on the west side of the ccelostat, and on the top of each of these a
 4-feet length of heavy rail was placed, held in ordinary railway
 chairs, lent for the purpose by the railway authorities at Pulgaon.
 A wooden stop or button fixed on the under side of the camera rested
 against the lower rail and prevented the camera from slipping down
  towards the mirror.
    The angle at which the camera was set was so selected that the slide
 end should be at a suitable height for working.           It was found con
 venient to direct the     camera  towards   a point  about    30° below the
 horizon, a little to the south of east.        The focussing was done by
 reflection, and calls for no special  remark,   the final adjustment being
 accomplished by using the ccelostat mirror.

   The    adjustment of the axis of the ccolostat was effected very
quickly by means of the attached declination theodolite.                The level
attached to tho telescope makes it possible to adjust in altitude
without any astronomical observation, for the latitude of the place
can be taken from the map with sufficient accuracy ; and setting the
telescope to the south declination equal to the co-latitude, and in the
meridian, the level should indicate horizontally. Index errors of the
circle and level are eliminated by reversal of the instrument. There
is a slight uncertainty attending the placing of the telescope in the
meridian, but this does not seriously affect the adjustment in altitude.
If a cross-level were made for tho pivots of the telescope, this uncer
tainty could be removed.
   To adjust in azimuth we must have an observation of the sun (or
a star) at a distance from the meridian.                Observing his declination
(in reversed positions         of  the  instrument and taking the mean), the
instrument must be moved in azimuth until this observed decli
nation agrees with that given in the 'Nautical Almanac' A very few
trials, if the sun can be seen for half an hour, will soon indicate the
true azimuth without any calculations, within a minute or two of
arc, though if the instrument be moved much in azimuth the altitude
observation must be repeated.
   After the initial adjustment of the ccelostat it was not disturbed,
but the adjustment was re-tested at intervals, with the following
results. Tho individual readings were only taken to minutes of arc,
but both limbs of the sun were observed in both positions of the
instrument, and the moan of the four set down : —

    From this general watch kept on the instrument it is clear that the
 adjustments remained good within 1' or 2', which is more than suffi
 cient for the purpose.           The only other adjustment required is the
setting of the face of the mirror parallel to the polar axis of the
instrument.       This was easily effected by reversing the mirror in the
 Ys and observing if the sun's image in the two cases crossed the
same position on the ground glass when the mirror was moved in
right ascension.

    Plates 2, 3, 4, 5 were backed          with a solution of asphalte in benzol
and had       the Abney standard squares impressed on them.                        If the
rapidity of the Special Rapid be taken as twice that of the Empress
plates, the above programme gives a series of equivalent exposures
of
                       2,    4,   8,   12,    24,    48 seconds.
    No exposures of less than 2 seconds were made, because it was
considered that the detail of the inner corona would be better shown
 by the large scale pictures, of which at least four separate sets were
 being taken by independent observers at other stations.
     The orientation of the corona was determined                    by the following
 method : After the last exposure had been completed the clock was
 stopped and the wholo instrument was left untouched, with the slide
 still in the camera, till night.          The Abney lens was then uncovered
  for about 2| hours, the mirror being left stationary, and a series of
  star trails were thereby drawn across the plate.
     A recorder was employed whose duty was to note the exact time of
 each exposure made during the eclipse.               They were as follows : —

       The slits were in each case adjusted to such a width as to realise
    one-seventh      of the theoretical maximum resolving power of the
    prisms. In the case of spectroscope No. 1 which, as will be shortly
    seen, was used for most of the work, this amounted to about 0'3 of
    an Angstrom unit in the violet. It may be noted that any higher
    degree of resolving power would havo been wasted owing to the
    coarseness of grain of the photographic plate, the above figure repre
    senting not only the calculated resolving power of the instrument,
     but that actually realised on a trial plate.
       The length of the spectrum on the plate was 3j inches from Hp
    toK.
       Both spectroscopes were mounted in an approximately horizontal
    position, and were supplied with light by a heliostat, furnished with
    a 12-inch flat mirror.

             Report on       the    Solar Eclipse Expedition                   to    Pulgaon.                53
   Erection and adjustment of Instrument. — The heliostat and spectro
scopes were placed on masonry piers, and a hut of bamboo matting
was bnilt np round the latter.     The heliostat was left in the open,
and, such was the dryness of the air, that it was fonnd that a sheet
tied over it at night was more than sufficient to protect it from any
damp.
   The adjustment of the polar axis of the heliostat was carried out
by means of an attached theodolite in precisely the same manner as
lias been described above in the case of the ccelostat.  As it was not
possible to reverse the instrument    when   the  slow  motion in right
ascension was attached, the position of the axis when once adjusted
was not  retested. This, however, was of little importance, as great
accuracy  in the driving is not required for this work.
  The adjustments of the spectroscopes call for no special mention.
  Programme of Exposures. — Two separate lines of work were under
taken : —
  (1) The recording of the spectrum of the corona — using for this pur
pose both spectroscopes, and giving only one exposure of as long a
duration as possible.
                                              " flash " or spectrum of the

both the beginning and end  of totality.
  For this purpose, spectroscope No. 1 only was used, the camera
being provided with a sliding plate, by which means a large number
of successive exposures could be made at short intervals.
  It was intended to begin the exposures about 10 seconds before
6econd contact, and to continue them tUl .7.. second? after it, and to

      The second series did not begin quite as aoon as had been intended,
  and between the fifth and sixth exposures there was rather a longer
  interval than between the others, owing to a slight mistake on the part
  of the exposer.    This is, however, of no consequence, as all the interest
  centres about the photographs taken within 5 seconds of the
  contact.
      The Corona   Spectrum.   — A reproduction of the corona spectrum as
  obtained by the two-prism flint spectroscope is given in Plate 2. It
  is obvious that the photographic intensity of the continuous spectrum
  fell off very rapidly on receding from the limb. No trace of it is
  seen at a greater distance     than 4'.
     Five strong bright lines of unquestionably coronal origin are to be
  seen.   Their wave-lengths, and relative intensities may be provision

     Spectroscope No. 2, with the quartz train, gave a corona spectrum
 stretching a considerable distance into the ultra-violet, but of feeble
 intensity.    A strong bright line occurs at          \  3801-0, and the lines
 given   above  are   also  to  be  plainly   seen  with    the exception of the
 well known line in the green which was outside the plate.
     Spectrum of the limb. — The two series of spectra of the limb con
tain an immense amount of detail, and will take a considerable
time for complete examination. As an indication of the character
of the results obtained, reproductions of portions of the two spectra
taken at second and third contacts are given in Plate 3.
    As considerable interest attaches to the question of the connection
between the bright line spectrum of the limb and the solar spectrum,
a reproduction of the latter, taken with the same instrument is
appended.

            Report on     the  Solar Eclipse Expedition         to Pulgaon.      55
                      V. — The Spectroscope with Two Slits.
                                  By H. F. Newall.
     It  was intended to attempt             (i) to determine by a spectrographs
  method,   the  difference    in velocity      in the line of sight in the eastern
  and western equatorial regions of the corona, (ii) to utilize the same
  material, as was obtained for the first research, for a comparison of
  the spectra of widely separated parts of the corona, and (iii) to use the
  same instrument in securing photographs of the bright line spectrum
  of the    sun's limb at the end of totality, to be used for the
  accurate determination of the wave-lengths of the bright lines.
     The instrument         provided for these purposes is a four-prism
  spectroscope with two slits.
     The train of prisms ia of such dimensions and construction, as to
  transmit a 2-inch beam of light, and to produce a minimum deviation
  of 180° for Hy.        The collimator and camera are set parallel to one
 another.
     The whole spectroscope            is mounted so as to     turn about an axis,
 parallel to the collimator.           The axis is rotated (with a period of 24
 hours) by    clockwork,      and   is   tilted so as to be parallel to the earth's
 axis.    In this position the collimator points to the north pole.
    The tube of the collimator            is prolonged beyond the plane of the
 Blit, and is arranged to carry at its end a mirror of speculum metal
 and an object glass, by means of which an image of the sun can be
 thrown upon the slit.
     The whole arrangement thus consists of a spectroscope combined
 with a polar heliostat, and in virtue of the fact that the spectroscope
 is rotated  together with the mirror, the image of any celestial object
 thrown upon the      slit does not rotate relatively to the slit. Furthermore,
 the mirror is mounted in such a manner that the axis about which it
 can be tilted — namely the declination axis — can be oriented relatively
 to the collimator tube, so that any diameter of the sun may be set
parallel to the slit.
    The two slits with which the collimator is provided are parnllel to
one another in the focal plane of the collimator lens, and are separated
 by such a distance that when the image of the eclipsed sun is thrown
between the slits, one is illuminated by the eastern, the other by the
western equatorial region of the corona.               The top half of one slit is
covered, and also        the   bottom     half   of the other. The exposures for
the two 6ides of the corona are made simultaneously, and the resulting
photograph should give two spectra side by side on the same plate,
one slightly displaced, relatively to the other, by an amount depending
on the separation of the two slits and the construction and adjustments
of the spectroscope.
    It  was decided that certain coronal lines            in the neighbourhood of

56                  Capt. E. H. Hills and Mr. H. F. Newall.
A.   4233 would be the best available            for the determination of displace
ment due to velocity.
   The linear dispersion in the photographed spectrum is about 15
tenthmetres per millimetre at HY.    The relation between the velocity
in the line of sight and one complete revolution of the micrometer to
be used in the measuring the plate is about 260 kilometres per second
for one revolution.
   The scale of the photograph is such that one degree on the sky
corresponds to about 9 mm. on the plate.
   The effective aperture of the combination regarded as an instru
ment for producing monochromatic images of a slit-shaped region of
the corona is TV-
   The adjustment of the axis of the instrument to parallelism with
the earth's axis, was accomplished in the same manner as that adopted
for adjusting the ccelostat. A theodolite with declination circle was
attached to a part of the frame of the spectroscope, specially prepared
for    it,
       between the camera and the collimator.     The adjustment was
very easily and satisfactorily made in altitude by observations made
                                                 :
with the spirit level attached to the theodolite- telescope, and in
azimuth by observations of the sun made some hours before or after
noon.
                    Programme      of   Exposures and General Results.
     I.   Spectra    of   the Corona.   — A set of five photographs, from which
the relative velocity in the line of sight of the eastern and western
equatorial regions of the corona could be deduced, was to be taken
with the spectroscope with two slits.
   The programme of exposures was carried out completely successfully,
as follows —    :
     Thirty minutes before totality, plate A was exposed for 15 seconds
          for spectra of sunlight diffused from the sky near the sun.
     Fifteen minutes before totality, plate    was exposed for 20 seconds
                                                     B
          for a duplicate of plate A taken in falling temperature.
     During totality, plate No.     was exposed for 100 seconds for the
                                          1
          spectra of the eastern and western regions of the corona.
     Fifteen minutes after totality, plate    was exposed for 15 seconds
                                                     C
          for spectra of sunlight diffused from the sky near the sun.
     Thirty minutes after totality, plate D was exposed for 15 seconds for
          a duplicate of plate    under different temperature conditions.
                                        C
      Result.   — On development,
                             the photographic plate No.   showed no      1
trace of any impress of the coronal spectra, though the development
was pressed as far as possible.
  It clear that the failure
          is                    due to the faintness of the corona in
                                            is
the region photographed. Captain Hills was successful in photo

graphing the spectrum of the corona at the same station, but tho
radial extension of the bright lines and also of the continuous
spectrum is unexpectedly small.            In neither of his photographs is the
spectrum     traceable    further   than    about 4' from the limb of the sun.
N., basing his attempt on the results obtained by Deslandres in 1893
and by Abney and Thorpe, had tried to photograph the spectrum at
nearly 8' from the limb of the sun.                The apparatus used on the
present occasion was of such design and construction, that it was
expected to give considerably brighter images than those used
by Deslandres in 1893.
   II. Spectrum of the Sun's Limb. — With the same spectroscope,
photographs were to be taken of the bright line spectrum of the sun's
limb at the end of totality.
    Ten seconds before the end of totality, the exposure referred to in
the preceding paragraph was completed ; and whilst another plate-
holder was being placed in the camera of the spectroscope, the adjust
ments in R.A. and Declination were changed so that the image of the
chromosphere, which was being disclosed near the point of third
contact, was adjusted on one. of the two slits.              Four exposures were
 then made in rapid succession.
    Results. — The photographs thns obtained, give spectra ranging from
 about \ 3900 to X4900; and the first of the series contains a vast
 number of bright lines, generally similar to those seen in Captain
 Hills' photographs, and to those shown in the photograph obtained by
 Mr. Shackleton in Novaya Zemlya, 1896, August 9, and reproduced
 in Sir Norman Lockyer's Preliminary Report,* and also to those
 obtained    by Mr. Fowler in 1893, and reproduced in Sir Norman
  Lockyer's   Report.f
    An additional point of interest in the first photograph of the series
 is that many absorption lines are also visible.            A cursory comparison
 with the solar spectrum discloses the interesting fact that these lines
 differ in intensity from the absorption lines in the ordinary solar
 spectrum.
                     VI.    The Objective Orating Telescope.
                                  By H. F. Newall.
    An objective grating telescope was used for visual observations of
                                                                          (1474 K),

    A  plane   grating, by Rowland, 14,438 lines to the inch on a ruled
 surface,  3^ X 2J inches, was fixed on a turn-table in front of a tele
 scope  of focal length 29 inches and aperture 3§ inches.               A positive
 eye-piece was used which gave a magnifying power of 19-2, and whose
 circular field of view was rather more than 1° in diameter.

   The instrument was mounted so that the telescope was parallel to
the earth's axis and       pointed towards the north pole.      The grating
was used in a manner analogous to that in which the mirror of a
polar heliostat is used. The light of the corona was incident on the
grating at an angle of about 57°, and diffracted beam utilised in the
telescope left the grating at an angle of about 13°.           In this posi
tion of the grating, the green of the second order was used, and the
magnifying power of the grating was a little greater than £, so that
the distorted coronal ring was an ellipse, in which the major axis
was about twice as great as the minor axis ; the minor axis was
parallel to the length of the spectrum and perpendicular to the
direction of daily motion. No clockwork was used, but a slow
motion of a very simple1 construction was provided and found to
work perfectly satisfactorily.         The observations were begun 6
 seconds after the beginning of totality, and were completed in about
 70 seconds.
    Results. — The coronal ring was seen in the spectrum of the       second
 order with great distinctness and with such brilliancy as to leave no
 doubt that it could have been photographed.
    None of the fine radial structure of the corona could be seen,

 clearly visible in different positions round the ring.

 the observer (N.) keeping himself intentionally in ignorance of the
 orientation of the image seen in the eye-piece until after the observa
 tions were completed so as to avoid bias. A preliminary comparison
 of the drawing with the direct photographs of the corona has been
 made, and the following general statements will probably not require
 much revision on a closer comparison : —

             an element " coronium ") at all points round the sun's limb

             4' and 14'.
    (ii) The luminosity was not uniform round the limb, but in              no

             poles of the sun in ordinary direct photographs of            the
             corona   were   observed,   though   this fine   structure   was
             specially looked for.
     (iv) In certain positions round the limb patches of increased
             luminosity were seen ; in all, seven patches were noted ; in
             several cases the extension was considerably greater in a
             radial direction than in a tangential. The bases of the

            10° to 30°at the centre of the sun's disc, and the radial

                                By H. F. Newall.
 It   was intended to devote any time that remained over, after pro
viding for the three foregoing investigations during the eclipse, to
(i)   asearch for faint extensions of the corona with the aid of a
polariscope, or as an alternative (ii)  general investigation of the
                                              a
nature of the polarisation-phenomena visible during an- eclipse.   It
was expected that results obtained in the latter investigation would
probably only be serviceable in suggesting methods of research for
future eclipses.
  The polariscope   used consists of a Nicol prism with a Savart
plate attached in front of it.  The field of view of the instrument       is
lozenge-shaped after the manner of Nicol prisms, the long axis being
29° long and the short axis 24°. The width of the central band due
to the     Savart plate was approximately 1° 25' between the centres of
the   first lateral dark bands, the centre being regarded as that part of
the   dark band where the dusky red meets the steel blue. The plate
Dad been    adjusted relatively to the Nicol prism, so that the bands
when visible were parallel to the principal plane of the Nicol, and
they were kept in this relative position throughout the observations.
The instrument was used without tolescope or circles.
   Observations. — "When first the instrument was put to the eye, about
85 sees, after the beginning of totality, bands were visible over the
whole field of sky seen through the Nicol prism.      Not only were the
 alternations of brightness seen, but the colours of the bands appeared

with unexpected vividness. They were seen at all points within 30°
of the sun, with little or no variation in vividness, and as the instru
ment happened first to be held, the bands            were approximately
parallel to  the sun's  axis.  These  vivid  bands are attributed to the
polarisation of the light scattered (diffracted) by solid particles in
the earth's atmosphere.
    The bands were so disconcertingly     vivid that a few moments  were
wasted in inspection of the instrument, but immediately afterwards
observations were quietly renewed, the search for faint coronal exten
sions was abandoned, and attention was confined to the phenomena of
polarisation.
    The instrument was rotated about its axis, and the bands faded
from view and became invisible in a certain position. It was thought
immediately after the eclipse that the observations made were enough
to prove that the plane of polarisation was neither vertical nor hori
zontal, but it has since been found that the evidence is not such as to
warrant this statement.       When the bands had become invisible in
the outer part of the field of view, the rotation of the instrument was
discontinued for a moment. The eye then gradually became aware
of faint colours over the corona, but the distribution appeared to be
uneven — rather in patches than in bands.       These colours are attri
buted to the polarisation proper of the corona.      The " patchy " dis
tribution is doubtless a result of the nature (presumably radial) of
the polarisation of the corona, and of the largeness of the scale of
the bands compared with the diameter of the moon (1° 25' : 33').
The fact that the colours appeared faint in contrast with the vivid
sky-bands previously seen may be referred to several alternative
explanations which cannot well bo dealt with here in detail. It is
obvious that the ratio of the brightness of the light scattered by
the sky to that of the light of the corona plays as important a part
as the proportion of the coronal light that may be regarded as
polarised.
    Next, attention was directed to the corona near the limb, and the
central part of the central band was observed while the instrument
was rotated, the central band being kept radial to the sun's disc.
The observed central part was seen to be bright at all points round
tho limb on the east side, whether the central sky-band were bright
or dark.
    Then the bands were set so that one of the first dark lateral bands
was tolerably close to the moon's limb, with its centre perhaps half a
moon's diameter from tho limb. The band was observed to be bright
near the limb, and to be dark at a short distance on either side.
    Both of the last mentioned observations point to the idea that tho
light scattered by the atmosphere was comparable in brightness with
the corona at points not far distant from the sun's limb.

    The incompleteness of the observations is recognised, bnt on the
whole it wonld appear that their suggestiveness justified the observer
in devoting 15 seconds to making them.
    The observed intensity of the        bands, attributed to sky polarisation,
is evidence of the quantity of light reflected by solid particles in the
atmosphere.          It seems not improbable that the unexpected brightness
of the general sky and landscape during totality may have been
 connected with the amount of light reflected from the dust suspended
 in the atmosphere and illuminated by the sun-lit plains outside the
 moon's shadow. The light colouring of the plains, due to the dried
 herbage at that time of year, is very marked at Pulgaon, but it must
 not be forgotten that the "sun-lit plains" were in the moon's penum-
 bral shadow for more than an hour both before and after totality.
    The observations occupied the 15 seconds, ending 15 seconds before
 the end of totality.
    About 30 seconds after the end of totality, polarisation was again
 looked for, but no trace could be detected near the sun in any position
  of the instrument.

     An       element which seems to have been too little regarded in
     e physiology of sponges is the permanent tension of their walls.*
      e contours of the surfaces, particularly where they rise over
      jecting spicules, are alone sufficient to demonstrate that there is
      •face-tension between the protoplasm of the sponge and the sea-
    ater. Both the outer and the inner surfaces of a cylindrical or of
    spherical sponge unite, therefore, in exerting a force which tends
     contract its diameter.         In many sponges there would appear to be
         some     form  of elastic matter in the tissue immediately underlying
          collar-cells; since in teased preparations of the living sponge,
        ments of the chamber-wall turn inside out and swim about like
     iate larva. While the collar-cells are active, these united tensions
       resisted by the pressure of the water in the cavities they line. A
        d generalisation of the mechanism of a sponge's currents shows
     at the velocity in the oscular stream (of comparatively narrow

       me from some fallacies with regard to the effects of this tension, and Professor

sectional area) is the manifestation of a pressure in the flagellate
chambers (of broad aggregate sectional area); which pressure is
maintained by the moving flagella, and resisted by a normal tension
in the walls of the chambers or of the sponge.*
    I therefore regard the contraction recorded by Minchin in C.
clathrus (and undoubtedly occurring in unfavourable conditions, not
only in this, but in many other spongos) as the passive result of per
manent tensions in the sponge- walls. which are no longer counteracted
by the comparatively inactive flagella. f It is with the advantage of
preventing such contraction being a consequence of inactivity that a
skeleton has been evolved in most sponges : whatever the substance
of which it is composed, this skeleton tends to take in surfaces a tri-
radiate [more rarely sexradiate] arrangement.
     [If a uniform elastic membrane be extended by a star of rigid
rods, the area extended is greatest in proportion to the material in
volved, when the star is equiangular and has either four or five rajs ;
though there is comparatively little advantage for any number from

as   a whole, to the action of crystallisation."            If I understand my friend
correctly,       I   differ from him essentially.           I  regard the spicules of
calcareous sponges as beingskeleton crystals of calcite.                 The direction
of the optic axis is fixed (probably by the conditions of pressure and
tension prevailing at the moment) when the spicule first makes its
appearance.            The formed material from which the calcite crystallises
is commonly limited by biological conditions to a narrow interval
between two similar surfaces.                These surfaces may have the form
of a comparatively wide cylinder, as in tho case of Cfathrina clathrus
or Leucosolenia lAeberkiihnii, a narrow cylinder, as in the ca^e of the
s^alk of G-uaneha blanca, or a more comp'ex irregular form, as in the
afferent or rai|jal canals of the Heteroccela.                    I suggest that the
 triradiate spicule is in all cases the skeleton of that region of a
 hexagonal prism, with the given optic axis, which is enclosed by the
 two surfaces which limit the formation of material.
     It is impossible to pro0ss, in a limited space, or indeed with the
 limits of our available knowledge, to give anything approaching a
complete harmony of all known forms of spicules with the foregoing
 hypothesis.          Treating of the simple -it, the regular triradiates of
 Clathrina clathrus and Quancha coriacea, I have been led to the
 above conclusion primarily by observation of deformed spicules ; of
 which I sketched all examples met with during many months
 examination of fresh preparations at Naples, and for which I have

  that part or the whole of one ray deviates at an angle of some
  multiple of 60° from its normal course.                That all deformities in these
  species   should    be reducible    to  this  law   appears to me inexplicable on
  the supposition that they are due to any biological variation of the
  formative cells ; and it will he observed that the variation in which
  two of the angles between the rays are of 60° is wholly irrecon
  cilable with the " honeycomb " theory of contiguous circles appealed
  to by Minchin. Ebner (12) has worked out the relations of many
  forms of spicule to the optic axis and the hexagonal prism : he sums
  up against regarding the spicules as mere crystals.                I can only claim
  to have a little extended his observations,                 but that little is all in

on the external face of the spicule opposite the rays, and intermediate
to them on the gastral face ; complementary, as are the edges oti the
opposing poles of a rhombohedron : the crystallisation is therefore
closely comparable with that of Schiefer spar (a natural form of
calcite crystallising in flat hexagonal plates), and still more with that
of a specimen of dolomite (calcite with a little magnesium), No. 427
in the Cambridge museum, which is crystallised in flat triangular
plates.      The rays of the spicule are opposite the faces of the rhombo

  are always seen to lie accurately over the rays of the triradiate,*
  either as definite minute triradiate spicules, or as three rows of
  thorns; and therefore crystallise on the three faces of the rhombo
  hedron.       The whole quadriradiate, with fourth ray and thorns,
  extinguishes simultaneously in four positions between the crossed
  nicols. I have verified on 0. coriacea and blanca [and A. reticulum]
  pjbner's observation, that the optic axis of these equiangular spicules
  is perpendicular to their plane.
     I suggest that the ancestors of these sponges had a skeleton con
  sisting of organic rods, partially impregnated with carbonate of lime:
  that these rods united in a triradiate grouping and that— whether
  for cementation or merely for strength — the calcareous secretion in
  creased to the point of crystallisation.             The original triradiate form
  was due to an instinct, apparently acquired by the skeletogeuous
  with uniaxial    optic picture, being vertical to the plane of the spicule, interpreta
  tion of these figures is not obvious.
     Glycerin commonly first decalcifies the axial parts, presumably because the liquid
  enters most freely where there is greate.-t admixture of organic mutter.        Canada

the existing triangular grouping of the formative cells determined the
crystallisation of the calcite in a flattened (pinacoid) form, extended
transversely to the optic axis, as in Schietor spar : the unicellular
crystals appear as [elongated] rhombohedra [cf. Sollas (9) p. 389]
which form the primitive acerates.                    The ontogenetic history of
the triradiates of Leucosolenia is not yet known.                   It is possible that
the rudiments originally form an acute angle with the morpho
logical axis of the sponge, and that the formative cells repeat a
change which has taken place in evolution, with the advantage
of the production of a [gastral from an ectocytal] skeleton. The
causes governing the direction of the optic axis in this and higher
sponges are still not clear.*
    Whatever the cause, the "alate" spicule (fig. 9), such as is
typical of Leucosolenia, and very frequent in more complex sponges,
is stated by Sollas (9) and Ebner to have its optic axis at an acute
angle with the morphological axis of the unpaired ray, in a plane
   *
     [The acicular spicules which clothe S. raphanus        appear completely referable
to law.   In  the body of the radial tubes the optic axis of the triradiates is nearly
parallel with the axis of the tube ; this we may ascribe to compression, radial to the
sponge, due to tencion of the cylindrical outer surface.       On the free conical ends
of the tubes the optic axis is nearly perpendicular to the surface ; the large acicular
spicules leave the surface tangentially, and can frequently be seen to be the extremely
prolonged unpaired rays of triradiates (cf. Ebner and others) ; corresponding with
these relations the optic axis makes an angle of nearly or exactly 90° with the
morphological axis. The fine acicular spicules leave the surface nearly vertically,
and the optic axis is correspondingly coincident with their length; like the gastral
rays of quodriradiates in Ascaltis they are to bo regarded crystallographically         as
extremely acute rhombohedra.         This is the acicular form which we should expect
to find in free crystallisation of calcite, and   I have shown elsewhere (19) — though
suggesting a ideological       explanation —  that the number and size of these fine
spicules vury greatly with the condition of the water.
   In L. Lieberkiihnii the optic axis is often exactly at right angles to the acicular
spicules, in other cases it makes with the long axis an angle of from 70° upwards.
The figures of'Schulze (S. raphanus) and Minchin (L. variabilis) suggest that the
larval spicules are tangential when first formed, and that some are afterwards
rotated outwards.     It does not seem at present possible to account for the varying
angles made by the optic axis to the morphological        axis of acicular spicules, with
out reference to cellular directive power. The giant oxeotes of the young Leu-
candra aspera especially suggest that there has been cellular determination to form
a divergent brush of protective spicules.           To examine thic question there is
necessary   greater knowledge as to the mode of ontogenetic development of the
canal-systein, as to the mechanical strains resulting in the various stages of such
development¦ and as to the laws governing free crystallisation of calcite in acicular
forms of which tho greatest length ii not parallel to the optic axis.
   In tho club-spiculcs of & compressum the optic axis lies in the plane of the
spicule, normal to the morphological axis at its point of greatest curvature.           It
must be noticed that, according to tho observation recorded above, the acicular
spicules of the adult sponge are in this species not unicellular in formation. — July

 cylindrical surface of three planes, which meet at equal angles in a
 line forming an acute angle with the axis of the cylinder, to which
 one    plane is radial, two of them, therefore,                 cut the cylinder in
 ellipses, and one in a straight line.                Investigation shows that tho
 angle     agrees     with that given by Sollas and Ebner for the optic
 axis of a      spicule of similar form.* The alate triradiate of Leucoso
 lenia, with curved rays, is therefore as accurately regular a skeleton-
 crystal as the equiangular triradiate of Clathrina.                   Both follow the
 same law, that the calcareous secretion is limited by the form of the
 sponge to the surface of a cylinder, and crystallisation                         of the
 secretion takes place in the radial planes of a rhombohedron which
 are perpendicular to its three faces, the difference being only that in
 Clathrira the optic axis of the rhombohedron is radial to the cylinder,
and in Leucosolenia it lies in a radial plane of the cylinder at an acute
angle with the axis.t

between it and the gastral surface.         In L. Lieoerkiihnii, as observed by Kinchin
'or   L. complicate, its origin is on the unpaired          ray.  Unlike the apical ray

would have assumed no more importance than crystallisation                          of
urates among higher animals.                Bat the strangely         beautiful   and
elaborate patterns of calcareous spicules are truly crystalline, and
their curves and angles, as they vary from one individual to another,*
are not necessarily of appreciable advantage or disadvantage to the
species in which they are found.              And, in spite of the colloid nature
of silica, Schulze's beautiful figures of Hexnctinellid spicules prove
to me that this substance has some property akin to crystallisation
on the cubic system, to which the triaxon forms of siliceous spiculep,
and probably the tetraxon also, are to be ascribed.                 It remains to be
shown whether the complex detail of a peacock's tail may not also
be referable to a mathematical equation, rather than to the aesthetic
 nicety of ancestral hens. Be minimis non curat lex vitae.
    [I find that in attempting condensation of statement I have not
 succeeded in completely explaining the position above advanced.
    There is probably no group in which, more clearly than in the cal
careous sponges, change phyloganetically progressive can be shown
 to result in progressive advantage to the organism, whether we con
 sider the canal-system or the arrangement of the skeleton. It is not
 under dispute that, where the form of the spicule can appreciably
 affect the chances of survival of a sponge, there natural selection
 dictates to the necessary degree the form of the spicule.                This it may
 do either directly, as appears probably the case in many acicular
 spicules, by developing a stubborn morphographic sense in the
 skeletogenous cells ; or indirectly, by varying the chemico-physical
 conditions of the secreted fluid, so that the form of crystallisation
 changes.       Such indirect action of selection in A. cerebrum may possi
 bly explain the presence of thorns on the gastral ray, though irre
  sponsible for their arrangement.
     But, while granting fully that the most apparently unimportant
  variations may prove vital to the organism, it appears logically
  necessary that there must be variations which are unimportant. or
  unimportant compared with solid advantages with which they are
  necessarily concomitant.          In the case of calcareous triradiates the
 solid advantage is that a mechanically useful skeletal element is
  of A.  cerebrum, its crystalline vosition tends to give it a laminate rather than  an
  acicular form.
     * In Sycon raphanus this is most markedly the     case.

attained by the passive submission of a solution of carbonate of lime
to forces of crystallisation ; thus, with economy to the organism, very
simple secreting cells produce a result similar in effect to that which
would be attained by morphographic skeletogeuous tissues of far
more complex heredity.          It would appear from comparison of the
spicules of Sycon and Leucascus, Anamixilla and Heteropegma {vide
infra), that in calcareous sponges this advantage completely out
weighs any possible profit or loss resulting from slight change in
angle or substitution of curved for straight rays.
    It is difficult to believe that the equiangular spicule with which
Heteropegma      and Leucandra australiensis support their tubes, alike
has induced their survival, and would cause death to the Sycon that
should imitate them.       Nor, on the other hand, can the spicule forms
of S. raphanus be ascribed to a rigid atavistic heredity ; for between
individuals self-sown in the same tank, the striking differences of
homologous spicules proclaim their form to be most variable. The
explanation of the exact geometrical figure observed in any one case
is to be sought in crystallography, and not in physiology ; in the
1aws which we recognise as governing form in dead matter, that                   is,
those that are apparently independent of any forces in the dimension
of memory.
    So far as can be judged, it seems that the change in form, which,
 through influence on the direction of the optic axis, results from
 change of stress, renders the spicule less well adapted to bear that
 stress
      ;   a predominant longitudinal tension placing the paired rays
 nearly transverse to its own direction.           A priori, where one cha
 racter in an organism        physically a function of another character in
                              is
 the organism, the variation of one only can be exactly correlated to-
 the needs of the organism.        If both are important, the adaptation of
 neither can be perfect; according as either                predominant, the

 variety in which they are noted.

      Mincbin,  in 1896 (20) and 1897 (21), recorded that the larva of
L. variabilis     is an amphiblastnla, as shown by Metschnikoff for
  L. Lieberkiihnii ; and that that of the species coriacea, cerebrum,
 reticulum, and contorta (sensu Bwk.) is a parenchymula, as shown by
 Miklueho-Maclay        (1) for blanca (confirmed by Minchin), and by
 Schmidt (2) and Metschnikoff (6) for primordialis and clathrus.            He
 pointed out that the first spicules to appear in the amphiblastnla
 larva are acerates. in the parenchymula larva triradiates.         He found
 that in L. botryoides, variabilis, complicata, and Lieberkiihnii the
 nucleus of the collar-cell is distal, as in Sycon ; in the species with
 parenchymula larvaa           basal.*

     On these important observations he divides the Homoccela into
 two families.
     (1) Clathrinidce (Olathrina clathrus, coriacea, cerebrum, reticulum,
contorta, and Ascandra falcata) with reticulate external form, equi
angular triradiate systems, collar-cells with basal nuclei, parenchy
 mula larva, and triradiates the first spicules to appear.
     (2) Leticosoleniida) (Lencosolenia botryoides, complicata, Lieberkiihnii,
variabilis, and Ascyssa (?)       with erect or arborescent form, sagittal
                                              )
 triradiate systems, collar-cells with terminal nuclei, amphiblastula
larva, and monaxon spicules the first to appear.            Such Sycons as
 iS. raphanus he derives from the Leucosoleniidre,     but leaves     an open     it
question     whether     some  Heteroccela  mny   not  be  derived  from   the
Clathrinidse.
 I     propose to emphasise very considerably the lines he has indicated,
and particularly the suggestion (originally made by Keller (5)) that

Leucascidoe with the reticulate Ascons ((17) pp. 166, 190, 249, Ac);

to the collar-cells and that the optic axis      perpendicular to the plane

little reason          for supposing Calcarea               to be    a natural       class ;   but
retaining        it provisionally       I  propose to divide as        follows : —
                                         Class.    — Calcarea.
                               Sub-Class        I. — Calcaronea,   nov.
      The nucleus of the             collar-cells and of the flagellate cells of the
 larva is distal, and the flagellum arises from it directly.                           The larva
 is an amphiblastula.             The     first    spicules  to appear    are  oxea, generally
  (always ?) lance-headed,               the triradiates are typically alate* and
 the optic axis is rarely perpendicular to the plane of the spicule.
 The pylocyte is annularf and generally lies at the bottom of a
 funnel-shaped           depression         or afferent canal.            Branching of the
  sponge takes place typically nearly at right angles to a growing
  axis, giving rise to stolonate and arborescent forms.                            The gastral
  fourth ray of a quadriradiate spicule rarely rises perpendicularly
  from the meeting point of three rays.                         Lance-headed oxeotes are
  frequently present          in  the   adult.        The sponges    never show a coral-red
  or sulphur-yellow colour.

       The nucleus of the collar-cells                 and (? ?) of the flagellate cells of
    the larva is basal,       and the flagellum does not arise from it directly.
    The larva is a parenchymula.                       The first spicules to appear are
    triradiates,     the triradiates are typically equiangular and the optic

pylocyte has as yet only been investigated in homoccel species,
it is there amoeboid, and perforates the entire sponge-wall without
any afferent funnel-shaped depression lined by other ectocytes.
Branching of the sponge is typically dichotomons or umbellate, with
frequent anastomoses, giving rise to reticulate growths supported on
solid stalks often of obvious length in the adult. The fourth ray of a
quadriradiate spicule generally (or always) rises perpendicularly

     It  is impossible to estimate the degree of relationship between
Calcaroiiea and Calcinea until the histology of siliceous sponges is
better known.          The fact that the skeleton is in both groups composed
of calcite seems       little evidence of common origin ; since the researches
of Elmer and        Minchin suggest that they separated before the calcite
 took the     form of spicules.       The mode of attachment of the nagellum
 would seem      necessarily perfected so soon as the mode of nourishment
 by aquiferous canals was established             for the race ; on this reasoning it
 would seem not improbable that the phylum Sponges may be com
 posed of two classes, the Basinucleata and the Apicinucleata ; or the
 Hexactinellida may be a third class of eqnal value.                           The Spongil-
 lidae and Spongida are the            two groups among Demospongiao which
 wvinld appear to offer themselves               for union with tho Calcinea, as
 laving basal nuclei to their collar-cells                     and larvea completely
 flagellate ; for the Apicinucleata              we know of distal nuclei in the
 Calcaronea, Halichondria (18) and probably (reasoning from Schulze's
  figures) Chonirosia (3), Corticium (6), Eaiisarca (3).
      The Spongioid® and Spongida are both anomalous                             groups, and
  the Demospongise would be rather more homogeneous if they were
  removed, and scarcely more heterogeneous                   by the admission of the
  Calcinea.      But onr knowledge is as yet too imperfect to propose
  such a classification.

 "
   The Influence of Eemoval           of the Large Intestine and increasing
        Quantities of Fat in the Diet on general Metabolism in Dogs."
        By V'AUGHAN HASLET, M.D., Professor of Pathological Che
        mistry, University College, London.            Communicated by Prof.
        Victor Horsley]! F.K.S.           Received   July 25, 1898.
                   (Abstract, published during the Vacation.)
    In this research it was intended, by comparing the results obtained
in dogs on a given diet with the same animals after the removal of the
large intestine, to study more carefully the functions and any influence
the absence of the large intestine might have on general metabolism.
    In one dog a little more than the middle third of the large intestine
 was removed, while in the other two dogs the total length of the large
intestine, together with the caecum, was extirpated.         The dogs were fed
 after recovering from the operation on meat and biscuit, to which vary
 ing quantities of fat were added.           The meat employed was preserved
 by sterilising minced     meat   in  separate weighed out portions sufficient
for each day.
    In all the experiments the nitrogen and fat in the diet were analysed,
and in two dogs quantitative analyses were made of the carbohydrates
in the diet and faeces.      It was found on the above diet that no carbo
hydrates were obtainable        in the faeces either in normal dogs or in those
in which    the large intestine had been removed, so that it can be con
 cluded that the       large  intestine   has  no action  on the carbohydrate
 absorption, and     in subsequent experiments it was not investigated.
    The first step was to investigate the effect of an increasing quantity
of   fat on a staple diet in normal animals, so as to compare that with
the results    obtained after the removal of the large intestine.
    In dog   1
                (Table III) it is seen on the same carbohydrate and proteid
diet   when the quantity of fat is increased from 12-04 grams to 32'04
grams, the    average quantity of urine fell from 118 c.c. to 89 c.c., and this
decrease   in quantity was accompanied by a slight increase in the specific
gravity of 1058 to 1060.         In  consequence of the proteid sparing action
of the fat the quantity of       nitrogen eliminated fell from 4-457 grams to
3-57o grams.        On increasing the diet still further to 62-04 grams, the
quantity    of  urine  was only 70 c.c., the specific gravity remaining 1060,
the nitrogen being slightly decreased in quantity to 3-362 grams.
   As far as the faeces are concerned, their daily quantity increased from
18-61    grams to 20'42 grams and 22-70 grams.             Together with the
increased quantity of the faeces the nitrogen daily eliminated             also
increased    in quantity from 0-351 gram to 0-412 gram and 0-469 gram.
As one     would naturally expect, with the increased quantity of fat in
 the diet, the fat in the faeces increased from 0-733 gram to 0-971 grf.m

                   Intestine,  &c, on General Metabolism in Doyx.                 79
and l-264 gram.            In consequence of the increase of the nitrogen in the
faeces,      the apparent absorption of nitrogen per diem fell from 92 71
per cent. to 9T45 per cent. and 9026 per cent., while, on the other
hand, in spite of the increased quantity of fat in the faeces, the absorp
tion of fat rose from 93-91 per cent. to 96-97 per cent. and 97-96 per
cent. by increasing the fat in the diet.
      In dog    2 during the three periods examined, the first two were on
the same        quantity of fat, and the results found correspond with those
found in dog 1.
      The next observation       (Table  V)    was made on a dog in which a little
more than one-half of the large intestine was removed.               It is seen that
 on increasing the fat from 1T73 to 36-73 grams the quantity of urine
 fell from 172 c.c. to 169 c.c., the specific gravity falling from 1035 to
 1031.        The nitrogen also fell from 5-596 grams to 4-991 grams.            On
 still further increasing the fat to 5T73 grams, the average quantity of
 urine fell to 112 c.c. with a specific gravity of 1048, the quantity of
 nitrogen being 4'680 grams when four days were analysed.                  As far as
  the     quantity of    faeces is concerned,    during two of the periods the dog
  did not      pass   its faeces daily,  so   that the average can only be made
  approximately.
       The increase in the quantity of fat is scon in this case to cause no
  increase in the quantity of faeces, although the total quantity of freces
  are    more than the previous normal dogs would lead one to suppose
  ought to occur on that diet.            The total nitrogen in the faeces also is
  increased in quantity, although no increase occurs with the addition of
  tbe fat.      The fat analysis in the three periods remained practically the
   same ; in consequence          of this, the absorption is not altered by in
   creasing the fat.        The total absorption of proteid varies from 8G-91
   per cent. to 89-85 per cent., that is to say less than the normal dogs,
   while the fat absorption rose from 86 per cent. to 97 per cent., prac
   tically the same as is found when the large intestine is intact.
       In the next two dogs the entire large intestine was removed, and the
   result obtained is seen in Table VIII.
       In dog 4, four periods were analysed, each having four days dura
   tion.     During periods     a and   b   the quantity of fat was 9-71      grams,
   while in periods      c and d the quantity was 29'7l grams.
        It is seen that the quantity of urine during the periods            a and   b
    varied very      considerably,   and the same occurred      with the increased
    quantity of fat.       The cause of this variance     it would be impossible to
    explain ;    the   tendency, however,        is for the   quantity to slightly
    decrease    with the increased quantity of fat, and specific gravity to do
    the same.
         At the same time     the decrease in quantity on increasing the fat is
     not  nearly so marked as in the normal dogs.            The increase of fat in
     the  diet, however, brings out the same proteid sparing action as the
                                                                         G

82       Dr. V. Harley.      The Influence   of Removal of  the  Large
quantity of nitrogen in the urine falls from 4'445 grams and             4-374
grams to 3-243 grams and       2 '965 grams.
    The quantity of   faeces  during the different  periods compared very
much better than the quantity of urine, and on a small fat diet the
quantity was 75'55 grams and 74-71 grams, that is to say, more than
double the quantity on the same diet in normal dogs.            On increasing
the fat in the diet the quantity rose to 83-78 grams and 83-49 grams,
so that we have here the same as in the normal dogs an increase in the
quantity of faeces caused by increasing the quantity of fat in the diet.
At   the same time the total quantity of faeces is very much in excess of
that on the same diet in normal dogs.
    The nitrogen in the     faeces  during the periods a and b was 1-064
grams and T081 grams, nearly three times the amount obtained in
normal dogs, while on increasing the fat it only increased slightly to
1'088 grams and 1-095 grams.          The fat in the faeces during periods a
and   b was 0'777 gram and 0-605 gram, and on increasing        the fat in the
diet it rose to 0'769 gram and 0873 gram, so that the total quantity
of fat obtained in the faeces in dogs in which the large intestine had
been removed was almost the same as in the normal dog, and the
increase of fat in the diet caused an increase in the quantity of
faeces.
    Now, turning to the absorption as indicated by the quantity found
in the faeces, we see while the normal dogs absorbed over 90 .per cent.
of the nitrogen given, in the absence of the large intestine only 84 per
cent. was absorbed, and that the increase in the quantity of fat given
caused very little decrease in the absorption of nitrogen per cent. The
absorption of fat in the normal dogs varied from 93 per cent. to 97 per
cent., while in these dogs we see that it varies from 92 per cent. to
 97 per cent., so that as far as the absorption of fat is concerned the
 large intestine plays no part.
    In dog 5, in period b, when 4T55 grams of fat were given, the
 animal refused to take its food, so that only two days' analysis were able
 to be given ; but the results obtained in dog 5 correspond with those in
 dog 4, and it was found in other dogs that it was impossible to increase
 the quantity of fat in the diet in the absence of the large intestine, as
 the animals invariably went oft' their feed.
    The above results showed that the removal of the large intestine
 has a great influence on the quantity of faeces, it will be as well now to
 discuss the change in the quantity of water eliminated in the faeces and
 its percentage composition.
    On comparing the averages of the above dogs we see (Table XIV)
 that in the normal dog the quantity of fwces varies from 18'61 grams to
 36-26 grams, while when the large intestine is partially removed the
 quantity is slightly increased, although the small quantity found may
be partly explained by constipation.       On removal of the whole of the

large intestine,   on the other hand,         the quantity of faeces varies from
75 grams to 83 grams ; that is to say, was very markedly increased.
    The quantity of water in the normal fieces per diem is increased on
increasing the quantity of fat in the food.
    In dog 1 it rose from 12-79 grams to 14-32 grams.               After removing
the large intestine there is also an increase in the quantity of water on
increasing the quantity of fat in the diet, for it rose from 58' 11 grains
and 56-87 grams to 66-56 grams and 66-09 grams by increasing the fat
in the diet.      Also the percentage quantity eliminated with the fasces
is  enormously increased by removal of the large intestine.                   Even the
partial removal of the large intestine in dog 3 shows a very marked
 increase in the quantity of water per diem. The percentage of water in
 the fseces  in the normal dogs slightly falls with the increased quantity
of fat in the diet, whilst instead of falling the percentage increases
after the removal of the large intestine.           In the normal dog 70-78 per

                  Intestine, &c, on General Metabolism       in Dogs.           85
cent. of     water was eliminated with       12 grams of fat, on increasing the
fat to 62 grams only 67-87 per cent. of water is eliminated.
    In the dog in which the large intestine was entirely removed, dog 4
with 9-71 grams of fat, the faeces contained 76-59, but on increasing
the fat to 29-71 grams the percentage of water increased to 79 grams
instead of falling as in normal dogs.
    The effect of removal of the large intestine on the breaking up of
fat in the     alimentary canal was next investigated (Table XX).
    In the above table the quantities of neutral fat, free fat acids, fat
acids as soaps and cholesterin are given, and their percentage composi
tion taking the total ether extract as 100.            It is seen in all the dogs
that the quantity of free fat acids is very much greater than that of
the neutral fat ; the quantity of fat acids as soaps and neutral fat
correspond very much in percentage composition.
    As far as the total quantity is concerned, that varies with the diet,
hut on the whole is comparable, so that one can conclude that the
removal of the large intestine has no action in stopping either the
breaking up of fat or the formation of soaps in the alimentary canal.
    When we turn to the cholesterin, however, we find that there is a
dif0rence.         The normal dog 1 excreted 0-154 gram and 2 only
0-061     gram of cholesterin.      After partial removal of the large intestine
the   quantity of cholesterin       corresponded very much with the normal
'log   1,  being    0-145   gram,  while  in the case of both dogs, when the
 large intestine was entirely removed, the quantity of cholesterin was
 very much less (in dog 4 only 0'025 gram, and in dog 5 0-069 gram) ;
 so that one may consider that the removal of the large intestine causes
 a decrease in the
                           quantity of cholesterin, and this is probably ex
 plained by the loss of so much secreting surface in the intestine as
 would occur when the large intestine is removed.
    The colouring matter* in the faces was also investigated               in the
normal dogs, and found in all cases to contain no bile pigment but
 marked quantities of urobilin, while in the case of the dogs in which
 the large intestine had been removed this was not always the case.
    As far as the contents of the intestine or its walls are concerned the
 animals were killed with chloroform, and the presence of urobilin
looked for throughout the intestine.          In the normal dogs in the great
majority     of  cases  no  trace of urobilin could be detected above the ileo
cecal valve.        The contents of the small intestine only gave the bile
reaction.
    In dog 5 the small intestine having been joined 6 cm. from the anus,
a  slight urobilin reaction was obtained as high as 35 cm. from the anus,
the bile reaction as far as 78 cm.          In this case evidently urobilin for
mation was       taking place in the small intestine comparatively speaking

    In dog     4  only  4 cm. of rectum    was left, and only in this part was

86        Dr. V. Harley.       The Influence of Removal    of the Large
-any    urobilin reaction obtained,   so that in this case as in normal dogs
only the large intestine formed urobilin.
     The next step in the investigation was to see the influence of diet
and removal of the large intestine on the sulphates in the urine.
     In Table XXVI it is seen that on increasing the fat in the diet, as
 the quantity of nitrogen decreases in the urine the quantity of total
 sulphates do the same; with 12 grams of fat a dog eliminating 0637
 gram of sulphates, with 32 grams of fat 0544 gram, and with
 62 grams only 0-521 gram.           On the other hand it is seen that this
 steady    increase   in the quantity of fat accompanied by the decrease in
 the sulphates, is not due to a diminution in the quantity of aromatic
 sulphates, but of the alkaline sulphates, the aromatic sulphates remain
 ing throughout practically the same, 0'OGi gram.           In consequence of
 the decrease in the alkaline sulphates the ratio A to B is decreased, so
 if one only referred to the ratio one would believe that there was an
 increase in the intestinal putrefaction,       while on the other hand in
 reality   there  is no increase ; if anything a decrease, as brought out in
 dogs 1 and 2, where the aromatic sulphates. are not increased but, if any
 thing, decreased.
     In dog 3, in which the large intestine was partially removed, the
 influence of fat in the diet on the sulphates is the same as in normal
 dogs, and the quantity of aromatic sulphates corresponds with that
 found in normal dogs, so that one can say that there is no increase or
 decrease in intestinal putrefaction caused oy partial removal of the
 large intestine.
     In dog 4 after complete removal of the large intestine it was seen
 the quantity of total sulphates corresponds with that found in normal
 dogs,     only there is a marked decrease in the quantity of aromatic
 sulphates to half the normal.        In consequence of this the ratio is very
  much increased, and, both by the ratio, increase, and the total decrease
  in aromatic sulphates, one sees clearly that intestinal putrefaction is
  very much diminished.
      In dog 5 the same is brought out, but not to such a great extent,
 and, as is already seen, dog 5 was an exception as far as the urobilin
 was found to occur in the small intestine some way up.
      In conclusion wo may say that this research has led to some interest
  ing results.      That, as far as the large intestine influences the absorp
  tion of food stuffs, it has no action whatever on the carbohydrates of
  the diet, but its absence causes a marked decrease in the absorption of
  proteids from 93 per cent. to 84 per cent. The fat, on the other hand,
  is absorbed in practically the normal amounts, and it is found that the
 breaking up of fat continues the same when the large intestine is absent.
 The water of the faeces is increased in total quantity, although the
 percentage of water increases with an increased fat diet, instead of
 decreasing cis in normal dogs.          The total quantity of facces is also

           Observations concerning                       the Eelation of the Toxin and
     Anti-Toxin of Snake-Venom."                          By Charles J. Martin, M.B.,
       D.Sc., Acting Professor of Physiology in the University of
       Melbourne.   Communicated by W. D. Halliburton, F.B.S.
       Eeceived August 23, 1898, and published during the Vacation.
     The discrepancy between the quantities                     of anti-vencne   required   to
neutralise   a given dose of venom when they are (1) previously                       mixed
outside   the body, and (2) simultaneously injected under the skin in
different parts of the body, has been drawn attention to by Fraser and
myself.    My experience coincides with Fraser's* upon this point, viz.,
that it requires at least 10 — 20 times as much anti-venene to counter
act a given dose of venom when they are injected separately, but at
the same time, as is necessary to effect this if they are mixed together
prior to injection.
     Sometimes,         however,quantity necessary by simultaneous but
                                     the
separate injection may be much greater ; in one of Fraser's experiments
1000 times as great.t      Moreover, there is no constant ratio between
the amounts necessary under the two conditions, as will be seen from
the experiments tabulated below (Series A).        In this series, experi
ments 1  —  4, in which increasing doses of venom were employed, show
that 0-5 c.c. of the particular sample of serum used was more than
adequate to prevent a fatal result when previously mixed for fifteen
minutes at temperature 13° C. with 0'5 c.c. of a solution containing
0-0001 gram of the venom per c.c.         As 0'00003 gram per kilo was
found to be the minimal fatal dose of this poison, one may be sure that
under these conditions 0-5 c.c. of the serum is adequate to neutralise
more than 0-00002 gram of the venom, that                       is,
                                                 0-00005 gram mimis one
fatal dose.
   In experiments — 12, 0'OOOOo gram of venom per kilo, was injected
                          5
in   each case, and        increasing      amounts        of serum separately, but at the
same    time.      Under these conditions,               every quantity less than    c.c,

symptoms        when brought directly into contact with the poison before

    The further        experiments      detailed      in the present         paper    afford a
 reasonable      interpretation of      the very different efficacy of anti-toxic
 serum under these two conditions.                   They are also an additional con
 firmation of the conclusions regarding the direct chemical nature of
 the antagonism         between the toxins and anti-toxins of diphtheria and
 snake-poison      respectively, which were drawn by Cherry and myself in
 a recent   paper.* Moreover, some inferences which seem to me to be
  necessitated by the experimental              results are of practical importance
 in the treatment of snake-poisoning, and not devoid of interest in their
 ltearing upon the relations of toxins and anti-toxins in general.
    The experiments arranged in tabular form below were made with
 the object of obtaining definite data concerning the proportions of anti
  toxin to toxin necessary to save an animal under the following three
  conditions   : —

     (1) Mixed together prior to injection.
     (2) Injected simultaneously,         the anti-toxin    into  a vein, and     the
            venom subeutaneously.
     (3) Injected simultaneously,      but separately, under the skin.
     The venom of Hoplocephahts curtus, the Australian tiger-snake, was
used.     After weighing the dried venom, it was dissolved in enough O'D
per    cent. NaCI solution for 1 c.c. to contain O0001 gram of the venom.
This solution was heated momentarily to 90° C. in order to destroy one
of the poisonous constituents which coagulates at 85° C* The poison
ous proteose remaining produces the same symptoms as cobra poison,
and is very probably identical with the principal poisonous constituent
in that venom.
     The anti-venene was prepared by Dr. Calmette. Two quite different
serums were used.           For the experiments in Series A above, samples
dated November, 1896, were employed, and for the experiments in
Series B samples bearing date December, 1897.                 The anti-toxic value
of the former, according to Behring's method of notation, I found to
be l/50th of a normal unit per c.c. ; of the latter l/200th of a normal
unit per c.ct
     The control experiments are in Table I. Here the same proportions
of venom to body weight, as employed in the experiments in Tables
II, III, and IV, were injected, but no serum given. The effect of
these doses of venom upon the rectal temperature and the time they
took to kill is shown for comparison.                From these experiments it is
seen that O00003 gram venom per                  kilo, is just on the margin of
fatality.      From    other  experience     I  have   found   that this quantity
generally kills.
     II and   III   show parallel series of experiments.          The amount of
anti-venene per kilo, remains constant, but the quantities of venom

the venom and anti-venomous             serum were mixed together in a glass
and allowed to remain' in contact for fifteen minutes at temperature

             Relation of the Toxin and                      Anti-Toxin of Snake- Venom.               93
venene        simultaneously, but separately, under the skin on different sides
of the        body.     These large quantities were introduced by injecting
about        2 c.c. into different situations ; 20 c.c. of serum is quite harmless.
  The rectal               temperature         of each rabbit was taken               at the time of
injection and each          twelve hours subsequently.                       The fall in temperature
caused           by the poison is a good indication of the extent to which the
animal is affected.
  The conclusions                   I   feel justified in drawing from the above experi
ments are :           —
      (1)    That about             the  quantity of anti-venene necessary to
                                          same
                 neutralise the venom in vitro,    capable of doing so when the
                                                               is
                 former     injected into the blood-stream, and the latter sub-
                               is
             cutaneously.
      (2)    At least ten to twenty times this quantity required when they    is
             are both placed simultaneously under the skin, but in different
                 parts of the body.
  That the proportion of toxin to anti-toxin necessary to neutralise
the former should be approximately the same whether they be (1)
mixed      glass, or (2) the anti-toxin be injected into the blood-stream
              in   a
and the toxin subcutaneously,   might be expected       the nature of the      if
antagonism   between   them  be     chemical  one, andain  consideration of
the evidence                   by Kanthack,* Erhlich,t Fraser,| Stevens, and
                           adduced

any other             conclusion.
  The            toxinanti-toxin of snake-poison neutralise one another
                           and
when            together in adequate proportions, quite irrespective of
                 mixed
the actual quantity of each.        Solutions of the two can be titrated
against each other just    like standard solutions with the life of     rabbit                a
as an indicator, in which the error in the determination of the         " end-
      "
point      one fatal dose.
                 is
 If   anti-venene be introduced into the blood-stream the anti-toxin                                  is
there ready to neutralise the toxin as          absorbed, and, as might have
                                                               it   is

appearance in the blood.        The experiments indicate, however, that a

     94       Relation of       the Tconn      and   Anti-Toxin of Snake- Venom.
        The much higher proportion of anti-toxin to toxin required when
     separately introduced under the skin seems to necessitate the inference
     that anti-toxin is comparatively slowly absorbed from the subcutaneous
     spaces.   Our chemical knowledge of this poison in Hoplocepludus venom
     and of the active principle in anti-venene, together with what is known
     of the physiological mechanism of absorption, is quite in accordance
     with the view that this anti-toxin is only capable of slowly penetrating
     the capillary wall, whereas the venom passes through fairly rapidly.
     The constituent of the venom which was used in the above experiments
     is an albumose.    It dialyses slowly, can be filtered through a film of
     gelatin under  pressure, although it does not pass through so readily as
     water or bodies of simpler molecular constitution.*          It is rapidly
     absorbed by the blood-vessels.      An   animal  can be killed by subcu
     taneous injection of a large dose in a few minutes, and the result is not
     retarded by previous ligature of the lymphatics from the limb and the
     thoracic duct.t
        On the other  hand, Brodief filtered anti-toxic serum of diphtheria
     through gelatin, and found that the active properties of the serum
     remained with the proteids on the outside of the filter. Cherry and I
     confirmed this result with diphtheria anti-toxin, and found the same for
     anti-venene,§   and     think both these anti-toxins are bodies of great
                                I.-
     molecular size comparable to proteids.        The walls of the capillaries             of
     the limbs are membranes possessed       of  permeabilities approximating to
     those of   a  film of gelatin, for Starling showed they were relatively
     although not absolutely impermeable to proteids.||          molecular size
                                                                           If               is
     the obstacle to proteid absorption from subcutaneous spaces the same
     would apply to anti-toxins.
        Calmette has made the statement that anti-venene             more rapidly is
     absorbed than venom.        He does not adduce any experimental proof for
     such a  statement, and        cannot see that the results detailed in this
                                      I
     paper  can  bear  any other  interpretation  than that the poison with which
     I  have been working        absorbed 10
                                      is      —  20 times as rapidly as the active
     principle  in anti-venomous    serum.
        The practical indication of this in the treatment of snake bite         to     is
     inject the serum intravenously, until the potency of the anti-venomous
     serum which     isat the disposal of the public    greatly enhanced.

             Impurity found in Nitrogen Gas derived from Urea.                      95
"
    On the Character of the         Impurity found in Nitrogen Gas derived
        from    Urea."      By Lord Eayleigh, F.E.S. Received August
        17, 1898.
    It  has   already* been recorded that nitrogen prepared from urea by
the    action of sodium hypobromite or hypochlorite, is contaminated
with an impurity heavier than nitrogen.              The weight of pure nitrogen
in the globe employed being 2-299 grams, the gas obtained with hypo
chlorite was 36 milligrams, or about 1£ per cent., heavier.                   " A test
with alkaline pyrogallate appeared to prove the absence from this
gas of     free oxygen, and only a trace of carlxm could be detected when
a considerable quantity           of the gas was passed over red-hot cupric
oxide into solution of baryta."              Most gases heavier than nitrogen
we excluded         from consideration by the thorough treatment with
alkali to which the material in question is subjected.                In view of the
 large    amount     of the  impurity,   and  of  the fact  that  it was  removed by
 passage over red-hot iron, I inclined to identify it with nitrous oxide ;
 but it appeared that there were strong chemical objections to this
 explanation,      and so the matter was left open at that time.                   This
 summer I have returned to it ; and although it is difficult to establish
 by direct evidence the presence of nitrous oxide, I think there can
 remain little doubt that this is the true explanation of the anomaly.
 I need scarcely say that there is here no question of argon beyond the
 minute traces that might be dissolved in the liquids employed.
     In the present experiments- hypochlorite has been employed, and the
  procedure has been the same as before.               The generating bottle, pre
  viously exhausted, is first charged with the full quantity of hypochlorite
  solution,    and the urea is subsequently fed in by degrees.                The gas
 passes     in succession over cold copper turnings, solid caustic soda, and
  phosphoric     anhydride.      In various experiments        the excess of weight
  was   foimd to be variable,        from   23   to 36 milligrams.       In order to
  identify the    impurity it   was desirable to have as much of        it as possible,
  and   experiments were undertaken to find out the conditions of maxi
  mum weight.         A change of procedure to one in which the urea was
 first introduced, so that the hypochlorite would always be on the point
 of exhaustion, led in the wrong direction, giving an excess of but
  7 milligrams.      Determinations of refractivity by the apparatus, t which
 uses only 12 c.c. of gas, allowed the substitution of a miniature
 generating vessel, and showed that the refractivity (and along with it
  the  density) was increased by a previous heating of the hypochlorite to
  about 140° C.       Acting upon this information, arrangements were made

 for a preliminary heating of the large generating vessel and its charge,
 with the result that the excess 'of weight was raised to 55 milligrams,
 or about 2| per cent. of the whole.               In any case heat is developed
 during   the  reaction,   and   the    heavier    weights of some of the earlier
 trials probably resulted from a more rapid generation of gas.
    In seeking to obtain evidence as to the nature of the impurity,
 the most important question is as to the presence or the absence of
 carbon.    The former experiment has been more than once repeated,
 with the result that the baryta showed a slight clouding.                 Parallel
 experiments in which CO., was purposely introduced, indicated that the
whole carbon in a charge of gas weighing 30 milligrams in excess was
about 1 milligram.        It is possible (though scarcely, I think, probable)
that this carbon is not to be attributed to the gas at all, and in any
case the amount appears to be too small to afford an explanation of
the 30 milligrams excess of weight.              If carbon be excluded, the range
for conjecture is much         narrowed.        As   to oxygen, only traces were
found in most of the samples examined, whereas enormous quantities
would be needed to explain the excessive weight. It should be noted,
however, that the extra heavy sample, showing 55 milligrams excess,
gave evidence of containing a more appreciable quantity of oxygen.
    It seems difficult to suggest any other impurity than nitrous oxide
which could account for the anomalous weight.                  Unfortunately there
is no direct test for nitrous oxide,         but  so  far as  the examination has
been carried, the behaviour       of the gas is consistent with the view that
this is the principal impurity.         The gas as collected has no smell. The
proportion    of  nitrous   oxide    indicated      by the refractometcr is nearly
the same    as that deduced from the weight.              For example, the refrac-
tivity  was  observed of some of          tho  gas which weighed 55 milligrams
in excess.       The proportion by volume (:i•) of N.,0 in the whole
required to explain the excess of weight is given by

    The refractivity (referred to air as unity) of the same gas was deter
mined by two independent               sets of observations       as T047, 1-04S ;
mean, 1-0475.       If we assume that there are only nitrogen and nitrous
oxide present, the proportion (x) of the latter can be deduced from
the known refractivities (;*-l) of nitrous oxide, nitrogen, and air,
which are respectively 0-0005159, 0-0002977, 00002927, the number
for air being k*s than for nitrogen. Thus,
                  xx5159    +  (l-a)x2977          =  1-0475x2927,
giving                               x = 0-0408.
    The slight want of agreement           dan be explained   by the presence of a

            Impurity found in Nitrogen Gas derived from Urea.                     97
little oxygen, the recognition of which would lead to a rise in the
second value of x, and a fall in the first.            Examination of the gas
from the refractometer with alkaline pyrogallate proved that oxygen
was    actually present.
    Evidence may also be obtained         by exploding the gas with excess of
hydrogen, for which purpose oxy-hydrogen gas must be added.                      But
when nitrous oxide is in question, operations over water are useless,
while for the more exact procedure with mercury, experience and
 appliances were somewhat deficient.           Tho contraction observed was
 rather in excess of the volume of nitrous oxide supposed to be present,
 but of this a good part is readily explained by a small proportion of
 free oxygen.
    If  the  impurity is really nitrous oxide, it should admit of concentra
tion by solution     in water.    To test this, about 1 litre of water (cooled
 with ice)    was shaken with the contents of a globe (about 2 litres).
 The dissolved gases were then expelled by boiling, and were collected
 over water rendered alkaline, in order to guard against the introduction
 of C02.      The quantity was,    of course, too small for weighing, but it
 could readily be examined in       the refractometer.      Of one sample, after
 desiccation, the refractivity relatively to air was found to be as high
 as 1*207, although some air was known to have entered accidentally.
 The proportion of nitrous oxide in a mixture with nitrogen which
 would have this refractivity is 0-255.         The impurity thus agrees with
 nitrous oxide in being very much more soluble in water than are the
 gases   of the atmosphere.
    In the analytical use of hypobromite for the determination               of urea,
 it has been noticed* that the nitrogen collected is deficient              by about
 8 per cent, but the matter          does not appear to have been further
 examined.      The deficiency might be attributed to a part of the urea
 remaining undecomposed, but more probably to oxidation of nitrogen.
 In default of analysis any nitrogen collected as nitrous oxide woidd
 not   appear   anomalous,     and  the  explanation suggested requires the
 formation in addition of higher oxides retained by the alkali.
    There is reason to suspect that nitrogen prepared by the action of
 chlorine upon ammonia is also contaminated              with nitrous oxide, and
 this is a matter of interest, for the contamination in this case cannot
 well be referred to a carbon compound.             In two trials with distinct
 samples the refractivities were decidedly in excess of that of pure
 nitrogen.

desirable to give further details of the apparatus employed, referring
for explanation of the principles involved to the former communication
already cited.
   The optical parts, other than the tubes containing the gases, are
mounted independently of everything else upon a bar of T-iron 90 cm.
in length over all.    The telescopes are cheap instruments, of about
3 cm. aperture    and 30 cm. focus, from which the eye-pieces are
removed.    At one end of the T-iron and in the focus of the collimating
telescope the original slit is fixed. This requires to be rather narrow,
and was made by scraping a fine line upon a piece of silvered glass.
At the further end the object-glass of the observing telescope carries
two 6lits which give passage to the interfering pencils, and are
situated opposite to the axes of the tubes holding the gases. The sole
                                        —
eye-piece is a short length of glass rod the same as formerly described
— of about 4 mm. diameter, which serves as horizontal magnifier.   The
g;is tubes are of brass, about 20 cm. long and 6 mm. in bore.    These
are soldered together side by side and are closed at the ends by plates
of worked glass, so cemented as to obstruct as little as possible the
passage of light immediately over the tubes.  There are two systems
of bands, one formed by light which has traversed the gases within the
tubes, the other by light which passes independently above ; and an
observation consists in so adjusting the pressures within the tubes that
the two systems fit one another.     Unless some further provision be
made, there is necessarily a dark interval between the two systems of
bands corresponding to the thickness of the walls of the tubes and any
projecting cement. It            is,
                             perhaps, an improvement to bring the two
sets of bands  into closer juxta-position. The interval can be abolished
with the aid of bi-plate (fig.

                    is                    in front of the object-glass of the
observing telescope, the plane of junction of the two glasses being hori
zontal and at the level of the obstacles which are to be blotted out of
the field of view.

as a     sort of Geissler pump.         The two halves of the apparatus being
independent and similar, it will suffice to speak of that which contained
the gas to be investigated.            The tubes in which the levels of mercury
are observed are about 1 cm. iii diameter.                The fixed one, correspond

                                  of a Geissler or Topler, is 33 cm. in length,
and is surmounted by a three-way tap, allowing it to be placed in com
munication either with the optical tube or with one of narrow bore
ending in a U, drowned in a deep mercury trough. The bottom of
the fixed tube, prolonged by 92 cm. of narrower bore, is connected
through a hose of black rubber with the movable manometer tube.
The latter is 70 cm. long and of one bore (1 cm.) throughout. It can
either be held in the hand or placed in a groove (parallel to the fixed
tube) along which it can slide.            The four columns of mercury stand
side by side, and the levels are referred by a cathetometer to a metre
scale     which     occupies   the central    position.     It  is  not proposed to
describe     the cathetometer      in detail,  but it may    be mentioned     that it is
of home construction, and is mounted on centres attached to the floor
and .ceiling of the room.           It sufficed to record the levels to tenths of
millimetres.        The   whole   apparatus   was constructed by Mr. Gordon.
    If the glasses closing the optical tubes were perfect, there would be
coincidence of bands corresponding              to complete exhaustion of both
optical tubes.          A correction could be made for the residual error once
for all    determined,     but it is safer to make two independent settings,
one at     pressures as nearly atmospheric as the case admits, and a second
at minimum pressures.              There are then in all eight readings to be
combined.         An    example may      be taken    from   a case   already   referred
to:—
                   I.               II.              III.             IV.

    Columns I,       II  refer to the anomalous        nitrogen,   III  and  IV  to the
dried air used        as a standard     of comparison.       I and   IV   are the fixed
manometer         tubes   in communication with the optical tubes.             The re
duction may        be effected by subtraction of the rows : —

    Thus 4708, the difference between II and I, of the nitrogen balances
4935, the difference between III and IV, of air.                     The refractivity
referred to air is accordingly yf^f, or T048.
   .Xifc this  example the range of pressures for the air is 493-5 mm., or
    3ut twr- thirds of an atmosphere.
    Great care is sometimes required to ensure matching the same bands
&the two settings. A mistake of one band in the above example would
entail nearly 2 per cent. error in the final result, inasmuch as the whole

 number of bands concerned is about 96 per atmosphere of air, or about
 62 over the range actually used.             It is wise always to include a match
 with pressures about midway between the extremes.                        If the results
 harmonise, an error of a single band is excluded, and it is hardly
 possible to make a mistake of two bands.
   As regards accuracy, independent final results usually agree to one-
thousandth     part.

  On Nagana, or Tsetse Fly Disease. (Report, made to the Tsetse

       Experiments carried out from November. 1896, to August,
       1

       Blandfohd.          Received October 27, 1898.
   At the request of the Colonial Office, the Royal Society of London
appointed a Committee           to co-operate with Surgeon-Major Bruce in            his
research     upon    Nagana or the Tsetse Fly disease. This Committee
entrusted     us  with the actual experimental work. The object was to
study Nagana systematically in ordinary laboratory animals, to investi
gate the life-history of the haematozoon discovered by Bruce, and, if
possible, to discover methods of prevention, cure, or immunisation.
   The material for our observations was obtained in the first instance
from the blood of a dog infected by the disease on the voyage from
Africa, and brought to England in November, 1896, by Dr. Waghorn.
   The investigation was begun at once at the pathological laboratory
of St. Bartholomew's Hospital, but in February, 1897, was transferred
to the pathological laboratory of the University of Cambridge.
   Tlw Ha imdoz•icm of nagana has already been described by Bruce, and
is closely allied to the Trypanosoma of Surra. We have had no oppor
tunity of studying the latter disease, the relation, of which to nagana is
referred to later.       The parasite discovered and described by Rouget*
in a  horse in Algeria is also similar.          In English sewer rats (Mus il'cu-
rnanus)   a Trypanosoma (T. sanguinis) is occasionally found, but this is
quite    distinct  from the hacmatozoon of nagana, both in its morpho
logical appearance and in its pathogenic effects (vide infra).
                                     I. Susceptibility.
   Cats, dogs, mice,     rabbits,  rats, both   sewer rats    (Mm     ilecunuinm)  and
white and piebald rats (Mus rattm), are highly susceptible, and in these
animals the disease has proved fatal in every ciise of infection which
has been allowed       to run to a close.

  A single       hedgehog inoculated            was readily infected             and died in seven
teendays, so that this animal probably possesses a high susceptibility.
  A single donkey was inoculated and was killed twelve weeks later,
beingthen in a weak condition and near dying.
  Two hn-sex have been inoculated, one a strong and                                    well-fed      cart

animal (see under zebra hybrids) which survived only eight days.
  A     |ai*ch-bok   has also been inoculated            ;   it   died seven montha afterwards
without showing         any lesions.         All     the inoculations made from            it    proved
negative.

have also been inoculated.   These were kindly put at the disposal of
the  Royal Society by Professor Cossar Ewart, of Edinburgh,    order                         in
to see whether such hybrids are refractory to nagana.
   The two former were infected by plunging a needle wetted with
nagana blood beneath the skin      the latter received
                                                 ;     dose of cubic              a             1
centimetre of the same blood.                   All   of them died
                                                     about eight weeks.    in
During the course of the disease they showed irregular rises of tem
perature, sometimes up to 41-6° C.      Variations in the number of
haematozoa were ascertained in the case of the horse hybrids   on some                   ;
occasions they were           abundant
                            (66,000 per cubic millimetre).     When
ever thedonkey hybrid was examined at the earlier stage of the illness
the hcematozoa were found to be either scanty or absent.     A horse
which was   inoculated as a control died in eight days, with very abun
dant hsematozoa in its blood    this animal must have been peculiarly
                                            ;
susceptible to nagana, as no other cause for death could be found at
mt-iiwrt'in examination.                 There     is    no reason     for  supposing that the
hybrids exhibitedany more refractoriness                          than other horses or asses.
   Koch* reports on attempts which he made to infect two Masai
donkeys, and two crosses from Muscat and Masai donkeys.    None of
these showed any symptoms    of the disease up to three and   half                               a
months, nor were                             in their blood at any time,
                          haematozoa discovered
although repeated examinations were made.         Consequently there      no                        is
proof that these animals were really infected.          In our experience
scratch inoculations sometimes, though rarely, fail      on the other hand,  ;
inoculations  by puncture   with a  needle or  by  actual  injection do not
fail Koch's animals were inoculated by the scratch method.

be added that all his control infections were successful.         He did not
find that ordinary mules showed any immunity.
   With regard to guinea-pigs, at first we thought that they were refrac
tory under normal conditions, and that        was possible to infect them
                                                              it

ferences.

   We found, however, that guinea-pigs are susceptible to nagana under
 ordinary conditions, but that, as a ride, the disease in them is more
protracted than in rabbits, rats, mice, cats or dogs, and even horses; so
 that they are distinctly more resistant than these animals.                   In no
instance, however, has recovery ensued after haematozoa have once
 appeared in the blood.
    According to unpublished observations by Bruce upon the Tsetse
 Fly Disease in South Africa, it appears that native gaits and sheep are
 to some extent refractory, the disease, as a rule, running a chronic
course (five months).
   A   nvrnkey (Macaw.' rhesus) was also tried.              It died in about two
 weeks in an advanced condition of pulmonary tuberculosis, but the
presence of abundant haematozoa had                been   determined    in the  blood
during life up to the time of death.
   A  weasel was injected.         It  showed    haematozoa in its blood, and died
a few days later, but death almost           certainly was hastened by the     effects
of captivity.
   Pigeons are       the. only Lints which have yet been tried.          The pigeons
after inoculation did not show signs of the disease, nor was their blood
infective.     It may be mentioned that Bruce tried South African Iwns
without    success.      Further experiments with birds are in hand.
   Ynuwj animals, if susceptible (kittens and puppies), as a rule have
died earlier than adults, and while suckling they are still more highly
predisposed ; young guinea-pigs, however, are comparable to older ones
in their resistance.
   The foetus in utero of infected rabbits, guinea-pigs or rats, is not
infected,    although the mother's blood may contain a large number of
haematozoa.        The latter are to be found in the placenta, but not in the
fcetal blood.       Similar observations have also been made by Lewis,*
Lingard,t and RougetJ in their investigations on allied haematozoa.
                 II.   Duration of Disease in the different Animals.
   As will    be seen    from the figures given below, the lethal period varies
somewhat in each species of susceptible animal.                  The duration of the
disease appears to depend principally upon the individual suscepti
bility rather than on the mode of inoculation or the quantity of
infective material introduced. Thus, of foiu- rabbits inoculated in the
same manner with the same material, three died on the 12th, 21st, and
24th days respectively, whilst the fourth was killed on the 41st day ;
many similar instances could be cited.                Nor does a larger quantity
necessarily determine a more rapid death ; thus a rabbit which has

                        On Nagana, or Tsetse               Fly   Disease.                     103
received         the whole   blood    of    rabbit containing numerous
                                           another
haematozoa   may survive longer than the minimal lethal period for
rabbits.  We have not been able to define the conditions which deter
mine these variations     in susceptibility. Kouget has noted similar
variations in the lethal period.
   The ratio of the minimal to the maximal lethal periods is about
Ito5orlto6in rabbits and rats, and 1 to 9 in guinea-pigs. The
number of other animals inoculated has not been sufficiently great to
determine a satisfactory ratio.
   In our experiments dogs survived an infection 14 — 26 days, cats
22—26 days, rats 6—26 days, mice 8—25 days, rabbits 13—58 days,
and guinea-pigs   20 — 183 days; the average duration being for dogs
18   days, for cats 24 days, for rats 12 days, for mice                     13 days,   for rab
bits 30 days, and   for guinea-pigs 50 days.
     Since the commencement of these experiments, a large number of
animals have been    dealt with, and thus an extensive series of cross-
inoculations        has been   carried     out   ;   but we have found that the dura
tion of the disease is not dependent on the kind of animal from which
the h«matozoa arc derived.      No constant modification      therefore,        is,
effected by passages, either in the                    direction    of   attenuation     or    of
increased virulence. This statement                  is   completely borne out by Bruce's
observations on wild animals, as well                     as African sheep and goats, for
he  found that the haematozoa of these animals were as infective                               as
those obtained from highly susceptible animals, such as dogs.
                               III.   Mode   of      Inoculation.
   Inoculations have been made with the blood of an infected animal,
subcutaneously, intravenously, or intraperitoneally, or by applying                            a
minute and often minimal quantity of infected blood to a superficial
scratch.  Rabbits have also been inoculated in the anterior chamber of
the eye, and rats directly into a lymphatic gland.
   Blood taken from diseased animals, although showing no haematozoa
when examined    microscopically, has frequently been proved to be fully
infective, so that   appears that a single haematozoon, or at any rate a
                       it
very   small  number  of them, successfully introduced, are capable of
producing the disease.   At present no method of graduating the dose
appears possible, since a minute           quantity        is   as effective as much    larger
quantities, though the lethal period                  may be somewhat prolonged.               It
is   also       that unrecognised
            possible                                 forms are present in these cases,
though   should
            it   be added that in some instances where no hsematozoa
are found in simple films, we were able to detect them      means of            by
centrifugalising the blood.
  Successful inoculations have also been made with lymphatic gland,
spleen, bone-marrow, aqueous humour, serous fluid, cedema transuda
tion, and testicular juice.

104             Messrs. Kanthack, Durham, and Blandford.
   The incuhation period and the duration of the disease, as already
pointed out, are not entirely dependent upon the number of hiematozoa
in the material injected, or the source of the infective material. Thus
the hsematozoa of lymphatic glands, &c, are as infective as those of the
blood.       The duration of the disease     is    not materially affected by    the
mode    of inoculation adopted, and is alxmt the same, whether the
infection was brought about by subcutaneous, intravenous, or intra
peritoneal injection, or by a superficial scratch.
    Material taken from the bodies of animals twenty-four hours, or some
times less, after death, is hardly ever infective, even when several cubic
centimetres are injected, so that we have no evidence of a resisting or
sporing form which survives in the tissues or blood of the dead animal, and
is inoculable into other mammals.     It must )>e added that putrefactive
changes often set in with great rapidity in the bodies of animals dead
of nagana.
   Blood drawn from the living infected animal and kept in vitro in an
aseptic condition, retains its infective power at most for three or four
days, but this period is generally less.           Complete drying also renders
blood non-infective.
   Blood heated to 50' for thirty minutes invariably becomes non-
infective,even in large doses (such as 4 c.c), while when heated to
46° C. for half an hour it proved infective in one out of two cases,
although apparently the hsematozoa had become non-motile — at least
no motile forms were detected under the microscope.  But even in this
case the lethal period was not prolonged.
   Infection by feeding     has been attempted   by means of a number of
experiments.        Sometimes it was successful, in most cases unsuccessful,
so that it has seemed to us that the possibility of infection by                 the
mouth depends on accidental lesions about the mouth, nose, ears                   (in
rats), or alimentary tract.
   Of  a number of rats fed on organs of nagana animals, only        few    a
acquired the disease, and these invariably showed superficial lesions             of
the snout and ears, due to lice.     When fed upon infective material,
they bury their snouts       in   as well as scratch their ears with their
                                  it
blood-stained forepaws.       Furthermore,        in
                                              the rats which acquired the
disease through feeding, the cervical glands were always enlarged most,
which proves that the hiematozoal infection must have token place                 in
the head, for, as we shall show, the primary infection travels      the     by
lymphatics.
  A  cat fed repeatedly on        soft tissues of      the bodies
                                                             of infected        dogs
and cats, and subsequently        on the bodies of dead rats, died at     a     time
corresponding by lethal period to an infection at the first meal on rats.
We regard      itas probable that some splinter of bone caused     supera
ficial lesion through which the hsematozoa were enabled to enter.
    One rabbit, fed carefully      by
                                 means of a pipette with large quantities

                          On Nagano,, or Tsetse         Fly   Disease.                 105
   of in0cted blood,        never showed the slightest sign of the disease.
   Rouget (iqi. tit.)   also   failed to infect animals by the mouth.
      Two rabbits, into whose conjunctival sacs several drops of blood
  containing     very abundant hiiematozoa, and a third rabbit whose eye
  was brought      into contact with one of these, did not become infected.
  We presume that Rouget's              positive results   by this method were due to
  some   accidental lesion.
      A dog suffering from the disease did not infect her puppies during
  the last fourteen       days of her life, nor did these puppies infect their
  foster mother (she-cat) after they bad been inoculated.
     Nor have       we    observed       transmission     of the    disease through the
 mother's    milk in guinea-pigs.           Rouget alludes to a doubtful instance of
 in0ction by coitus in rabbits by means of the spermatic fluid.                        We
 have not detected haematozoa in spermatic                     fluid obtained from the
  vesieulse seminales, and believe that in Rouget's single positive ease
 there may have been direct infection from the penis, which s1itters con
 siderably in rabbits and may become                     excoriated, so that it easily
 bleeds.
     We therefore do not believe that             it is possible to infect an animal by
 0eding     in the absence of superficial lesions, and in this respect we
 dif0r from Bruce,         who seems         to imply that the hwmatozoa          can pass
 through the unbroken            surface of the alimentary tract.
                       IV.   Symptoms       anil Course of  the Disease.
     These    vary somewhat according to the nature of the animal, but
 there are certain striking symptoms which commonly occur in different
 0oups of animals.             These may therefore be regarded as the most
 characteristic.
     1. Miisriiln.r -icustini) and Ivss of powei' are evident in all but the small
animals.       In rats, mice, and guinea-pigs they are but little marked or
absent    altogether.        In the horse, dog, cat, and rabbit the wasting is
very conspicuous.             In the cat, dog, rabbit, and hedgehog there is
marked loss of weight, amounting to 20 — 30 per cent.
    2. Fever.  — In    most animals         which have      been   examined,    there is a
smart    rise of temperature          about the time of appearance of hamiatozoa
in the blood.        (Horse,      41-5°  C. ; dog, 40°    C;     rabbit, 41° C. ; guinea-
pig, not    constant.)
    Paroxysms of fever are common in the horse, as has already been
shown by Bruce.            The temperature may rise to a considerable height
(416 C); the          same      is true of the zebra-horse hybrids.           In a horse
upon    which daily observations              were made, quick and sudden rises of
temperature       immediately        followed an increase of the haematozoa in the
blood.      At the time of death there was marked pyrexia.
    In the single donkey which            we examined      the temperature     was gener
ally raised     throughout the course of the disease.

106             Messrs. Kanthack, Durhani, and Blandford.
   In  dogs there   is also fever,   the temperature  becoming subnormal     on
approach of death.
   In   rabbits   pyrexia is common, and generally the temperature is
elevated throughout the disease, but it may fall suddenly to normal.
The temperature curve is always irregular, and no relation between
the temperature curve and the haematozoal curve could be established.
   In ruts also the fever is well marked, the temperature falling quickly
towards the end.
   It  is difficult to speak with certainty of the temperature         in such
small animals as rats and mice.
   In guinea-pigs, representing less susceptible animals, fever as a rule is
not a special feature.       The temperature is as irregular as it is in the
normal animal, but the animal shows paroxysmal rises from time to
time, sometimes above 41°; these may be accompanied by an acces
sion of haematozoa into the circulation, but this is not a constant
feature.
   3.  (Edmui is common in certain animals, such          as the horse, rabbit,
cat, and     dog, and is most marked about the head, legs, belly, or
genitals.    In smaller animals, such as rats and mice, it is not usual, and in
guinea-pigs it has not been observed.        In dense tissues, as the rabbit's
ear, there may be a local cedema at the site of inoculation.
   Rabbits exhibit a special tendency to cedema of the external genital
organs.     There is often great and progressive swelling of the prepuce
or labia, as the case may be.         The swollen parts often excoriate and
become sore and covered by crusts, so that the animal is in a sorry con
dition.
   4. Cluinges in the Eyes and Nose. — In cats, dogs, rats and rabbits
turbidity of the aqueous humour, fibrinous plaques in the anterior
chamber, and corneal       opacities are occasionally observed.    In rabbits a
muco-purulent conjunctivitis        is common, and this may be followed by
an opacity of the cornea and a turbidity of the aqueous humour,
which under such conditions        shows haematozoa microscopically as well
as   leucocytes.     Hacmatozoa     have also been discovered in the con
junctival     discharge in the earlier stages of the disease.         Vascular
corneal    ulcers sometimes occur in dogs, and the conjunctivitis of cats,
dogs, rats and rabbits is frequently associated with oadema of the
eyelids and face.       In rabbits the eyelids and nose frequently become
almost    entirely closed up by the drying of the secretion ; in the latter
case   they breathe with great difficulty, keeping their moutha open.
This condition     has been described by    Rouget (op. cit.).
   5. Aruemw.     — Some    degree of anaemia is always present, but it does
not seem to be so extreme as to be the sole attributable cause of death,
and points rather to a disturbance in the haematopoietic or the ha;ma-
tolytic mechanisms.
   The number of red blood corpuscles            steadily diminishes  and nu

                         On Nagano., or Tsetse        Fly  Disease.               107
cleated      red corpuscles (normoblasts)           often appear, especially in rats.
According to observations on rabbits               the diminution of haemoglobin is
roughly proportional to that of the blood corpuscles.
    Leucocytosis is not a constant feature and when present is ap
parently due to the febrile temperature.                  An excessive leucocytosis,
such as occurs in leukaemia, was never observed;                      15,000 — 34,000
leucocytes being the highest numbers recorded per cubic millimetre.
     Blood drawn from an animal               seriously ill, when clotted, generally
exhibits a marked          butfy    coat  ;  the serum     is often turbid and may
undergo secondary          clotting.
     Instead   of forming rouleaux, the red corpuscles tend to clump into
masses and to lose their outlines, especially when the anaemia is pro
 nounced (rabbit,      ass, and horse).
     The serum of such blood, when mixed with normal blood of the same
 species   of animal, causes the red corpuscles to clump together also.
     The urine of infected dogs spectroscopically examined often shows
 an intense urobilin band.
     6.  Wounds do not heal well, and tend to break                down  and  become
 septic, even though the             operation    has been    performed   with strict
 aseptic   and antiseptic      precautions.      The haematozoa may be abundant
 in the discharge        from the wounds.           Many animals, especially dogs,
 are apt to become infected with pyococci                 and other bacteria in the
 later stages of the disease, even when the inoculated material has been
  proved to be free from bacteria.               We conclude that a spontaneous
  terminal bacterial infection may occur when the marasmus has reached
  a certain    degree.      This may accelerate death and is probably fairly
  often the case in the naturally acquired disease.               But we have often
  proved by cultures that bacteria are absent in uncomplicated cases of
  experimental inoculation.
      7. A voracious appetite has not been observed in the infected labo
  ratory animals ; some animals refuse their food and the stomach is not
  seldom empty after death.
     8. Rats and       guinea-pigs      often exhibit convulsive or eclamptic
  seizures   shortly before death, but otherwise guinea-pigs, rats, and mice
  show    no symptoms of disease, except dulness in the later stages.
      9. Transmission from one animal to another, without direct inocula
  tion, has   never been observed.          Nor have we come across instances of
  infection   by  coitus   or  through suckling, although we have dealt with
  large  numbers of animals.
                                 V. Morbid Anatomy.
     In  rats and mice    exactly the    same conditions     may be observed.    The
  most striking changes are        :—
      (1) Enlargement       of the lymphatic glands, the glands corresponding

108             Messrs. Kanthack, Durham, and Blandford.
to the seat of inoculation         being always largest.      This observation is
important,     because     from  the relative size of the  glands it is possible to
determine the seat of infection.            To this allusion has already been
made, when the effects of feeding were discussed.                 The glands are
generally red, congested, juicy, and cedematous             j  in a few   instances
haemorrhagic        extravasation     has  been observed.     In some     cases   all
lymphatic glands          in the body are enlarged, in others a particular
series otdy.      If a  rat be inoculated in the right thigh, the glands in the
left axilla and left groin suffer last.
   (2) The spleen is much enlarged, with but few exceptions, and it is
generally firm, friable, and dark coloured.
    (3) The liver generally shows some enlargement and may be fatty.
   (4) Wasting of the muscles and atrophy of the fat is, as a rule, not
well marked.
   (5) Sub-pleural        ecchymoses are sometimes present in the lungs,
accompanied by        a  small  amount of pleural fluid.
   In rabbits the general enlargement of lymphatic glands is less notice
able.    The spleen is generally enlarged.            Petechial ecchymoses are
rare.    Fatty degeneration of the liver is always present, and muscular
wasting is often extreme.           Enlargement of testes   has been observed.
   In   dogs muscular wasting is well marked, the animal being often
reduced to a skeleton, but the fatty tissues are generally not much
affected, except at the base of the heart, where the fat may undergo
cedematous degeneration.            The general enlargement of the lymphatic
gland is well marked, and, as in the rat, the glands are (edematous and
congested, yellowish, or even show haamorrhagic extravasations.
   The spleen is also greatly enlarged, granular, firm and friable.
   Pericardial effusion is common, pleural effusion may be present.
   Sub-pericardial       petechiae   and haemorrhages occur frequently, sub
peritoneal occasionally,       and sometimes also sub-mucous in the intestines
and stomach.
   In  rats wasting     is pronounced, the glands are greatly enlarged, the
spleen   is  also   enlarged,    the liver is slightly enlarged.    Haemorrhages
beneath the pleura and pericardium have been noticed.
   In  guinea-pigs,   which clinically often show no changes or symptoms
at all, the morbid changes after death are not very well marked.                The
spleen    is generally moderately enlarged,          and  occasionally even     con
siderably ; it is often very soft and rather pale.         The lymphatic glands
are distinctly, hut as a rule only slightly, enlarged, those corresponding
to the seat of inoculation being always the most affected.
   Haemorrhages have been observed in the lungs and in the stomach ;
serous effusions and cedema have not been noted.
   In all these animals the hone-marrow is sometimes dark red in colour,
at other times natural, or paler than it should be.           In the shafts of the
long bones the fat disappears and          becomes  replaced by   "red"  marrow.

      In many cases an iron reaction has been obtained with the liver,
spleen, and kidney (ammonium sulphide ; and K4FeCy0 4- HC1).
                              VI. Distribution of Hwriuitozoa.
                                         A. Blood.
      After a latent period of some days, haematozoa are invariably found
in the blood at some time or other during the course of the illness.
      1. Ruts. — When the animal is inoculated with small quantities of
infective blood, the latent period averages 3 — -4 days. When, however,
 a   large   number      of haematozoa    is inoculated  into the peritoneal cavity,
 the parasites may be found in the blood even after a few hours.
      When the haematozoa have once appeared in the blood, they are
 generally found therein to the end, gradually increasing in number till
 the blood literally teems with them.              During the early stages of the
 disease,     however, variations are frequently noted, inasmuch as an
 increase on one day may be followed by a marked decrease on the next.
 In a few cases they have even temporarily disappeared from the circu
 lation for a day or two, but this is distinctly rare in rats and mice,
 although common in other animals.
      At the later stages the haematozoa may amount to 2,000,000 —
  3,000,000 per cubic millimetre.
      2. Mice. — What has been said of rats applies also to mice.
      3. Ilabbitx. — In these animals,      after inoculations with minute quan
  tities of blood, the parasites first appear in the blood in about eight
 days,    about the same time as the pyrexial attack.              They remain in the
 general circulation for a day or two in small numbers ; this is followed
 by a disappearance and reappearance for a variable number of days at
 irregular      intervals.     In the animals which have           been systematically
 examined the haematozoa do            not appear abundantly until towards the
 close of the disease ; the largest number which has been estimated near
 the time of death has been 60,000 per cubic millimetre (compare rats
 and mice), but even at that time they may be scanty and difficult to
 find. They are also to be found in the fluid of the local cedema and
 discharge from wounds, conjunctiva, or genitals.                Although haematozoa
 may lie so scanty that they cannot lle discovered by the microscope
 (sometimes        even    after  centrifugalising), the animals show marked
 clinical symptoms.          Their blood has often been proved to be infective.
      4. Ikxp. — Early in the disease, from 4 — 6 days, the haematozoa may
 he absent from the blood, but observations            on their presence during life
 in the lymphatic glands have not been made.                 Towards the end they
 become very numerous (100,000 — 300,000 per cubic millimetre). Varia
 tions in the number of haematozoa are common, but as a rule haematozoa
 are numerous        throughout the disease.
       5. Cuts. — The latent period is about five days         ;  then the haematozoa

110                  Messrs. Kanthack, Durham, and Blandford.
appear in the blood, and, with daily variations, quickly increase in
number.   The variations are sometimes remarkable ; thus on one day
the haematozoa may be extremely numerous,               while on the next      day
they will have become scanty.
      6. Hmse. — Systematic     observations   on this animal, as well as ou   the
donkey, have been made by Bruce.   In our first horse the latent period
was seven days.  The first appearance of haematozoa in the blood was
followed by a sharp rise of the temperature.     After the haematozoa
once showed themselves          they were generally scanty and often absent
(the centrifuge        was not used), but an appearance of the haematozoa in
the blood was generally followed immediately by a paroxysm of fever.
A few days before death, however, the number increased greatly,
falling again to zero two days before death and being low at the time
of death.
   7. (ruinm-pigs. — After a subcutaneous inoculation, a few haematozoa
will generally be found in the blood about the fifth to seventh day.
They may then again disappear and reappear from time to time, to
disappear again after a few days. This alternation may go on for weeks.
Then suddenly the haematozoa become numerous and gradually increase,
sometimes with irregular variations, till the blood is almost crowded,
200,000 — 500,000 per cubic millimetre being present.     The guinea-pigs
die, generally without showing any symptoms, except perhaps convul
sive attacks a day or two before death.
   In some cases no haematozoa have been found in the blood for over
six weeks, although it has been examined daily. They then appeared
in small numbers, and after remaining scarce for a week or so, suddenly
and rapidly increased as the disease approached its fatal termination. It
is, however, more common to find      few haematozoa about a week after
                                         a
inoculation, this being followed by a more or less prolonged period             of
absence.
      In   cases where   the disease runs a less protracted course, the hiema-
tozoa become numerous           about four weeks after the inoculation, when
they are often present in large numbers; but, as in the case of other
animals, the number of haematozoa may be very variable, being almost
enormous one day and very considerably less, or even very small, the
next.       In
             case where the guinea-pig had been bled before inoculation
                 a
the disease ran a rather short course haematozoa appeared nine days
                                               ;
after the infection, rapidly rising in number to over 128,000 per cubic
millimetre, the animal dying after twenty-two days. In        few cases
                                                                    a
where the lymphatic gland corresponding to the seat of inoculation was
examined, haematozoa were found in the gland whilst they were absent
in the blood.

                        On Na.ga.ua, or Tsetse      Fly  Disease.                Ill
                                  B. Lymphatic Glands.
    In the rat the superficial lymphatic glands may be readily examined
by piercing them with fine capillaries or sharp needles ; they may also
be excised and examined            more thoroughly.      Although a considerable
number of observations          have been made by these means, and also after
killing    the   animals    at   various periods after inoculation, we wish to
speak somewhat guardedly, since the appearances are not quite con
stant.     Moreover, we are at present unable to be certain that unrecog
nised    developmental forms have not been overlooked.
    By the study of the right inguinal glands after subcutaneous inocu
lation   in the right thigh, we find that the haematozoa are present from
 one  to three days before they are discoverable in the blood (taken from
 the ear   or right leg).      Again, they may be very abundant in the gland
 when they are still scanty in the blood.           Moreover, the number in the
 blood    may increase, whilst that in the gland decreases.                In these
 earlier stages the haematozoa may be extremely numerous,                   forming
 0ngles and clusters in the lymph gland, whilst only a few scattered
 ones  are to be   found in the blood.     The first appearance of haematozoa in
 the  gland of the other side is apparently associated with their appear
 ance   in the blood.
     The   observations,     fewer    in number,    which   have been made upon
 guinea-pigs, also point to a multiplication         in or about the nearest chain
  of lymphatic glands in the first instance.
     We    have    not yet determined          whether     these haematozoa pass
  directly   into   the  blood    through   the  local  blood   vessels, or whether
  they are distributed by means of lymphatic paths into the main
  circulation.
     The animals may appear comparatively             well whilst large numbers of
  parasites are present in their blood and glands, this is especially the
  case with     rats and guinea-pigs.         On the other hand they ma}' be
   seriously ill whilst the haematozoa are scanty in their blood ; this
   obtains usually     in rabbits, in which animals, as already stated, the
   glands do not become so much enlarged, and it is possible that the
   main effect of the parasites is borne by other organs.           For instance, at
   times the   bone-marrow      has shown the presence of haematozoa, although
   search in other organs and in the blood proved negative.
      After death in the various animals, haematozoa are to be found in
   most cases   in the bone-marrow       and spleen.    The adult haematozoa may
   be common     in these situations when but few are present in the blood ;
   but this is not constant, for the reverse may be the case.             Multiplica
  tion of the parasites certainly takes place in the lymphatic glands (rat)
   as well as in the infected area of connective tissue ; it may also occur
   in the above-mentioned organs as well, and perhaps too in the blood,
   but of this we have no certain evidence.

  112            Messrs. Kanthack, Durham, and Blandford.
     The haematozoa are also found in the fluids of the serous cavities, at
 any rate when they are present also in the blood.
     They have not been found in the intestinal contents, nor have they
 been seen in the urine, except in one case in which haematuria and sub
 mucous petechiae of the bladder were present (rat).
     It is evident from these observations that, in order to investigate
 the development of the haematozoa in the rat, &c., special attention
 must    be   paid  to the seat of inoculation and the nearest lymphatic
 glands.
    Dead and non-motile forms may frequently be found in the circula
 tion and in the lymphatic glands, when the disease is advanced. These
 are less defined and are ghost-like, being somewhat swollen in appear
 ance ; they are also generally in an extended condition.
                         VII.  Toxic Power of the Blood.
    The fact     that  animals   may   appear to be well for days while
 haematozoa are abundant in their blood, suggests that the tnematozoa
 do not secrete much, if any, specific toxin, and indeed so far no direct
 evidence has been obtained       of a potent poison manufactured by the
 haematozoa,    either by secretion  or by chemical changes induced in the
 blood.
    Fresh serum after filtration through Bcrkefeld filters, and blood or
 serum which had been kept for days in a sterile condition till the
 haematozoa had died, have had no specific toxic effects, even when
large quantities have been injected into dogs, rats, or rabbits.     Blood
in which the haematozoa have been killed by exposure to 50° C. has had
no more effect.      The extracts of organs obtained from diseased animals
 have also shown no poisonous properties.
    The whole available blood of highly diseased rabbits has been injected
immediately      after removal into healthy rabbits, without producing
immediate symptoms of acute intoxication.
    The bile of diseased animals does not appear to be more toxic than
that of healthy animals.
    A   cat, into the peritoneal cavity of which a collodion sac full of
fresh infected blood had been inserted, showed no signs of illness. It
was fully susceptible on subsequent inoculation.
    Dogs, when injected with large quantities of filtered serum from an
infected dog, showed no symptoms of a profound toxaemia.
    Our experiments do not point to the presence of any intense specific
toxin oi' poison in the blood.
                        VIII.  Immunisation ami Cure.
    The endeavours to produce immunity, or to cure the disease after    its
establishment, are shortly summed up as follows :—

                            On Nagana, or Tsetse        Fly     Disease.                         113
     1.    Animals which           repeatedly injected with blood or
                                 have    been
serum of nagana animals, such blood or serum having been previously
freed from living haematozoa, either by filtration, heat or by allowing it
to stand         for   a week or longer,     have not shown the slightest degree of
an     acquired immunity.              Rats, rabbits, and dogs have been tested in
this manner, but none of these animals                 have shown any diminution in
susceptibility.
     2.    Animals repeatedly           injected with        extracts       of    the   organs    of
diseased      animals have acquired no resistance.
     3.    The blood of almost full-term fcetuses,                  prematurely born of
highly         diseased    rabbits,    has   been   tried,    but   without the slightest
success      in prevention or cure.
     4.    The guinea-pig being a comparatively resistant                        animal, its serum
has       been used, but it also has no immunising action.
      Repeated inoculations of bile of diseased animals have been with
     5.
out  preventive or curative effects, although in vitro bile, which is always
free from hsematozoa, rapidly destroys the haematozoa. Infective blood
mixed with sufficient bile becomes non-infective,                   but confers no immu
nity.
     6.    Previous     inoculations with the haematozoon of the ordinary rat
 (T.
   mnyuinu) have also been valueless.
     Sewer rats and white rats which have been repeatedly, but unsuc
      7.
cessfully, inoculated with the ordinary rat-haematozoon (T. sanguinis),
and have been proved to be refractory to further inoculations with this
hcematozoon,           have all contracted
                                        nagana when subsequently      inocu
lated,       and have died in the same time as control animals treated with
an        equal dose of   infective blood.
      8.     The young born of infected mothers (dog, guinea-pigs),                        are no
 more        resistant than those born of normal animals.
      9.     As already  stated, by constant transmission through different
 species,       the nagana haematozoon has shown no definite loss or gain in
 the intensity of virulence.
    10. Of immunising sera the diphtheria antitoxin and antistrepto-
 coccus serum have been used, but, as we expected, without the slightest
 effect    :    they neither protect nor cure.
       11.     Dietintj. — Eats have been fed,       on the one hand, exclusively
 with meat, and on the other,             with green vegetables in neither case has
                                                                        ;
 any increased            resistance    or prolongation of life resulted from this
 alteration in diet.
       12.     Excision of the lymphatic glands immediately after inoculation
 or after they have begun         to show enlargement has been of no avail.
       13.     Feeding with haematozoa also conveys no immunity.

                                 IX. Allied   Hormatozoa.
                              1. Trypanosonut    Sanguinis.   .
     As already mentioned, in sewer rats (Mus ileeu-manus) a trypanosoma
  may be found in a certain percentage of individuals. This haematozoon
  is distinct from that of nagana morphologically, and also as regards its
  pathogenic effects.       Thus (1) the T. sanguinis has not been communi
  cated to the dog, cat, rabbit, or mouse, even when large quantities of
 blood were used for inoculation.           (2) In some guinea-pigs it has been
 found in very small numbers in the blood for two or three consecutive
 days, usually from about the fifth day after injection ; but there has
 been no persistence.        (3) In white rats many unsuccessful inoculations
 have been made with the T. sanguinis, even with considerable doses, and
 it appears that the minimal infective dose is larger than with the nagana
 Tni/xiniwmii .      (4) White rats may lose the haematozoon after they
 have been proved to have been successfully inoculated with the T.
 sanguinis.     (5) Some of those which had had, and then lost, the parasite
 proved     refractory on re-inoculation.        Black and white (piebald) rats
 have never been successfully inoculated in our experience.            (6) No rat
 has been successfully inoculated with the T. sanguinis, except at the
 first attempt. (7) We have not been able to recognise any illness after
 successful inoculations with T. sanguinis.          Any pathogenic effect it may
 have must be slight. Infected rats remained alive for months; we have
 not observed any instance where death was to be ascribed                  to  the
 hicmatozoon.
     R. Koch* examined        rats in Dar-es-salam,      and also recognised dif
ferences between the haomatozoon of the local rats and the Tri/panoawrm
 of the    Tsetse   disease.     Whether the Trypanosoma occurring in the
 African rats examined by him is identical with that occurring in our
 English rats we cannot decide, although from the brief description given
by Koch they certainly closely resemble each other.                Nor did Koch
succeed in infecting animals other than rats with the African rat Trypano
soma. He therefore showed that the parasites which occur in the blood
of rats (in Dar-es-salam) do not stand in any relation whatever to the
Tsetse disease of horses and cattle.           In this connexion the observations
of Bruce are of great value, because they prove that in big game the
Tsetse parasite certainly does occur without apparently causing acute,
fatal, or even obvious disease ; in the same manner, this parasite may
sojourn     in the body of the guinea-pig for weeks and months without
interfering with the health and development of the animal for a long
time.     Fm-thermore,      Bruce (in an unpublished report) has made similar
observations on the South African goat and sheep ; he shows that in
these animals the disease runs an extremely protracted course, and
lasts for montha.

                          On Nagann, or Tsetse        Fly Disease.                11 f,
                   2. Trypanosoma     of Surra (Trypanosoma Evansi).
    Koch announces that the disease known                as  Surra in India and the
Tsetse disease of Africa are produced by the same parasite. His reasons
for this assumption are apparently not based on extensive personal com
parative observation.*             Lingard, working in areas naturally infected
with surra, has not clearly distinguished between the Trypanosoma of
surra and that occurring in rats in India. His account of surra as it
occurs in rabbits, and guinea-pigs, and rats is suggestive of this dis
ease being closely similar to nagana, but it is impossible for us to pretend
to give any final decision in the matter.              To illustrate the confusion in
which Lingard has placed the matter, it may be pointed out that he
writes      that    cows, horses, monkeys,       and field    rats are susceptible to
inoculation with the ordinary Indian rat haematozoon, but that rabbits,
guinea-pigs, dogs, cats, and donkeys are insusceptible, but he adds
that the latter animals are susceptible after this rat haematozoon has
been passed         through the horse. He also asserts that surra can be pro
duced in horses by feeding on the excrement of rats.                  These observa-
tions are calculated to create a certain amount of suspicion, particularly
 when it is remembered that Vandyke Carter failed to infect horses with
 the Indian rat Trypanosoma.t                For the present therefore the question
 must be left open till an opportunity arises of studying the various
 parasites at the same time side by side, both in their morphology and
 pathogeny.
                                 3. Trypanosoma    of Rouget. \
    Rouget describes Trypanosoma disease in Algeria, which apparently
 is  identical with the disease described by Bruce.                Judging from the
 drawings and descriptions, his parasite agrees with that of nagana.               He
 will not commit himself as to the identity of his parasite with that of
 surra.      White rats and mice, rabbits, and dogs exhibited a consider
 able    susceptibility, while guinea-pigs, he says, were refractory (possibly
 because he did not recognise the chronicity of the disease).              Sewer rats
 were not always susceptible, while some showed a relative immunity.
 It seems, however, that he did not re-inoculate them so as to test their
  immunity again.            His description of the symptoms and anatomical
  appearances        in mice,  rats, rabbits, and dogs agrees almost exactly with
  our own observations.            He claims to have succeeded in immunising a
  number of      mice    by injecting them with the serum of an infected rabbit
  previous to inoculating the Trypanosoma ; six mice survived altogether,-;

     was useless   ; guinea-pigs   serum   also  had no preventive action.
                          X. Bidoijy of  the  Nagana Hwniatozoon.
         So far our knowledge of the nagana parasite, as that of other Try
     panosomas, is very incomplete.         Rouget* has failed to find forms corre
     sponding to those described by Danilevsky in birds and by Shala-
     shnikov in rats, and Lewis and others have been equally unsuccessful,
     while it is difficult to follow Lingard in his description of young forms.
     -We have not succeeded in tracing a life history, and we are still in
     search of developmental        forms, a task which at present occupies     our
     special attention.
        1.  Most commonly in blood, &c., drawn from infected animals the
     forms described by Bruce are found.              They are generally in active
    movement, and can sometimes lie observed in locomotion with their
    rlagellated end forwards, as Lewis described in the case of other haema-
    tozoa ; in many cases they do not change their position by free swim
    ming, but tend to fix themselves by one or other end to the coverslip
    or to corpuscles or cells in the specimen ; they then exhibit more or less
    rapid oscillations, and may change their position by apparently draw
    ing or pushing themselves in one direction or the other.             Meanwhile
    the vibratile membrane waves rapidly and the protoplasmic body alters
    in shape, becoming thicker and shorter or thinner and longer ; in the
    case of the English rat haematozoon free swimming is the rule ; changes
    in the shape of the body like those of the nagana organism are not
    observed.
        2. The nagana parasites vary considerably both in size and form ;
    they may be long and pointed or blunt-ended and somewhat stouter ;
   some individuals are short and thick with a short flagellum, their proto
   plasm lieing crowded with rounded granules. Still larger forms possess
   ing more than one vibratile membrane are sometimes, though rarely,
    met with.
        3. Especially in specimens taken from lymphatic glands, but also in
   specimens obtained from the blood, &c., there is a clear vacuole at the
    thick end ; this does not become stained with staining reagents ; it
   varies much in size in the different individuals, but we have watched in
   vain for evidence that it is of a contractile nature.
       4.  By means of hsemalum or haematoxylin a nuclear body can be
   demonstrated       in the middle of the parasite ; it is usually oval, but may
   be more      saddle-shaped.      The protoplasm also contains a number of
   granules    which    stain with   basophil reaction (methylene-blue, thionin,
   &c.) ; these are somewhat variable in number, being fewer in specimens
   in which the protoplasm is more refractive, e.g., from lymphatic gland.

 These granules are       distributed irregularly throughout the body of the
parasite ; they do not occur in the membrane or the flagellum.                The
chromatin spot situated close to the non-flagellated end in the T. san
guinis is not defined in the Nagana Trypanosoma.             The T. sanguinis also
does not stain at all readily even by basic aniline dyes (dahlia, fuchsin,
&c), whilst that of Tsetse disease is more readily coloured by these
reagents.
    5. Examples     joined by the poles opposite the flagellum are common
at times, but although they suggest perhaps conjugation, we have no
evidence that this process does really occur.              After prolonged obser
vation no further changes have been noticed in these joined individuals.
    In freshly drawn blood, or in the lymph of lymphatic glands, or in
pleural and peritoneal fluid, when the haematozoa are common, tangles
made up of numerous           haematozoa   have been observed ; this has been
already described by Lewis.          The haematozoa often converge with their
non-flagellated ends towards one common point. In lymphatic glands,
Wore the haematozoa are found in the blood, such tangles may be
present in great numbers.
                 consisting apparently of two individuals joined side by
               •
    6. Forms
side by their bodies, the flagella being free, have been observed on rare
occasions ; from prolonged observation in the living state we have no
reason    to suppose that these are undergoing longitudinal fission.
Especially in kept blood, &c., many of the hsematozoa may present a
rhomboid     outline whilst still motile.
    In drawn blood      or serous fluids    the haematozoa eventually become
motionless ; this may        occur rapidly, for instance in twenty minutes,
but   generally   some motile specimens can be found after two to three
(lays — sometimes, indeed, after as long as five or six.          When they are
abundant, the tangles above noted are formed.              Then the bodies of the
organisms become rounded,         the nuclear bodies becoming more distinct
and   readily stainable (haematoxylin or basic aniline dyes). At the same
time the vibratile membrane or fin and the flagellum separate, forming
a rather rigid filament.       Eventually (generally after three to four days)
masses    of spherules alone remain ; these apparently correspond to the
nuclear bodies.       In numerous experiments these structures have uni
formly proved to be non-infective, and it must therefore be inferred that
if they are not simply degeneration products, they require other con-
ilitions for their further development than those that are found in warm
blooded animals.        All individuals, however, do not pass through these
changes   ; some,    or  even all, may simply become non-motile, stiff, and
pale, at the same time retaining their form.           In numerous attempts at
cultivation in normal blood, similar phenomena are observed without
any evidence     of multiplication.    Within    a corpse, the blood and organs
become     non-infective in about     twenty-four hours, the changes in the
hsematozoa    being similar to those just described.

118                 On Nagano,,   or  Tsetse Fly  Disease.
    Exposure for several hours in an atmosphere of hydrogen or CO., has
no appreciable effect on the motility of haematozoa in blood-free serous
fluids.   The haematozoa are also fully active in hosts killed by ether,
chloroform,   or coal-gas.
    7. Oval forms, smaller than the ordinary haematozoa, with (or without)
a short flagellum, and often with a
                                         " beak " at the
                                                         opposite pole, have
been observed in the organs, but rarely in circulating blood.
    8. Small rounded or ovoid bodies, about 1 — 2 /i in diameter, hyaline,
sometimes with a refringent chromatin spot or bipolar spots, or irre
gular (1 amceba-like) bodies, also sometimes with a chromatin spot and
of the same size or rather larger, have been observed, especially in the
lymphatic glands and bone-marrow, or spleen. It is possible that these
are early stages in the development of the haematozoon.            No forms
have been seen at any time within the red blood corpuscles.
    9. Neither sporocystic    nor larger distinctly amceboid forms have
been observed.
    As our observations on the development       of the parasites are still in
an incomplete condition,    this short statement must suffice, and a more
detailed description must be left for a future occasion, when we submit
a  full report upon our work.

   In  a communication       on the sensory nerves of muscles laid before the
Society last year,* the question previously raisedt as to the existence

of afferent nerve fibres in the so-called " motor cranial nerves for the
muscles of the eye was advanced to the following position. Myelinated
nerve-fibres    from the ITIrd cranial and IVth cranial nerve-roots were
traced    into the tendons of the recti and oblique muscles. Since then
control observations have been made. The ophthalmic division of the
Vth cranial has been severed at its origin, and with it the Vlth cranial
trunk.      This has been done in the monkey.                  The condition of the
nerve branches going to and lying within the muscles and tendons has
been examined after an interval of twelve to fourteen days.                  Those of
the external rectus contained        nothing but degenerate nerve-fibres, save
for a few fine myelinate fibres, probably from the ciliary ganglion.
Those of all of the other eye-muscles contained exclusively •healthy
nerve-fibres.     The sensorial musculo-tendinous organs of the eye-muscles
are, therefore, not innervated by the ophthalmic division of the tri
geminus.      On the other hand, the nerve-fibres of the external rectus
muscle behave, after severance of the Vlth cranial nerve, in the same
way as my previous papers showed those of the other eye muscles                     do
after section of the Illrd and IVth nerves.
   A contribution towards the physiological inquiry into the matter                has
been made as follows, and has given a clear reply.                  The conjunctivae,
both palpebral and ocular, and the cornese of. both eyes have been ren
dered deeply anaesthetic to cold, warmth, touch, and pain by liberal
applications of cocaine.       Then in a completely dark room the power to
direct the gaze with accuracy in any required direction has been tested.
The person under examination is seated, with the head securely fixed,
in front of a screen.      One of his hands carries a marker.             The hand is
moved by an assistant, and is made to mark the screen at some one
point ; it is then passively replaced.            The person under observation
(hiring this time keeps the eyes open in the primary position or sits
with them closed. He is then required to direct his gaze to the spit
marked on the screen.         The light is then switched on, and the point to
which the gaze is turned is noted.           The power to direct the gaze under
these circumstances has been found to remain good.                  If for co-ordinate
execution and ability to perform the delicate adjustments for training

     A quartz sphere,            0"9 diameter, weight T004 grams, was sus

120       seconds.    A second quartz sphere, 6"6 cm. diameter, weighing
399-9 grams,       with its centre on a level with that of the first and

      The axis of the smaller   sphere was horizontal and perpendictdar to
the line     through  the centres.   Any directive action should manifest
itself as   a periodic couple, producing forced oscillations in the smaller
sphere.

the    115-seconds         period.       By taking      a   large number of periods, the
mean reading       for     each phase should be freed to        a  great extent from other

122     On tfie Formation, &c,     of Carbohydrates in      Monocotyledons.
   The quadrantal     and semi-circular     series of observations   both    gave
evidence of periodic     vibrations of  1 15 seconds,  but so small that they
could only be put down as giving superior            limits, and not at all as
proving the existence of the couples.
   Assuming that the gravitation constant in the quadrantal case is G
for parallel and G' for crossed axes, the existence of a couple enables us
to find (G   - G')/G, and the observations show that this fraction is not
greater than 1/16500.
   Assuming that the gravitation constant in the semi-circular         case is G
for like parallel axes, and G' for unlike parallel axes,         -
                                                              (G G')/G     is not
greater   than   1/2850.    The  semi-circular    vibration  outstanding after
the elimination of disturbances was much greater than the quadrantal,
no doubt owing to the fact that want of axial symmetry would itself
lead to a semi-circular couple ; and though an attempt was made to
eliminate the effect, it was probably unsuccessful.

   The paper is divided into two parts, the first dealing with the
formation of starch by assimilation in the leaves, the second with the
occurrence of starch and inulins in the reserve-organs of various
Monocotyledons.
   The author has investigated about seventy species, belonging to all
the principal groups of Monocotyledons, some of them at various
different stages of growth, and finds that starch due to normal assimi
lation in the leaves occurs in very different amounts in different genera.
Relatively few produce much, and some form none at all, but species
from most of the principal families form some starch in their meso-
phyll.
   On comparing the type of leaf, its position and age, the habit of
the plant, and the period of normal activity, the author is led to
suggest that some connection exists with the storage or non-storage of
temporary starch.      Broad and cauline leaves, those of aquatic Mono
cotyledons, and those working at higher temperatures in the summer,
seem more prone to have starch than narrow radical leaves, those of
forms in dry situations, and those of spring species.          That the age of
the leaf affects the question is shown by the results with Allium, a
genus long known not to form starch under ordinary conditions : the

           Observations on the Effects   of partial Thyroidectomy.        123
author finds that starch is developed      even in this plant in the young
leaves.
    The starch of the stomatal guard cells is next examined, and the
difficulty of depleting these cells discussed.     In experiments with cut
leaves exposed to sunlight little or no appreciable increase of starch
could be obtained.       In experiments with pieces of leaves floated on
sugar solutions, cane sugar was found to produce starch far better than
any other; invert-sugar, glucose, and fructose follow next in order,
and maltose is almost useless.
    The necessary details of the experiments, and discussion of results
and   previous h'terature are given in the full paper.
    In Part II the author deals in detail with certain inulins which he
has discovered in Scilla nutans and Galanthus nivalis, and shows by the
examination of many other genera that inulin is by no means uncom
mon in Monocotyledons.
    The inulin of Scillu is remarkable for its easy solubility in cold
water, while that of Galanthus requires water at 80° C. for solution ;
ordinary inulin from Helianthus and other Compositse dissolves at
about 50° C.
    The proofs of the inulin nature of these bodies, their reactions and
mode of occurrence are worked out in detail.            Contrary to previous
assumption, inulin and starch may co-exist in the same cell.
    It is interesting to note that aquatic species do not store inulin,
apparently, but that it is common in those inhabiting dry situations ;
the author regards the concentrated solution in the cell-sap of such
plants as useful in resisting drought.
    The paper concludes with a detailed examination of the behaviour of
 the starch and inulin in the bulb of Galanthus at various periods
 throughout its whole annual cycle of development,              comparing  the
stages   with those  in the bulb  of Narcissus.
    Summaries of the literature, and illustrations, accompany the full
paper.

    Further Observations on the Effects of Partial Thyroidectomy."

     Two years ago Vassale and Generali published some interesting
  experiments on the thyroid; they found that excision of the four
  parathyroids that occur in dogs (leaving the thyroid lobes) was fol
  lowed by symptoms       practically identical with those produced by exci
  sion of the entire thyroid, including the parathyroids.

124                                 Mr. W. Edmunds.
   These       observations     I   have   repeated eighteen experiments
                                                      :                    were
made in dogs      in all it
                    ;               was intended to excise all the parathyroids.
leaving,   as a rule, the thyroid proper ; but in seven it was subse
quently found that one, and in one case two, of the smaller para
thyroids had escaped excision ; these seven experiments were therefore
cases of partial parathyroidectomy or parectomy.
   Of the eleven experiments in which the whole of the parathyroids is
believed to have been removed, in two, one of the thyroid lobes was
removed at the same time ; of these two, one dog died the night after
operation and the other survived the operation, but died when the
remaining thyroid lobe was subsequently removed.
   Of the nine cases in which the parathyroids only were removed,
four died : one in two days, one in four days, one in seven days, and
one in twenty-eight days.
   The other five survived the operation, two after temporary symptoms
and three without.
   Thus of the nine total parectomies, four died, two rficovered after
symptoms, and three without.
   The five which recovered were submitted to further excision of one
thyroid lobe, and       they survived this) of the other thyroid lobe.
                          (if
Two died after removal of the first lobe, one died after removal of the
second lobe, and two survived even this, which amounted to total
thyroidectomy, but they both had temporary symptoms.
   The symptoms produced by these operations were (1) tremors, (2) a
slow and most unstable gait, sometimes going on to paralysis of the
hind limbs, and (3) emaciation and weakness.
   In two of the dogs an interesting eye symptom was noticed, viz.,           a
narrowing of the palpebral fissures with apparent recession of the eye
balls. This occurred in one dog who succumbed to excision of the para
thyroids only, and in one dog who survived this, but died after excision
of one thyroid lobe.
   In six of the eleven    cases microscopic changes were found in the
thyroid  lobes left at the  excision of the parathyroids  these changes
                                                                ;
were (1)   adiminution or absence of the colloid in the vesicles, (2) an
excessive amount of intervesicular young thyroid tissue, (3) multiplica
tion of secreting cells in the thyroid vesicles, and (4) the secreting cells
becoming columnar.       These changes are very similar to or identical
with those descrihed as compensating             hypertrophy of the thyroid, and
to those found in Graves's disease.
  In   sevendogs the larger parathyroids were removed, but was sub-  it
sequently found that one, and in one case two, of the smaller para
thyroids had escaped excision, these were therefore cases of partial
parectomy.
  Notwithstanding         the incompleteness of the excision, in one of these
cases the animal        succumbed to the operation after seventy-two days.

            Observations oii the Effects       of partial Thyroidectomy.        125
The other six dogs did not die, but four of them had temporary
symptoms ; they were submitted to further thyroid excisions, from
which they all died, one after simultaneous excision of both thyroid
lobes, three after removal of one thyroid lobe only ; two survived this
operation, one of them having temporary symptoms                   ; these both died
after removal of the remaining lobe.
    In this series, too, besides the usual symptoms            of tremors, unstable
gait and paralysis,            emaciation and weakness, eye symptoms were
oliserved, — in four out of the seven dogs.
    In two, after the partial parectomy, the eyes became unduly promi
nent, but subsequently, after a further operation on the thyroid, the
palpebral fissures became narrow, and the eyeballs retracted.
    In one of the partial parectomies no change was noticed, but after
 one of the thyroid lobes had been excised the eyes became unduly
 prominent, and after the remaining lobe had been excised the palpebral
 fissures became narrowed, the eyeballs retracted, and the animal died.
     In one, after removal of some of the parathyroids, and also, after an
 interval, of one of the thyroid lobes, no change was noticed ; but after
 the removal of the remaining lobe with a parathyroid attached, the
 palpebral fissures became narrowed, and the eyes retracted.
     Altogther in the eighteen dogs operated on, ocular changes were
 noticed in six.
     In  the  partial parectomies,        changes in the thyroid lobes left were
 also observed, the same          as those found in complete parectomies and in
 Graves's disease.
     Similar    effects    on the eyes were also noticed in monkeys, but these,
 eight of them, were subjected to           total excision of the thyroid including
  the parathyroids       ;   four of the monkeys died as a consequence of the
 operation    :  one    in thirteen days, one in thirty-six days, one in sixty-
  eight days, and        one in 262 days ; three of them were treated with
  thyroid extract,      but this, although it produced marked benefit, did not
  save their lives.         One monkey was killed by accident ; the other three
  are still alive.
      As to their eye symptoms          :  in two the    eyes appeared to be more
  prominent, and the palpebral            fissures  were   wider; and in two the
  palpebral fissures were narrowed, and the eyes appeared sunken.                 In
  four no change could be seen.            Drawings of the monkeys were made,
  before and after operation.

                                              (Abstract.)
    The experiments here described consist mainly in determinations of
the least degree of supersaturation                   necessary to cause water vapour to
condense on nuclei from various sources.
    As in former experiments* the supersaturation                    is brought about by
very sudden expansion of air or other gas originally saturated with
water     vapour, the expansion required to produce a fog or shower of
drops being measured.                  The expansion is expressed in terms of v.,|vv
the ratio of the final to the initial volume.
    The following classes of nuclei have been studied in this way : —
    1.   Nuclei produced by Rontgen rays.
    2.       „           „          „ uranium rays.
    3.      „            „          „ ultra-violet light.
    i.       ,,          „          „ sunlight.
    5.       „           „          ,, metals in contact with the gas.
    6.       „           ,,         „ the action of ultra-violet light on a negatively
                                            electrified zinc plate.
    7.       „           „          ,, the    discharge of electricity from a pointed
                                            platinum wire.
    In addition the behaviour of the nuclei in an electric field has been
studied,       with the object of distinguishing between " ions " and nuclei
which      carry no charge of electricity.
    1.   The action of strong X-rays on the gas diners from that of weak
rayst     merely in the number of nuclei produced, the supersaturation
required        to cause water to condense on the nuclei remaining unaltered.
 The value of v.Jvl corresponding                   to this degree of supersaturation
 (approximately fourfold) is equal to l-25.
     2. Uranium compounds, whether inside the expansion apparatus in
immediate contact with the gas or contained in a glass bulb outside the
apparatus J, produce nuclei requiring the same degree of supersatura
 tion as those produced             by X-rays.

    (Expansion experiments        probably   furnish one of the most        delicate
methods of detecting these rays.)
    3. Ultra-violet light acting on moist air or oxygen produces nuclei
 which, when the radiation is weak, require quite as great a degree of
 supersaturation   to  cause water to    condense on them as those produced
 by X-rays. With stronger          radiation, however, the nuclei appear to
grow, the expansion required to produce a cloud now depending on the
strength of the radiation and on the time for which the gas has been
 exposed to the rays before expansion.            With very strong ultra-violet
 light  the  growth    of  the  nuclei, even  in unsaturated     air, continues till
 they become visible (as stated in a preliminary note).*               The pheno
 mena are then like those observed by Tyudall with certain vapours
 exposed to ordinary light.         That nuclei are produced when ultra
 violet light enters an expansion apparatus through a quartz window
 was discovered by Lenard and Wolff, but they believed them to
.arise from disintegration of the quartz.          That these nuclei arise not
at the quartz, but throughout the volume of the air exposed to the
 rays, is capable of experimental proof in a variety of ways.             In hydro
 gen even strong      ultra-violet  light produces comparatively        few  nuclei,
 these requiring also as great a degree of supersaturation as the nuclei
 produced by X-rays in order that water may condense on them.
    4.  Sunlight produces in air nuclei which require large expansions
 (vji^ about 1 -25) in order that water may condense on them.
    5. Certain metals in moist air produce nuclei, always requiring great
 supersaturation    in order that condensation may take place on them.
 The supersaturation        required is generally as great or greater than
 that required in the case of X-ray nuclei.        In the presence of amalgam
ated zinc dense fogs      are obtained  with  expansions, which in the absence
 of the metal only result in the formation of a very few drops.               Clean
 surfaces of zinc or lead have a similar but much slighter effect ; with
 copper or tin it is inappreciable.          These phenomena are obviously
 closely connected with the effects which these metals exert on a photo
 graphic plate, studied by Russell and others.
    6. Ultra-violet light acting on a negatively electrified zinc plate pro
 duces condensation nuclei, as was proved by the steam jet experiment*
 of Lenard and WollF. The nuclei, however, are not, as these obser
 vers supposed, produced by disintegration of the metal, for expansion
experiments show that they are identical with the nuclei produced by
 X-rays with respect to the degree of supersaturation required to cause
 condensation   to take place on them, and therefore entirely unlike dust
 particles.   In hydrogen the maximum number of drops in the fogs
 which result on expansion is obtained with comparatively weak fields ;
 no nuclei are produced when the zinc is positively electrified.

sion,           = 1-25, in order that condensation may take place on them.
         fi/Pi
If    the expansion      he made while the discharge is taking place no fog is
obtained       with smaller expansions.        The results are not so simple if the
expansion        be   made   after   the   discharge has ceased, apparently         on
account of some secondary effect of the discharge causing the nuclei to
grow.        No nuclei were produced unless a glow could be observed at
the point of the wire.
     Effect  nf an Electric Field.
                                   — When air exposed to X-rays is enclosed
by two parallel plates, between which a sufficient difference of potential
is maintained, the fogs obtained on expansion are very much less dense
than in the absence        of the electric    field, and if the rays be turned off
before expansion all the nuclei          are found    to have been removed, whereas
 without any electric field a fog is obtained even if the expansion be not
made      till some seconds after the rays have been cut off.           This behaviour
of the nuclei        proves   them    to  be charged       particles  or "ions."   The
 nuclei produced by        uranium rays behave in a similar manner ; those
 produced by       the action   of ultra-violet light on moist air, or by the pre
sence of metals, are entirely unaffected by an electric field.                They are
 therefore not ions but uncharged nuclei.                   (Since the nuclei produced
 by the action of metals on air or by weak ultra-violet light require just
 as great a degree of supersaturation               as those produced by X-rays to
 cause water to condense on them, the difference in the behaviour of the
 two classes of nuclei can scarcely be due to a difference in size.)               The
 nuclei which escape from a negatively electrified plate under the influ
 ence of ultra-violet light are of course charged.
     It follows from the experimental results described in this paper that
  the passage     of electricity through gases is effected by charged particles
  which have an identical effect as condensation nuclei, whether the con
  duction is the     result of exposure of the gas to X-rays or uranium rays,
  or  of the action of ultra-violet light on a negatively charged zinc plate,
  or  consists in the escape of electricity from a pointed platinum wire.
  In all cases the degree       of supersaturation        required to make condensa
 tion take place on these particles is        approximately fourfold.*
     The nuclei which are produced and grow (in air or oxygen) under
  the action of ultra-violet light are uncharged, in their initial stages at
  least ;   they are therefore not electrified water drops.              It is possible
  that   they are water drops containing in solution some substance, per
  haps    H202, produced within them by the action of the ultra-violet light
  in  quantities sufficient to counterbalance          the effect of the curvature of
  the surface     upon the vapour pressure necessary for equilibrium.

"
    The Origin of the Gases evolved on heating Mineral Substances,
       Meteorites, &c." By Morris W. Travers, D.Sc,     Communi
       cated by Professor W. Kamsay, F.E.S.    Received November
         14,— Eead November 24, 1898.
  The study of the gases evolved on heating mineral substances has
been made the subject of a number of investigations, and the results
have formed a basis for speculations as to the origin and history of
these substances.
    In   a paper entitled " The Gases enclosed in Crystalline Rocks and
Minerals,"* Professor Tilden has suggested a theory to account for the
evolution of gases by mineral substances under the influence of heat.
He considers that the gases, which are given off on heating certain
rocks and minerals, are actually present in those substances in the
gaseous state, enclosed in small cavities under high pressure. To
account for their presence in these cavities he makes the suggestion,
" that the rock
                  crystallised in an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide
and steam, which had been, or were at the time, in contact with
some easily oxidisable substance, at a moderately high temperature.
Of the substances capable of so acting, carbon, a metal, or the pro
toxide of a metal, present themselves as most probable."
   Beyond the fact that minerals give off gases when heated, there                          is,
except in the case of carbon dioxide, no direct experimental evidence
to show that these substances really contain the gases in the free state.
In many cases no cavities can be seen in thin sections of the mineral,
and as a mineral yields about the same quantity of gas when ground
to  afine powder as when       itonly broken into small pieces, the cavities
                                    is
must be assumed to be very minute         they exist at all.
                                              if                 do not con
                                                                        I
tend that   it  impossible for
                 is               rock to contain considerable quantities
                                     a
of gases enclosed in cavities, but      propose to prove experimentally,
                                          I
that at least in some cases where      mineral or rock yields gases other
                                          a
than carbon dioxide on heating, those gases are produced during igni
tion, by the interaction of its non-gaseous constituents.          shall first
                                                                           I
consider the formation of carbon monoxide            and     hydrogen from
minerals and rocks which contain as active constituents only water,
carbon dioxide, and ferrous oxide.
    Aglance through the results of the analyses of some such substances,
and of the gases evolved by heating them, will show that the quantity
of hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced bears        certain relation to
                                                                   a

heating the substance.    In the following table the quantities of ferrous
oxide and water are expressed in terms of weight per                    cent.  ;   the   gases

    The talc lost only 0'06 per cent¦ of water when heated in the hard glass tube,
renainder came off at a very bright red heat.
  S
    The felspar contained free iron.
  The estimation      of the ferrous iron was conducted                       in the following
manner.       The sulphuric acid(30 per cent.), previously boiled and
cooled in a corked flask, was poured into the bottom of a thick-walled
glass tube.  The mineral was weighed out into a small test-tube with
a glass    rod sealed to the bottom of           it to support it above the sulphuric
acid   in the large tube during exhaustion.  The tube was drawn out at
the    end as in fig. 1, attached to a Topler pump by a rubber tube,
exhausted,and sealed at the capillary. After heating to 1 70° — till the
mineral was entirely decomposed — the tube was again attached to the
piunp as in fig. 2, the   point of the capillary was broken inside the rubber
tube  and the gas contained in it was pumped out and analysed.      The
tube was afterwards cut open and the ferrous sulphate was estimated by
titration with a solution of potassium permanganate.  In the case of the
mica    it was necessary to   use     strong sulphuric acid to decompose the
mineral.
   In general, the gas contained in the sealed tube consisted only of
carbon dioxide.   In the case of the felspar from Peterhead granite, and
of certain helium-yielding minerals, the gas also contained hydrogen.
I shall deal with these minerals separately.
  That the minerals, which on heating give hydrogen and carbon mon
oxide, give neither of these gases when decomposed by means of dilute
sulphuric acid, is almost sufficient evidence to show that the gases are
not present in the minerals iti a free state, either occluded, or enclosed in
cavities. That the amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide pro
duced by heating a mineral         as     is,
                                        have shown, proportional to the

amount of ferrous oxide, water, and carbon dioxide present' in           may             it,
be taken as evidence that the gases are produced by the interaction of
these      substances when the mineral            is    heated, according           to the equa
tions  :—

                                     If    this is the case, the mineral, after   ignition
                                  in mam, should contain less ferrous oxide            than
                                  it did originally ; the difference between              the
                                  quantities of ferrous oxide before and              after
                                  heating should be equivalent to the hydrogen
                                  and carbon monoxide evolved ; and these may
                                  be calculated from the equations written above.
                                    One c.c. of hydrogen or carbon monoxide is

                                    In order to prove this experimentally. I
                                  selected a chlorite from   Zoptan in Moravia.
                                  This mineral contained      10-60 per cent. of
                                  ferrous oxide, 4'79 per cent. of water, and con
                                  sequently gave       a considerable    quantity of      hy
                                  drogen on heating.   It was also quite free from
                                  sulphides, which seriously interfere with the
                                  accurate estimation of ferrous oxide.
                                    A  weighed quantity, about 10 grams, of the
                                  chlorite was heated in a hard glass tube till it
                                  ceased to give any gas.  The gas was collected
                                  and   analysed, and the loss of weight of the
                                  mineral was determined, by weighing the hard

    This number agrees very closely with that already obtained.
    The application of this method of investigation is very limited, as it
 is difficult to obtain minerals which are quite free from sulphides and
 carbonaceous       matter, and which     at the same     time   give on heating     a
 sufficient    quantity of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.                 Other speci
 mens     of chlorite    gave large    quantities  of  hydrogen      on  heating, but
 they were found to contain sulphides.
    The minerals and rocks, which had been investigated up to this
point, had all been of igneous origin.           At Professor Bonney's sugges
        I
tion, next proceeded         to  determine whether minerals of aqueous origin.
containing ferrous oxide, water, and carbonates, would give hydrogen
and carbon monoxide on heating.               Professor Bonney kindly obtained
for me a specimen of chalk marl, rich in glauconite, from the Cambridge
beds.
    The glauconite was freed from chalk as far as possible by washing
with dilute hydrochloric acid.           The residue, seen under the microscope,
appeared to consist of foraminiferous casts, with adhering grains of
glauconite.        The sample taken for the experiment contained 1-33 per
cent, of     ferrous oxide,     15  per cent. of water,      and 13'7 per cent. of
calcium     phosphate.
    Heated in a hard glass tube to a dull red heat for some time, only
5-7 per cent. of the water was given off with a considerable quantity
of gas, which was found on analysis to have the following composi

  The greater part of the hydrogen and hydrocarbons is probably pro
  duced by the breaking down of organic matter in the mineral.                   This
  organic matter may be due to infiltration from the surface, but, con
  sidering the treatment the mineral had received, it is more probably
  contained in the foraminiferous casts, the decomposition products of
  their original occupants.
     The presence of manganous oxide in minerals appears also to favour
 the production of hydrogen and carbon dioxide ; indeed, it has long
 been known, that when moist manganous carbonate is heated, these
 gases are always produced along with carbon dioxide.
     The first reactions which take place when the mineral is heated, may
  be expressed by the equations       : —
                           MnO-f H.,0         =   MnOj   + H,
                           MnO + CO,          =
                                                  MnOJ + CO.
 But it was found that when cerite,          a  mineral which contains   a consider
 able quantity of manganous         carbonate       was heated, the gas contained
 not only hydrogen,      but oxygen, the product of a reaction taking place
 at a somewhat higher temperature           : —

                              3Mn02           Mn304 + 02.
 Analysis of the gas obtained by heating               finely powdered   cerite gave
 the following results : —

    Yttrotantalite, samarskite, &c, containing lower oxides of uranium,
also give small     quantities of hydrogen when heated.              The  hydrogen
may be    produced according to the equation :—
                          3U0,  +  2H,0     =    U,Og  + 2H2.
The quantity of hydrogen is not, however, very large.
    Minerals containing sulphides usually give a mixture of hydrogen,
sulphuretted hydrogen, and sulphur vapour when heated. The quantity
of gas is often very large, but the reaction is too complicated for direct
investigation. It is probable that the sulphides react with water

     It is known that certain crystalline minerals contain liquid hydro

obtained nitrogen from quartz            highly improbable.

that the gas was introduced accidentally in the course of the experiment.
I     stated earlier in this paper that the felspar from Peterhead granite
exhibited certain peculiarities, and that should describeI                    it
                                                                       separately.
The granite consisted of very large crystals of quartz           and felspar with
a   comparatively small quantity of mica of a dark colour. On heating,                       a
mixture of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen was given off.
    In order to ascertain whether these gases were derived from each of
the minerals, or whether any particular one gave more gas on heating
than the others,    I   crushed      large quantity of the granite in an iron
                                       a
mortar and picked out the constituents, separating them from one
another as far as possible.        The mica was easily obtained quite pure,
but the quartz and felspar could not without very great trouble be
separated from one another             in fact, the felspar always contained
                                         ;                                                   a

   These  results show that the mica and felspar are responsible for
nearly the  whole of the hydrogen, while the greater part of the carbon
dioxide is derived from the quartz.    The carbon dioxide is prolxibly
present in cavities   in  the quartz, but if the hydrogen were also
present in cavities, one would expect that it would be also obtained in
greatest quantity from the quartz, the only mineral of the three which
has no cleavage ; one     would not certainly expect to obtain it from the
mica.
   As the felspar gave off gas in the cold when treated with dilute
sulphuric acid, a weighed quantity of the mineral was placed in a thick-
walled tube, with a second tube containing 50 per cent. sulphuric acid.
The tube was drawn to a point, exhausted, and sealed in the manner
already described.    After heating for twenty -four hours to 170° the
gas was  pumped   out and analysed, and the ferrous sulphate in the solu
tion was determined.
   The following results were obtained from two samples of felspar
from different parts of the same block of granite.     The quantities of
gas are expressed in cubic centimetres per gram : —
  Ferrous oxide in solution                       (a) 4-02 p.c.     (b)   2-05 p.c.

  From these results      I   was led to suppose that the felspar contained
both free iron and ferrous       oxide, since if we calculate the amount of
iron which would be equivalent to the hydrogen evolved, we find that
expressed in terms of ferrous oxide,
   3'50 c.c. of hydrogen per gram      = 2-25 per cent.     of ferrous oxide,

Quantities which are considerably less than the quantity of ferrous
oxide found by titration.    On the other hand, it is possible that some
of the hydrogen is taken up by the ferric compounds present, lessening
the yield of hydrogen, and increasing the quantity of ferrous sulphate
in the solution.
   There   is,
             unfortunately, no accurate method of estimating the free
iron in minerals.    The copper method apparently fails in the presence
of hydrated ferric oxide, on account of the secondary reactions which
take place between that compound and copper sulphate, and subse
quently between the ferric sulphate and precipitated copper.
   In order to prove that        considerable amount of free iron was
                                 a
present in the  felspar, two weighed quantities of felspar from the same
sample were heated with 50 per cent. sulphuric acid and 96 per cent.
acid respectively.    The gases were subsequently pumped out of the
tubes and analysed, and the ferrous sulphate was estimated           the         in
liquid.

action of water and carbon dioxide on ferrous oxide and metallic iron

   Both the gas obtained by heating the felspar and gases obtained
from the sealed tube experiments contained traces of hydrocarbon.     This
may be accounted for on the assumption that the free iron in the felspar
contains    a   small quantity of carbide.

varying proportions, and attempts have been made to draw conclusion

the gases            by heating them.
                obtained                These speculations are based

Mallett* found 10 per cent. of nitrogen in the gas from a meteorite
from Augusta Co., Virginia.                 Wrightt examined a large number of
meteorites, and found that in almost every case the gas contained
nitrogen. In this case, however, the presence of nitrogen can easily
be accounted for, as no particular precautions were taken with regard
 to the thorough exhaustion of the apparatus employed.                          A Sprengel
                        "  which was kept running till the air was thoroughly
 pump was used,
removed, as could be seen by the gauge."                  Dewar]: found nitrogen, in
 quantities not exceeding 4 per cent. of the total gas, in the gases from
 samples of meteorites and graphite.
     In one single case a meteorite has been                found to yield a trace             of
 helium on heating.§
     With regard to the carbon dioxide and combustible gases, it is diffi
 cult to obtain direct evidence as to their origin. In the case of
 meteorites containing bituminous matter and carbonaceous nodules, the
 evolution of these gases may be attributed to the destructive distilla
 tion of their constituents.             Meteorites of the stony variety appear to
 evolve more carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons, and less hydrogen and
 carbon monoxide, than those which are of a metallic nature.                           Several
 specimens       of stony   meteorites     have  been  carefully examined by Wright
 and Dewar with the following results : —
      Wright (he. cit.) found that in the case of a stony meteorite from

      The meteorite lost about 10 per cent. of its weight of water on
  heating.       The water was allowed to collect in the apparatus, and as no
  drying reagent was used, it is easy to account for the presence of
  hydrogen in the gas. The carbon dioxide may have been present as
  an unstable hydrated carbonate, or in the state of occlusion in the
  pores of the substance.
      Dewar (loc. cit.) showed          that a meteorite of a similar nature was
  capable of reabsorbing water and carbon dioxide after the gases had
  been removed           by heating in maw.             The following results were
   obtained    : —

    The quantity of water reabsorbed after the second heating was very
small, and it is interesting to note that the quantity of hydrogen
evolved during the subsequent heating was also very small.                       From
this  it would appear that the hydrogen was produced directly from the
water.      There is no evidence to show whether the carbon dioxide
entered into combination         with some constituent of the meteorite, or
not.
    Meteorites of the second class usually consist chiefly of metallic iron,
nickel, &c., with small        quantities of crystalline minerals, such as
olivine.     The presence of these minerals, which are usually hydrated
silicates containing ferrous oxide, might in themselves account for the
formation of hydrogen.         The carbon monoxide might be produced by
the interaction of carbon dioxide, the product of decomposition                    of a
carbonate, with the metallic iron.           The small quantities of hydro
carbon, which are also present in the gas, and which appear to belong
to the saturated       series, might be produced        by the action of water,
which     is  invariably present, upon metallic         carbides.      The changes
which take place are      probably of a complicated nature.
    In order to ascertain whether a sample of meteoric iron actually
contained occluded or enclosed gases, the following experiment was
 performed.      A piece of meteoric iron was cut into fine shavings, which
 were carefully cleaned.       The metal was divided into two portions ; one
 part was heated in a sealed tube with copper sulphate and water, in the
 manner already described, the other was heated in vacuo.                  The gases
 evolved were in each case collected and analysed.
                                                                               Copper

     The trace     of  hydrogen      which was produced during the copper
 sulphate experiment may well be attributed to secondary relations
 between the metal and the salts in solution.
     It would appear then that the gases produced by the action of heat
  upon meteorites are not present as such, but are the products of decom
  position of their non-gaseous constituents.        It is therefore impossible to
  draw conclusions as to the former history of a meteorite from the
  nature of the gases which      it gives on heating.

                                     Helium ami Argon.
      With regard to the state in which helium is present in the minerals
   from which it is obtained by the action of heat, there is at present no
   conclusive    evidence.      It  must be present       under one of three condi
   tions : —
           I. In combination with some constituent of the mineral.
          II.  Occluded ; or in solution in the mineral.
        III.   Enclosed in cavities under pressure.
      Microscopic examination of the minerals, from which helium has
  been derived, has failed to reveal the presence of cavities, and, indeed.
  if we assume that cavities exist, and that they contain all the helium
 present in the mineral, we have to make further assumptions to explain
 why the helium escapes when the mineral is heated, although in most
 cases no disintegration takes place.                It seems improbable that the
 helium is present in the state of solid solution or occlusion, a condition
 of which we yet know little, for unless we assume that the rate of
 diffusion of the helium through the mineral in which it is dissolved is
 infinitely small, the gas should long ago have escaped into the atmo
 sphere.      Further, it is probable that the supposed cases of solution of
gases, like hydrogen, in solids such as platinum, palladium, &c., are
really cases of chemical combination, as has recently been proved by
the researches of Ramsay, Mond, and Shields, and even in meteoric
iron it is improbable that the hydrogen is not present as such, but is
 the product of secondary reactions.             Indeed, in the state of our know
ledge    at  present  it is impossible    to  draw   a distinction between occlusion
and chemical combination.
     We are, therefore, forced to the conclusion that helium is present in
the minerals in the state of combination with one of its constituents.
It may be well to review such positive evidence as exists in favour of
such a supposition.
     In the first place       the gas is not found generally dispersed among
crystalline     mineral    substances,    but seems only associated with certain
elements, uranium, yttrium, &c., in minerals which are invariably vein
 products.
     It has been pointed out by Professor Ramsay and the author,* that
in certain cases the evolution of helium from the mineral is accom
panied by a considerable evolution of heat, and in one case by a con
siderable decrease in density.             This matter has been dealt with fully
in the paper (loc. cil.), and is considered as evidence in favour of
chemical combination.             Julius Thomsent has confirmed this obser
vation.

           evolved on healing      Mineral Substances, Meteorites,          tye.    141
    A  series  of experiments were undertaken to determine the conditions
 under   which    the minerals gave off helium.              It was found that from
cleveite helium was evolved, but very slowly, at the temperature                       of
boiling quinoline,      and    somewhat     faster  at the    temperature     of boiling
sulphur.       At a bright red heat a considerable quantity of helium
was obtained, but in no case did the mineral lose the whole of its
helium under the influence of heat alone.
   By heating cleveite to redness for some hours a mixture of helium,
hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide was obtained ; the
gas came off readily at first, and appeared finally to cease altogether.
   A quantity of the same sample was completely                       decomposed by
means of      sulphuric acid (30 per cent.) in an exhausted                sealed tube.
The results are given below : —
                        By heating the mineral.      By action of sulphuric acid.
      He                 1 -487 c.c. per gram.      3201 per cent. per gram.

      CO,               2-298
   It will  be noticed that only half the helium is given off on heating
the   mineral; this makes it appear probable that if the helium is
present in the mineral originally in a state of binary combination the
decomposition takes place according to the equuation : —
                                 XHe2    =  XHe    + He.
A  specimen     of fergusonite was also examined, but the results were not
altogether satisfactory, as it was found to be practically impossible to
completely decompose the mineral by the action of 30 per cent, sulph
uric acid ; strong sulphuric acid appeared to be still more inactive.
When fused with acid potassium sulphate a larger yield of helium was
obtained but the mineral was not completely decomposed.                     The follow
ing figures indicate     that   about  half  the  helium    contained   in  the mineral
is liberated under the influence of heat.

   It  is somewhat      significant that both cleveite and fergusonite yield
hydrogen when decomposed by sulphuric acid.                      If the helium were
present in combination          with  a metal it would eventually be liberated
as a hydride.      It is probable that the hydride would be a very unstable
 compound and would decompose at the moment of formation.                        Part of
 the hydrogen would probably be token up by the ferric and uranic
 compounds, and part would escape in the gaseous state.                        A similar

reaction would take place between sulphuric acid, and an iodide, in the
presence of a reducible substance, at a higher temperature.
                                         Conclusions.
    It   would appear that the only evidence on which the assumption
that         of a permanent character, such as hydrogen, carbon mon
         gases
oxide, nitrogen, helium, and argon, exist in the free state in the mineral
substances from which they are evolved on heating, rests on certain
observations with regard to the cavities which can sometimes be
detected by microscopic examination.
   The cavities may be either apparently empty or they may contain
liquid, and when the mineral is warmed the liquid disappears at a
temperature which is a few degrees below the critical point of carbon
dioxide or of some hydrocarbon.      The fact that the critical temperature
of the liquid is a little below the point corresponding to carbon dioxide,
in the case of a mineral containing that substance, is not, however, of
very great significance as pointing to the presence of a permanent gas.
A small quantity of methane would produce the same result.*
   Further, although it can be shown that compact minerals do enclose
carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons, gases which can easily be liquefied,
the analogy cannot be extended to gases such as hydrogen and helium
in connection with minerals like chlorite, mica, and cleveite, which
exhibit many cleavages.
   On the other hand, there        as        is,
                                         have endeavoured to show, a con

decomposition    or  interaction  of  its   non-gaseous constituents   at the
moment of the experiment.        The results of such experiments cannot,
therefore, serve as basis for speculation as to origin and history of the
substances in question.

which the metal of an alkali salt                  is   liberated when the salt      is   vaporised

in a flame.     By some the liberation is supposed to         be effected thermally
by chemical    dissociation  ; others suppose that the salt is converted into
hydrate or oxide, and then reduced by the flame gases. It is also note
worthy that, however the metal be liberated, and however oxidisable it
may be,   light is emitted from parts of the flame where oxidising gases
are  in abundance, and where even less oxidisable metals in the massive
state are   rapidly oxidised.
   The primary object of the experiments described in this paper is to
ascertain whether the luminosity imparted by vaporised salts to flames
is related in a definite manner to the electrical conductivity of the salt
vapours.      The conductivity of vaporised salts in flames has been in
vestigated by Arrhenius,* who concluded that it was of an electrolytic
character.     In the case of alkali salts, Arrhenius supposes that the
salt vapour is acted upon by the large quantity of water vapour in the
flame, in accordance with the following equation —
                          M'X'+H20       =  M'OH     +  HX',
•and  that the metallic hydrate so formed         undergoes     partial electrolytic
                                 +            -
dissociation into the ions       M arid (HO).       From the analogy stated to
¦exist between     dilute solutions of solids and matter in the gaseous
state, and from his own theory that in dilute solutions electrolytes sire
in greater or less degree dissociated into their ions, Arrhenius was led
to believe that electrolytes distributed in small concentration through
out a gas, would likewise be electrolytically dissociated, — a view to
 which his results as above stated, are conformable.
   Since,   according to the electrolytic dissociation theory of Arrhenius
as   applied to dilute solutions, the metallic ion in virtue of its electric
¦charge   can persist in an oxidising medium, it appeared that if the
same theory were really applicable to salts vaporised in flames, it would
afford an explanation both of the liberation of the element, and of its
persistence in the midst of an oxidising atmosphere of flame gases.
   Another consideration appeared to favour this hypothesis.                Accord
ing to Arrhenius, the conductivity of a salt vapour is proportional to
the square root of its concentration            in the flame, and according to
Gouyt the luminosity of a flame coloured by an alkali salt also follows
within certain limits, the same law.
   The motive of the present authors was to test the above hypothesis,
and incidentally to gain increased knowledge of the circumstances that
govern the electrical conductivity of vaporised salts.

maintained apart for any length of time.                  The gas and air supplies
were regulated    with  great care,     and   the air supply was made to actuate
a sprayer, whereby an extremely fine spray of any salt solution could
be led into the flame.      The devices used in regulating the gas and air
supplies, and the precautions necessary in the construction and use of
the sprayer, are described in the paper.
    The electrode system which usually consisted of two coaxial cylinders
-of platinum-indium alloy, was fixed symmetrically in the space between
the two cones of the flame.
    The source of electricity consisted of three accumulators, from which
by means of a German-silver wire, 20 metres long, and two contact
pieces, any E.M.F. up to 5-7 volts could be used.                For higher E.M.F.'s
Leclanchc; cells were used.
                               3. Method     of Working.
    After the apparatus had been adjusted, the current in either direction
between     the electrodes was measured by a Kelvin high resistance
galvanometer for a series of E.M.F.'s.             The constancy of the apparatus
 was tested    at intervals during the progress of the experiments by
 measuring the conductivity due to a TVth normal solution of potassium
bromide, and the results were satisfactory.
                       4. Conductivity     of  the Free Flame.
    From the observed conductivity due to a salt, it was necessary to
 deduct the conductivity of the flame gases alone, and that of the water
in the spray.      This value, which is very small, was determined by
 measurements made when distilled water only was sprayed.
                              5. Unipolar Conduction.
    Considerable    unipolar effects were noticeable in the experiments,
 and measurements of these are given in the paper.
       6. Measuremen I   of the Concentration      of Salt-vapour in  tlw Flame.
    It was not necessary for the purpose of the enquiry to determine the
 absolute amount of salt between the electrodes ; but for the purpose of
 instituting some comparison           with the results of Arrhenius, a rough
                 * Smithells,  '
                                 Phil. Mag.,' vol.  39, p. 122, 1895.

                    On Flames containing Vaporised Salts.                         145
 measurement of the amount of salt was attempted by a photometric
 method. It appeared that the amount of salt conveyed to the flame
 was about eighteen times as much as in the corresponding experiments
of Arrhenius, so that it was possible to investigate the conductivity of
salt vapours at greater concentrations than was done by Arrhenius.
         7. Relation   between    Current Strength and Electromotive      Force.
    Experimente were made with a large number of salts, and with a
 difference of potential between the electrodes varying from 001 volt
 to 45 volts. The results show that with small E.M.F.'s up to 02 volt,
 Ohm's law is accurately obeyed. With greater E.M.F.'s the law is not
obeyed, the deviation becoming greater in increasing proportion as the
E.M.F.     is increased.
    The general relationship between current strength and E.M.F. was
expressed by Arrhenius          as follows  : —
                                       C =  A/(E),
where C is current strength, E the E.M.F., and A a constant dependent
on the solution sprayed.             This expression is only valid for the pre
sent results within certain limits. With the more concentrated solutions
it is not applicable.
    Acting upon a suggestion           of Professor     J. J.   Thomson, the authors
have found an equation capable of expressing the relationship between
C and E in a remarkably complete way. This equation is based upon
the work of Thomson and Eutherford* on the passage of electricity
through gases exposed to Eontgen rays, a phenomenon which has
several points of external resemblance to that of conduction through
flames. The equation is —
                                       C =a' + i-iE,
where    i  bears the same relation to the          E.M.F.    as the  current in X ray
conductivity.       Tables are given in the paper showing to what extent
the above equation expresses the results obtained.
                    8. Influence    of Temperature     on Conductivity.
    Experiments were made in which the electrodes were raised or
lowered, so as to bring them into regions of different temperature.
The temperature differences were measured by means of a platinum
platinum-rhodium thermocouple.                The results showed that the con
ducting power of the salt vapour increased very rapidly with increasing
temperature, and that at temperatures not greatly below those which
the vapour attains in flames, the conductivity would become inappre
ciable.

  e.    Caesium salts — Chloride, nitrate.

 /.     Hydrogen salts — Chloride, sulphate.
                                :
  The concentration      of the solution varied from ij^th to        normal.              1
As an example of the range of work,          may be stated that potassium
                                                          it
iodide was investigated with         ^v, ^v, y^y, ^^ normal solutions, in

0-227 volts.    The set of measurements was repeated more than once.
as a rule, in order to avoid errors.
   The results show that at small concentrations equivalent solutions
of all salts of the same metal impart the same conducting power to the
flame.    At higher concentrations this equality no longer holds good                                     ;

increasing concentration the molecular conductivity of the                                         oxy-salts
passes through   minimum value.

salts.
  The conductivity increases   with increasing atomic weight of the
metal, the increase being more rapid in the case of the oxy-salts than
in that of the haloids.

with that of alkali salts. Ammonium salts being decomposed in the
flame, behave like their acid component.  Sulphuric acid     doubtless                   is
also decomposed in the flame.    The conductivity of hydrochloric acid

                        On Flames containing        Vaporised Salts.              147
      was measured      with  a view to subsequent experiments,       and was found
     to  be — with  a  half-normal solution — five or six times      as great as that
     of the vastly     more concentrated      water vapour     which existed in the
     flame.
           11.   Experiments with Deeolorise-l Flames containing Salt-Vapours.
         When chloroform vapour is passed into a flame containing a salt-
     vapour, the    colour is suppressed, owing to the large amount of hydro
    chloric acid formed.        The conductivity of flames in this condition was
    determined      and   compared as nearly as was possible with the con
    ductivity of flames containing the same amount of vapour, but no
    chloroform.       The salts of lithium, potassium, and caesium were used.
    It was found that the conductivity of the flames was not largely
    affected by the decolorisation.         With small E.M.F.'s the conductivity
    was somewhat diminished, but with an E.M.F. of 5-6 volts an increase
    was   always noticed.
               12. Conductivity of Salts vaporised in   the Flame of Cyanogen.
       The view of Arrhenius is that salts are hydrolysed in flames by the
   water vapour present, and that the hydrate furnishes the ions. To gain
  some      idea of the influence of water vapour, the cyanogen flame was
  chosen       as a medium for the volatilisation of salts.       Such a flame con
  tains    only the water coming from the sprayer.              No differences were
  noticed      in the behaviour of the several salts that would not have been
  found      equally in a coal-gas flame.
       The high general temperature reigning in a cyanogen flame causes a
  high degree of conductivity.            A dry salt vaporised into a cyanogen
  flame from a platinum wire shows great conductivity, and thus it seems
 certain that the presence of water vapour in tho flame is not necessary
 for the     production of ions.
                                    General  Conclusions.
      1.  The authors conclude from their experiments, that the conduc
tivity of vaporised salt is of an electrolytic character, but that there are
features connected with it that distinguish it from electrolytic conduc
tion in aqueous solution. Thus Ohm's law is only obeyed within certain
limits, and the general relation between current strength and electro
motive        force can only     be  represented    generally by   a more complex
expression.
    2.   The conductivities of different salts differ greatly, according to
the electropositive constituent.
     3. Among different salts of the same metal differences of conductivity
kktu LXTV.                                                                  N

148                         Anniversary Meeting.
appear at the higher concentrations, but at low concentrations equiva
lent solutions have equal conductivity.
   4. The conductivity of the haloid salts as a group is distinct from
that of the oxy-salts.
   5. The conductivity of the haloid salts of a metal among themselves
increases with the increasing atomic weight of the halogen.
    6. The conductivity of the oxy-salts of a metal is approximately
equal, and approaches that of the hydrates.
    7. The more easily oxidisahle halogen salts are probably partly con
verted into oxide in the flame, so that their conductivity is composed
of two parts.
    8. The behaviour of the salts in flames supplied with chloroform
 vapour seems to establish the fact that the conductivity and the colour
produced by the salt vapour are not due to a common cause.
    The coloration of   a flame by an  alkali salt does   not seem therefore
to be connected with the ionisation of the salt.       It must be attribute" 1
to the metal set free by a chemical process.          This process consists
probably   in  a  reduction   effected by  the  fkmie   gases.   An oxy-sak
would, generally speaking, form in the first instance an oxide, which
would then be reduced.          In the case of haloid salts it seems also
necessary to suppose that an oxide is intermediately formed, the metal
then being liberated by reduction.

     Read December       8, 1898.
   In  a paper   by the author,      read before the Royal Society on May
12, 1898,*   the results    of some experiments were given showing the
change in the value of the hysteresis of soft iron transformer plate
when subjected to continued baking at temperatures not exceeding
200' C.    The experiments there described have since been extended to
higher temperatures, and the results for heating at temperatures up to
700° C. are given below.
   The same specimens were used as in the former experiments, con
sisting of soft Swedish iron transformer plate which had been re-
annealed.     The baking at these high temperatures was carried on in a
specially  constructed    electric  oven heated by coils of platinum wire
wound on a mica frame, inside a metal vessel completely surrounded
by a lagging of silicate cotton except for a mica tube through which
the specimens and thermometer were introduced. By this means, any
desired temperature could be maintained up to a bright red heat, so
that the apparatus could be also used as an annealing furnace.             As the
specimen and thermometer         were situated within the heating coil they
could   be very  rapidly brought up to the desired temperature, which
was read direct on a Callendar-Griffiths platinum pyrometer.              Regula
tion was effected by alterations in the grouping of the coils as well as
by outside resistances.      The measurements of hysteresis were made as
before with Professor Ewing's hysteresis tester, the specimens being
removed periodically from the oven and tested at atmospheric tempe
rature.
   A   number   of short runs at various        high temperatures    were taken.
The results given in Table       I and fig. 1 represent    the means of several
independent observations      at each temperature.
   The absolute values of the hysteresis           are given in ergs per cubic
centimetre per cycle (for B     = 4000), together      with the rise expressed as
a percentage of the initial hysteresis to the nearest 1 per cent.            The
general features of the action are similar to those noticed before at
                                                                                  '
more moderate temperatures.          They should be compared with fig. 2 of
the former paper.        The initial rise of hysteresis is more rapid the
higher the temperature, but the subsequent fall takes place sooner, and
the final state is one of lower hysteresis the higher the temperature,
until at about 700° C, a temperature just short of that required for
complete annealing, the hysteresis falls again to quite its original value

after  a very short time,     At temperatures above this, no trace of any
rise has been observed.
   The question at once suggested         itself whether iron which had been
heated at a constant temperature          with the effect of causing its hys
teresis to pass a maximum and to become reduced, would have its
hysteresis again increased by exposure to more moderate temperatures,

 152               Mr. S.  R  Eoget.   Effects of prolonged
 or would show some degree of immunity to temperature effects.             It
 was found that the susceptibility to change at moderate temperatures
 was not by any means entirely removed by prolonged heating at high
 temperatures.      The subsequent action of low temperatures was, how
 ever, slower than in freshly annealed iron, especially after the high
 temperature    had been applied for a considerable time, also it appeared
 that temperatures at 500° or 600° C. produced less effect on the
 susceptibility to subsequent change at lower temperatures than was
 produced by more moderate degrees of preliminary heating.            A com
 plete series of experiments on this point, however, has not yet been
 made, only a few samples having been re-heated in this way, but the
results obtained with these were consistent, and pointed to the above
 conclusions.
    The latter part of the action at the higher temperatures resembles an
incomplete annealing, as there appears to be little difference between
the state after the iron has been heated for a few hours at a tempera
ture just short of the " critical
                                    "
                                      temperature at which ferromagnetic
 quality disappears, and that of the same material which has been
heated above this temperature so as to become completely annealed.
    The above experiments, and those in my previous paper, refer to one
particular brand of iron, all the specimens having come from the same
sheet.    A  few examples, showing how widely different is the behaviour
of different brands of steel and iron, are given in figs. 2 and 3.       The
data for these diagrams are to be found in Tables         II and III,  where
 the absolute values of the hysteresis in ergs per cubic centimetres per
 cycle are given together with the rise expressed as a percentage of the
initial hysteresis.
    Figs. 2 and 3 relate to various samples of commercial iron and steel,
some of which were supplied by makers in this country and some from
America. Fig. 2 shows the effects of heating at 120° C, and fig. 3
shows the effects of heating specimens of the same iron at 230- C.
The curves, numbered alike in both figures, refer to the same material.
All these samples were initially in the annealed state. No. 1 is a piece
of the iron used in the previous experiments, and is given here for the
sake of comparison.       No. 2 is a sample of special transformer steel of
equally low initial hysteresis.    The action of heat on it is similar in
general characteristics to the action of No. 1, but much less in degree.
No. 3 is practically " non-ageing," even in the annealed state, and
although not of such low initial hysteresis as some of the other speci
mens, would be the most suitable for transformers on account of its
immunity from change by prolonged heating.            No. 4 is a sample of
sheet-iron not specially made for transformers ; it is of poor magnetic
quality, but is interesting as showing, at 120° C, effects which require a
higher temperature in the other brands of iron ; the initial rise is very
rapid, and the subsequent fall of hysteresis is clearly shown, even at

the annealed state, although this identical sample appeared to be prac
tically unaffected by heating for a fortnight in the state in which it
was supplied, but was then of somewhat higher initial hysteresis.                       It
is interesting to notice that this iron if annealed before use in a trans
former would ultimately, through low temperature heating, show much

more hysteresis than            if left in the state in which it was submitted by
the manufacturer.
     The author      has      no information    as    to the treatment by which this
remarkable                  "                  "
                  degree of   non-ageing            quality had been produced.  The
general characteristics of the action at 230° C. on the different samples
(see fig. 3) are much the same, differing only in degree. No. 3     again,       is,
little changed by prolonged heating.
     Itseems from these and other tests, that brands of transformer steel,
which are practically " non-ageing," are obtainable commercially, but
they are not (at least in these examples) of such low initial hysteresis
as the  " Swedish iron," which was
                                    formerly considered the best mate
rial for transformers.   The effects of annealing vary much in differ
ent samples.     All the samples tested after annealing have been
found to lie more liable to change in that state than in the state in
which they were supplied by the makers.      The method of annealing
and rate of cooling may have much to do with the " non-ageing
                                                                      "
quality of the material.    Incidentally the experiments have given
some evidence that samples of iron may undergo       slight change in a
hysteresis, even keptif  at atmospheric temperature for  three or four
years.
     It
     may be convenient to briefly summarise the chief effects of pro
longed heating on the magnetic properties of iron which have been
observed in these and the previous experiments.
     1.   Material in the annealed state       is    more liable to change than         in   a
harder state.
     2.   All   the changes produced       by prolonged heating are completely
removed by re-annealing.
     The heating need not be continuous
     3.                                                    ;   the same cumulative     effect
isproduced by    number of short periods at
                    a                         given temperature as by
                                                               a
a continuous heating at the same temperature.
   4. The effect may be regarded as being due to two actions super
posed, one tending to increase the hysteresis, this action being the
more prominent at lower temperatures      the other analogous to an
                                                       ;
incomplete annealing, tending to decrease the hysteresis, this action
predominating at higher temperatures.
  5. The liability of the material to increase in hysteresis at moderate
temPerature8      not removed by prolonged heating at higli tempera
                    is
tures.
      The change
     6.              confined to the lower part of the B.-H. curve, the
                         is
saturation value of the magnetisation being substantially unaltered.
      The effect
     7.              produced equally, whether the iron
                         is                                   or     not    is         is
exposed to the air during heating.
   In conclusion the author wishes to express his thanks to Professor
Ewing, for placing at his disposal the facilities which have enabled
these experiments to be carried out, and for much other kuid help.

     Anatomy, University College, Sheffield.                     Communicated by

                                        (Abstract.)
                                   General Purpose.
   This paper embodies the results of an enquiry into the topographical
anatomy of the abdominal viscera in man.                  The work falls into two
main parts.      First, that dealing with the relations of the viscera to
the surface of the body ; and, second, that dealing with the relations
of the viscera to one another.
   With regard       to   the   first part   :   It   is to be remarked       that the
methods of mapping out the abdomen at present in general use are
open to certain objections ; for the reasons that the lines used to
divide the abdomen        transversely are drawn at variable distances from
one another, the variation not being determined by the dimensions of
the body ; that the points between which the upper transverse abdominal
line is drawn are very variable in their level, so that in some cases the
transverse    lines come very near together leaving a large part of the
abdomen above them not mapped out ; in other cases the lines may be
far apart : and, moreover, the points between which the upper transverse
line is to  be   drawn are not always easily determined, and it happens

                    Anatomy of the Abdominal Viscera.                      157
that   in many cases the line,       if drawn correctly, is not horizontal.
For these reasons the transverse       lines as fair and uniform divisions  of
the abdomen,    and as guides to the deeper parts, lose very much value.
Further it is desirable for practicable purposes that the determination
of the positions    of parts of the viscera in regard to the surface by
measured distances,     in centimetres   or inches, as so much above, below,
to the  right or left of certain points or lines is to be avoided as much
as possible, seeing the very great variations that       occur in the dimen
sions of the trunk even in adults.
   The author has therefore sought to elaborate first some method of
abdominal surface-marking       which shall be independent of the variable
surface points, which shall be unvarying and uniformly proportionate
to the size of the trunk, which shall be easily determined and in which
the lines used to divide the abdomen shall be possessed of such constancy
both in regard to the bony skeleton and the viscera that they them
selves become   reliable land-marks.
   With regard to the second part of this enquiry : Many very accu
rate measurements of the position of individual organs or parts with
regard to the surface of the body are recorded.         But it is of great im
portance that,   in any one case, not only the position of any one organ
should be recorded,      but that of all the other organs or parts in its
neighbourhood, for in this way ouly can we discover the degree of
interdependence in the positions of the various organs, and the extent, if
any, to which when they are enlarged, or diminished           in size, or dis
placed, they tend to cause alterations in the positions of the various
neighbouring organs ; and, from the clinical point of view, it is per
haps as important to determine       that changes in the shape or position
of any one organ do not tend to cause alterations in the position of any
other particular organ, as to determine that they do.           In the second
part  of  this enquiry therefore, by studying       and  comparing a series of
cases, the author has endeavoured        to determine the forces which main
0in the various mutual relations of the abdominal viscera or which
cause alterations    in shape or displacements of them either as a whole
or with regard to one another.         And in this connection has been con
sidered, in the same manner, the position, and changes in position, of
the various lines of the peritoneal attachments to the body wall.
                                    Method.
   For obtaining the maps of the viscera the bodies of forty subjects,
taken consecutively, were examined in the fresh state, with the exception
of two bodies that were hardened before examination by fluid injections.
In all but a few cases, the examination was within thirty hours after
death.    The examination was conducted in the following manner :—
Tables   were prepared in each case recording the stature of the individual.

158               Dr. C. Addison.      On the Topographical
the general condition, the cause of death, the dimensions of the trunk
in various directions, the distances from one another of the various
bony and other surface points       and their relations to the lines used    to
divide the abdomen, and various         other  general and particular facts.
At the end of the examination the relations of the various surface lines
to the vertebral column and the parts at the back of the abdomen were
measured and recorded, as     will be explained.   These tables are presented
in an appendix as the Individual Case Tables.
    The different bony and other surface points, the parts of the costal
arch, and the lines used to divide the abdomen in their appropriate
positions were then drawn on the life-size scale on large sheets ruled in
 centimetre squares.
    The abdomen was divided vertically by three lines, a middle line
 and two lateral lines, one drawn' upwards on each side through a point
 midway between the anterior superior spine of the ilium and the
 middle line.     Lines were drawn transversely across the trunk through
points a quarter-way, half-way, and three-quarters of the way along a
 tape drawn from the pubes to the supra-sternal notch.         The lower two
 transverse lines were abdominal.       Steel pins 14 inches long, sufficiently
 thick, so as to ensure rigidity, and with long well-sharpened points, were
 then hammered through the abdomen at right angles to the table, into
 which they were driven when they failed to fasten themselves in the
 bony skeleton.      Six pins were driven through the abdomen ; three in
 each transverse plane, one on the middle line and one in each lateral
 line.
    The anterior abdominal      wall was then cut      free  of the  pins and
 reflected so as to completely   expose the parts beneath.
    The various viscera and other parts were then measured          in relation
 to the pins in various directions at the point of transfixion, and a life-
 size outline of them made on the ruled sheets.            No parts were dis
 turbed    before   measurement, and they were cut away piecemeal, as
 required,   to expose the parts beneath.     In this way, at length, a com
 plete map of all the viscera was obtained in relation to the pins pro
 jecting the surface-marking     through the abdomen.       The same applies
 to the lines of the peritoneal attachments.       Subsidiary drawings were
 made, as might be required, of peritoneal pouches or other parts, and
 of the viscera from different aspects.      At the end of the examination
 the relations of the pins to the parts of the skeleton behind and to the
 brim of the pelvis were recorded and drawn. A map of the viscera
 was in this way obtained both in relation to the surface lines and to
 the different bony and other surface points, so that if the method of
 dividing the abdomen had lleen found unsatisfactory, the measure
 ments could be transferred to any other system.           Outlines of all the
 viscera and the chief surface points from each case are represented on
  one sheet on the life-size scale in the Case Plates of the Appendix.      All

the individual   separated viscera are represented, grouped along the
various planes used to divide the abdomen, on the one-ninth scale in
different parts of the paper ; and in various other manners by means
of diagrams,          curves, and tables their correspondence and variations
with regard to the surface and         to one another are set forth. Finally,
full details of all the measurements of the viscera, and their averages,
are given in the   Measurement Tables in the Appendix.
  Various hardened, fcetal, and adult preparations have been made to
elucidate or illustrate different points in the paper.
  In the course of the paper each organ                         is considered       somewhat    as
follows       :— Its average position in regard to the surface
                                                         ; its variations
in regard    to the surface ; its average position in relation to other
viscera ; its different variations in regard to them ; the causes of its
variations ; its shape and movements.
                                               Results.
  The value of the method                  of the proportionate division of the abdo
men, already described,                 for the purposes of surface marking is well
established.          Indicating some of the chief points —
  First,         concerning   tlte   upper transverse       abdominal line, halfway between
the pubes         and the supra-sternal notch —         :
  It    found to practically correspond with the disc between the first
        is
and second   lumbar vertebrce — in 67 -5 per cent. of the cases it was
within half an inch of this disc ; its greatest distance from the disc, and
that only in one case, was 1 inch.       It corresponded in the average at
the costal arch with the tip of the 9th costal cartilage ; but it is
superior to that part for surface-marking           purposes because (a) its
vertebral variation was not so great,      and  (Ji) it can always readily be
obtained, whilst the tip of the cartilage in many subjects cannot be
localised.
   In regard to deeper parts, a horizontal plane at this level (a) practically
bisects the stomach as it overlies the middle line in the average of cases.
      (b)    In 72-5 per cent. of the          cases    it guide to the
                                                             was correct   as   a
level       of
         the pylorus  in these cases either passing through the pylorus
                               ;
or corresponding with one of its borders.
      (c)   In the right lateral line
                                   represents the place where the gall
                                               it
bladder overlies the duodenum, and, when the liver     not enlarged or     is
displaced downwards,   the plane passes just above the highest point of
the hepatic flexure of the colon.
   (d) To the  left of the middle line, nearly halfway between the middle
line and the    lateral line, indicates the highest point of the duodeno
                                        it
jejunal flexure and the upper border of the mesentery, which in 85 per
cent.     the cases were not situated more than
            of                                          cm. away from the
                                                                       2
plane one way or the other.

creas, usually about its upper third, and in the left lateral line                                    it
represents, in the average, the anterior border of the pancreas, this
part being, in 70 per cent. of the cases, at or within  cm. of the plane.2
   (/) In the left lateral line represents, in the absence of distended
                                                it                               a

the stomach, the attachment of the transverse meso-colon, and the
upper border of the transverse colon.

                                                                 it
of the basal surface of the spleen.
   Second, concerning the lower transverse abdominal line, quarterway from
the pubes to the supra-sternal  notch :—
  It   occupies    very regular
                         a      position with regard to the ilium, repre
senting practically Cunningham's intertubercular plane.           normally    It   is
situated     inches above the anterior superior iliac spines, and
                2                                                   found,              is
in regard to these points and the highest parts of the iliac crest, to be
somewhat less variable than the umbilicus.     In regard to vertebrae,                           it   is
situated over the upper part of the fifth lumbar vertebra.
  In regard         to   deeper parts   :— (a) It represents the place where the psoas
muscles diverge from the lumbosacral promontory, and passes                              a    little
above the inner attachment of the meso-sigmoid.
  (b)   In the right lateral line   represents the upper border of the
                                                     it
ileo-colic junction — the inner border of the ascending colon at this
point being situated immediately external to the lateral line.
   (c) In the left lateral line   passes   little above the commencement
                                                it        a
of the meso-sigmoid    — the inner border of the descending colon at this
point being situated immediately external to the lateral line.
   Third, taking plane across the abdomen midway between the trans

verse lines — For practical purposes
                    :                       represents in each lateral line
                                                          it
the lower pole of the kidney, passing         little above that of the right

the turning inwards of the peritoneum to form the commencement of
the transverse meso-colon       and in the middle line the crossing of the

   Fourth, taking      plane midway between the lower transverse

represents in the right lateral line the root of the appendix, and little                    a

mesentery and the innermost point of the caecum.
  This aspect of the paper, however, need not be further                             enlarged
upon.           An indication        has        been given     of the position of some of the
more important points of various parts around which others may be
easily filled in. Suffice  to say, that. as with regard to the surface
                                        it

to the more stable                 surface points,        such as the parts of the ilium and

the                notch, as well with regard to the more variable parts
          infra-sternal
of the costal arch and the umbilicus, were fully worked out, and are set
forth in the paper.
     Further,               in regard    to deeper parts       and   the    various       visceral        dis
placements              :   —
     1.     In   connection with the           stomach — (a)
                                        It is found that a low position
of    the stomach,
                 even combined    with distension,   is not sufficient to
cause material  downward displacement of the pylorus, but that that
part, firmly bound with the first part of the duodenum to the liver
requires downward displacement or enlargement      of the liver — particu
larly of its omental tuberosity  — for it to be substantially moved
downwards.
       Lateral displacements of the pylorus also are found more related
      (b)
to the condition of the liver than to that of the stomach           and the                 ;
evidence does not point to any considerable displacement of the pylorus
to the right in the filling of the stomach.     Similarly, displacements of
the duodenum and the head of the pancreas to the left are associated
with    low position of the lower border of the liver.
          a
       Concerning the "stomach-bed" described
      (c)                                                  Birmingham, the   by
parts behind the stomach vary with the condition of the stomach in
this manner — When the stomach
                            :            distended or situated low down,
                                                        is                                                 it
flattens out the pancreas, increasing the vertical extent of its gastric
surface and diminishing the prominence of its anterior border and the
depth, antero-posteriorly,   of its inferior surface; and the pancreas                                     is
further pushed down over the face of the left kidney, leaving an
increased gastric surface of that organ exposed above its upper border.
The reverse of all these processes takes place when the stomach                                             is
pushed upwards    by distended intestines below.
   (d) The  stomach  does not displace the left kidney downwards      in                              ;
fact the position of the left kidney     not found to vary directly with
                                                         is
that of any other organ in its neighbourhood, but      chiefly dependent     is
for its maintenance                     upon   the strength of its         enveloping       connective
tissue.
  It may here be mentioned, that the level of the left supra-renal body
in relation to the left kidney   determined very much by the level of
                                                   is
the pancreas with regard to the kidney.   When the pancreas       pushed                        is
down          over the     kidney the supra-renal body follows        but   not       it,            is
depressed           to so great an extent  and the reverse takes place when the
                                                    ;
pancreas    pushed upwards.

      The duodenum and the head of the pancreas have
     2.                                                  considerable                 a
range     level compared with the vertebral column — as great as, or
              of
greater than, that of the right kidney.  These alterations in level of
the duodenum    and the head of the pancreas are found to be chiefly
related to the position and size of the liver — which, on the other hand,
does not appear                 to   be potent   to displace the right kidney downwards.

    3.  Although     the ascending    colon usually makes a considerable
 impression    on the right kidney, yet that part of the bowel is not an
indispensable    support of the right kidney ; the bowel may be displaced
 away   from   a  right kidney situated at a level, as high, or higher than
 usual.    The right kidney is chiefly maintained in its position by the
 strong attachments of its enveloping connective tissue, particularly to
 the right crus of the diaphragm.
    4. Prolapse of the mesentery is commonly associated with prolapse
 of the splenic flexure of the colon, but more directly associated with the
 condition of the liver and stomach, as far as the forces above it are
 concerned.
    The costo-colic     ligament  is the chief agent in determining the
 position   of the splenic flexure of the colon, and, though commonly
 giving way before a liver and stomach displaced or enlarged down
 wards, may maintain the position of the splenic flexure of the colon in
spite of them.
    5.  Although in the foetus the arrangements of the coils of the small
intestine perhaps generally follow certain plans, as far as these cases
go, the coils do not appear to maintain these arrangements in the adult
with any special uniformity.
    Many other points in the paper of importance do not admit of being
explained or indicated in an abstract ; they are especially the pirts
dealing with the variations in the level of the cardiac orifice of the
stomach, and the relative levels of the two orifices of the stomach — the
varieties   in shape of the stomach, how that there appear to be four
chief types, and that the first and commonest is particularly noticed in
those cases in which the transverse colon occupies a high position — the
relations of the stomach to the liver — the shape and moulding of the
pancreas by the stomach, and how that the presence of a well-defined
omental tuberosity on the pancreas is associated with a distended and
low position of the stomach, not especially with distension only — the
abnormalities      of the duodenum as illustrated in these cases — the
position, direction, and moveability of the lower end of the ileum — the
peritoneum on the large intestine — the classification of the position
and attachments of the vermiform appendix, the changes in its position
with regard to the caecum, and the associated conditions ; and the
changes in the position of the caecum itself and the associated condi
tions — the varieties in shape of the transverse colon ; prolapse of the
transverse colon and the associated conditions — the description of the
meso-sigmoid, especially the length and attachments of its outer limb,
and the resulting condition of the upper part of the sigmoid flexure     of
the colon.

     1.   The object of this memoir is twofold : first, to develop the theory
 of reproductive         or genetic selection* on the assumption that fertility
 and     fecundity     may be heritable characters ; and, secondly, to demon
 strate    from two concrete examples that fertility and fecundity actually
 are  inherited.
    The problem         of whether fertility is or is not inherited is one of very
 far    reaching consequences.          It stands on an entirely different footing
 to the question          of inheritance     of other characters.          That any other
 organ or character        is inherited,  provided     that   inheritance is not stronger
 for one value of the organ or character than another, is perfectly con
 sistent with the organic stability of a community of individuals.                       That
 0rtility should be inherited is not consistent with the stability of such^
 community, imless there be a differential death-rate, more intense for the
offspring of the more fertile, i.e., unless natural selection or other factor
of evolution holds reproductive selection in check.                    The inheritance of
0rtility      and   the   correlation  of   fertility    with  other  characters    are prin
ciples momentous in their results for our conceptions of evolution ; they
mark a continual tendency in a race to progress in a definite direction,
unless equilibrium be maintained by any other equipollent factors, exhi
bited in the form of a differential death-rate on the most fertile. Such a
differential death-rate probably exists in wild life, at any rate until the
environment changes and the equilibrium between natural and repro
ductive selection is upset.           How far it exists in civilized communities
of mankind is another and more difficult problem, which I have paj-
tially dealt with elsewhere. f At any rate it becomes necessary for the
biologist either to affirm or deny the two principles stated above.                          If

ho affirms them,    then he must look upon all races as tending to pro
gress in definite directions — not necessarily one, but possibly several
different directions, according to the characters with which fertility
may he correlated — the moment natural selection is suspended ; the
organism carries in itself, in virtue of the laws of inheritance and the
correlationof its characters, a tendency to progressive change.   If,                         on
the other hand, the biologist denies these principles, then he must                           lie
prepared to meet the weight of evidence in favour of the inheritance                          of
fertility and fecundity contained               in Parts   II   and     III   of the present
memoir.
  2.   The theory discussed in Part      opens with the proof that
                                                 I                      fer             if
tility he a    function of any physical characters which are themselves
inherited according to the law of ancestral heredity, then      must it-self   it
be inherited according to that law.    As fertility would certainly appear
to be associated with physique, we have thus an        priori argument
                                                                    a                         in
favour of its inheritance.
  3.   In the next place the influence of " record " making on apparent
fertility is. considered.  The mother with more offspring has       greater         a
chance than one with fewer of getting into the record which extends
over several generations, and, further,     every possible entry lie taken
                                                     if
from the record, she        again weighted with her fertility.
                             is                                    Thus                       a
record  is not true account of the fertility of successive generations.
                  a
The fertility of mothers      always found to be more and their varia-
                                 is
hility less than the fertility and variability of daughters.      Accordingly
from the apparent fertility and variability of the record the actual
values in each generation must be deduced.          The difficulties and the
theory    of this investigation are developed  at some length, and methods
determined by which         can be ascertained whether a secular change
                            it                                                                in
fertility is  actually taking place. The results obtained are extended
to fecundity.
  4.   In the    case of thoroughbred horses, their number         so few and is
in-breeding      so great owing  to the fashion  in sires and  stocks, that we
have to deal with       a large array of offspring of the same sire.                     It   is
easy accordingly      to obtain 50,000 to 150,000 pairs of a given relation
ship, e.g., half-sisters, and we rapidly get numbers too large for form
ing correlation tables in the usual manner.             Accordingly methods
are developed for finding correlation coefficients from the means
of " arrays." These methods are of considerable importance, for they
enable us to ascertain the correlation between         latent character
                                                                a          one          in
sex and      apatent character in another, or between characters latent
in tw.o individuals.      Thus,       shown that the correlation Instween the
                                      it   is
brood-mare's fecundity latent in two related stallions can be deduced
from the correlation between the mean fecundities of their two arrays
of daughters.       In this way numerical estimate can be formed of the
                                      a
inheritance      of latent characters.

      5. The    brood-mare is for many causes, detailed at length in the paper,
   a highly artificial product, and accordingly the record gives a consider
  able percentage of fictitious fecundities.            The effect of a mixture of corre
  lated    and    uncorrected        material   on correlation and variation is next
  investigated,       and   it is shown that the former is more seriously affected
  than    the latter.       Hence     results based on variation are more likely to
  he   trustworthy         than    those which use correlation.           Incidently the
  problem      of the mixture of           heterogeneous materials uncorrected in
  themselves is investigated,           and it is shown that a correlation will result
  in the    mixture.        This spurioux correlation is of some importance for
  die question of mixtures of classes in fertility problems, but it is also
 significant of the general danger of heterogeneity in bio-statistical inves
  tigations, and further indicative of the possibility of creating correlation
  between two characters by breeding between small heterogeneous groups
  in which this correlation is zero.          This illustration suffices to indicate how
  correlation       between      characters does not      necessarily  indicate  a causal
  relationship.
     6.  Part     II   of the    memoir    deals with the inheritance       of fertility in
  man.      It  is  first shown by large numbers that fertility is undoubtedly
 inherited       from mother to daughter, but that if we include all types
 of   marriages the inheritance is largely screened by other factors.                    An
 attempt is made            to remove      one by one these factors, and the more
 stringently this is done the more nearly the regression of daughter on
 mother moves up towards                 the value required by the law of ancestral
 heredity.         If  we  could   take  only marriages in which both daughter and
 mother were married during the whole of their fecund period there
 is  little doubt        that we should find inheritance according to the law
 of ancestral heredity.            The sparseness of homogeneous material hinders,
 however, such an           investigation.
     The inheritance          of fertility from father to son is then considered ;
 this is really rather an inheritance of sterility or tendency to sterility,
for the full fecundity of a man is not usually exhibited in monogamic
union.        It is rather a problem of whether his fecundity lasts as long as
his wife's.         We find definite inheritance of this sterile tendency from
father to son, although for the reason just given it falls below that
indicated by the law of ancestral heredity.
     Lastly, the inheritance of fertility in the woman through the male
line is dealt with, and it is shown that a woman's fertility is as highly
correlated with that of her paternal as with that of her maternal grand
mother.         In    other words the latent character,       fertility in the woman,     is
transmitted           through the male line, and with an intensity which ap
proximates to that required by the law of ancestral heredity.                          Inci
                                      "            "
dentally the problem of                 heiresses    is dealt with.    It is shown that
in the case of women who are chiefly " heiresses," there is at once a
 considerable         drop in the correlation between their fertility and that of
                                                                               0 2

their mothers, while there is           a small drop only in their average fertility.
In other words, an " heiress " is not to              be looked upon as coming in
general from a sterile stock, but as having a mother, whose fertility
has a fictitious value, i.e., the apparent fertility of the record is not
the    potential fertility,         the  inherited character, in the mother. In
other words        " heiresses " are not    as a rule due to sterile mothers, but in
the bulk are due to such causes as late marriages, restraint, incompati
bility of husband and wife, absence of sons or death of other children,
&c., &c.
   7.   Part     III   of   the   memoir    contains    the results  of a  somewhat
laborious investigation            into the fecundity of brood-mares, which hi£
been a number of years in progress.                Had better material been avail
able for the inheritance of fecundity, we would gladly have adopted it
in preference to dealing with such an intricate subject as the breeding
of race-horses.         Unfortunately the absence of place and means hindered
any experimental            investigation on our part into the inheritance of
fecundity       in   some     simpler type of life.       Such investigation ought
certainly to be made by a trained biologist with the knowledge and
the laboratory at his disposal.
   After discussing at length the steps taken by us to measure and
tabulate the fecundity of brood-mares, we deduce the following con
clusions    : —
   (i.) Fecundity in the brood-mare is inherited from dam to mare,
   (ii.) It is also inherited from grand-dam to mare through the dam.
   In both these         cases   the intensity is much less than would be in
dicated by the law of ancestral heredity, but the divergence is not such
that it could not be accounted for by a percentage of fictitious values
such     as the peculiar        conditions   of horse-breeding   warrant us in con
sidering probable.
   (iii.) The latent quality, fecundity in the brood-mare, is inherited
              through the sire ; this is shown not only by the correlation
              between half-sisters, but by actual determination of the corre
              lation between the latent character in the sire and the patent
              character in the daughter.
   (iv.) The latent quality, fecundity in the brood-mare, is inherited by
              the stallion from his sire.          This is shown not only by the
              fecundity correlation between a sire's daughters and his half
              sisters, but also by a direct determination of the correlation
              between the latent quality in the stallion and in his sire.
   In both these          cases   of  latent qualities the law of inheritance ap
proaches much more closely to that required by the Galtonian rule
This is probably due to the fact that the determination of the correla
tion is thrown back on the calculation of the means and variabilities of

  arrays, and       not on the direct calculation of the correlation between
  fecundities,    a large percentage of which are probably fictitious (see § 5).
      8.  Parts   II and  III accordingly force  us to the conclusion that  fertility
 is   inherited in man and fecundity in the horse, and therefore probably
  that both these characters are inherited in all types of life.           It would
 indeed be difficult to explain by evolution the great variety of values
  these    characters    take in allied species, if this were not true.        That
  they are     inherited according to the Galtonian rule seems to us very
  probable      but not demonstrated to certainty.             It is a reasonable
  hypothesis     until more data are forthcoming.
      The memoir       concludes   with   a discussion  of the meaning of repro
  ductive selection for the problem of evolution and with sixteen correlation
  tables, giving the dressed material on which our conclusions are based.

      A   study of the nodules found upon the roots of leguminous plants
 has     led the    author to an unhesitating confirmation of the parasitic
 nature of both the filaments and the bacteroids contained in these
 organs.       The filaments, it was found, have no such constant           relation
 to the     nucleus of the cells, as was represented        by Beyerinck in 1888.
 By plasmolysis of the root-hairs, the infection tube             is shown to have
 grown into the hair, and not         to correspond with the primordial utricle
 of the hair, a result which proves that Frank was mistaken in regarding
 the tube as formed from the contents of the hair mingled with fungal
 protoplasm.         By staining with aniline blue and orseillin these tubes
and the filaments in the cells were shown to consist of strands of
straight rodlets,       lying parallel to the longer axis of the filament, and
embedded         in a colourless matrix. This matrix does not consist of
cellulose,      chitin, or any form of slime.           The swellings upon the
filaments       occur at places where the rodlets have become heaped up,
and       at such places the filaments eventually burst, liberating the
rodlets, whilst they themselves remain as pointed portions, directed
towards each other in the cells.            After liberation from the filaments,
the rodlets become transformed into X, V, and Y-shaped bacteroids.
This variety of shape does not occur when these organisms are culti
vated outside the plant on a solid medium, but in liquid pea extract
the change from straight rodlets to " bacteroids

tion with high powers, these rodlets are seen to multiply by division
into equal, or sometimes slightly unequal, halves.     By this method
the author hopes also to determine whether the change in shape arises
from fusion of two or more individuals or by branching.     Their multi
plication by division leads to the conclusion that these organisms are
members of the Schizomycetes ; whether or not they are true Bacteria
must, however, still be undecided, until the final stage in their li0
history has been fully followed.
   The X, V, or Y-shaped bacteroid, when once formed appears to
be incapable     of further growth.    These organisms are aerobic in
character,    their  power  of  fixing atmospheric  nitrogen is to he
tested in connection with their growth on silicic acid gelatine.   Com
mercial    " Nitragin
                      "
                        consists of minute micrococcus-like   bodies, all
straight and immobile.    They multiply rapidly on gelatine media, and
in pea extract become converted into "bacteroids" as well as straight
rods.   Nitragin does consist of the tubercle organism, and as a result
of the inoculation of either seeds or soil with           it,
                                                      tubercle formation
takes place.    Crossing of kinds supplied for different genera and
species is quite successful within the tribe Vicieae. In order to test
the possibility and conditions of direct infection of the roots, seedling
peas, starting both before and after germination, were grown in sterile
tubes, by which means the whole plant was kept under control.       This
method   showed  that direct infection of quite young radicles tolerably
                                                                is
certain, also of older roots, provided the conditions under which
germination occurred are maintained after infection.
   In order to secure infection       it not necessary that the organism
                                           is
should pass through the soil, and the age of the root-hair at the time
of infection seems to be without effect upon the result. An accumulation
of CO., round the roots   isnot the cause of failure in direct infection.
   The addition of nitragin to soils rich in nitrates appears to be      in
advisable, but    asupply of      to soil poor in nitrates results in an
                                 it
increased yield, though better results are obtained     instead of nitragin,

 the corona, and the position of this line was also stated to be 1474K.
     Although other determinations of the position of the green line of
  the corona during eclipses have not all agreed absolutely with Young's
  observations, the differences have been attributed to errors of observa
  tion, so      that Young's statement of the coincidence of the coronal and
  chromospheric           lines, and their correspondence with the solar dark line
  at   1474K has been generally accepted.                    No special attention appears
  to have        been directed        of late years to the measurement of the corona
  line  itself.
     This and other coronal                radiations  were photographed as iings by
  the use of prismatic cameras in 1893, 1896, and 1898, but a full list of
  them has only so far been                   published for the photographa taken by
 Mr. Fowler            during the eclipse of 189.3. f Among the brightest of
these rings, which is common to all three sets of photographa, is one
about wave-length                4231, which probably is identical with the corona
line photographed                by .Schuster in 1886, and stated to have a wave
length         of 4232-8        on Angstrom's scale (4233-4           Rowland).        Schuster
stated         that this      line was "probably the same             line as 4233-0 often
observed          by Young in the chromosphere. "J                The chromospheric lino
 at   this wave-length has since been identified as an enhanced line of
 iron, of which the precise wave-length                       is 4233-3.        Captain Hills
 photographed            this     corona    line  with a   slit spectroscope in the hist
eclipse,        and he gives its wave-length             as 4233-5,15      which within the
limits of error might be considered coincident with the enhanced line
of iron.
     The later researches on the spectrum of iron have shown that the
iron line which I observed in 1869 to be coincident with the bright
 chromospheric line at 1474K (5316-79 Rowland) is also an enhanced
 line, agreeing absolutely                with Young's latest determination              of the
 wave-length of the 1474 chromospheric line,|| with which, according to
 his eclipse observations,             the green line of the corona is coincident.
     According          to these results then, two of the chief lines in                      the
 spectrum of the corona would be coincident                        with enhanced fines of
 iron.i" The remaining corona lines, which have so far been measured,
 are not, however, coincident                  with enhanced lines. It did not seem

possible, therefore, that two of the enhanced lines of iron should be
present without the others, even if it be admitted that the corona may
have a temperature high enough to produce any enhanced lines.
    It appeared then, either that the coincidences of the chromospherie
and coronal lines about 423 and 531 were accidental, or that they
were not real coincidences at all.         A careful    examination of the eclipse
photographs       of 1896, taken by Mr. Shackleton, and those of 1898,
taken by Mr. Fowler, has therefore been undertaken, with special
reference to this point.
    The wave-length of the coronal ring at 4231, already published               in
the case of the 1893 photographs, has been confirmed.
    The 1896 and 1898 photographs further indicate that the corona
line near 4231 is not coincident with the chromospherie line to which
reference has been made, and show that while the chromospherie line
is coincident with the enhanced line of iron at A 4233-3, the corona line
has a wave-length       of 4231*3.
    With regard to the ring in the green, the lack of sufficient photo
graphs     on isochromatic      plates  in 1893 does not permit of         a final
determination        of   wave-length.      Important      data, however,     were
obtained, both in 1896 and 1898.            A measurement of the position of
the chief ring in the green, as shown in these photographs, comparing
the ring with the spectrum of the chromosphere and a solar and iron
spectrum token by the same prisms, shows beyond all question that the
wave-length is very different from that generally accepted.             The mean
result of measurements of different parts of the ring made by Messrs.
Fowler and Shackleton and Dr. Lockyer is 5303-7, or about 13 tenth-
metres more refrangible than 1474K (5316-79).
    Although the new wave-length is not to be regarded as final, for the
 reason that the conditions under which the photographs were taken
 necessitate certain small corrections which have not yet been fully
 worked out, it is not likely that it can be in error by so much as
 1 tenth-metre.
    The examination of the photographs, which has been undertaken in
 the first instance by Mr. Fowler, indicates that other important con
 clusions are to be drawn from the admirable series obtained by him,
 among them the possible existence of one or more new gases, some of
 the lines of which, as gathered from the dispersions as yet available,
 appear also in the spectra of some stars and planetary nebulae.
     The photograph which accompanies this piper has been prepared by
 Mr. Fowler.

    The Action of Magnetised Electrodes upon Electrical Discharge
      Phenomena      in Rarefied Gases. Preliminary Note."      By
      C. E. S. Phillips.  Communicated hy Sir William Crookes.
      Received November 30, — Eead December 15, 1898.
   The experiments herein described were undertaken in order to ascer
tain what would be the action of strongly magnetised electrodes upon
electrical discharge phenomena in rarefied gases, and especially upon
the charged residual gas, when all external stimulation had ceased.
    For this purpose an apparatus was constructed,   as shown in Fig. 1,
consisting of a soda-glass bulb, B, open at both ends for the purpose of
inserting the pointed soft iron electrodes, E, and E.,, and with the
leading tube L attached for connection to a Sprengel air pump.
                                       Fig.   1.
   No precaution was taken to keep mercury vapour out of the bulb B
during the experiments.     Each electrode had a screw thread of suitable
pitch cut upon     in
                 it,  order  that the brass cups    and C, when screwed
                                                    Cl
into position and sealed with cement to the glass, might serve to keep
the electrodes central, to reduce the possibility of their rushing
together under the influence of strong magnetic forces, and to seal
air-tight the two ends of the bulb.
   The poles of  alarge electro-magnet, Mi M.„ were insulated from the
electrodes by means of two thin glass sheets, (ii G.,.   A discharge from
the secondary of  an  induction  coil or other suitable source, could then
be passed through the bulb, the exhaustion varied and the electrodes
magnetised at pleasure.
                                      Results.
     A
     pressure was obtained within the bulb, such that cathode rays
began to be freely emitted by the negative electrode, and from the

         upon    Electrical Discharge Phenomena in Eareficd               Gases.    17'3
screw thread       cut upon it there came a helix of rays which gave rise to
the appearance of golden-green              rings of fluorescence upon the inner
surface of the glass vessel B.           When the electrodes were magnetised
these green rings twisted somewhat and moved forward, the direction
of   rotation     depending      upon    the    polarity    of   the  magnet   emitting
the rays.
   It  has   already been noticed* that an external magnet, placed behind
the negative electrode           will cause rotation of the green fluorescence
upon    the   walls  of an  exhausted tube, and that the direction of motion
is opposite to what it would be in the case of a wire placed at right
angles to the axis of the magnet, and in which a current flowed away
from the pole.        In the above experiment, the rotation was only partial
but agreed      in direction with the results of other observers.
   The bending forward of the rays is evidently dependent upon their
 partial rotation, because, on reversing the polarity of the magnet
emitting them, the direction of their rotation was also reversed, and the
iiending     forward still occurred.         That   a  positively charged body, mov
ing in a definite direction,        sets up magnetic whirls in planes transverse
to its   path, is generally accepted, the whole effect indeed being treated
hs a current flowing in the same direction ; and it seems only logical to
conclude that weie the body negatively charged, its motion would give
rise   to   effects similar to those accompanying a flow of current in the
opposite direction.        From this we should expect cathode rays to behave
towards       a magnet just as would a wire carrying a current in the
opposite      direction to that in which the charged particles, constituting
the rays, are supposed           to be moving— a view which is borne out by
experiment.
    The pressure        was    then   still further lowered, until a 3-inch spark
from a 10-inch Apps induction coil was only just able to start the
glow. Under these conditions irregular green patches flickered upon
 the inner surface of the glass ; but when the electrodes were oppositely
 magnetised these green flecks immediately vanished, and, the resistance
 of the residual gas within the bulb becoming smaller, a hazy blue
cloud formed between the points.
    Owing to the ever varying charges upon the inner surface of the
 bulb and upon the electrodes themselves, it could not be ascertained
 whether this blue cloud tended to assume a definite geometrical form or
 not.     It  was  found, however, that, after        a strong stimulation of the bulb
 had    taken place and         then   been stopped, the electrodes meanwhile
 remaining unmagnetised,             on exciting the magnet, a luminous ring
 suddenly appeared within the bulb, between the pointed ends of the
 electrodes, and in a plane at right angles to the direction of the mag
 netic lines of force.
     The ring shone brightly for          a moment, when          the magnet circuit was

    ing in fact hazy and indefinite, if the pressure within the bulb was
    slightly increased.
       On the other hand the rarefaction must not be carried too far, for it
    is necessary, in order to obtain this luminous effect, that the residual
    gas within the bulb should be very generally stimulated by the passage
    of the discharge.    The following combinations were then tried :—
       After stimulation, both the leading wires attached to the electrodes
    were removed from the secondary of the induction coil, and (ii) insu
    lated, (b) joined together and insulated,          joined together and
                                                        (r)
    connected to earth, (il) one insulated and the other connected to earth.
    In all these cases the ring formed equally well when the pointed ends
    of the electrodes were oppositely magnetised. On the other hand, as
    long as the points were made either both N or both             S,
                                                          no ring could
    be obtained.
       In another experiment, after the exhaustion        had been carried       some
    what further and the bulb strongly stimulated,        second ring flashed
                                                              a

    concentrically with the smaller and more permanent ring, and appeared
    to be situated upon the inner surface of the glass bulb.
       Observations as to the actual mode of formation of what        venture
                                                                        I
    to call the primary ring, i.e., the smaller one of the two, could at this
    stage of exhaustion be conveniently made.        It appeared to emanate
    originally as     bright stream from between the electrodes, and then
                        a
    to curl rapidly round the magnetic axis, that portion most distant
    from the electrodes gaining upon the rest, ultimately disengaging the
    tail of the stream from between the points, and thus forming an equa
    torial circle of light within the bulb.   The ring then spread out and
    became somewhat wider and less well defined, and as        gradually died
                                                                  it
    away   the   glow  seemed  to be rotating  more and  more  slowly until at
    last   it   flickered and vanished.
      It   appears, in fact, that this luminous ring spins between the electrodes
    from the moment           forms under the action of the magnet, the high
                             it
    initial velocity with which, in that case,  it must be set in motion tending
    to keep     rotating, even after the magnetic lines have reached
                 it                                                    maxi  a
    mum.    The gradual expansion of the ring, which begins to take place
    immediately     has formed, may, according to this view, be due partly to
                        it
    centrifugal force, and also partly to the attraction exerted by an electro
    static charge residing upon the inner surface of the glass walls        the  of
    bulb.   It significant, too, that when the ring had all but disappeared,
                   is
    the sudden turning off of the magnet slightly revived the luminosity.
    At the instant the ring formed, the glass walls of the bulb became
    charged so strongly that a spark could, in some cases, be seen to piss
    between the outer surface of the glass and the brass cups, Ci, C.a attached
    respectively to either electrode.   It should be noticed that the ring            is

 generally   very sensitive to variations in the charge upon the glass walls,
 and that touching the bulb at various places with the fingers produces
 vigorous movements of the glow within.
    In a   bulb, the diameter       of  which was about       3 inches,   the  ring
 threaded    itself on to either of the electrodes Ex or E.,, when the centre of
 the bulb was     electrically connected to the cups C., and Ci respectively.
    When only one electrode was magnetised, after the bulb had been
 stimulated, the rotation of the glow was more easily seen owing to the
 formation around the magnetised electrode of a wide, spiral-shaped,
 luminous cloud which was apparently rotating as it became more and
more dim, and it was then noticed                 that the direction of rotation
could be    reversed by reversing the polarity of the magnetised electrode.
No change        in the effect was observed when the connections to the
bulb were      reversed.
    The form       of the electrodes was next varied,       but the effects pro
duced were        mainly the same.      With    a pointed  cathode and a concave
anode    the    ring formed    as usual,   but it was observed that, whenever
these   relations     were   reversed,  no    ring could be obtained.       Indeed,
having first of all stimulated the bulb with the concave electrode
negative, it was not only impossible to obtain a ring on magnetising
the electrodes, but even when the connections were reversed still no
ring would form until after repeated or prolonged              stimulation of the
bulb.    Neither did a ring form when the electrodes were magnetised
so that like poles faced each          other — a similar result to that already
observed with pointed electrodes.
   It may be worth recording that when pointed electrodes were em
ployed, the ring formed equally well, whether the bulb was stimulated
by means of a Tesla oscillator,            an induction coil, or a Wimshurst
influence machine.

   Finally, experiments were made with external magnetised electrodes,
the exhausted         bulb being shaped as shown in fig. 2. In this case of
course,    the    discharge   was   oscillatory, and consequently       the effects
were not very        directly comparable to those already described.

electrodes, a Hash of white light was observed within the tube, Bud
irregular green splashes momentarily made their appearance upon the
glass.

son, F.R.S.,    for kindly permitting me to       use the Tesla apparatus at
his laboratory, and for the interest he has taken in the progress of       these
experiments.

                                    (Abstract.)
    In this research the modern methods of investigating the         course of
tracts and their degeneration      in the central nervous system have been
used.    The previous     literature of the subject is scanty.     Bumm first
gave an account of the various tracts in the brain, and the histological
side has been and is still being worked out by Brandis.
    Valuable information is given by Edinger in his ' Vorlesnngen,' and
quite recently the Marchi method has been used and the results
obtained described by Wiener and Miinzer, Wallenberg and Fried-
lander.
    The anatomy has been studied by sections made in the three planes
and stained by the Weigert and Nissl methods, and by observing the
course of the degenerated fibres following various lesions, staining by
Marchi's fluid.
    In the brain of the Bird the cortex of higher animals is represented
by a thin pallial sheet of grey matter, forming the mesial and dorsal
boundary of the narrow ventricle, and gradually losing itself on the
lateral aspect of the hemisphere.        Its substance is composed of oval,
rather large cells, grouped into clusters, and it contains the fibres of an
important tract, called by Edinger the Tr. septomesencephalicus, and
by us alluded to as the pallial tract.      The hemispheres themselves cor
respond to basal ganglia ; posteriorly they expand laterally into the
large occipital lobes.     Their substance contains cells resembling those
found in the pallium, and which cannot be differentiated distinctly into
definite   regions.
    The hemispheres are connected with the thalamus by a constriction
 of their substance, forming an isthmus on either side, from which the
 thalamus in transverse section is seen suspended as a triangular shaped
 body.

     The other        prominent features are the large optic lobes, on the surface
of   which        shining white fibres can be seen, and also the excessive size of
the optic         tracts, the diameter of which is equal to that of the spinal
cord   in the dorsal region.
     The general plan of the tracts               of the central nervous system             is as
follows      :—
     I. From      the hemispheres tracts arise which undergo a descending
degeneration,       and terminate in the thalamic and mesencephalic region.
There        is no direct connection of the cerebral hemispheres with the
spinal       cord.
     II.    A   well marked       tract    arises in the mesencephalon, undergoes an
ascending degeneration,                and can be found to terminate in the substance
of the       hemisphere.
     III.     The mesencephalon           is the site of a complex         system of fibres,
which can be              grouped as    follows :—
      («)    The ascending        tract to the hemispheres           alluded     to above    (Tr.
                mesencephalicus striatus).
     (18)    Arciform fibres decussating in the middle line and reaching
                downwards into the spinal cord (Ford's and Meynert's foun
                tain decussation).
      (y)    The optic tracts and various commissural                 fibres connected with
                  this.
      (a)   A     tract    originally described      by   Pcrlia,   and   called   by him the
                   median optic bundle.
     This tract can be well seen after all lesions involving the optic lobes
as   a well defined degenerate bundle, situated on the inner side of the
 dorsal aspectof the optic tract, and ending in the ganglion isthmi,
 which   situated in the optic lobe at the junction of that body
             is
with the cerebellum and pons.    Peripherally, Wallenberg found that                           it
could     traced to the ganglion layer of the retina of the opposite
             be
eye,       Perlia, in his original description, observed the tract as a
            and
 degenerated bundle found after enucleation of an eye.
      IV. The commissural system, including —
       (a)   The anterior commissure.
      (ft) The posterior         commissure.
      (y) The commissure                 roof of the aqueduct (lamina commis-

                   suralis mesencephali) which contains the large cells thought
                   to be the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminus.

                   Edinger.
      V. The tracts
                  of the spinal cord,                     which have broadly the usual
 ascending and descending course.

    Without  entering into detail, some points in connection with the
tracts of the cerebral hemisphere should be mentioned.
    (i)The Tr. septomesencephalicus forms      prominent feature on the
                                                          a
mesial wall of the hemisphere, where           it
                                            seen as  is
                                                      fan-shaped expan
                                                                    a
sion of  white fibres.  It rapidly converges to     well defined bundle,
                                                                a
which turns laterally, and    seen on the ventral aspect of the brain as
                                     is
a   band of fibres situated          between   the   optic      lobes and      hemispheres.
Sections         that the anterior lobe of the brain contributes to its

                            it                                    Whilst the
main mass of its fibres pass in front of the anterior commissure,        dis           a
tinct band passes posteriorly to that commissure to end in the region
of the ganglion habendulac.       This part represents the fornix.       also          It

gives origin to fibres of the    pallial commissure, and      in connection
                                                                          is
with the optic tract by well defined bundle.
                                 a
   (ii) The middle region of the hemisphere especially, but also the
remaining parts to      less extent, give origin to the tracts which ter
                            a
minate in the thalamus and mesencephalon respectively, viz., the Tr.
striothalamicus and Tr. striomesencephalicus.
   (iii) The expanded posterior part of the hemisphere          the site and
                                                                          is
origin of three large tracts, viz., the anterior commissure, the Tr.
occipitomesencephalicus, and a great associational bundle binding the
anterior and posterior parts of the brain together, and called the fronto-
occipital tract.
   In considering the physiological significance of these tracts, their
anatomical distribution indicates the paramount importance          the                of
sense of sight in the bird.
   The optic tracts and lobes are enormously developed, and the latter
have connections with all parts of the central nervous system, being
thus a reflex centre of the highest importance.       The well-developed
posterior parts of the hemisphere, with their connections with the
mesencephalon, illustrate in this animal the first formation of    higher          a
cerebral visual centre.
    Further, not only   there marked deficiency of sight in the opposite
                            is
eye after injury to one  optic vesicle, but the same symptom     noticed         is
after injury to any part of the cerebral hemisphere.       The defect of
sight    most marked after removal of the whole hemisphere, or of the
          is
occipital portion but we are of opinion that distinct amblyopia fol
                        ;
lows      a    superficial lesion chiefly involving the pallial tract, or after
removal         of the fore part of the brain, which, as mentioned above,                   is
connected with both this tract and with the occipital lobe.
  Two excitable areas are found on the surface of the hemisphere                       :
  One situated on fibres of the pallial tract, near the median plane,
and stimulation of which gives, as was long ago described     Ferrier,           by
constant contraction of the pupil of the opposite eye.

       By what path such stimulation affects the motor nuclei we do not
know, but lesions    of this region give rise to a limited degeneration in
the pallial tract.
       A
     second situated on the lateral aspect of the surface of the brain,
at a point corresponding    to the junction of the great striate and
occipital tracts.
  Stimulation of this area gives rise to complicated movements, which
consist chiefly of deglutition, often accompanied by actual pecking and
by a       rotation of head and neck.
   No other motor symptoms were noticed on carefully stimulating the
surface of the brain. Nor is any motor defect observed after removal
of one  hemisphere. After removal of both hemispheres, a condition
follows which has been carefully studied by Schrader, and with the
descriptionof this author we fully agree. The symptoms vary accord
ing to  the time which has elapsed since the operation.     In the early
s0ge the animal is markedly inert, stands with flexed head, ruffled
0athers, and eyes shut ; the lack of initiative is pronounced.    In the
later stage        it constantly walks about, and is in condition of continual
                                                                      a
unrest,        yet always avoids obstacles, and can maintain its equilibrium in
various positions.
       The relative  importance of the mesencephalic spinal system of fibres
led        us to examine the animals after injury of the optic vesicles for
indicationsof motor defect.
  Contrary to what has been noticed in higher animals, we are of
opinion that whilst a slight lesion is not followed by any observable
motor defect, more pronounced                    injury gives rise to        a weakness on the
opposite side, so             that the animal falls to that side. If the lesion be
very severe, the animal is            quite unable to stand, and lies continually on
 its   back.

the opening of the palpebral fissure, but of its closure. The obser
vations having been unavoidably interrupted by removal to a new
laboratory, it is only recently I have been able to confirm the pre
liminary observations on a sufficiently extended scale.
   The monkey and the cat have been the animals employed.         Under
deep chloroform narcosis intracranial section of the Vllth cranial nerve
was performed at the point where the nerve plunges into the petrosal
portion of the temporal bone. In three instances the nervus octatiu,
and the pars intermedia, were also severed with the facialis.   In every
case the side selected for operation was the left.      The facial palsy
caused was not detectable so long as the narcosis was maintained.     As
that was gradually recovered from, asymmetry of expression, &c,
became marked.      In those instances in which both the facialis and
octavus         had been severed, there    appeared   among   the symptoms   the
following: — Rotatory nystagmus of the left eyeball, some inequality
of the pupils — the left being the smaller, some degree of impotence of
the eyeballs to move so far to the right as to the left, or, expressed
more objectively, the eyeballs were never observed to move freely to
the right of the primary visual position, although they frequently
moved well to the left ; they certainly never moved far to the right :
the animals rolled over about the long axis of the body, as mentioned
in Magendie's original description of the effect of unilateral section of
the pons.   The direction of rotation, if traced from the supine position
as starting point, was towards the animal's right side, so that that side
next after the back lay undermost.        The monkey clutched hold of
things within reach, with the apparent intention of preventing itself
from rolling.    If it failed to obtain some support the rolling would
continue through a series of complete turns.      This was the condition
immediately after complete recovery from the narcosis, and at that
time the left knee-jerk was less brisk than the right ; on the latter side
it appeared to be abnormally brisk, but it is difficult to fix a normal.
The actual existence of section, and whether it had included both
nerves or only one, was always determined by subsequent post-mortem
    dissection.
      As to the eye closure, while the animal was exhausted, or sleepy,       or
    only partially recovered from the chloroform narcosis, there was         no
    obvious              between the appearance of the eyelids on the two
                difference
    sides, as they   rested half open over the globes. When the animal
    blinked, however, under these conditions, the palpebral opening of the
    right eye closed, but not that of the left — at least not to any easily per
    ceptible extent.   When on the contrary the animal was fully awake and
              both eyes well opened, it was seen that as the right eye
    active, with
blinked the left eye also did so. By blinking I understand the rapidly
executed movement of closure which occurs so repeatedly without
attention being directed to         it,
                               although  can be voluntary restrained—

the quick movement            which may      be regarded as an     irregularly recurring
reflex that doubtless has among              its objects the renewal of moisture on
the   corneal surface, which         otherwise would become dry.            This natural
blinking movement seems in the monkey not to employ the orbital
portion of the orbiadaris pa1pebrarum, but only the palpebral.                   It occurs
habitually as a bilateral and symmetrical movement.                        It is far less
extensive in action than the closure of the palpebral opening, which
ensues when the monkey grimaces on being threatened                        with a blow.
That in the       blinking the contraction of the palpebral part of the orbi
cularis     is    not however          the whole of the muscular               mechanism
at play, is clear from the fact, that in the awake and active animal
with fully opened eyes, the blinking still remains bilateral, subse
quent to section of the facialis nerves of one side.                   The blinking by
the right eye was of course normal in character.                        As the light eye
blinked, the upper lid of the left eye quickly dropped three to four
millimetres over the globus of that side, and was then synchronously
with the lifting of the right upper lid lifted again.                  The left lower lid
was not on any occasion detected to move at all.                   The quick fall of the
upper    lid   of  the  left  eye  must    have   been  due  under   these circumstances
to inhibition of the tonus                of the left levator palpebras superioris
muscle.       This brings the co-ordination of the reaction into line with
that which 1 have described for other movements under the term
reciprocal innervation.
    It is interesting that Panas, Sappey, Fuchs, Wilmart and others,
who have carefully and particularly studied                     the mechanism of the
tlosure of the eye, have not attributed any share to an inhibition of
the levator palpebras ; one physician,                 however, Dr. Lor, of Brussels,
has argued that in the closure of the human eye such an inhibition
does    under certain circumstances             occur.

    -M.  A. Leduc in a recent paper* has discussed the relation between
 the  density of argon, its proportion in atmospheric nitrogen, the den
 sity  of the latter, and that of pure nitrogen.               It appears to me that he
 has   misunderstood         some    of the data given by          Lord Rayleigh, Dr.
 Kellas, and      myself   ;  and as the question whether the found density of
 argon corresponds with that calculable from the other data, is in itself
 an interesting        one, I have the honour to present this note to the
 Society.

    The data may be divided into two groups : those of Leduc and
Sehloesing ; and those of Kayleigh, Ramsay, and Kellas.
    From the first group it is possible to calculate the density of argon,
i.e., the crude mixture left after separating oxygen and nitrogen from air.
     From the second group, the density of argon may be calculated; or
if that be assumed, both groups give data for the calculation of that

  In the memoir on Argon, a new constituent of the atmosphere,* by
Lord Rayleigh and one of us, reasons arc adduced on pages 235 and
236 in favour of the siipposition that argon is an element, or a mixture
of elements ; and on page 236, the                           "
                                    following words occur : — There is
evidence both for and against the hypothesis that argon is a mixture,
for, owing to Mr. Crookes's observations   of the dual character of its
spectrum ; against, because of Professor Olszewski's statement that it
has a   definite melting point, a definite boiling point, and a definite
critical temperature   and pressure; and because on compressing the gas
in presence of its liquid, pressure remains sensibly constant until all
gas has condensed to liquid.          The latter experiments are the well
known criteria of a pure substance ; the former is not known with
certainty to be characteristic of a mixture."        And on pages 257-259
of the same volume, it is shown by Professor Sydney Young and one
of us, that the ratios between the boiling points of argon and benzene,
argon and alcohol, and argon and oxygen on the absolute scale are
such   that it is possible to compute the boiling points of argon at
Afferent pressures with very considerable accuracy.          We therefore draw
the conclusion : — "  It is hardly likely, though not impossible, that so
good an agreement would be obtained with a mixture or an impure
substance.    It   is,
                    at any rate, certain that     distinct want of agreement
                                                           a
would have shown that argon was not              definite, pure substance, and
                                                          a
the results may be taken as affording additional confirmation of the
conclusion that argon         definite, hitherto unknown constituent of the
                             it is
                                a

                                                                  a
proaching to purity."
   The density of      sample of argon prepared by means of magnesium
                         a
was found by one of us to be 19-941 (0 = 16)                and    much larger
                                                                      ;       a
preparation by Lord Rayleigh, obtained by exposing              mixture of air
                                                                          a
and oxygen to an electric flame in presence of caustic soda, possessed
the density 19-94.     Supposing argon to be        simple substance, and not

a mixture, the atomic weight would therefore be 39-88.              An attempt
was made by Dr. J. Norman Collie and one of us to effect              separation  a
                             * 'Phil. Trans.,' A, (1895), p.      187.

 of argon    into  a  light and   a heavy    portion passing by diffusion ; but
 without definite results.        While the density of the portion passing
 first through the pipe-clay septum was 19'93, that of the last portions
 was 20*01.      AVe remarked on these figures in the following terms: —
 "These numbers show that no important separation has been effected.
 The difference in density of the two portions may possibly be attri
 buted to experimental error.        . .   .   As it stands, the difference is an
 extremely minute one, and it may, we think, be taken that any separation
 of argon, if effected at all, is very imperfect."
     It thus remained uncertain whether argon was a mixture or not ;
although the balance of evidence went against the supposition.
     When helium was discovered in 1895, a new light was thrown on
 the question.      Its density, determined by Ramsay, and independently
by Langlet,     closely   approximates to 2'0.       Experiments, in conjunction
 with Dr. Collie, and subsequently by ourselves, showed that no great
difference in density could be brought about by- fractional diffusion ;
and, indeed, the latter revealed no impurity except traces of argon.
On grounds similar to those from which a corresponding conclusion for
argon was drawn, the atomic weight of helium must be somewhat
below 4'0.       The difference between the atomic weights of helium and
argon is consequently about 36 ; and this is approximately the differ
ence between the atomic weights              of manganese and fluorine (36),
chromium and oxygen (36'3), vanadium and nitrogen (37*4), and
titanium and carbon (36'4).          But between each¦ of these pairs of ele
ments, there exists another, exceeding in atomic weight the lower
member of each pair by approximately 16.                 It was therefore to be
expected that another element should exist, with atomic weight about
20, and on the assumption that, like helium and argon, it too would lie
a. monatomic     gas, its density would be 10.         It was with the object of
attempting to discover       this unknown     gas that the experiments on the
fractional diffusion of helium were made ; and the gases evolved on
heating some fifty minerals were investigated              in order to find out
whether a new spectrum could be observed, but with negative results.
Seven meteorites were also examined, as well as six mineral waters, but
no new lines could be found.           Sixteen of the minerals, two of the
mineral     waters,   and   one of the meteorites      were proved to contain
helium ; but if the gases extracted from them contained any gas other
than helium or a trace of argon, it must have been in quantity too
minute to have revealed itself to the spectroscope.
    The gas which we were in search of was ultimately found in argon.
The argon, amounting to about 15 litres, was prepired by means of
apparatus, of which a description is given in the sequel.          From the air
employed in n. liquid state for the purpose of liquefying and fraction
ally distilling     the   argon, two other elementary         gases have been
obtained, besides one yielding the       "         "

argon, and the present paper deals with some of its properties.
                              The Properties      of Pure Argon.
    In order to prepare 15 litres of argon, it is necessary to deal with
about 1,500        litres of atmospheric air, of which approximately 1,200
litres consist of a mixture of nitrogen and argon.                          To absorb the
nitrogen contained         in  this  quantity     of  gas by conversion into nitride, 4
kilograms of magnesium would be required theoretically, but in order to
cover loss through leakage and incomplete                   action, 5 kilograms of the
metal are employed.            The absorption of the oxygen and nitrogen was
conducted in three stages.           In the first, the oxygen was removed by means
of   metallic copper      ; in the second, the nitrogen was passed twice over
metallic magnesium ; and in the third, the gas, now rich in argon, was
finally freed from nitrogen and hydrogen by passage over a mixture of
anhydrous lime and magnesium powder heated to a red heat, and sub
sequently over red-hot copper oxide.                     The apparatus employed is
shown in detail in the annexed figure.
    It was of course necessary to confine the gas over water between the
successive stages of purification, and finally to store the gaseous argon
in the same      way.     On account of the considerable solubility of argon
in water,    this would have entailed no small loss if the quantity of water
with which it had been brought into contact had been large.                       We con
sequently decided        to make      use of gas-holders of the gasometer type,          in
which the water was contained               in an annular      space    of small capacity.
Balance weights          were attached to cords passing               over pulleys, and
served   to relieve the pressure on the gas due to the weight of the gas*
ometer.       As the volume of the gas decreased after each successive
s0ge, the four gas-holders employed were of different sizes ; the capa
city of   A   was about 180 litres        ;   that of B,   27  litres ;  and of C and   I),
each   18  litres.
    Atmospheric nitrogen was obtained by drawing air, freed from car
bon dioxide by passage               through caustic soda solution, over heated
metallic copper.        A  large iron tube F, 3 feet 6 inches long, and 3-5 inches
m diameter,      containing 25 lbs. of scrap copper, was connected with the
gas-holder A ; the tube was heated in a long fire-brick trough during
these   experiments,        but a gas-furnace is shown in the figure, which
has now been        substituted for the more primitive arrangement.
    The  time required to fill the gas-holder was usually about five hours,
 and it   was found, on analysis of the gas, that one single operation

186            Prof. W. Ramsay and Dr. M. W. Travers.
sufficed for the complete removal of all oxygen.    The oxidised copper
was reduced between each operation by means of coal-gas.
   By closing the stop-cock b, and opening the stop-cock r, the gas
holder A could be placed in communication         with the apparatus in
which the preliminary absorption of nitrogen took place. By placing
weights on the top of the gas-holder, the nitrogen was driven through
the vessel M, and the IJ-tube N, both of which contained           strong
sulphuric acid, into the tube G, which contained magnesium.           This
tube was   a piece of steam-barrel, 1*5 inches in diameter, connected   at

     The  Preparation          and  some  of the Properties of Pure Argon.              187
each end     by a reducing socket with an iron tube, 0'25 inch in diameter.
The tube contained 250 grams of magnesium, cut into coarse shavings
in a shaping machine ; the magnesium was not pressed very tightly into
the tube.      Since after each operation          it was necessary to remove the
sockets   in order to clear the tube, the joints were luted with red lead,
and the    tube was made of sufficient length to project about 3 inches at
each   end of the furnace.
    The greater part of the nitride was generally removed by using an
iron rod, and the remainder            by means of water, which converted it into
the   hydroxide.       The tube was raised to a bright red heat before con
necting it with the (J -tube 0, in order to allow the greater part of the
hydrogen occluded by the magnesium to escape.                        The absorption of
the nitrogen,        which was indicated by the rate of flow of the gas
through     the  (J"1i1''68 Nand 0, was maintained briskly until practically
the whole of the magnesium was converted into nitride ; the volume
of the gas absorbed was equivalent to half the capacity of the large
gasholder.
    The gas, after leaving the         U.tuue 0, passed through        a second   iron tube
H, containing      copper oxide       ; next, through the vessel P, in which water
condensed; and it finally collected in the gasometer B.                        That which
passed during       the   first  stages  of  the process   consisted     of  nitrogen con
taining much argon ; but towards the end of the operation the argon
became much diluted, until finally the gas which passed through the
 U-tube O consisted almost entirely of atmospheric                        nitrogen.     The
 tube   G was then replaced             by another    containing     a fresh     supply of
 magnesium.
    The tap c was then closed, and the taps d and e turned, so that the
 gas in the gasometer B could be made to flow through the magnesium and
 copper oxide tubes         into the gasometer C. In this process its volume
 was   very much reduced, and the gas which collected in C probably
 contained as much as 25 per cent. of argon.                 When the whole of the
 gas had been expelled from B, the taps d and e were again turned, and
 atmospheric nitrogen was allowed to flow through the magnesium tube,
 as in the first stage of this operation.
    When the gasometer C had become full of the mixture of nitrogen
 and argon, as it did at the end of every third or fourth operation,
 it became necessary to reduce its volume by further absorption
  of nitrogen.       The method employed, which was first described by
  Maquenne,* consisted in passing the gas through a hard glass tube
  containing    a mixture of magnesium               powder and lime, heated to
  a dull red heat        in a combustion furnace.             The lime was obtained
  by thoroughly calcining precipitated            chalk   in  a muffle.      The nitrogen
  continued to be completely              absorbed as long as calcium remained
  unattacked, so that the product of this operation consisted of pure

 turned out to be        rich in neon, and to contain helium.* The remainder
 of the argon         boiled  back into the gasometer until the last few drops
 were  left ; the residue solidified, and finally gave a gas to which we
gave  the  name metargon ; it was collected in mercury gasholders, t As
will be subsequently shown, the krypton and xenon in this quantity of
argon are too minute for detection.       A similar operation for the pur
pose of separating    the lighter as well as the heavier constituents was-
afterwards  repeated three times, the middle portion of argon being
always returned to the gasholder D (fig.           A fourth liquefaction1).
was carried out in which six mercury gasholders were filled with six
separate fractions of argon, each taken after each successive fifth of the
total    argon      had evaporated.            were next purified from
                                                These fractions

potash.  After the removal of the oxygen the density was determined.

  For    a     preliminary determination of the density of                                   the    various
samples      a   bulb of about 33 c.c. capacity was employed.                                It    is   much

   After the first of these determinations the gas was passed over a
mixture of red-hot magnesium and lime, and subsequently over red-hot
copper oxide, in order to remove hydrogen.                 But after determining the
density,     the  gas  was   examined    spectroscopically, and was found to con
tain hydrogen. The gas was therefore again sparked, when the density
19-952 was found.          This specimen was also examined spectroscopically,
and was found to be absolutely free from all visible traces of impurity.
The last weighing refers to the same sample of gas, and was made as a
control experiment.
   These results conclusively prove that the density of argon, purified
from its companions, does not differ greatly from that obtained by
Lord Bayleigh, viz., 19-94, nor by one of us, viz., 19-941. The true
density may, we think, be safely taken as the mean of the last two
determinations,       viz., 19-957.
   This corresponds with the mean of the four reliable determinations
with the small bulb, viz., Nos. 2, 3, '5, and 6, which is 19-955.

    The refractivity of pure argon was next determined.                 The measure
ments were made according to the plan suggested by Lord Itayleigh*
The samples investigated were Nos. 1, 2, 5, and 6. The comparison
was made with air.

crude argon found by Lord Kayleigh, viz., 0-961,* and also from that
previously found by ourselves, 0-9596.      The removal of neon, which
appears to have a very low refractivity, and of helium, of which the
refractivity is (H238, accounts for the increased refractivity of a sample
from which they are absent.    The gases which we have recently found
in air and in crude argon will form the subject of a future communica
tion.       Suffice        it to say that the amount                        of neon and helium is much
more       considerable          that of the others, and that their effect on
                                 than
crude       argon          is,
                        therefore, much more marked on its density and
refractivity.
  To revert to the opening sentences of this communication, we may
point out that the remarks on the homogeneous nature of argon were
just at the time.  The change in its physical constants, caused by the
mixture of more recently discovered gases which     has been shown to                 it
contain,        is
          exceedingly small, and  does not call for any serious altera

" On some Expressions            for the Radial and Axial Components of
      the Magnetic        Force in the Interior of Solenoids of Circular
      Cross-section." By C. Coleuidge Fark, B.Sc, formerly Angas
      Scholar, University of Adelaide. Communicated by Professor
      H. Lamb, F.R.S. Received June 7,— Read June 16. 1898.
   In the present paper, certain expressions are arrived at, in       terms of
zonal   spherical harmonics and their first derivatives, by which the
values of the two components of the magnetic force may be calculated
for any point in the interior of a coil, and hence the total force may be
found both in magnitude and direction.             The resulting series suffer
from the well-known defect in the spherical harmonic method, in that
they are not very rapidly converging for points near the boundary
of the space for which they apply.             A table of the values of the
first derivatives of the first seven zonal harmonics is added.            This
table, in conjunction with that calculated by Messrs. Holland, Jones,
and Lamb, and published in the ' Philosophical Magazine,' Series 5,
December, 1891, will facilitate the numerical use of the expressions
arrived at.

     Since n(S- T) - the number of turns per unit of length, = X (say),
 the defect of Z from 47rNy depends on the importance of the terms
 under the sign 2.            For the region near the equatorial plane of an
 infinitely long solenoid these terms become vanishingly small.
     The series under the sign 2 are convergent, though not very rapidly
 so if S is nearly as huge as r or /.

 using   for this purpose the table of Y,t calculated by Messrs. Holland,
 Jones, and Lamb, and published by Professor Perry in the ' Phil. Mag.,'
vol. 32, 1891. This is not a complete check on the fourth figure in my
tables, but no disagreement            larger than O0004 has been passed over
without     examination,     and   that   only in the higher values of dPJdO.          It
is therefore hoped that the tables may be found accurate as a whole,
though it is perhaps scarcely to be expected but that some errors have
escaped detection.
   With the aid of Perry's tables and those now given the magnetic
force at any point inside a coil may be found numerically by means of
the formulae in the body of the paper. For points outside the coil a

slight alteration of the expressions  for Z is necessary;    those for X
remain the same.
   It has been thought sufficient for numerical application to give
tIP. /dO to three places of decimals. The establishment of the fourth
place would involve a considerable amount of extra labour.        Though
dP.,jdd, ilPJdO, and dPJdd are not used in the present work, they have
been calculated in order to complete the table as far as it goes.

          Tables   for the Solution of the Equation
              By W. Steadman Aldis, M.A. Communicated by Professor
             J. J. Thomson, F.K.S. Eeceived and Read June 10, 1898.
          1.  The object of the present paper is to exhibit the processes of cal
      culation of the values of the two solutions of the equation
                                 dx1   x    dx    \                                  (1).
     for successive     values of x in the two cases of n = 0 and n =       1.
          That is  if
                                     y =    Aln^ + BK^z)
    be     the   complete     integral of (1), where K„(a) is a function which
    becomes      zero when x is indefinitely increased, our object is to calculate
    the    values of I0(«), I^-c), K0(.t), Kj(a) for successive equidistant values
    of x.
         The values     of I0(x) and Ix(x) have been calculated and published by
    a  committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.
    To the best of          the writer's knowledge, no          steps have been taken
    towards the computation of K0(x) and K^-t).                 The Tables I and II, at
   the end      of this paper, give the values of these latter functions for in-
-
   tervals of 0-l in the argument, to such a large number of decimal
;  places as will make it a mere matter of difference calculation              to detcr-
   mine intermediate values of K0(z) and K[(a:) to any reasonable degree
   of accuracy, at any rate for values of x greater than unity ; and also by
If
   means of the sequence laws to derive those of K2(x), Ks(./)                      , as
   tar as may be requisite.
       It will be convenient to state a number of well-known theorems in
   regard to the solution of (1).
       2. The function I„(z) is defined by the condition
                                                     / x \»+2r

Thus the successive terms of I0(x) and l^x) are obtained by multiplying
by series of factors of the form \x\r +
   a                                          the alternate terms when       1;

one column, the even ones in another, and by addition of each column
the values of I0(x) and Ij(x) are obtained.
   In working out the values of I0(x) and \x(x) given                                             in Table   I,   all the

  multiplications by Jx/r + 1 have been conducted in two different forms
  to avoid the possibility of mistakes.             Thus, for instance, in working
  out I0(5-2) and I^S-2), the factor £a;/8, or 2-6/8, can be used as it
  stands,                                                 \
           or as jji, and also put into the form + i. The adoption in all
  cases of  two quite different processes is an almost infallible guide to the
  detection of a mistake.
      7. The values of I0(x) and Il(x) being thus obtained, K0(x) and K^z)
  can be derived.
      We have
   K„(.) =     -I0(,){log,-E}+{(|)V(|)ln^+(|)-{^p+...}
           =   -I0(*){log*-E}         + {)8i +  ^SI + ^A + i8A+...}.
 But 0 =      Io(*)-l -{& + & + & + &+                      }.
 Adding

 Hence
 Ko(*)= -I0(x){log.r-E-l}-l                   + {74 + y6 + y8+           }           (10)
     The value of I0(x) is known and that of log x can                   be   found from
Wolfram's Table. The quantities y-ir must be derived,                      each from the
corresponding /?&'•
    For earlier values of     y-2r   the multiplier Sr      -  1 is most easily used in
the natural form

    In using    the primary form, many simplifications are possible, thus
i  + £ = £ = rf, and the multiplication is effected by shifting the decimal
point one place to the right, and dividing by 12.

different processes for computing each y have been employed,                                 so that
any mistake is almost certain to have been detected.
   For the lower values of x a second process of calculating the values
of yir has been found from the obvious fact that if y'-2r be the value of
72r when x becomes rjm,
                                        Y»    =
                                                  -^
Thus the values of the quantities y for x = 2-6 can be deduced from
those for x = 5-2 by a series of divisions by 2 or powers of 2.
   For the values of x from x = 3-l upwards, this process was not
available, but either two different transformations   of the sum of the
vulgar fractions, or one such transformation,                    and the decimalized           value
have been used in every case.
  Another process, which           has been occasionally used, when the fraction
\xjr +   1   happened       to be in low terms, is based on the easily proved
formula
It only                                                      - -

             remains
to this product, to subtract the sum from ~y.      The value of K,(/),
which is always a positive quantity, is then obtained.

quantities already found.

differentiations, produce .in error of   unit in the sixth place from the

end, consequently completely disorganise the sequence of the eighteenth
differences which consist only of five figures.    That this has actually
happened in this case the writer has shown by examining the effect of
adding to the values of K0(z) given in Table        the three additional           I

    figures,   two of them certainly correct, which he has calculated.                     The
   differences at the lower end of the table then become regular up to
   the   twentieth order.
       This process has not been applied to the K,(z) column, because the
   writer     believes that, granted K0(x) correct, the verification formula
   above sufficiently proves the accuracy of K^r).                        The values of the
   quantities      in Table I are believed to be correct to the last figure given.
   A dot after the last figure indicates that it has been increased by unity,
   the first figure omitted being equal to or greater than 5.
       11. Table      II has been computed by means of the formula (9).
       The remainder after s terms in the series involves tho integral —
                                     £»+*-&£-*     1 +   —        dz,
   where     6 is some proper fraction.
       Now whatever n may be, after a time n s                   - -\     becomes negative.
   When s has reached such a value, inspection of (9) shows that the
  terms in the series thereafter are alternately positive and negative,
  inasmuch as a new negative factor is in troduced in forming each suc
  cessive     coefficient.    It is also evident that,         from and after that point
  in the series, the       quantity      1 +—          *    is numerically less than unity,
                                       (         J
 and      the    remainder    required at any point to give the value of Kn(x) is
  numerically less than the next term in the series.
      Consequently, after the alternation of signs has begun, the sums of
 8   terms,     (s+1) terms, («+ 2) terms, &c, will                be  a series of quantities
 alternately greater         and     less than the value of         Kn(/).    As long  as the
 terms of the series diminish,              it is possible in this way to obtain         a set
 of    quantities,     continually approaching one another, between alternate
 pairs of      which K„(a-) must lie.
      For the values n = 0, n = 1, (9) gives —

Hence the sum of 1, 3, 5, ... terms is numerically greater than the

     The       r+lth      term    is    derived from the rth by              multiplying    by
(2r

is less     than the rth, and the terms continue                to diminish.      The r+ 1th

   The relations (16) are                             adapted  to logarithmic computation.    The

                                    (Abstract.)
                                   Introduction.
   The subject of the partition of numbers, for its proper development,
requires treatment in a new and more comprehensive manner. The
subject matter of the theory needs enlargement.            This will be found
to be a necessary consequence of the new method of regarding             a parti
tion that is here brought into prominence.
   Let an integer n be broken up into any number of integers
                              an    a2>  aa>      a«>
and we ascribe the conditions
the succession
                               «1»   a2» a8       a»
is what is known as a partition of n.
                -
   There are s 1 conditions
                       ai»a2. a2»a8              a«-l»a«>
to which we may add
if the integers be all of them positive (or zero).
   For the present all the integers are restricted to the positive or zero
by hypothesis, so that this last-written condition will not be further
attended to.
   If, on the other hand, the conditions be
                             OjSOjao,              5a,
no order of magnitude is supposed to exist between the successive parts,
and we obtain what has been termed a " composition
                                                             "
                                                               of the integer n.
   Various other systems of partitions into s parts may be brought
under view, because between two consecutive parts we may place             either
of the seven symbols
                             =*i =. *> =,    *¦ =*. 5-
   We thus     obtain  7*_1  different     sets  of conditions that may be
assigned  ; these are not all essentially different, and in many cases they
overlap.

          Memoir on      the  Theory     of the Partition of Numbers.             225
   For the moment      I concentrate attention upon the symbol
and remark     that the    s -  1 conditions which          involve this symbol, set
forth above, constitute      one set of a larger class of sets which involve
the  symbol.    We may have the single condition
                A^o, +     V^ V*,   +           +         +  A/"*     =z 0,
wherein   Aj, Aj,    Ag        As are integers        +, zero, or        -,of which at
least one must be positive,      or we may have the set of conditions
             Ai,1,ai +   V*       +  V«.      +         +  a.'1'**  =  °
             Ai(2,ai  + A2t2,«2 + A3l2,a8 +             +  V2'** £ 0
              Ai(8,«i + A2,8)«2 + Ag'8»aj +             + A8'3,a,   ==0
              Ai(r,ai +  A2Ir)ai! + A8(rla8+            +  A/rix,zO
as  the definition of the partitions considered.
   If the symbol be = instead of a the solution of the equations falls
into the province of linear Diophantine analysis.                  The problem before
us may be regarded       as being one of      linear partition analysis.       There is
much in common between the two theories; the problems may be
treated by somewhat similar methods, and lead to results of the same
general character.
   The partition      analysis of degree higher than the first, like the
Diophantine,    is of a more recondite nature, and is left for the present
out of consideration.
   I  treat the partition conditions by the method of generating                  func
tions.   I seek the summation
                              SX/iX/OC^                 X„<-
for every set of values (integers)
                                  an    a2>  a8>      a«
which satisfy the assigned conditions.
   It appears that there are, in every case, a finite number of ground or
fundamental solutions of the conditions, viz. : —

Mr. J. D. Hamilton Dickson, M.A., Fellow of Peterhouse, who con
tributed a paper to the ' Phil. Mag.' for June, 1898, on " The Reduction

 228             Prof.  J.  Dewar.       On the Boiling Point     of
to Normal     Air Temperature      of the Platinum      Thermometers," used in
the low temperature researches of Professor Fleming and the author, has
been good enough to calculate a special formula for this thermometer
No. 7. He finds the formula
                                    = 2-03596488
               (R + 43-958933)'2                     (t+ 1193-1460)
expresses    the   relation between the resistance and temperature in
centigrade degrees.        This expression gives a probable error of only
0-16° C. over a range of more than 300° C. When this thermometer
was placed in boiling hydrogen, the resistance became 0-129 ohm, and
remained constant at this value.           Calculated into the Dickson formula,
this value of the resistance corresponds to a temperature of          - 238-4° C.
If we assume the resistance reduced to zero, then the temperature
registered by the thermometer ought to be             - 244° C.   At the boiling
point   of  hydrogen, therefore,        if  the law correlating resistance and
temperature can be pressed to its limits, a lowering of the boiling point
of hydrogen by 5° or 6° C. would produce a condition of affairs where
the platinum would have no resistance, or become a perfect conductor.
Now we have every reason to believe that hydrogen, like other liquids,
will boil at a lower temperature the lower the pressure under which it
is volatilised.   The question arises, how much lowering of temperature
can we practically anticipate.         For this purpose we have the boiling
point and critical data available from which we can calculate an ap
proximate vapour pressure formula, accepting 35° abs. as the boiling
point; 52° abs. as the critical temperature, and 19-4 at. as the critical
pressure ; then as a first approximation
                         logp    =                     mm                     (1).
                                    6-8218-1^-
   If instead of using the critical pressure in the calculation we assume
the molecular latent heat of hydrogen is proportional to the absolute
boiling point, then from a comparison with an expression of the same
kind,   which gives      accurate    results   for oxygen   tensions  below one
atmosphere,     we can derive another          expression for hydrogen vapour
pressures, which ought to be       applicable to boiling points under reduced
pressure.
   The resulting formula is
                          \ogp   = 7-2428
                                              -^1- mm                         (2).
   Now formula (1) gives       a  boiling point of 25-4°     abs.  under a pres
sure of 25 mm., whereas the second equation (2) gives for the same
pressure 26-1° abs. As the absolute boiling point under atmospheric
pressure is 35°, both expressions lead to the conclusion that ebullition

               Liquid Hydrogen under Reduced Pressure.             229
under 25 mm. pressure ought to reduce the boiling point some 10° C.
For some time experiments have been in progress with the object of
determining the temperature of hydrogen boiling under about 25 mm.
 pressure, but the difficulties encountered have been so great, and
repeated failures so exasperating,     that a record of the results so
far reached becomes advisable. The troubles arise from the conduction
of heat by the leads ; the small latent heat of hydrogen volume for
volume as compared with liquid air ; the inefficiency of heat isolation
and the strain on the thermometer brought about by solid air freezing
on it and distorting the coil of wire.   In many experiments the result
has been that all the liquid hydrogen has evaporated before the pres
sure was reduced to 25 mm., or the thermometer was left imperfectly
covered.    The apparatus employed will be understood from the figure.
                                         Tbcha pump
The liquid hydrogen collected in the vacuum vessel A was suspended
in a larger vessel of the same kind B, which is so constructed that a
spiral tube joins the inner and outer test-tubes of which B is made,
thereby making an opening into the interior at C. The resistance
thermometer D and leads E pass through a rubber cork F, and the

230     Boiling Point of Liquid Hydrogen under Reduced Pressure.
exhaustion takes place through C. In this way the cold vapours are
drawn over the outside of the hydrogen vacuum vessel, and this helps
to isolate the liquid from the connective currents of gas. To effect
proper isolation the whole apparatus ought to have been immersed in
liquid air under exhaustion.                   Arrangements of this kind add to the
complication, so in the first instance the liquid was used as described.
The liquid hydrogen evaporated quietly and steadily under a pressure
of about 25 mm. of mercury, without the least appearance of solidifica
tion or loss of mobility ; still remaining clear and colourless to the eye.
Naturally the liquid does not last long, so the resistance has to be taken
quickly. Just before the reduction of pressure began, the resistance
of the thermometer was 0-131 ohm. This result compares favourably
with the former observation on the boiling point, which gave a resist
ance of (H29 ohm. On reducing the pressure, the resistance diminished
to (H14 ohm, and kept steady for some time.                                 The lowest reading of
resistance   was    0'112       ohm.        This value corresponds to -239'1°C, or
only one degree lower than the boiling point at atmospheric pressure,
whereas the temperature ought to have been reduced some 10' C.
or in any case 5° under the assumed exhaustion.                                              The position
of the observation             on the curve of the relation of temperature
and resistance for No. 7 thermometer is shown on the accompanying
diagram.     The question arises then as to what is the explanation of

         Liquid Hydrogen for        the Production   of High Vacua.        231
this result   t Has the platinum resistance thermometer arrived at a
limiting resistance about 35° aba., so that at a lower temperature it
refuses to change in resistance, the curve having become practically
asymptotic to the axis of temperature 1 On the other hand, has the
influx of heat by the leads, and the correction on account of this
change of resistance, become so great as to vitiate the results at these
excessively low temperatures 1 Again, it may be suggested that the
thermometer was not properly cooled, or that the liquid hydrogen does
not lower in temperature to any marked extent under exhaustion like
other liquids. All these conjectures can only be set at rest by a repeti
tion of the experiments with a new thermometer of much higher initial
resistance, and under conditions of better heat isolation. No blunder
having been detected in the observations, for the present we must
assume that the platinum resistance thermometer No. 7 acts in the
manner described.     It would be premature to discuss the inferences to
be drawn from these results until they are confirmed on another
variety of platinum wire made into a resistance thermometer.      But as.
this will involve the use of considerable quantities of liquid hydrogen,
it will take some time to complete the investigation.
   The same kind of anomaly appears in the case of the use of a thermo-
junction at these low temperatures, but this is a separate matter, and
must be dealt with in a further communication.
   I am indebted to Mr. J. E. Petavel for assistance in the electrical
measurements, and also to Mr. Robert Lennox and Mr. Heath for
 their general help in the conduct of the experiments.

    As an illustration   of the extraordinary power of the new cooling
agent — liquid hydrogen, the extreme rapidity with which high vacua
can be produced by its use    is,
                              perhaps, one of the most striking. The
absolute boiling points of hydrogen, oxygen, and chlorine are respec
tively 35°, 90° and 240°, in other words oxygen boils at    temperature
                                                             a
two and   a half times higher than liquid hydrogen, and  liquid chlorine
similarly at two and      a   half times that of liquid oxygen.      From
this we infer that liquid hydrogen as      acooling agent ought to be rela
tive to liquid air as effectivo as the latter   compared to that of liquid
                                               is
chlorine.   Now chlorine at the temperature of boiling oxygen     is  hard
                                                                       a
solid, some 80° below its melting point, and in this condition has an
excessively feeble vapour pressure.        When liquid hydrogen freezes
air out of sealed tube by immersing the end in the liquid,

  inferred that no measurable pressure of air ought to be left in the
  vessel.     If we apply Van der Waal's law of corresponding temperatures
  to the case of hydrogen, the above inference is made unimpeachable.
  An approach to some knowledge of what the tension of air must be
 about the boiling point of hydrogen can be attained by extrapolating
 the vapour pressure curves of oxygen and nitrogen.                Taking the follow

    Another Gibbs formula was calculated, taking Estreicher's values for
 the vapour pressure of liquid oxygen below its boiling point, viz. : —

    We deduce from these formulae the following vapour pressures at
the temperature          of boiling hydrogen : —
       (1) Nitrogen                      0-0015      Pressure in mm., 35° abs.

    The results of calculation, taking the formulae for the widest range
of pressures, viz., (1) and (2), may probably be the surest, but in
any     case    those     values    must   be  taken   as  a maximum,     seeing they
refer to the liquid state, while both oxygen and nitrogen, at the tem
perature of 35° absolute, are hard solids, and must therefore have
dropped to lower tensions than that of the extrapolated liquid vapour
pressure curves.           It is curious to note that at this low temperature the
theoretical ratio of the tensions of nitrogen and oxygen is as 20 to 1.
Direct measurements of the vapour pressure of nitrogen at the melting

      Production of Vacua, and their Spectroscopic Examination.               233
 point, or 60° absolute, gave the value of 26 mm., and a ratio of the
 tensions of nitrogen to oxygen of 6 to 1, whereas from the curves the
 value ought to be 6-7 to 1.       Olszewski gives the tension of nitrogen at
  - 214° as 60 mm.,     and   as  at this temperature      the oxygen tension is
 3-8 mm.,   the ratio of the saturated pressures        of the two gases at the
 melting point of nitrogen would be as 16 to 1, which is far too high.
 Probably the oxygen value will be nearest the truth, seeing it has the
 lowest  melting point.       The tension    is   about   a ten millionth of an
 atmosphere.     In the   case of nitrogen, the    maximum theoretical pressure
 would be one        five-hundred-thousandth of an atmosphere.              It is
 safe to  infer that the vacuum        left after liquefying the air out of a
 vessel by means of liquid hydrogen cannot exceed the millionth part
 of the atmospheric pressure, exclusive of the pressure resulting from
 any incondensable material other than nitrogen and oxygen.               This is
just about the pressure of the vapour of mercury at the ordinary tem
 perature in the Torricellian vacuum, so that as good an exhaustion
ought to result as can be got by boiling out a space with mercury.
There is another way in which the question may be put.                 Assuming
the molecular latent heats are approximately proportioned to the abso
lute boiling points, then we can, from a comparison with the oxygen
value, deduce that of hydrogen, and thereby get the constants in a
two-term formula for the vapour pressures.              For pressures below an
atmosphere, the following approximate           formulae were deduced   : —
                 Oxygen             log^ = 7-2058     -        mm
                                                         ^l6                  (4).
                 Hydrogen...        log1p = 7-2428    - —~     mm             (5).
   From these expressions it follows that at its boiling point, or 35°
absolute, hydrogen has 7/852000 times the pressure of oxygen, or the
latter pressure is about the eight millionth of an atmosphere.                  A
similar formula, calculated from the critical and boiling point data,
gives substantially the same order of quantities.               Formula (4) for
oxygen tensions must be fairly accurate, seeing it gives a theoretical
latent heat of about 56 units per gram of liquid evaporating at the
boiling point, whereas direct determinations result in 55 units. To test
this inference,    the following plan of experimenting was adopted : —
Ordinary shaped vacuum tubes, like A, B, used for the spectroscopic
examination of gases, with and without electrodes (figs. 1 and 2),
having a capacity ranging from 15 to 25 c.c., had pieces of quill tubing
about a foot long sealed on.        The tubes were contracted at D to about
1 mm.,   so   that  they could be sealed off with rapidity.          The end C
sometimes terminated       in  a small bulb (fig. 3), in order to give increased
cooling surface, and, when necessary, to allow many times the volume

of air in  A, B, to enter and be condensed with the object of accumu
lating any incondensable residuum.
   The tubes were filled with air, oxygen, and nitrogen at the atmo
spheric pressure.     The liquid hydrogen collected in the vacuum vessel,
immersed in another similar vessel full of liquid air, being ready, the
end C was dipped in the liquid for a little over a minute, and the tube
AB sealed off at D, so that on removal from the hydrogen bath the
solid air might melt and distil off without generating any pressure.
On attempting to pass the spark through vacuum tubes prepared in
this manner, their excellent exhaustion was revealed by great resistance
to the passage of the discharge, and the high phosphorescence of the
glass.   Two tubes, kindly prepared by Sir William Crookes with
platinum electrodes that he had previously sparked to remove gases
and impurities on the glass before filling with dry air, gave, when
treated in the manner described, such high vacua that the tubes
                                                                        had
to be heated in order to get any spark to pass. Thus it is proved that
the tension of solid nitrogen and oxygen at the temperature of boiling
hydrogen is below the millionth of an atmosphere, seeing there is less
difficulty in getting a discharge to pass in tubes exhausted to this
extent.    In order to get some definite idea of the limit of the exhaus
tion produced, two tubes, such     as have been described  as  suitable  for

       Production of Vacua, and their Spectroscopic Examination.                     235
the liquid    hydrogen experiments, might be joined together and filled
with oxygen   or nitrogen at atmospheric pressure, and simultaneously
exhausted with the mercurial pump to a small fraction of an atmo
sphere, and then sealed off from the pump and each other.         One of
these two identical tubes could then be subjected        to the hydrogen
cooling, following the directions already given,    and  the two vacuum
tubes now compared.      If there was a marked difference in resistance
to the passage of the discharge in the frozen tube, then something
must have condensed, and by a few tentative trials a limit might
be reached when the initial exhaustion was unaffected by the hydrogen
cooling.   Such experiments have not yet been made. The presence of
any vapour of mercury would require to be carefully eliminated, other
wise the method would not be satisfactory.       Tubes that are prepared
without taking special precautions to exclude organic matter and water
from the glass, deteriorate, especially with electrodeless tubes after the
discharge has taken place for some time.
   The rapidity with which the vacua are attained is such as theory
would suggest; assuming       a hole of a square millimetre in section
through which the air rushes into the condenser, and that a velocity of
current between 600 and 700 feet a second is attained,                   then a vessel of
20 c.c. capacity could be reduced in pressure in 1 second to 1/10 of the
initial pressure, and if the same rate is continued at the end of
60 seconds to (xV)00-  Sir George Stokes has been good enough to
consider the problem and writes as follows : —

   " This would give a density of almost inconceivable smallness.
Doubtless the supposition made above as to the rate of discharge is
very wide of the mark, being much too great.                  If the velocity of
rushing is about half the velocity of sound,       the  ratio of densities would
become 72 x 102i7.      If so it is satisfactory to find that the mathematical
following out of the hypothesis leads to a density of the residual air in
 the vessel which is enormously below what suffices to account for the
observed result." A practical mode of rapidly attaining a high vacuum
in any vessel is to displace the air with carbonic or sulphurous acid,
either at the atmospheric or under diminished pressure, and then to
freeze out the remaining gas by the use of liquid air, just as in the
experiments with liquid hydrogen.
   The first vacuum tube was an electrodeless one, the air had not
been dried, nor the glass specially cleaned.        On spectroscopic examina
tion it showed hydrogen lines bright along with the second or compound
line spectrum of the same gas, and a series of bright bands defined on
the less refrangible side, diffuse on the more refrangible, which occur
in the yellow, green, blue, and indigo. These bands were found to be
identical with the carbonic oxide spectrum.           With a Leyden jar in the
secondary circuit the line spectrum of hydrogen disappeared, leaving
the second spectrum fainter ; but the carbonic oxide bands remained
bright, and there was no appearance of the hydrocarbon spectrum.
The second tube had aluminium electrodes, and, like the last, had no
special treatment in filling in the air. This tube showed also the line
spectrum and the second spectrum of hydrogen ; the latter being
bright along with the carbonic oxide spectrum ; but on sparking the
latter disappeared.      No appearance of the hydrocarbon spectrum could
be detected, but there was a suspicion of bands in the indigo like the
negative pole spectrum of nitrogen.            The addition of a Leyden jar
brought out nothing new, only intensifying the line spectrum of
hydrogen, while leaving the second spectrum bright.                In neither of
the above tubes could any lines of nitrogen or oxygen be recognised.
The third tube was filled with air drawn over cotton wool, red-hot
copper oxide, and phosphoric pentoxide, no rubber joints being em
ployed.    The spectrum showed the carbonic oxide bands and the
hydrogen line spectrum as before.                Only the second hydrogen
spectrum was feeble.         There was a yellow line W.L. 5849, identical
with one occurring in the natural gas from the King's Well at Bath.
In a paper on " The Liquefaction of Air and the Detection of Impuri
ties,"* the separation of helium from this gas is described by liquefac
tion and fractionation, and it was observed that during the sparking
                                                      "
the helium lines were well marked along with others, the origin of which
mast be settled later."   It was further observed, " With a modified form of

  3 cubic  feel of air or Bath gas, but from hundreds of cubic feel of such
 products."    The helium and other associated material was shown to be
 more   volatile than nitrogen. Pursuing this course of investigation in
 the summer of this year, the volatile portion of air was examined,
 when the presence of material giving the same lines as Bath helium
 was recognised.       While this investigation was in progress, Professor
 Ramsay and Dr. Travers observed the same spectrum in the more volatile
 portion of argon which they have associated with a new element called
 neon.     The use of liquid hydrogen, as described, proves that the most
 chfiracteristic line of neon in the yellow, about W.L. 5849, can be detected
 in 25 c.e. of ordinary air, and the presence of helium in the atmosphere
 is confirmed.*
    A fourth tube, filled like the preceding one, had a phosphoric pent-
 oxide tube left on.      This showed again the carbonic oxide bands, but
 no hydrogen lines could be detected ; while the oxide of copper ought
 to have removed all free hydrogen and transformed all the organic
 matter into carbonic acid and water.               Yet it appears that the
 spectrum of the carbon compounds is difficult to remove from electrode-
 less tubes, probably owing to carbonic acid coming from the glass.
 There were some broad diffuse bands that may arise from the drying
agent.      The absence of hydrogen in this tube suggests that its presence
in the third tube was due to vapour of water coming slowly from the
glass.     I am greatly indebted to Professor Liveing for making a
careful examination of the spectra of these tubes.
    Sir William Crookes was good enough to prepare two tubes with
platinum electrodes, which he sparked in vacua till all hydrogen dis
appeared, and then filled with dry air, but without the use of red-hot
copper oxide or any agent for the absorption of carbonic acid or the
destruction of organic matter. After the cooling with liquid hydrogen,
he found on spectroscopic examination, in one no hydrogen, but two
faint lines, one about 5852 W.L. and the other 5676 W.L.                      The
second tube showed the same yellow about 5852, the helium line
along with 5939 and 6145, the hydrogen lines C and F, and some red
lines. The observations of Crookes confirm the presence of neon,
helium, and hydrogen.         The absence in his tubes of the carbonic oxide
spectrum is important, seeing all the electrodeless tubes gave this
spectrum. In these tubes the vacuum was very high, and it was
difficult to observe the gaseous spectrum. Still, the fact of finding hydro-
    • In   a paper along with Professor Liveing, " On the Spectra of the Eleclrio
Discharge in Liquid Oxygen, Air, and Nitrogen," ' Phil. Mag.,' 1894, we noted that
during the distillation and concentration in vacuo of liquid oxygen and air under
diminished pressure that two bright lines appeared in the spectrum at wave-lengths
557 and 555, and that one of these lines was very near the position of the auroral
line.     These lines arc now attributed  by the same chemists to  a new element,

gen in one and not in the other, leaves the presence of free hydrogen
in the atmosphere as a question for further inquiry.        The tube that
did not contain hydrogen was heated very hot in order to get a
discharge, and then the spectrum showed some bands like the negative
glow of nitrogen. Occasionally, a jar discharge was got to pass, and
when this took place the nitrogen lines could be seen. An electrodeless
tube filled carefully with oxygen made from fused chlorate of potash,
which was contained in an extension of the vacuum tube gave nothing
but the carbonic oxide bands.       In future experiments it will be easy
to concentrate all the most volatile material in air or other gases,
and thereby to make a more thorough examination of the spectrum.
In the meantime my object is to show one of the scientific uses of liquid
hydrogen.

of the difficult experiments.     Mr. Heath has also helped in the work.

 on  intermittently in the intervals of other work.
    Preliminary reports on some of our results have been laid before the
 British Association at the Ipswich, Liverpool, Toronto, and Bristol
 meetings, and a short paper on one section of the subject was commu

 year.    In the   present paper  we  give a  full account,   with  illustrations,
 of the   detailed evidence upon which our various conclusions are based.
 The following is a brief statement of the more important results given
 in the paper   : —
    1.  Although    our  primary object was to study the oyster under
unhealthy conditions, in order to [elucidate its supposed connection
 with infective disease, we found it necessary to study in minute detail
 the histology of certain parts of the body, especially the gills and
 mantle lobes, the alimentary canal and liver.           We give figures and
 descriptions of these structures in both normal and abnormal condi
 tions.
    2.   We have also worked out the distribution and probable function
 of a    minute muscle, which we believe to be the modified representa
 tive of the protractor pedis muscle of some other molluscs.
    3. A diseased condition we found in certain American oysters very
soon brought us into contact with the vexed question of the

there are several distinct kinds of greenness in oysters.        Some of them,

Essex coast, are healthy ; while others, such as some Falmouth oysters,
containing copper, and some American oysters re-bedded on our coast,
and which have the pale-green " leucocytosis

former paper to the Royal Society, are not in a healthy state.
    4. Some forms of greenness (e.g., the leucocytosis)            are certainly
associated    with   the presence  of a greatly   increased   amount    of copper
in the oyster, while other forms of greenness (e.g., that of the Marennes
oysters) have no connection with copper, but depend upon the presence
of a special pigment, " marennin."

granular cells on the surface of the gills as leucocytes which have
escaped from the blood spaces, and have probably assumed a phago
cytic function.
   5. We see no reason to think that any iron which may be asso
ciated with the marennin in the gills, &c., is taken in through the
surface epithelium of the gill and palps, but regard          it,
                                                          like the rest               of

green parts (gills, palp, &c.) of the Marennes oyster contain either
absolutely or relatively to the colourless parts (mantle, &c.) more iron

is more copper in the green American oyster than in the colourless
one   ;and more proportionately in the greener parts than in those that
are less green.  We therefore conclude that their green colour      due          is
to copper.    We also find a greater quantity of iron in those green
American oysters than in the colourless        ;but this excess     propor is,
tionately, considerably  less than that of the  copper.

than does the normal colourless oyster.     In these Falmouth oysters the
cause  of the green  colour   may  be the  same   as in the green American
oyster.

find that the copper reactions correspond in distribution with the green

                        is

green leucocytosis, in which copper in notable amount        stored up

   12.   Although we did not find the Bacillus        typlwsus   in any oysters
obtained from the sea or from the markets,           yet  in  oil: experimental
oysters inoculated with typhoid we were able to recover the organism
from the body of the oyster up to the tenth day.           We show that the
typhoid bacillus does not increase in the body or in the tissues of the
oyster, and our figures indicate that the bacilli perish in the intestine.
   13. Our experiments showed that sea- water was inimical to the
growth of the typhoid bacilli.         Although their presence was demon
strated in one case on the twenty-first day after addition to the water,
still there appeared to be no initial or subsequent multiplication of the
bacilli.
   14.   In our  experiments in washing infected oysters in a stream of
clean    sea-water the results were definite and uniform ; there was a
great   diminution or total disappearance of the typhoid bacilli in from
one to seven days.
   15.   The colon group of bacilli is frequently found in shell-fish as sold
in towns, and especially in the oyster ; but we have no evidence that it
occurs in mollusca living in pure sea water.             The natural inference
that the presence of the colon bacillus invariably indicates sewage con
tamination must, however, not be considered               established   without
further investigation.
   16.   The colon group may be separated into two divisions : (1) those
giving the typical reactions of the colon bacillus, and (2) those giving
corresponding negative reactions, and so approaching               the typhoid
type ; but in no case was an organism giving all the reactions of the
B. typhosus isolated.     It ought to be remembered, however, that our
samples of oysters, although of various            kinds and from different
sources, were    in  no case,  so far  as we   are  aware, derived from a bed
known to be contaminated or suspected of typhoid.
    17. We have shown also the frequent occurrence, in various shell
fish from the shops, of anaerobic spore-bearing bacilli giving the cha
racteristics of the B. enlerilidis sporogenes recently described by Klein.
    18. As the result of our work, we make certain recommendations            as
to the    sanitary regulation and registration of the oyster       beds, and as
to quarantine for oysters imported from abroad.

    It is well known that   a small   bright object for which the eye is not
accommodated      often presents   a  multiform    appearance, the number of
separate   images perceived varying in different cases from about six to

fifteen.       In Helmholtz's       '
                                      Physiological Optics,' drawings are given
illustrative of the phenomena exhibited by a luminous point when the
conjugate focus is situated a little in front of or a little behind the
retina.      A narrow luminous line such as that formed when a spectro
scope     slit   is held before a flame or other bright background may
become similarly multiplied.              These and other allied phenomena are
believed to arise from the suture-like radial lines, six or more in
number, which occur upon the two surfaces of the crystalline lens.
    It is also known that as the result of disease or malformation of the
eye, the patient may habitually see several images of single objects.
But in the course of a careful search among physical and physiological
publications, in which Dr. Dawson Turner, of Edinburgh, has most
kindly assisted me, I have been unable to find any reference to certain
curious phenomena of vision which attracted my notice in the year
 1897, and which form the subject of the present communication.                   It
appears that under siutable conditions a normal healthy eye can see
hundreds        of independent images of a single point, an effect which
probably results from the cellular structure of the lenses and the mem
branes associated with them.
    In the earlier observations,          the object consisted of a small bright
disc.    Several     different    discs were employed, their diameters ranging
 from   0"5 mm. to 8 mm.,          and other details were also varied, but (when
 the circumstances were suitably modified) the results were in all cases
 of the same nature.           It  will be convenient    to describe the procedure
actually carried out in a particular experiment ; but, except as furnish
ing a rough guide for the repetition of the experiment, no special
 importance       must be attached       to the distances mentioned ; they vary
 greatly for different        individuals, and from time to time even for the
 same eye.
     The condenser of       a  lantern was covered with two sheets of glass, the
 one ground and the other deep red.                In front of these was placed a
 brass plate, in the middle of which was drilled a hole TV inch (2 mm.)
 in diameter.       Inside the lantern was an incandescent electric lamp of
  25-candle power.            The observer, standing with his left eye at a
 distance of about 2 feet from the hole in the plate, first covered the
  hole with a concave lens of 11 inches (28 cm.) focal length, held in his
  hand, and then slowly moved the lens towards his eye. When the
  lens was some four or five inches away from the hole, the outline of the
 little bright disc began to appear multiple ; there seemed, in fact, to be
  a number of little discs almost, but not quite exactly, superposed.            As
  the lens approached the eye, the images became gradually more and
  more widely dispersed, and when the eye was reached, they had
  become completely separated.             There now appeared to be seven bright
  discs — a central one surrounded          by six others, their arrangement  being
  fairly symmetrical      ;  these were backed by an irregular luminous        haze

          On the  Formation of Multiple Images in      the  Normal Eye.       243
  of nearly   circular outline.    If  the light was made stronger, each of the
  circumferential discs acquired a pointed tail, directed radially outwards,
 and the whole appeared like a six-rayed star.          So far there is little or
 nothing new in the observation.
     The observer then gradually moved backwards,          still holding the lens
 at his eye ; the    outer discs at once began to elongate radially, and each
 soon became resolved into two or more, the approximate symmetry of
 the figure being still retained.       When the distance from the eye to the
 hole was 3 feet, the number of images that could be counted was about
 twenty, and the appearance presented was happily likened, by an expert
 person     who confirmed my observations, to that of a large unripe black
 berry.      If an orange-yellow glass were substituted for the dark red
 one,   the stronger illumination again gave rise to the development of
 tails, and the blackberry became transformed into a beautiful flower.
 At   4  feet distance the images had increased to about forty, which was
 nearly the greatest number that could be counted with any degree of
 certainty.      But, while becoming much less easily distinguishable, they
 still obviously continued to multiply.           At 25 feet there was seen a
 mottled luminous patch streaked with. a few bright lines, evidently cor
 responding with the sutures of the crystalline lens.         These bright lines
 were     found to consist of overlapping images of the round hole, and
 traces of many similar images could be detected in different parts of the
 mottled patch.
    The above described       effects can be observed equally well and with
but    little modification when the lens employed is convex instead of
 concave ; indeed, any one who is skilled in the mangement of his eyes
 may dispense with the lens altogether.
    I have tried to describe the phenomena as seen with my left eye.
 With the right eye they are of the same general character, but differ in
details ; in particular, the separate images first seen are less symmetri
cally arranged, and their number appears to be eight instead of seven.
The observations in question would be found difficult or impossible by
a novice in optical      experiment, partly on account of his inability to
keep    his  eye  in a definite   state of accommodation, but chiefly perhaps
because he would not recognise what he saw.
    I thought that the observations might be rendered easier if the
source of light had a more distinctive and conspicuous form than that
of a simple circle.       Experiments were, therefore, made with a semi
circular hole, and this was in some respects an improvement ; but far
better results were afterwards obtained by using as a Source of light
the horseshoe-shaped filament of an electric lamp, screened         by a coloured
glass.      When such a lamp was looked at through a lens, concave or
convex, of about 6 inches focal length, from a distance of a few feet,
the roughly oval patch of luminosity formed upon the retina appeared
to be made up of a crowd of separate images of the filament, some

being brighter than others, as represented in fig. 1. The number was
apparently few when the observer was near the lamp, and greatly
increased as he retired from               it,
                                   or moved the lens further from his eye.
     It   occurred to me that the analysis of the luminous field would be
facilitated      if    the attention could          be confined to   a   small portion of it.
With this object in view   interposed an adjustable slit taken from
                                      I                                                         a
spectroscope, between the eye and the lens, and adjusted its width                              by
trial. When the round hole in the brass plate was viewed through this
arrangement      appeared like a string of bright beads, arranged not
                      it                                                                        in
a perfectly straight line but somewhat sinuously. A slight movement
of the slit in  direction perpendicular to its length produced
                     a                                            curious             a
wavelike motion of the beads.
     By sufficiently increasing            the distance    between the source of light
and the eye, perhaps as many                       as twenty-four or twenty-five bright
spots might be made to appear in the row, but they could not be
counted with certainty.  At greater distance, or with lens of shorter
                                           a                               a
focus, the spots became indistinct and blurred.
   The appearance presented by the filament of the electric lamp, when
seen through the slit, made ^ inch (0-3mm.) wide, and          convex lens of
5 inches (127 cm.) focus     very well imitated in figs.

          On the Formation    of Multiple Images in          the   Normal Eye.          245
     If   the distance   between    the eye and the incandescent filament is
made much more than 8 feet, or          if a lens of shonter focus is employed,
the multiple images become blurred and indistinct ; at a distance of
20 feet with a lens of 3 inches (7-6 cm.) focal length, the separate
images appeared to have coalesced, but the band of light was crossed by
a very large number of hazy dark lines at right angles to its length
and at   fairly equal distances apart.
     Thinking that the original images had been resolved into still simpler
elements,       I   endeavoured    to ascertain    how   many       elements     were   de
veloped        from each image.        Fixing my attention upon              a conspicuous
image near the end of the          row,   I   moved a convex lens slowly forwards
in front of the slit, and carefully watched the changes which occurred.
It was found very difficult to follow them satisfactorily, but the con
clusion arrived at was that the space corresponding to a single image
was ultimately crossed by from fifteen to twenty dark lines ; hence,
assuming twenty-five images, the total number of elements would be
four or five hundred.
    Taking the diameter of the pupil when feebly illuminated to be
 \ inch, these latter observations seem to indicate some fairly regular
 anatomical structure in or near the crystalline lens, and composed of
 cells measuring about ^yVir incn (0*01 mm.) in length or breadth.       It
has been suggested      to me that the cause may be found in the endo
thelium on     the  anterior  surface of the lens, the cells of which are
polyhedral and flattened, and about 0-02 mm. in diameter.             Their
dimensions appear to be too large, but perhaps the agreement is as
close as could be expected.
    I do not know of any structure sufficiently coarse-grained to account
for the images of which twenty-five or thereabouts occur in a row.
The mesh of a network which would explain these should be about
T-5 inch (0-2 mm.) in length, and nothing of the kind                    is,
                                                                believe, to  I
be found in the eye.     Probably, however, the effect       composite, or
                                                                    is   a
rather    differential one, like that of the two pieces of gauze used in

       (1) The object of this paper is to investigate the types of wave motion
    in the neighbourhood of a theoretical Hertzian oscillator. By a theo
    retical Hertzian oscillator the writers understand a Maxwellian " double
           "
    point of initial maximum moment ± EZ. But as the actual oscillator
    has been shewn by Bjerknes and others to give a damped wave train, we
    take the maximum moment to run down with the time, and to oscillate
    between the limits ± EZe_?i '. This gives a wave train corresponding
    to that observed by Bjerknes and represented at a given distance by
                                     Ce-^i' sin (p2l + y).
    The investigation for a " double point " with a steady wave train was
    originally made by Hertz himself, and has found its way into most of
    the current text-books of electro-magnetism.        The theory thus given,
    is insufficient for two reasons, both of which were recognised by Hertz
    himself, namely, because       the actual oscillator has sensible extension,
                                     (i)
    and (ii) the wave train     gives forth
                                it             not steady.

       The present paper only attempts to remove the latter objection to
    Hertz's original theory like that theory
                                ;                     becomes less accurate as

    we approach nearer to an actual oscillator. Still the range within which
    the damping produces      very sensible divergence from Hertz's theory,
                                a
    seems sufficiently large to allow of experiment being made at                 a
    considerable distance from the oscillator; certainly the chief diver
    gences between the present and Hertz's original theory actually fall          in
    the portion of the field, wherein his chief interference experiments
    were made.       Besides therefore     the difficulties arising from the
    phenomena of "multiple resonance,"      seems necessary to measure

  (2) After the writers had investigated the general theory of a double
point with damped intensity, an attempt was made to replace the well-
known Hertzian diagrams of the field by a more complete series, repre
senting the field for seven complete oscillations, and showing how the
field  for some twelve metres round the oscillator chosen, gradually
falls to nearly ^ of its maximum initial strength. These diagrams are
entirely due to Miss Alice Lee, and involved a large expenditure of
labour and time, which would, perhaps, not have been justified were
any other graphic representation of a damped wave motion available.*
These diagrams were originally intended for kinematograph representa
tion, but that method of reproduction has not yet been found feasible.
   (3.) The writers next deal with the type of waves propagated, their
velocities and their phases.    The following general conclusions are
reached       :   —
     (i)     Three waves of electro-magnetic force may be considered as sent
out        from the oscillator, and not merely two as supposed by Hertz.
These are         —
                  :
     (a)     A wave
               of purely transverse electric force.
      (4)    A wave
               of electric force parallel to the axis, briefly termed the
wave of axial electric force.
     (c)wave of magnetic force.
            A
  The waves of axial electric and of magnetic force move outwards
with the same velocity, which    however,  is,
                                             function of the distance
                                                           a
from the centre            of the oscillator.    The intensity of both forces for
points on the same sphere varies as tho cosine of the latitude, the polar
axis being the axis of the oscillator.
   The wave of transverse electric force          propagated with the samo
                                                      is
velocity at  all  equal  distances  from   the  centre of the oscillator, but
this velocity differs from that of the two previous waves, the amplitude
ii  independent of the latitude, being constant over any sphere.          The
velocity after the wave has reached        certain distance from the double
                                                 a
point     always greater
             is              than  that of  the waves of magnetic and axial
electric force.         Its excess over the velocity of light tends to become
three           the excess of the velocity of the magnetic wave over tho
             times
velocity  of light both the excesses decreasing asymptotically.
                       ;
   (ii) The velocities of these waves undergo remarkable changes in
the neighbourhood of the oscillator, but these changes extend to dis
tances       which are greater      than   those within which     a   great proportion
of Hertz's interference experiments were made.
   (iii) The point of zero phase for both transverse and axial electric
waves does not coincide with the centre of the oscillator, so that these
waves appear to start from spheres of small but finite radius round
             must be remembered that a damped wave motion does not denote merely
  *     It                                                                           a
factor      e~Pj in the wave intensity, but factor e-PiQ-'fl, which sensibly alters the

the oscillator. A fourth wave dealt with by Hertz, namely, the wave
of magnetic induction, does not, as he supposes, start with zero phase
from the origin, but with a finite phase. The wave in the equatorial
plane, largely relied upon by Hertz for his interference experiments
" of the first kind," is a compound of the waves of transverse and axial
electric force, and has a much more complex series of velocity                  changes
than Hertz appears to have realised.
  (iv) The existence of the two electric force waves and the singular
points or surfaces for the wave motion in the neighbourhood of the
oscillator very possibly throw light on the difficulties which arise in
Hertz's experiments.    It would seem that such experiments should be
made at distances greater than 6 to 7 (A/2n-) from the centre of the
oscillator, or, roughly, about a wave-length from the oscillator. In
Hertz's case this amounts to about 10 metres— a distance at which
Hertz rather terminated than started his interference experiments. Only
at such a distance are the phase curves sensibly linear.
   The authors are not unaware of the physical difficulties of experi
ment at great distances, and wish, therefore, to emphasise again the
fact that they are dealing with a theoretical oscillator. It however, is,
this type for which Hertz himself endeavoured to provide       mathe        a
matical investigation, and       that investigation which, in
                                  it   is                                   the first
instance, they have attempted to expand and modify.

                                   (Abstract.)
   The existence     of a group of fossil plants, combining in their orga
nisation   certain characters of the Ferns and the Cycads, has been
recognised,   of late years, by several paleeobotanists, as, for example, by
the late    Professor W. C. Williamson, Count Solms-Laubach,               Mr.
Seward,    and the author.      The convenient name, Cycadofilices, has
recently been proposed by Professor Potonie" to designate the group in
question, which now includes several, somewhat heterogeneous, genera,
among which Lyginodendron, Heterangium, and Medullosa may be men
tioned.
   Several species of the genus Medullosa (founded          in 1832 by Cotta)
have already been described, from the Permian               and   Upper Coal-
measures of the Continent.        They agree in the extraordinarily complex
structure of the stem, which, as shown by Zeiller and Solms-Laubach,
resembles in the ground plan of its organisation,           that of a highly
differentiated Fern, of the usual polystelic type, but with the addition
of a zone of secondary wood and bast, sometimes reaching an immense
thickness, developed around each stele. The mature stem thus acquired
a Cycad-like    character.    The structure, however, has been extremely
difficult to interpret owing to the comparative rarity and incomplete
character of the specimens hitherto known.
   No stem of a Medullosa has hitherto been recorded from this
country, though specimens of Myeloxylon, now known to have been
the petioles of Medullosa, are frequent in the calcareous nodules of the
Lower Coal-measures.
   The author has recently had the opportunity of investigating several
excellent specimens of a new species of Medullosa from the Ganister
Beds of    Lancashire.     These fossils are of special   interest on several
grounds ; they are considerably more ancient than any members of
the genus previously described, they are the first English specimens
recorded, they are preserved in a more complete and perfect form than

 250             Dr. D. H. Scott.       On the Structure and
 •any others at present known, and lastly, the greater simplicity of their
 structure causes the essential characters of the genus to stand out with
 greater clearness than in the more complex species.          The specimens
 were discovered by Mr. G. Wild and Mr. J. Lomax, in material from
 the Hough Hill Colliery, Stalybridge.           The sections have been cut,
 with the greatest skill and success, by Mr. Lomax, and are very
 numerous,   about   100   sections,  transverse   and  longitudinal, having
 been examined from one specimen alone.
    The principal specimens are four in number,        in addition to which
 other fragments have been included in the investigation. The species,
 which is very distinct from any form previously described, will be
 known as Medullosa anglica ; a diagnosis is given below.
    The most complete specimen of the stem has a mean diameter oi
 rather more than 7 cm., including the adherent leaf-bases. The
 others do not appear to have been very different in dimensions.
    The large leaf -bases, to judge from the most perfect specimens,
almost completely clothed the surface of the stem. They were de-
current, and confluent with the stem for a vertical distance of 13 cm.
or more, the diameter of the petiole, where it became free from the
stem, being about 3 or 4 cm.          The arrangement of the leaves was a
spiral one, and in the only case where the phyllotaxis could be deter
mined, the divergence proved to be 2/5.
    In two of the specimens the external characters of the fossil are
well shown.     The outer surface of the long leaf-bases is marked by
a conspicuous longitudinal striation, the ribs (which would not have
been so prominent during life) representing the fibrous strands of the
hypodermal tissue.      The habit of the stem, clothed with the long,
almost vertical, overlapping leaf-bases, may have been not unlike that
of some of the tree-ferns, such as Alsophila procera.
   The vascular system of the stem consists of three (or locally four)
steles, anastomosing and dividing at long intervals.       Each stele has an
elongated, somewhat irregular, sectional form, and is composed of a
central mass of primary wood, surrounded by a zone of secondary wood
and phloem.    The primary wood, which is very well preserved, is made
up of tracheides and conjunctive parenchyma, with the spiral elements
(protoxylem) scattered near its outer margin. The secondary wood
consists of radial series of tracheides and medullary rays ; the secondary
tracheides bear multiseriate bordered pits on their radial walls ; most
of the primary tracheides are pitted in the same way, but on all sides
alike. In the neighbourhood of the protoxylem-groups the tracheides
of the primary wood are spiral or scalariform.          The phloem is made
up of elongated elements, presumably the sieve-tubes, forming a net
work, the meshes of which are occupied by the phloem-rays.
   Each stele of Medullosa anglica shows the closest agreement in struc
ture with the single stele of a Hekrangium, so that the stem of this

  Medullosa     might well be concisely      described   as  a polystelic     Heler-
  angium.
     The course of the leaf-trace    bundles was followed very completely in
 consecutive series of transverse,       and in longitudinal, sections.         The
  leaf-traces   leave the steles precisely in the same manner as in Heter-
 anghm.        On becoming free the trace is a large concentric bundle,
 surrounded by its own zone of secondary wood and bast.                       As it
 passes     obliquely    upwards through the cortex, the trace loses its
  secondary tissues, and undergoes repeated division into a number of
  smaller bundles, each of which has collateral structure.       These collateral
 strands have in all respects the same arrangement          of their elements as
  the well known bundles of Myeloxylon.
     The base of the leaf received a large number of bundles, consisting
 of the    ultimate branches derived from the subdivision of several of the
 original leaf-traces.      This distribution of the bundles is peculiar and
  unlike that in any known plants of Cycadean affinities.
     In a few cases accessory vascular strands, of concentric structure,
 recalling the cortical bundles of a Cycas, were found to the outside of
  the normal stelar system.
     The stem formed a well marked zone of internal periderm.                In one
 specimen the whole of the outer cortex, with the leaf-bases,           had    been
 exfoliated, so that in this case the periderm formed the external surface.
     The leaf-bases and petioles present in all respects, as regards hypo-
 derma, vascular bundles, and gum-canals, the characters of the Myeloxy
 lon Landriotii of Renault, which was evidently not a species, but a type
 of   leaf-stalk common to various Medullosese.          The petioles branched
 repeatedly, the finest ramifications of the rachis having a diameter of
 about 1 mm. only, but retaining in essentials the " Myeloxylon
                                                                           "
                                                                              struc
 ture.     The leaf was thus a highly compound one; the structure of
 the    leaflets   associated  with the rachis agrees well with that of the
 AMhofteris leaflets, figured by M. Renault.
     The roots, never previously observed in any species of Medullosa,
 were of triarch structure, with abundant formation of secondary wood
and bast, and an early development of internal periderm, by which the
 primary cortex was thrown off.          Developmental stages show that the
 periderm originated in the pericycle.             The roots, which branched
freely, were borne on the stem in vertical series, between the bases of
the leaves.         They were attached to pedicels, through which the
vascular tissues of the roots were continuous with those of the stem.
The author is indebted to Mr. J. Butterworth and Mr. G. Wild, for
specimens which have thrown important light on the connection
between root and stem.
    The full paper concludes with a short historical resume, and a dis
cussion of affinities.

affinities    with Heterangivm, perhaps the most fern-like of the genera
grouped under Cycadofilices.           The new species is far simpler than any
Medullosa hitherto described, for the steles are not only few but are
uniform, showing no differentiation into a peripheral and a central
system.        The small central steles, called " Star-rings " in other Medul-
losese, are absent here.        In these and other points the species agrees
with the genus Colpoxylon of Brongniart, but as that genus is doubt
fully distinct and its leaves are not known, it is not proposed to unite
the English species with it.
     In the structure of the petiole and of the leaf generally, Medullosa
anglica is as highly organised as any of the Medulloseae, and agrees
closely with M. Leuckarli, the only other species in which the connec
tion between leaf and stem has been at all satisfactorily proved.
     In the structure of the petioles, and of the roots, in the secondary
tissues, and in the secretory canals, which occur throughout the plant.
 there are clear points of agreement with Cycads, though the primary
 structure of the stem was that of a Fern.             The affinities in the latter
 direction came out more clearly in Medullosa unglica than in any of the
 other species as at present known.
      The habit of the leaves, if as appears likely, they were of the Ah-
 flwpteris type, must have been fern-like, but that in itself, as the
 familiar example of Stangeria teaches, is as consistent with Cycadaceous
 as with Filicinean affinities.
      While Medullosa thus combines, in a striking manner, the characters
  of Ferns and Cycads, the author is not disposed to regard it as having
  lain very near the direct line of descent of the latter group.           It is more
 probable, as Count Solms-Laubach has suggested, that the Medullose*
  represent a divergent branch, which has left no descendants among
  existing vegetation.

                                           (Abstract.)
   1. The Lippmann-Helmholtz theory of the capillary electrometer
contains two assumptions.
   2. The first assumption   would apply to any electrolytic cell. A
                      is it,
deduction from     which would apply to any cell having large and            a                a
small electrode,   that the variation of the potential difference at the
capillary electrode of an electrometer              is   the same as that of the applied
electromotive       force.
   In order to trace the relation between surface tension and potential
difference on the view that this first assumption      correct,    neces
                                                                   is            it   is
sary to eliminate the possible effect of depolarisation upon the form of
the electro-capillary curve — i.e., the curve which shows the relation
between       the surface tension          and the applied     electromotive      force.     A
direct method of examining the depolarisation current   described and   is
applied. An estimate of the magnitude of the depolarisation effect                           is
given, and the circumstances under which the effect may become
appreciable     are discussed.
   3. The second assumption of the Lippmann-Helmholtz theory, that
the electro-capillary phenomena are controlled by a simple variation
of the electrostatic surface energy, leads to two conclusions, each of
which    beset with difficulties.
         is

254          On  the  Nature  of Electro-capillary  Phenomena.
   a.  The form of the electro-capillary curve is remarkably dependent
upon the nature and concentration of the electrolyte, and depolarisa-
tion is quite insufficient to account for the dependence.
   b. The conclusion    that the potential difference between the solution
and the capillary electrode is zero when the surface tension has its
maximum value, leads to the necessity for assuming large potential
differences between certain solutions.
   4.  The hypothesis that the potential difference between equally con
centrated solutions of potassium chloride and iodide is negligible
possesses a high degree of probability.     It has been shown by previous
observers that if this hypothesis be true the points of maximum surface
tension on the electro-capillary curves for the above solutions cannot
have the significance which Helmholtz's theory gives them.
   It is shown in the paper that the first hypothesis of the Lippmann-
Helmholtz theory is in striking accord with this hypothesis concerning
the potential difference between KC1 and KI when the very definite
"descending" branches of the electro-capillary curves are considered.
   5. If both the hypotheses just mentioned be true, we get the result
that the surface tension of mercury (for a certain range of potential
differences) in two solutions is the same for a given potential difference
between the mercury and the respective solutions, if the solutions are
equally concentrated and possess the same kation.
   6. An extension of this result shows that it is indifferent whether the
kation be K, Na, or H.
   7. The relation found for the KC1 and KI curves can be extended
to the other known cases in which the electrometer curves and liquid
potential difference calculations seem to be contradictory, in such a
way as to account for the apparent contradiction. Several of the cases
are examined.
   8. The results in 4, 5, and 6 would give a direct and accurate method
of finding the potential differences between equally concentrated solu
tions, and could be extended to the case of solutions of different con
centrations.
   9.  The probability that the electro-capillary curves are never com
pletely free from influences other than electrostatic is shown by an
examination of the relations between the curves for unequally concen
trated solutions of the same salt.
   10. In confirmation of results obtained by G. Meyer, in a slightly
different way, it is shown that if the potential difference between KC1
and KI is very small, the potential fall from a half normal solution of
KI to a dropping electrode of the Paschen type is about a quarter of a
volt greater than that from a half normal solution of KC1 to the same
electrode.
   In the same way the potential fall from       KI to mercury when the
surface tension is a maximum      is about a quarter of a volt greater than

                                         Introduction.
     When       I commenced my investigations into the functions of the large
intestine by means of experimenting with isolated loops, into which
milk was injected, and after some hours again collected, I found that
the analysis yielded most unsatisfactory results.                   In consequence, in
order to get over the difficulty, it seemed better to try the effect of the
removal of the large intestine on nutrition.                  I believed that by com
paring the analysis of the urine and faeces of dogs after removal of
the large intestine with that of normal dogs on precisely similar diet,
the effect of the absence of the large intestine would be sufficiently
clearly demonstrated, and by this means its functions would be better
understood.

25G     Prof. V. Harley.          Influence of Removal of Large Intestine                  and
   In the earlier method of experimenting with loops of                            the   large
intestine,   in some experiments the middle part of the large intestine
was isolated, forming a Vella's fistula.
    A given quantity       of food was passed into the fistula, and after some
hours   it was again collected for analysis.                By this means, however, I
found   it impossible     to    collect   the   entire    quantity put into the fistula
unless very large quantities of wash-water were used, which rendered
the analysis fallacious.           I do not therefore refer in this paper to the
results thus obtained, but at the same                 time wish to draw attention            to
the fact that in these dogs the Vella's fistula               was found in the intervals
between experiments to fill up with debris.                   For example, in        one   ease
the middle (17 cm.) of the large intestine was separated, the upper ana
lower ends being sewn to the abdominal wound ; the upper and lower
 part of the divided remnant of the intestine was connected together.
 The dog at first was fed on milk and gradually on a better diet, as,
indeed, all the animals about to be described were treated.                      The opera
tion was done in this case in March, 1894, and by May, after careful
 feeding, the dog had gained three pounds in weight, so that the
 absence    of the    large     intestine     had not      hindered    the    animal      from
 putting on flesh.
      The Composition      of   the Excretion    of  a  Loop of the Large Intestine.
    In May the material that had collected in the loop was                          analysed,

    The analyses above given correspond very closely to those which
 have been found to occur in loops of the small intestine.
    Hermann,* Ehrenthal.t Berenstein,£                      and Fr. Voit,§ in their
 examination       of isolated loops of the small intestine, showed that
 they   were apt     to fill up with contents, which, microscopically ani'
 chemically,   corresponded with the materials collected from the loop of
 large intestine in the above dog.

      Increasing     Quantities    of Fat in Diet     on Metabolism    in  Dogs.    257
      In Voit's analysis the contents          of the loop of the small intestine
  contained fat, nitrogen, and salts in a proportion very much correspond
 ing to that found in the above dog, and he, together with others, con
  siders this a normal excretion          from the small intestine which goes in
  great   part to form the faeces on a diet which is well absorbed.*                The
  above result obtained in the large intestine is of importance,                   as it
  shows that a similar excretion occurs in the large intestine, as that
  already known to occur in the case of the small intestine, and this
  observation will explain in all probability the results obtained as
  regards cholesterin when the large intestine was removed {vide
  page 287).
      With these preliminary remarks            we    can now    turn to consider the
  present research, and before         doing so, it is as well to describe       briefly
  the  operative procedure        which   was carried out.
                                    Operative Procedure.
      The dog, after being put tinder an anaesthetie, had its large intestine
  thoroughly washed out by means of an enema, and after abdominal
 section the bowel was divided just above the caecum, and also as low
 down and as near the anus as possible.                 The lower part of the small
 intestine was then stitched into the rectum, care being taken to pre-
    * v. Moraczewski lias since the
                                       writing of the present article published a paper
 on contents of occluded portions of the intestine.        His experiments are limited,
 however, to two dogs, in both of which cases after the loop had been isolated
 the animals were allowed to live for about a year, being well fed throughout.
     In the first dog the loop consisted of part of the ilium, csecum, and the com
 mencement      of the colon. The material collected at the end of a year from this
 loop   was coloured,  and the analysis was roughly as follows : —
                                                           Fat and
               Qt.        Solids.     Water.    Proteid. cholesterin.   Ash.
             grams.        p. c.       p. c.      p. 0.      p. c.      p. c.

    Jn  the second dog only part of the ascending colon was isolated, so that we should
here get the excretion from the large intestine, not contaminated by anything from
the small.      The contents in this case were colourless. Unfortunately the absolute
quantity    of analysis is not stated. However, he says it contained very little proteid
or fat, and no cholesterin or lecithin, but principally only sodium carbonate.
    From¦ these results Moraczewski concludes that the secretion, or rather, as I
should prefer, the excretion, from the different parts of the intestine differs, that
from the small intestine containing colouring matter, fat, and cholesterin, while
that from the large intestine is only sodium carbonate.
    My own onalysis of the contents of the large intestine, although naturally the
quantity of material used was not so great and the period of collection much
shorter, does not lead me to entirely agree with the above results.        The fat was
distinctly less than the quantity found in the small intestine of Moraczewski, but
both fat and nitrogen were undoubtedly present, and the ash was extremely small
(' Zeit. f. Physiol. Chem.,' 1898, vol. 25, p. 122).

  258    Prof. V. Harley. Influence of Removal of Large Intestine and
 serve a good blood supply, and as far as possible not to allow too
 much tension at the place of juncture, as otherwise the ligatures were
  apt to give way, and to be followed by a fatal peritonitis. The isolated
 portion   of the large intestine, together with the caecum, was in some
  cases merely closed at both ends so as to form a kind of Hermann's
 loop. It was found, however, that this was not satisfactory, for no
  amount of washing out the loop would remove all the bacteria therein
  contained, and the loop tended to fill with the normal excretion
  already described, and this, together with the bacteria present, led to
  rupture and fatal peritonitis. The loop was sometimes found to fill
  with a very watery fluid, so that in one case it was found distended
  with a dirty brown fluid even in spite of a slight rupture having
  already occurred.    It was therefore decided that it would be more
  satisfactory to entirely remove the isolated portion of the large
 intestine.
     Of the experiments about to be described in one case the large
 intestine was only partly removed — that is to say, slightly more than
 its middle third.      In the other two dogs the large intestine was
 entirely removed together with the caecum.
     The dogs after the operation were then put on milk diet and the
 quantity was gradually increased with the addition of beef-tea and
 meat, until ordinary diet was able to be given ; and the experiments
 on the metabolism were only carried out on dogs which had been on
 ordinary diet for some time, and had regained practically their normal
 weight.
                             The  Did Employed.
    As far  as the food used  during the experiments, it was found most
 convenient to sterilise weighed out portions of minced meat, each
 quantity being sufficient for the day, and to this was added the given
 quantity of biscuit and fat as required. In all cases each meat, biscuit,
 or fat had been previously analysed, three separate samples being em
 ployed for the purpose, and the average of the three analyses were
 taken in calculating the nitrogen and fat of the diet.
                          The Methods of Analysis.
    With regard to the method of analysis employed, and collection of
material for analysis, the urine was collected by means of a catheter ;
at the same time the animals were kept in a cage, in case by any acci
 dent they should pass water by day or night, that also would be
collected in the cage and added to that obtained by the catheter.      As
a matter of fact, dogs sufficiently often catheterised pass very little
into the cage direct. The faeces were collected into the cage itself.
    The nitrogen in the urine and faeces was in both cases analysed by

   Increasing Quantities of Fat in Diet on Metabolism in Dogs.                      259
 the method of Kjeldahl, and the sulphates after the method of
Baumann.
   As far as the faeces were concerned, in all cases they were examined
with the ordinary precautions necessary in metabolism experiments.
each   daily quantity being separately examined, and the periods sepa
rated by means of charcoal.             They were dried down over a water-
bath, after adding dilute sulphuric acid, so as to avoid any escape of
ammonia in the drying process. The drying was continued in a drying
cupboard until they became a constant weight, and from this the
quantity of water and solids was calculated.                    The dried residue was
analysed    for  nitrogen   and   fat  after    the   usual   methods.      Naturally in
those cases where the fats were separately analysed, the portion of
faeces taken for the analysis was not dried down with the sulphuric
acid, but, on the other hand, extracted with alcohol, the alcohol extract
being evaporated over a water-bath, and the total extracted with ether,
and the fats, cholesterin, &c., separated, as I have already described in
a former paper.*
     As regards the carbohydrates, it was originally intended to estimate
the quantity in all the experiments, but it was found in one normal
dog, and in one dog in which the large intestine had been entirely
removed, that of the carbohydrates given in a diet of biscuit and meat
there was neither loss in the faeces in the normal, nor in the case of the
complete absence of the large intestine; it was therefore considered
unnecessary     to repeat these experiments.
     In order to investigate         the effect of       the removal of       the large
intestine on the general metabolism, it was necessary to examine in
close detail the normal conditions of dogs fed on, roughly speaking,
the same diet.
  The Influence of Increasing Quantities of Fat in the Diet on the Metabolism
                                   of Normal      Dogs.
   For this purpose the quantity of proteid and carbohydrate through
out each research was kept constant, only the quantity of fat being
increased    during different periods, and the same experiments being
repeated     on  dogs with either the partial or complete removal of the
large intestine. In calculating the quantity of proteid or fat absorbed
from the alimentary canal, no allowance is made for the quantity of
nitrogen which is normally present in the faeces in a fasting animal.
   C. Voit and Fr. Mullert have shown that even during fasting there
is an elimination of faeces. For example, in a dog of 30 kilos. the
average was about 2 grams of dried faeces daily, containing no less
than 0-15 gram of nitrogen.

260      Prof. V. Hurley. Influence of Removal of large Intestine and
   Rieder* found that on feeding dogs with a nitrogen-free diet the
faeces   contained absolutely more nitrogen than during fasting, and
often than     that obtained on a pure meat diet.             A  dog on 500 grams of
starch-meal     gave 0-7 gram, with 700 grams                of  starch-meal it gave
0-8 gram of nitrogen in the faeces ; while with 1500 grams of meat the
faeces only contained 0-67 gram of nitrogen.
     J.  Tsuboit    has lately carried out the same researches with the
greater     accuracy of modern methods in Professor Voit's laboratory,
and his results show that the nitrogen of the faeces on an absolutely
nitrogen-free diet is greater than that during fasting, and the quantity
of nitrogen increases with the quantity of food.                 In fact, the quantity
of nitrogen in the faeces on a nitrogen-free diet may be as much as
that found on the diet of meat rich in nitrogen.
   It  is thus seen that on such a diet the greater quantity of the nitro
gen    of the faeces must be regarded not as a nitrogen residue, but as
the product of metabolism.
   It has already been stated that the contents of the Hermann's loop
are probably to be regarded as consisting of such metabolic products ;
and, as    I have already shown in this paper, the large intestine behaves
in exactly similar manner.            Although by calculations on animals and
man, one has a rough idea of the daily quantity of nitrogen and fat
that ought to be eliminated during fasting, and although one can
subtract that amount from the quantity found in the faeces, in the case
where the large intestine was removed this could not be done, as we
have no data showing the daily quantity of nitrogen or fat that is
eliminated by the large intestine.             It was therefore considered better
in calculating absorption of proteids and fat, to neglect from the esti
mation the quantities probably excreted in fasting.
   We will now consider the experimental details, and in the first
instance I will refer to two normal dogs, which are taken for the pur
pose of comparison with those in which the large intestine was removed,
and in which the quantity of fat ingested during various periods was
steadily increased.        These details are given in the following table
(p. 261).
   Dog 1. — In the preceding Table           I  we see the influence of the addi
tion of fat to the diet on the absorption and metabolism in a normal
 dog.
   In this table the sterilised meat was commenced eight days previous
to the first analysis, the animal being on nitrogen equilibrium.                  The
diet consisted of sterilised beef, biscuit, and small quantities of fat ;
water was given twice a day, and the dog was allowed to drink as
much as she pleased each time.

262         Prof. V. Harley.   Influence   of Removal of Large Intestine and
the urine remained       almost constant ;   it rose somewhat on the ninth
day, when a little more urine than usual was passed of a higher specific
gravity. The average quantities are better discussed later on.
   The faeces for the first two days contained rather less nitrogen than
the next two, so that the percentage absorbed during the different
days varied from 89-75 per cent. to 9431 per cent, of the total nitrogen,
as estimated by subtracting the quantity of nitrogen left in the faeces
from the quantity known to be given in the diet. The fat in the
diet was in this case 12 -04 grams, and the faeces contained during three
days from 0-710 to 0-773 gram, one day being unfortunately lost, so
that the percentage absorption of fat fluctuated from 94-54 to 94-10.
   (b) The diet on the twelfth day increased, so that the dog received
32-04 grams of fat, and charcoal was given on the fifteenth, and another
period of four days analysed.         During the four days the urine
remained pretty well constant, being from 95 to 80 c.c.      The nitrogen
on the fifteenth, sixteenth,and eighteenth days was almost the same,
3*754 grams, but the seventeenth day it fell somewhat to 3-164 grams.
   The quantity of faeces varied from 17-52 to 24-56 grams, and the
nitrogen also varied, the daily quantity fluctuating between 0-351 and
0*497 gram, the fat showing again a greater fluctuation from 067 3 to
1-330 grams.
   Thus the percentage absorption of proteids varied between a range
of 89-68 and 92-71 per cent., while the fat varied between 95-85 and
97-90 per cent.
   On the 19th another 30 grams of fat was added to the diet, so that
the dog now received no less than 62-04 grams of fat per diem, as
well as the original quantity of proteids and carbohydrates.
      On the 22nd the analyses were again begun, and carried on for
      (c)
fqur days. The quantity of urine varies from 60 to 85 c.c. the specific
                                                               ;
gravity shows the same fluctuation.
  The nitrogen in the urine had its lowest limit at 3-085 grams       its ;
highest at 3-789 grams.    The quantity of faeces varied from day to day
between 17-52 and 28-26 grams, and there was        very marked differ
                                                       a
ence in the quantity of nitrogen eliminated in the faeces during the
eight days, being on one day as low as 0-364, while another day               it
reached as high as 0-620 gram.
   The fat in the faeces varied from 0-876 to T644 grams per diem.
This different quantity of nitrogen and fat on the different days caused
the percentage of the nitrogen absorbed to vary from 87-13 to 92-44
per cent., while the percentage of fats varied from 97-35 to 98-59
per cent.

were two separate periods in which the quantity of fat given remained

264         Prof. V. Harley.   Influence of Removal of Large Intestine     and
   (a) During the first four days the quantity of urine was rather
high, from 100 to 130 c.c. ; the nitrogen varied from 5460 to 6950
grams.
     The       varied in the different days from 22-70 to 50-59 grams.
            faeces
It   was indeed   in consequence of a great increase of faeces on the
twelfth day that it was thought advisable to give the dog another
period of four days on the same diet.
   The nitrogen varied, as one would expect, with the quantity of
faeces, fluctuating from 0-414 to 1-223 grams, and the fat from 0458 to
1-353 grams.
   In this case the quantity of nitrogen, fat, and the daily quantity of
faeces were separately analysed, so that the great rise on the twelfth
day in both nitrogen and fat found eliminated in the faeces, was not
due   to an error of drying, but to the quantity absolutely found by
analysis on that day.
   (b) During the next period of four days, for some unexplained
reason, the quantity of urine passed during the fourteenth and fifteenth
days was markedly diminished, being only 90 and 85 c.c., while on the
sixteenth and seventeenth it rose to 115 and 143 c.c. In spite of this
variance in quantity the averages of the two periods, as will be later
seen, are well within reasonable limits.
     The nitrogen in the urine was,   as one expected, increased during the
sixteenth                   days, being no less than 6-314 and 6-258
                and seventeenth
gram, as against 5-159 and 5-530 grams on the fourteenth and fifteenth
days, when the quantity of urine was low.
   As far as the quantity of faeces was concerned, on the fourteenth
day 33-30 grams were passed, while on the fifteenth day        it   dropped to
only 17-53 grams; on the next days 40-45 to 43-10               grams     were
passed.
   The quantity of nitrogen in the faeces         varied from 0-504 to 0-999
gram, and the fat from 0-539 to 1-139,            so that the absorption of
nitrogen varied from 87-50 to 93-70 per          cent., while the absorption
of fat varied from 92-51 to 94-53 per cent.
   On the eighteenth day the fat in the          diet was increased   to 65-19
grams, and the analysis commenced on the twenty-first day.
      During the three days on which
     ((-)                                  was analysed the quantity
                                            it
varied between 50 and 93 c.c., and the quantity of nitrogen from 3-115
to 4-270 grams.
   In this stage of the experiment the quantity of faces varied from
29-36 to 42-09 grams on the last day, and the nitrogen in the feces
being for the first day only 0-717, while on the twenty-third davit
reached no less than 1-067  grams.
   The fat was naturally very much increased by this large increase in
the diet, being 1-792 grams on the twenty-first day, and on the twenty-
third day 2-666 grams.     The percentage of proteids, as indicated in

         Increasing Quantities of Fat in Diet on Metabolism            in   Dogs.   26&
the faeces, varies on different           days from 86-65 to 91 '03, while the fat
varies from 95-91 to 9725.
        It will
         be well to now compare the averages of the two preceding
normal dogs before we discuss what occurs after the removal of the
large intestine.
   The normal averages are given in Table III.
   Dog 1. — Table          III
                       during the three periods of the experiment (a), (b),
  (<•)
    received the same quantity of nitrogen, 4-82 grams.            During the
period (a), 12-04 grams of fat were given      during period (b), 32-04 gram?,
                                                   ;
and during period (c), 62-04 grams. As far as the weight was concerned,
the increase of fat from 32 grams caused no real increase in the average
weight.     The further increase to 62 grams of fat caused- an increase of
weight   from  4-59 to 4'63 kilos.
  So far as the quantity of urine        concerned, the interesting fact
                                              is                                      is
brought    out that  the  increase of  fat  in the diet caused     progressive
                                                                        a
decrease in the quantity of urine from 118 to 89 c.c, and 70 c.c.
respectively, and this corresponds with an increase of specific gravity
   the different periods.     The fat also caused decrease of the quantity
of in
                                                          a
    nitrogen eliminated in the urine, the quantity falling from 4-457
to 3-575 grams, on increasing the fat from 12 to 32 grams, and still
further to 3-362 grams, by increasing the fat ingested to 62 grams.
The marked difference in the fall of nitrogen excreted during (a) and («),
when the fat was increased 20 grams,          clue to the animal having been
                                                   is
on rather      small quantity of nitrogen, although on nitrogen equili
                   a
brium.     On the other hand, when later on the fat ingested was in
creased to 62 grams, there was but        small decrease in the elimination
                                               a
of nitrogen, because the animal was, comparatively speaking, fat. The
quantity of faeces steadily increased as the fat was increased in the
diet, rising from 18-61 to 20-42 and 22-70 grams during the periods
to. (i),       («)•
          nitrogen in the fceces also steadily increased with the increase
        The
    fat in the diet.   Thus, on the relatively poor fat diet, 0-351 gram
of of
    nitrogen was eliminated     but, on increasing the fat in the diet in
                                      ;
spite  of  the fat containing no nitrogen, there was an increase in the
quantity of nitrogen in the freces to 0'412 gram, which still further
increased to 0-469 gram when the fat in the diet was increased to
62-04 grams.
         The fat in the fasces also increased from 0-733 to 0-971 gram, and
to 1-264       grams as the fat was increased in the diet.
  That the increase of fat in the diet should cause          decrease of
                                                                       a
nitrogen in the urine       what one naturally expects,* but that the
                                 is
increase in the fat ingested should cause an increase of nitrogen in the
feces     not what might have been priori expected to occur. That

    Increasing Quantities of Fat in Diet on Metabolism in Dogs.        267
this is due to an increased excretion or secretion from the intestines
seems unquestionable, as already suggested by Voit, Midler, &c.
    When we turn to the question of absorption, we find that so far as
the nitrogen is concerned an increase of fat causes a decrease in the
percentage of absorption, while, as in period (a), with 12-04 grams of
fat, 92*71 per cent. of the nitrogen was absorbed; on increasing the
fat to 32-04 grams, 91*45 per cent. was absorbed ; and on still further
increasing it to 62-04 grams, 90-26 per cent. was absorbed.
    The fat absorption, on the other hand, instead of decreasing with
the increase of fat in the faeces, really increased, so that it would
appear as if there was a greater absorption of fat on a diet rich in fat
than on one poor in fat.
    In period (a) only 93*91 per cent. of the total fat given was ab
sorbed, as compared with 96-97 in (b) and 97-96 per cent. in (c). This
apparent increased percentage of absorption of fat must be attributed
to the quantity of fatty matter excreted normally from the intestine.
so that when the fat in the diet is small this quantity alone is sufficient
to alter the apparent percentage very markedly. On the other hand,
when the quantity of fat in the diet is large the small quantity ex
creted by the intestines makes little difference in the quantity in the
faeces, so that the percentage absorbed appears to be higher than what
is really the case.
    Continuing the discussion of the normal averages, we now come to
dog 2 (vide Table III).
    In the first two periods (a) and (b) the diet was exactly the same, the
 reason being that the individual days fluctuated so much that it was
thought better to do two periods for a normal standard.
    It is seen the quantity of urine was 119 and 108 c.c. per diem
during the two periods (a) and (b). The same may be said of the
nitrogen in the urine, which was 6-127 and 5-815 grams ; the parallelism
 of the two periods is therefore close.
    The faeces amounted to 31-67 and 33-62 grams, and the quantity
 of nitrogen in the faeces during these two periods was 0696 and
 0799 gram, while the fat was 0776 and 0-898 gram respectively.
     The percentage of absorption of the proteids was 91-29 and 90-01
 per cent., while the absorption of fat was 9468 and 94-09 per cent.
     On increasing the fat to 6519 grams the animal increased in weight.
 The quantity of urine fell to only 74 c.c., while the specific gravity
 rose to 1061.     The total quantity of nitrogen in the urine fell very
                             •
 markedly to 3-858 grams the quantity of faeces rose to 36-26 grams,
 and contained 0901 gram of nitrogen, so that the quantity of faeces
 and nitrogen had increased on increasing the fat in the diet in the
 same manner as in the case of the preceding dog.
     The fat in the faeces increased to no less than 2-249 grams. In this
  case 88-73 per cent. of the nitrogen and 9655 per cent. of the fat was

   absorbed.      Thus in this dog we have exactly the        same results as     in the
   preceding dog, and therefore we can take these two normal dogs as a
  standard for comparison with the results obtained after the removal of
   the large intestine.*
       The Influence of Partial liemoml of     the Large Intestine   on  Metabolism.
       We now come to consider the effect of removal of the large intes
  tine on general metabolism under similar circumstances to what we
  have found in normal dogs on increasing the amount of fat contained
  in their diet.       Before doing so, however, we will consider by way of
  preface   a  case of  partial removal of the large intestine.
       In this experiment the middle third of the large intestine was
  converted into a Vella's fistula, the caecum being attached to the
  rectum, on March 20, 1894, at which time the dog (a female) weighed
  12 lbs.     In December of that year her weight had risen up to 15 lbs.,
  and    the experiments      about    to be described were not       carried,  out   till
  November, 1895.
      During    a  part of the time, before the experiments were completed,
  the dog was fed up, and became so fat at one time as to be practically
  unable to walk down stairs.           It was from the results which were then
  obtained in this case of the partial removal of the large intestine that
  the present research was entered into, although the original experi
  ments had been intended to be an investigation into the absorption
 from the large intestine, using fistulse for that purpose.                  The post
 mortem examination showed the fistulous part of the large intestine,
 which was over 17 cm. long, to be very much narrower than normal,
 and to contain deoris, mostly impacted, in the region of the fistula.
 This was analysed as already stated.
      In this case, from the ileo-caecal valve to the sutured junction, the
     * Wicke and Weiske, in some experiments on the influence of the addition of
 fats and starch to the diet on metabolism, experimented with sheep.         These two
observers found that increasing the quantity of fat in the diet caused an increasing
 quantity of faeces to be eliminated.    At the same time, less nitrogen was excreted
in the urine, so that the fat acted as a nitrogen sparer to the organism.
    It is thus seen that these experiments, in which fat was added to the diet of
herbivora, yielded the same results as are found in the above tables in the case of
the carnivora, except in one small detail.
    Wicke and Weiske did not find, according to their table, any marked decrease in
the quantity of urine by increasing the quantity of fat in the diet, although their
tables tend to show a decrease, while in the case of the carnivora we have got a
very marked decrease.
    We, therefore, can conclude that the normal dogs here shown are well capable
of acting as standards of comparison to the results obtained after the removal of the
large intestine, since the results compare very favourably with those found in the
case of the herbivora (' Zeit. f. Physiol. Chem.,' 1895, vol. 21, p. 42 ; 1896, vol. 22,
pp. 137 and 265).

distance     was 5-5 em., and from the junction to the outside of the anas
was 10 cm. when stretched.              The transverse measurement of the csecal
end of the     large   intestine   was    5 cm., while the rectal end had dilated
to no less than    10 cm.       Thus    a pouch had been formed above the anus
which accounted        for the changes in the            which took place during
                                                    faeces
the     time of observation.       For when      the animal first was put on solid
diet, some     three   weeks    after    the   operation,    the faeces passed   were
always fluid, while, later on, they were more or less formed, and, as
will be seen presently, became really of almost a normal consistence.

varied from 210 to 135 c.c, while the specific gravity was between
1025 and 1044.       The quantity of nitrogen excreted in the urine rose
and fell between 5-244 and 5-390 grams ; so that throughout these five
days the nitrogen equilibrium was well kept up.        The quantity of
fasces daily eliminated was very irregular.   The first day no less than
70-76 grams of fasces were passed, that is to say within twenty-four
hours of the diet.    Next day only 7-50 grams, and on the third day
none at all were passed ; on the other two days during which faeces
were passed the amount was 65-77 and 57-72 grams.        In consequence
of this great difference in the quantity of faeces daily passed,      the
nitrogen contained in them was also variable, varying from no less
than 0-176 to 1-488 grams.
  As far      as thefat analysis is concerned the average was obtained
from the figures  for only three days. At the same time as the average
thus obtained    came out roughly what one would expect, it would
appear  the  dog in every way behaved as a normal dog.       Naturally,
owing to the absence of feces on one day (the third), the percentage
of absorption during the various days varied notably,, both in the case
of nitrogen    and fat.
      The dog was now put on the same nitrogenous and carbohydrate
      (b)
diet, but the fat increased to 36-73 grams.    The quantity of urine
passed varied from 150 to 216 c.c, while the specific gravity fluctuated
from 1028      to 1038, the nitrogen in the urine varying from 4-188 to
5-491 grams.
  As far     as the faeces were concerned during these four days, one day
no faeces    were passed    on the other days the quantity varied from
                            ;
43-78 to 51-97 grams, the quantity of nitrogen, however, varying very
little, viz., from 0-753 to 0-918 gram.   The fat on the first day was very
high, being 2-219 grams, while the lowest limit was 1-543 grams.    In
this stage also the absorption varied on the various days from 85 to
88 per cent, of the total nitrogen, and from 94 to 96 per cent, of the
total fat.     During this period the dog steadily increased in weight.

  Increasing Quantities       of Fat in Diet     on Metabolism   in   Bogs.          271
      Another period of five days was next investigated, when the diet
     (f)
was increased still more to 51-73 grams of fat.   The quantity of urine
now passed varied from 96 to 130 c.c., with a specific gravity of 1040
to 1052.    The nitrogen was only analysed in the urine during three
days  out  of the five in consequence of an unfortunate accident.     It
varied from 4-307 to 4-971 grams, and remained pretty constant during
this period.   The dog daily passed his faeces, and the quantity in con
sequence appears smaller than in the preceding cases, varying from
1969 to 54-38 grams; at the same time the quantity of nitrogen con
tained in the faeces varied from 0-322 to 0-918 gram. On the third
day    this period the fat in the faeces was lost; on the other days the
       of
quantity varied from 3-050 to 1-602 grams.
   With this we get     varied absorption of proteids, the quantity vary
                          a
ing from  84-83  to 94-68, while as far as the fat     concerned
                                                          is       varied  it
from 94- 10 to 98-93 per cent.
     Having considered       this table in detail, we can now consider the
average      of the three periods (a), (b), in this case, where partial removal
                                          (c)
of the large intestine had been carried out.
 It   was found in this partial removal, even after shrinkage of the part
isolated, that over    half of the total length of the large intestine had
                         a
been removed.      The dilatation of the rectum accounts for the retention
of faeces on some days so as to cause constipation.
   From Table       the average of the three periods, the addition of an
                     V
increasing quantity of fat being added to a fixed nitrogen diet,        seen    is
to cause a decrease in the quantity of urine, the amount falling from
 172 to 169 c.c., and then to 112 c.c.        The specific gravity did not
quite coincide, as     did not rise steadily in the three periods.
                         it
   As far as the nitrogen in the urine       concerned, we see also that as
                                                is
the fat was increased, so the quantity of nitrogen in the urine fell
from 5-596 to 4-991 grams and 4-680 grams.         So that as in the normal
dog the nitrogen sparing properties of the fat are well brought out.
   The quantity of the faeces for all practical purposes           not much
                                                                      is
influenced by increasing the quantity of fat, and certainly not in the
degree which would seem to occur in the two normal dogs, in both of
which, on the fat being increased in the diet, the quantity of faeces
were augmented.       The variation may be in part explained by the con
stipation which occurred in periods (a) and (b).
    The nitrogen of the faeces in this dog,     anything, was decreased in
                                                     if
 quantity by increasing the fat, for whereas during the first five day?,
period (a), 0-792 gram of nitrogen was daily eliminated in the faeces,
 on the diet being increased to 36-73 grams of fat during the four days
 of period (li), the nitrogen was increased to 0-614 gram, and during
 period (c), when no less than 5173 grams of fat were being taken, the
 nitrogen amounted to 0-624 gram.
    With regard to the fat in the faeces, the table shows that the quan-

     Increasing Quantities of Fat        in Diet   on Metabolism             in Bogs.   273
tity, 1-217 grams, in the first period was increased to 1-437 grams,
when the diet contained 36-73 grams of fat, and on increasing the diet
to 51-73 grams of fat, it rose to 1-492 grams.
   When we compare this to what we find in normal dogs, we see the
total quantity of fat daily eliminated was really higher than what
occurred  in the normal dogs, for in dog           1,   on practically the same diet,
the   quantity of the three periods (a), (b),       (c)  was 0-733, 0-971, and 0-264
gram.
  We now turn to the table of absorption.   On the diet containing
11-73 grams of fat, the nitrogen absorption was 86-91 per cent. as
against    in the normal          per cent.
                                 dog 92-71    On increasing the fat to
36-73 grams the nitrogen absorption rose to 89-85 per cent.          On
increasing the amount of fat in the diet to 51-73 grams    fell slightly     it
to 89-69 per cent., while the corresponding absorption in the normal
dog was 91-25 and 90-26 per cent.     From this we see that on com
paring the  two animals  together, we  have   slight decrease in the
                                                          a
percentage   of absorption of proteids from the alimentary tract caused
by  partial removal   of the large intestine.   It also follows that contrary
to what one finds in normal dogs, namely, that on increasing the fat in
the diet there    isan apparently decreased absorption, one finds in the
dog from which the larger part of the large gut has been removed, on
the other hand, an increased absorption of nitrogen.
   Turning now to the fat, the average for which the periods (a) and                      (r)
is not complete, for the whole period analysed           appears that 86* per

•cent. of the fat   absorbed
                   is           as against   93 per cent. in the normal dog,
while when the fat         increased 96-09 per cent.
                            is                              absorbed in period

(b) and 97 per cent. in period (c).        So that while          seen that on
                                                                        it   is

normal dog, at the same time           must be noted that with
                                         it                           small fat   a
diet the absorption appears to have been less than normal, although
this may not be quite correct, since the average, as already stated,                      is
not for the total period.

tion of fat practically corresponds to what one finds in the normal dog,
in this case being 96-09 per cent. and again when the fat was in
                                              ;
creased to     5T73 grams, the absorption rose to                 97 per cent., the corre
sponding figure in the normal dog with 62-04 grams of fat being 97-96
per cent.
     Itmay therefore be considered that after partial removal of the
large intestine the influence on general metabolism, as indicated by the
urine,    very little that increasing the fat in the diet causes, as in the
          is            ;
normal dog, a steady decrease in the quantity of urine, and also causes
a sparing of nitrogen to the body, and therefore decrease of nitrogen
in the urine.
                  This figure probably too low. See Table V.

 274     Prof. V. Harley. Influence of Removal of Large Intestine and
    Increasing the fat in the diet of this dog did not increase the quan
 tity of faeces excreted, and still further did not increase the quantity of
 nitrogen contained in the faeces as occurred in the normal dogs. At
 the same time it increased the quantity of fat found in the faeces.
     The percentage of nitrogen absorbed under the same circumstances
 was decreased, but instead of decreasing with the increase of fat as in
 normal dogs, it practically remains the same, or if anything increases.
 In fact, the percentage absorption of fat would appear to be exactly
 the same as in the normal dogs.
   The Influence of Complete Removal of the Large Intestine on Metabolism.
    Having now finished the consideration of the dog in which the large
 intestine was partially removed, we will next examine the cases of the
two dogs in which the whole of the large intestine was entirely
removed together with the caecum.            In these instances the small
intestine, just above its junction with the caecum, was sewn into the
rectum as close to the anus as possible ; in fact, this was in even-
experiment found by post mortem to be under 6 cm.
    The difficulty in the after-treatment consists in the straining move
ments of the anus being apt to tear the sutures.
    During the first few days after the operation the animal was fed on
milk and beef-tea    ; later on, the diet was slowly increased, and finally
the animal     was able to take the normal diet.        For some reason or
other they were unable to take such large quantities of fat as normal
dogs, for when the fat was increased to a certain amount, they either
had a severe diarrhcea or refused their food altogether, so that it was not
possible to obtain the effect of the marked increase of fat on the com
position of the faeces so clearly as in the normal dogs.
    Dog 4. — In dog 4 the large intestine was entirely removed one
month previous to the beginning of the metabolism observations,
during which time the diet had been steadily increased as already
described, and the animal had begun to feed well on its mixed diet.
When its body weight had reached 4 kilos. the dog was then placed on
the meat and biscuit diet, and the employment of sterilised meat was
begun eight days before the commencement of the analysis.
    The general results are included in Table VI.
    In this case (dog 4)   four periods were investigated, two periods in
which the amount of fat given was 9-71 grams, the nitrogen in the
proteid amounting to 6-80 grams ; in the next two periods the fat was
increased to 29-71 grams, while the meat and biscuit diet remained the
same.     In this case it was found impossible to increase the fat still
more, as the dog then always refused his food.
   (a) During the first period the weight remained constant,         and the-
quantity of water passed fluctuated from 110 to 275      c.c., with a specific

t3 97-82 grams, and the nitrogen contained in the faeces fluctuated from
0-907 to 1-383 grams.         The fat in the faeces during the eighth, ninth.
and tenth days varied from 0-548 to 0*777 gram, while on the eleventh
day, from some unknown reason, in spite of the faeces not having
increased markedly in quantity, the quantity of fat contained therein
was T041 grams.          The absorption of nitrogen, in consequence of the
varied     quantities   passed on the different days, fluctuated somewhat
considerably,      consequently another period of analysis was done on
exactly the same diet for another period of four days, the diet in the
interval having been kept the same.
    (&) In this second stage of
                                    the experiment a part of the urine was
unfortunately lost on the eighteenth day. The daily quantity varied
from 309 to 395 c.c., with a specific gravity of 1012 to 1018. That is
to say, the quantity was very much increased above that found during
the previous four days, and the specific gravity very much lower.          The
 quantity of nitrogen in the urine during these three days varied from
 4-290 to 4-427 grams, so that that factor tallied very much with that
found on the previous day.
    The daily quantities of faeces were also more equal than on the
previous four days, as they varied from 68-67 to 81-12 grams, the
 nitrogen varying from 1-258 to 0-987 gram; the daily fat in this ease
 being fairly equal, and showing no marked rise as in the preceding
 period, varying from 0-713 to 0-513 gram.
    (c) During the next (the third) period the quantity of fat was in
 creased to 29-71 grams on the nineteenth day; and the analysis began
 on the twenty-second.        The weight went up from 4-11 to 4-17 kilos.
 The quantity of urine passed fluctuated from 121 to 265 c.c., with a
 specific gravity varying from 1014 to 1029.         The nitrogen in the urine
 decreased in amount, fluctuating         from  3-010 to 3-344 grams.      The
 quantities     of faeces observed daily were very nearly equal, varying
 from 82-56 to 84-82 grams, the nitrogen in the faeces remaining very
 constant, the fluctuations being only between TOOo and 1-162 grams.
 and the fat also remained very constant,        varying from 0-699 to   0-850-
 gram.
     ((/) In the final period (the fourth), the food being in the interval
 kept exactly the same, the animal went up somewhat in weight, rising
 to 4-31 kilos. The quantity of urine passed varied from 52 to 240i
 c.c. ; but the small quantity of urine passed on the twenty-ninth day
 is in all probability an error, as the specific gravity on that occasion
 was practically the same as on other days.         Leaving this day's amount

    Increasing Quantities of Fat in Diet on Metabolism in Dogs.          277
out of account, the quantity of urine collected on the other three days
was 310, 190, and 240 c.c. respectively, with a specific gravity varying
from 1018 to 1023.        The nitrogen observed remained throughout the
period very constant, varying from 3-220 to 3-960 grams. The quantity
of faeces again here, as in the preceding period, was fairly equal in amount,
the quantity varying from 8T53 to 85*10 grams.               The quantity of
nitrogen     in the faeces during these    four  days  varied  from 0-918 to
1-214 grams; the smallest quantity was found on the day on which
the largest quantity of faeces was passed, that is to say, on the
thirty-first day. The fat was only analysed on three out of the four
days.
     Before discussing the average results of these four periods of analysis
it would be well to discuss the facts of the next experiment, in which
the large intestine was also entirely removed, so that the two averages
 may be compared together.
     In this dog only two periods were investigated, to try to fill up the
 gap in the observations just described, which were incomplete owing
 to the impossibility of increasing the fat in the dietary in sufficient
 degree.
     Dog 5. — The first diet was started ten days before the analysis was
 commenced.       During the first period of five days the animal received
 G-26 grams of nitrogen in his diet, and 11-55 grams of fat.              The
 quantity of urine during these five days varied from 75 to 120 c.c.,
 the specific gravity varying from 1028 to 1052, the nitrogen, however,
 remaining pretty constant throughout, only varying from 4-110 to
 4-508 grams.       The quantity of faeces steadily increased in amount
 during the five days, rising from 46-93 to 94-20 grams, the nitrogen
 thereof also rising as the faeces increased, although it rose still more on
 the fourteenth day, when the faeces were not quite so high as on the
 thirteenth; it varied from 1-194 to 0-796 gram.
     The quantity of fat was only analysed on four of these days, and
 varied from 0-380 to 0-618 gram.
     During the next period of four days the fat in the diet was increased
 to 41-55 grams; however, during the last two days (twenty -fifth and
  twenty-sixth) the animal lost his appetite, although from the fifteenth
  to the twenty-fifth he had steadily kept up his diet and gone up in
  weight, and even stopping the fat for an interval and trying to admin
  ister it again was unsuccessful.     Consequently, although the four days
  were analysed, only the first two days can be taken as an average on
  this diet.
      We see on looking at the table that the quantity of faeces daily
  passed varied very considerably, and therefore the results obtained
  during the four days cannot be considered definite, but I have included
   the facts as an addition to the preceding observations.
      On the increased fat diet it will be seen that the quantity of urine

     Increasing Quantities of Fat in Diet   on Metabolism,  in Dogs.     279
 during the first two days was  96 c.c. and 85 c.c., with a specific gravity
of 1026 and 1030. The quantity of nitrogen in the urine fell very
considerably to 2-422 and 2-408 grams, while the quantity of faeces
also was not very high, being 64-55 to 54-20 grams.        The nitrogen in
the faeces was lower than in the former period, being only 0-743 and
0-468 gram.      The quantity of fat found was somewhat greater, being
0-936 to 0-701 gram.
    We now come to consider Table VIII, in which are given the
averages of the results obtained from these last two dogs, in which
the large intestine had been entirely removed.
    In dog 4 the quantity of urine during the two periods in which
9-71 grams of fat were given varied very considerably, being 191 and
341 c.c. respectively; and the specific gravity also varied, being 1025
and 1014. At the same time the quantity of nitrogen in the urine
during these two periods remained pretty much the        same, being   4-445
and 4-374 grams.       The nitrogen in the faeces also remained constant,
being 1-064 and 1-081 grams, the fat being 0-777 and 0-605 gram.
    We see, comparing these with the normal dog on the same quantity
of fat, that the quantity of faeces is very much larger, in fact nearly
double the quantity found in the normal dog on practically the same
diet, and at the same time the nitrogen in the faeces is increased, being
more than double, or at any rate double the quantity in a normal dog,
whereas the fat in the faeces is practically the same as in a normal dog
on a diet containing this amount of fat.
   As far as the absorption of proteids is concerned it is 84-3G and
84-11 per cent., while in a normal dog we find that on this diet roughly
92-71 and 91-29 per cent. was absorbed, and in the dog in which the
large intestine was partially removed 86-91 and 89-85 per cent. was
absorbed.     We may, therefore, take it that this dog shows a still
greater decrease in the absorption of nitrogen than after the partial
removal of the large intestine, and that the absorption of nitrogen is
very much influenced by the absence of the large intestine.
   During the next two periods 29-71 grams of fat were taken, and the
animals increased in weight during these two periods, also the quantity
of urine varied very considerably, being 207 and 198 c.c., with a
specific  gravity of 1019 and 1023.
   The quantity of nitrogen excreted in these two periods was 3-243
and 2-965 grams, so that the increase of fat caused a decrease in the
quantity of nitrogen in the urine ; that is to say, a proteid sparing
influence, the same as in the normal dog.     As far as the urine is con
cerned, and comparing these two periods with the former two periods,
it would seem as if the quantity of water absorbed is decreased by the
increased quantity of fat.   At the same time this is not at all so well
brought out as in the case of the normal dogs, or even in the dog with
partial removal of the large intestine.

   Increasing   Quantities of Fat  in Did   on Metabolism   in  Dogs.  281
   The quantity of faeces during the two periods is 83*78 and 83-49
grams, so that the increase of fat has iindoubtedly caused in this dog
an increased quantity of faeces. The nitrogen during these two periods
was T098 and T088 grams, so that the increase in the quantity of
fat in the diet has caused a slight increase in the . quantity of nitrogen
in the faeces, the same as we find in the normal dogs. The quantity
of fat in the two periods was 0-769 and 0-873 gram, that is to say, a
slight tendency to an increase, through the increased quantity of fat in
the diet.
   We thus see that the dog after total removal of the large intestine
shows a marked increase in the quantity of nitrogen in the faeces ;
at the same time, in spite of this increase, it can be still more
increased by increasing the fat given in the diet.           As far as the
fat is concerned the quantity of fat in the normal dog's faeces, as com
pared with that after removal of the large intestine, is practically the
same.    It is thus well borne out that as far as the fats are concerned
they are well absorbed by the small intestine, the large intestine having
no influence whatever on their absorption.
   On the other hand, as far as the proteids are concerned, they are not
so well absorbed — at least 10 per cent. less — but there is an increase
in the quantity of proteid or nitrogen in the faeces of the dogs in which
the large intestine has been removed, and that this increase is slightly
augmented by increasing the quantity of the fat in the diet, as in
normal dogs; at the same time the decrease in absorption, as thus
indicated in normal dogs, is not so marked, if at all marked, after
removal of the large intestine.
   Having considered the general metabolism, and having        seen how the
quantity of faeces is increased in dogs in which the large intestine has
been removed, we now come to consider the faeces more carefully as
regards their general appearance and the quantity of water.
The Influence of Diet on the Daily Quantity and the Amount of Water in the
                 Faces when the Large Intestine is Removed.
   Immediately after the operation, the dogs for the first few days took
practically no food, and then were put on a milk diet, which conse
quently caused the light motions so typical of this diet. When the
diet was slowly converted into that of biscuit and meat, on which a
normal dog would be passing well-formed faeces, the dog continued
to pass a semi-fluid motion. In the case of the partial removal of the
large intestine this was well marked, so that the dog for the first few
 weeks suffered from more or less diarrhcea.        Before death, however,
 throughout   the  time  in which   metabolism    experiments were being
 done, the dog passed faeces almost of normal consistence, and, as is
 seen by the post mortem,      this is %o  be explained   by the sack-like
 enlargement of the rectum.

2i2       Prof. V. Harley.        Influence   of Removal of Large Intestine        and
   In normal dog        1, Table    IX, are placed together the analyses of the
faeces, as influenced      by   the  increase of fat in the diet.    The fat is seen
here to cause not only an increase in the quantity of faeces, but also an
increase in the total quantity of water excreted in the faeces.                 While
we saw that increasing the fat in the normal dog's diet caused a decrease
in the quantity of urine passed, we find here that it causes an increase
in the quantity of water eliminated by the faeces, being on the first diet
 12-79 grams, then 13'79 grams, and on the diet rich in fat no less than
 14-32 grams.        The percentage of water in the total faeces, however,
decreases with the increased quantity of fat, as it falls from an average
of 70-98 to 67-85 and 67-87 per cent. Thus the increased quantity of
-water eliminated by the faeces is due to the increased quantity of
faeces, and not to an increased percentage of water present.

fat remained constant.            As far as the quantity of faeces was concerned
we found during these two periods the quantity pretty nearly the

same,     at the  same   time the quantity of water differs       somewhat       con

     The percentage of water in this dog was less than the percentage on
 the corresponding diet in the first normal dog, being only 63-26 and
 64-60 per cent.        On increasing the fat in the diet, the quantity of
 faeces, as in the former normal dog, increased, and the total water
 eliminated also increased.          The percentage of water, however, de
 creased, so that though the increase of fat in the diet caused in this
 dog, as in the former, an increased elimination of water in the faeces,
 this was due to an increased quantity of froces passed, and not due to
 any increase of the fluid constituent thereof.
     We now come to the dog in which the large intestine was partially
 removed, Table XI, and in which, as we have already seen, there was
  a dilatation of the rectum.      In spite of this latter condition the absorp
  tion of this dog differed somewhat from the absorption of the normal
  dog.     In this dog, during the three periods analysed, the quantity of
  faeces   fluctuated on different days, and during the first two periods.

284      Prof. V. Harley. Influence of Removal of Large Intestine            and
there was occasionally      an interval of a day without any faeces being
passed.     In  consequence of this constipation one would expect the
percentage of water to be small ; it is seen that in this dog the per
centage of water during the first period was 50-96, and with a
slight increase of fat rose, instead of fell, to 54-59 ; still further rising
on the diet rich in fat to 72-46. The quantity of water also rose ; but
in this dog, by increase of fat in the diet, one got not only an increase
in the total quantity of water eliminated by the faeces but also an
increase in the percentage.

    We now come to the dogs in which the total removal of the large
intestine is carried out. We have in Table XII two groups of results,
which represent two periods during which the dog received 9-71 grams
of fat, and two periods in which 29-71 grams of fat were given. As in
the normal dogs, wo have here also an increase in the quantity of fa'ces,
produced by increasing the quantity of fat, and also an increase in the

   Increasing Quantities of Fat    in Diet on Metabolism in   Dogs.  285

<inantity of water daily eliminated.      At the same time there is an
increase in the percentage of water from 76-59 and 76-26 to 79-45 and
 79-13 percent.
   In dog   5, Table  XIII, in which the large intestine was removed, wc
also have an increase in the percentage of water by increasing the fat
'hiring the two days on which it was analysed ; at the same time the
total quantity of water, as well as the quantity of faeces, was not in
creased, but this may have been due in this case, as already explained,
to the fact that a perfect determination of the periods during which the
faeces were collected could not be obtained.
   When we compare the averages, Table XIV, of these various experi
ments, we find that whereas a normal dog excretes about 18 to 22
grams of faeces, containing from 13 to 14 c.c. of water per diem on the

 various amounts of fat diet, a dog, after the total removal of the large
 intestine, excretes no less than from 75 to 84 grams of faeces, containing
 from    57  to 67 c.c. of water ; and further, that whereas the percentage
 of water in the faeces in a normal dog varies roughly between 60 and
 70, in dogs without a large intestine it varies between 77 and 81 per
 cent.
    In the case of partial removal of the large intestine, during the time
 in which there was constipation and a day was consequently missed in
 the action of the bowels, the percentage of water fell to 50-96 ; but on
 the other     occasions, when       the bowels     were    acting regularly,    the per
 centage tended to be high, 72-46 ; in fact, comparing fairly with those
dogs in which the large intestine was removed.
    The interesting fact brought out by this experiment is that in the
normal dog the increase of fat, causing an increased quantity of faces,
is accompanied by an increased elimination of water, and at the same
time by a decrease in the percentage of water eliminated, and that this
relative decrease is due to an increase of solids in the faeces.
    Fr. Miiller* had already shown that increasing               the fat in the diet of
a dog     fed on meat caused a decrease in the percentage of water con
tained     in the faeces. Thus a dog on 1500 grams of meat, with 30
grams of fat, passed faeces containing 69-6 per cent. of water ; but on
increasing the fat of the diet to 60 grams it fell to 64-9 per cent., and
still further with 250 grams to only 53 0 per cent.

    Increasing Quantities of Fat    in Diet  on Metabolism   in Dogs.   289
    On this point, in normal dog No. 2, the analysis was carried out during
 two periods, as shown in Table XV. In the first period the dog re
 ceived 15-20 grams of fat daily, and         four days were separately
analysed;     while   during  the second period the dog received 65-l9
grams of fat, and three days were separately analysed.
    We see that the quantity of free fatty acids, as compared to neutral
fat, is somewhat    greater on the diet poor in fat, while on the diet rich
in fat   it is very markedly so, being no less than 0314 gram of neutral
fat   and   1-359 grams of free fatty acids.       The soap is also very
markedly increased, namely, from 0043 to 0-591 gram by increasing
the quantity in the fat diet ; the cholesterin,      however, remains the
same, being 0-066 and 0-061 gram.         The percentage, taking the total
ether extract as 100, on the diet poor in fat, is 40-13 per cent, of fat as
neutral fat, 44-89 per cent, as free fat acids, and 4-60 per cent, as fat
acids in form of soaps ; while, when the diet is rich in fat, and the
faeces, in spite of the increased absorption, contained more than double
the quantity of ether extract, these contained only 13*63 per cent, as
neutral fat, 59-45 per cent, as free fat acids, and 24-12 per cent, as
soaps.     The percentage of cholesterin naturally differs owing to the
increased quantity of total ether extract.
   Table XVI.      In dog 1, on a diet rich in fat, containing no less than
62 grams of fat, the total result is very much the same as that obtained
in the previous table, the percentage of fat acids being in excess of
neutral fat ; the cholesterin, however, in this case, was somewhat
higher than in the former dog.
   Table XVII. When the partial removal of the large intestine was
carried out during three days' analysis on a diet containing 51-73
grams of fat daily, the same holds good, the quantity of cholesterin,
however, corresponding with Table XVI being no less than 0-145 gram.
   Table XVIII. In the case of dog 4, in which the large intestine has
been entirely removed, on a diet comparatively poor in fat — 29-7 grams
—the quantity of free fatty acids is very much in excess of the
neutral fat, the soaps being also slightly in excess of the fat acids ;
the cholesterin,    on the other hand, is very markedly decreased, the
average being only 0-025 gram per diem.
   Table XIX. Again, in dog 5, on a diet containing 41 -6 grams of fat,
the animal had slight diarrhoea; throughout the three days experi
mented on the quantity of fat acids was again in excess of the neutral
fats,  and the fat acids as soaps were not increased.   The cholesterin, as
in the  former dog, was on the whole diminished, being only 0-069 gram.
   In Table XX the average results of the two normal dogs are compared
with that of partial and complete removal of the large intestine, and it is
seen that as far as the fat is concerned the composition of the ether
extract in the faeces remains practically the same, whether the large in
testine is present or absent, the fat acids being in both greatly in excess

   Increasing Quantities       of Fat in Diet     on Metabolism      in Dogs.     29.'i
of the neutral fat and the fat acids as soaps. In some the quantity of fat
acids combined as soaps is much greater than the neutral fat, and in
others they are very much alike ; but at any rate the large intestine
appears to have no influence whatever in altering the composition of
the fats in the faeces.         On the other hand there is a difference in the
quantity of cholesterin present.
    It is seen that in the second normal dog the quantity of cholesterin
differs considerably from that seen in the first, and that results seen in
the partial removal of the large intestine correspond with the normal
dogs.     On the other hand, in the two dogs in which the large intestine
was completely removed, the cholesterin found was small in quantity ;
and if the averages are taken it is seen that the removal of the large
intestine tends to cause a decrease in the quantity of cholesterin daily
eliminated in the faeces.
    It has already been shown by Jankau* that large quantities of
cholesterin given by the mouth are absorbed, and therefore it is not at
all surprising if the quantities of cholesterin which are daily elimi
nated in the bile, &c, are to a certain extent absorbed in the small
intestine, that the absence of the large intestine should have no effect
in increasing the quantity found in the fasces.            At the same time, the
fact that the actual quantity of cholesterin found in the faeces appears
to be smaller in dogs without a large intestine, would appear to be ex
plainable by the fact that the secretion of the large intestine itself
contains cholesterin.        Further, it is conceivable that it is not so readily
absorbed     by the large intestine, hence the quantity of cholesterin
 normally present is larger than that found when the large intestine is
absent.
    Before leaving the subject of the faeces, it is of interest to note their
alteration as regards colouring matter after the removal of the large
intestine.
 Hie Action,   of  the Removed   of the Large Intestine on the    Urobilin Formation
                                      in the Faxes.
    In a paper     already published I showedt how it seemed probable that
 the  presence of urobilin in the urine was due to the conversion of the
 bile pigments during their passage along the intestines.
    •Schmidt}:    showed that when a concentrated solution of perchloride
of mercury is applied to wet or dry faeces containing urobilin, in the
space of a few minutes a bright rose-red colour is developed.                     The
 rose-coloured      extract, when separated and examined with the spectro
 scope, shows the urobibn band between F and b.                   This test is all the

  294     Prof. V. Harley. Influence of Removal of Large Intestine and
  more valuable     since in the presence of bile it gives a bright green
  colour, in consequence of the conversion^of bilirubin into biliverdin by
  the perchloride of mercury.
     Since this method has been introduced         it has become possible to
  recognise very small quantities of urobilin in the faeces.
     Schmidt, examining by this method the different parts of the intes
  tine and intestinal walls, showed that the urobilin reaction yielded
  results proving that in different parts Of the intestine urobilin was
  present in varying degree, and also varied in different cases.           The-
  staining  of  the  intestinal walls by this method, he considered, indicated
  the parts of the intestine which took part in the absorption of urobilin.
  My own experiments on dogs and monkeys, in which the post mortem
  examination was made immediately after death, showed no such stain
  ing of the walls, and therefore I consider it was probably due to a post
  mortem diffusion.
     The test, however, is valuable for the determination of urobilin in
  the contents of the bowel, and this we will now consider.
     I noted in various animals that as a rule no trace of urobilin coulil
  be found in the contents of the intestine above the ileo-caecal valve.
  In some few dogs there was a trace of urobilin in the contents just
  above the caecum, but in the majority of normal dogs recognition o£
  this substance was only possible after the ileo-caecal valve was passed.
     Of the dogs in which the large intestine had been removed, dog 5
  was killed by chloroform and the contents examined.          In this dog the
  post mortem showed the small intestine to have been artificially joined
  to the rectum 6 cm. from the anus ; and 78 cm. from the anus the
  green colour was first noticed by the perchloride of mercury reaction,
  and then, 35 cm. from the anus, began to show the urobilin reaction.
  which extended as far as the anus.
     In dog    4  only   4 cm. of the  rectum was found remaining at tho
  post mortem, and this dog only showed a very faint urobilin reaction
  in the contents of this latter 4 cm.        That is to say, throughout the
  entire small intestine of this dog no reaction of urobilin could be
  obtained.
     These   post mortem results were borne out to a certain extent by
  observations during life.       It was found in most of the dogs, in which
  the large    intestine    had been removed,    that immediately after the
   operation the motions were bile-stained, and gave the green colour
  with perchloride of mercury, and, only very faintly or not at all, the
  pink urobilin reaction.       Later on the urobilin became increased, and
  the bilirubin apparently decreased.
     In dog 5, throughout the time metabolism experiments were carried
  on, there was always more marked urobilin than in other dogs observed
  after the removal of the large intestine.

The Influence of Diet on the Total Alkaline and Aromatic                   Sulphates in
   Normal Dogs and in those in which the Large Intestine has             been in part or
   completely   Removed.
   Having discussed the          faeces, we   now come to consider the sulphates
in the urine. As we all know, the sulphur taken in the diet is princi
pally excreted in the form of sulphates, either combined with alkalis
or with aromatic substances, although some 14 to 25 per cent. of the
total sulphur in the urine is excreted as neutral sulphides.*
   In  this paper the sulphides were not determined.                    The sulphates
contained in the urine are principally derived from the proteids in the
diet, as only very small quantities are taken in the form of salts, and.
in consequence, the ratio of sulphuric acid to nitrogen excreted in the
urine remains very parallel — 5 : 1. Hence it will be seen in the
following tables that the proteid-sparing action of the increase of fat
causes not only a decrease in the nitrogen in the urine in normal dogs
but also a decrease in the quantity of the sulphates. The sulphur of
the proteids in fact had been retained in the organism for building up
the proteid of the body itself, in the same way as the nitrogen had
been.
   The aromatic sulphates were also investigated after removal of the
large intestine in order to see if the intestinal putrefaction was in any
way influenced by the removal of the large intestine ; for the experi
ments of Salkowski,t Baumann, J &c., have shown that in all prob
ability the phenol, indol, &c., which, when absorbed into the blood, go
to form the aromatic sulphates, are only formed in the large intestine.
   Baumann and Ewald§ have described cases of intestinal fistula ;
during the time in which the faeces were excreted through the fistula
the quantity of aromatic sulphates was very much diminished in the
urine.
   Table XXI. In normal dogs the analyses of the sulphates were
carried out during three periods in which the dog received progres
sively an increase of fat in his diet.
   We have already seen that this increase of fat caused a decrease in
the quantity of urine and in the quantity of nitrogen daily eliminated.
Accompanying this, we find in the above table there is also a decrease
in the quantity of the alkaline sulphates progressively with the increase
of fat. .On the other hand, the aromatic sulphates are not influenced
by the increase of fat to 32*04 grams per diem ; but on increasing the
fat to 62 -04 grams there is an apparent decrease in the aromatic
sulphates.

     Increasing Quantities  of Fatin Diet   on Metabolism   in  Bogs.   297
     The decrease in the alkaline sulphates and no alteration in the
  quantity of aromatic sulphates during the second period causes the
 ratio A to B to fall from 9:1 to 8:1, that is to say, by discussing
 only these ratios, one would consider that the intestinal putrefaction
 had really been increased instead of decreased. However, on increasing
 the fat in period 3, the decrease in the aromatic sulphates was suffi
 cient to counteract the decrease in total sulphates, so that the ratio was
 85:1.
    On turning to Table XXII, normal dog 2, we see the increase of fat
 in the food causes, as in the preceding dog, a decrease in the quantity
of urine, and at the same time a decrease in the quantity of nitrogen
excreted ; there is also in this case a more marked decrease in the
quantity of alkaline sulphates, but this is due to the greater decrease
in the quantity of nitrogen.       The aromatic sulphates, however, are
slightly decreased, the normal ratios being 7:1, while the ratio on the
increased fat diet is 66 : 1.     We here have also, even in spite of a
decrease of aromatic sulphates produced by increasing the fat in the
diet (since the alkaline sulphates are more markedly decreased), a
smaller ratio, which would lead us to believe that intestinal putrefac
tion is increased.
    From these two dogs we see that the old idea that the ratio 8 or
10 : 1 should be considered as the normal ratio indicating intestinal
putrefaction must be corrected, and that in future it is not sufficient to
make out the ratio of the total day's urine, but it is essential to com
pare the quantities in a given space of time, for on a diet rich in fat
the ratio may be very much diminished, say to 6 : 1, in spite of the
aromatic sulphates being also diminished.
    It would further appear that in a normal dog fat added to the diet,
if anything, tends to decrease the amount of aromatic sulphates, so
that the increase of fat does not cause an increase of intestinal putre
faction.
   Table XXIII. We now come to discuss the dog in which the large
intestine was in part previously removed.       In this case we have the
same decrease in water and nitrogen in the urine by an increase in the
fat as in normal dogs, and also a decrease in the alkaline sulphates and
aromatic sulphates.    In fact, the results, as far as the sulphates are
concerned, obtained in this dog, correspond exactly with those found in
the two normal dogs, so that we can conclude the partial removal of
the large intestine has no effect on the sulphates.
   Table XXIV. In dog 4 the effect of the total removal of the large
intestine was investigated twice on two diets.        In the first the diet
contained 9*71 grams of fat, and in the second 2971 grams.
   We see in this dog that increasing the fat causes, as in the normal
dog, a decrease in water and nitrogen in the urine, and this is also
accompanied by a decrease in the alkaline sulphates, but no alteration

    Increasing Quantities of Fed in Diet on Metabolism in Bogs.              301
in the amount of aromatic sulphates.           The total quantity of aromatic
sulphates     in  this  dog  is very much  decreased, being only from 0-026 to
0-035 gram as against 0-064 to 0*082 gram in the normal dogs.                We
therefore see that the absence of the large intestine in this case caused
a very marked decrease in the amount of aromatic sulphates, and this
decrease in the amount of aromatic sulphates was, doubtless, due to
the decrease of intestinal putrefaction, and explains how it was that
urobilin was found in such small quantities in the faeces.
    As far as the ratio of alkaline to aromatic sulphates is concerned, in
the two periods with the small quantity of fat the ratio is 17:1 and
22 : 1, while during the two periods with the large quantity of fat the
ratio was 13 : 1 to 12 : 1.
    We have here even more markedly than in the normal dog the error
 brought out by only noting the ratio, and not the absolute quantity, of
 aromatic sulphates, for with a ratio of 12:1, as compared to that of
 22 : 1, we should think the aromatic sulphates were very markedly
 increased if we did not know that this alteration in the ratio was due.
 not to an increase of the aromatic sulphates and therefore increase in
 the intestinal putrefaction, but simply to the decrease of alkaline
 sulphates in consequence of the proteid-sparing action of the increased
 fat in the diet.
     In Table XXV, dog 5, only two periods were investigated.               Here
 we see that a very marked diminution in the quantity of nitrogen was
 produced by increasing the fat from 11-55 to 41-55 grams.                Accom
 panying     this  is  an  equal diminution in  the quantity of alkaline sulph
 ates.      The aromatic sulphates in this case also were decreased in
  amount by increasing the fat ; in consequence of this, the ratio in this
  dog remains much the same.
     In Table XXVI are placed together the averages obtained in the
  preceding dogs, and it is seen that they compare very well with one
 another.
     As  a general conclusion,      one may say that in all cases the increase of
  fat causes a decrease in the quantity of sulphates, and at the same time
  tends    to decrease the quantity of aromatic sulphates;           that in the
  absence    of the large intestine this still holds good, although the aro
  matic sulphates are extremely small in amount.
     It is thus useless to consider the ratio of alkaline to aromatic sulph
  ates as an indication of the amount of intestinal putrefaction, unless the
  diet is poor in fat.
     It is also important to note that the amount of proteid itself given
  in the diet does not influence the amount of aromatic sulphates nearly
  as much as one would expect, for in dogs 1, 2, and 3, in spite of the
  proteid varying         in quantity very considerably,    the quantity of aro
   matic sulphates remained the same.

304     Prof. V. Harley. Influence of Removal of Large Intestine and
                                 Summary.
    The conclusions   to be drawn from the above experiments can be
briefly summarised, so that the general results will be more readily seen.
    1. The large intestine itself excretes a substance which contains
proteids, fat, and salts, thus resembling
                                           " Hermann's loop," but at the
same time contains no colouring matter, and so differs from the con
tents of the small intestine.
    2. Increasing the quantity of fat on a standard diet in normal
animals leads to a decrease in the quantity of urine passed, together
with a decrease in the amount of nitrogen eliminated in the urine, but
tends to increase its specific gravity.       The quantity of faeces is
increased when the quantity of fat in the diet is increased, and this is
accompanied with an increase in the nitrogen eliminated, and a more
marked increase in the quantity of fat eliminated from the bowel.
    In consequence of the increase in the nitrogen in the faeces, there is
a decrease in the amount of nitrogen absorbed from the alimentary
canal, but in spite of the increase in the quantity of fat in the faeces,
the increased quantity in the diet leads to an increase in the amount
absorbed.    The animal's weight increases, and this is due in part to
the increase of fat tissue by the additional fat in the diet, but mostly
to the fresh fat acting as a sparer of proteid destruction in the organ
ism.    (Table  III.)
    3. That increasing the quantity of fat in      a standard  diet in an
animal after partial removal of the large intestine yields similar
results as regards the urine and general metabolism to those found in
normal dogs, except that the increased quantity of fat in the diet does
not appear to cause an increase in the amount of the faeces, or an
increase in the nitrogen of the faeces, and only a slight increase of
fat in the faeces.
    The partial removal of the large intestine causes a diminution in the
absorption of nitrogen from the alimentary canal, which is only slightly
influenced by increasing the fat in the diet.       The absorption of fat
seems to be influenced in the same manner as in normal dogs by increas
ing the fat in the diet. (Table V.)
   4. The increased quantity of fat in a standard diet in dogs, after
total removal of the large intestine, causes a decrease in the quantity
of urine, and nitrogen in the urine, with a tendency to an increase in
specific gravity.
   The quantity of faeces is increased by increasing the fat in the diet,
but the quantity of nitrogen and fat in the faeces is uninfluenced by
the larger amount of fat taken, so that these dogs do not correspond
to what is found in normal dogs. (Table VIII.)
    5. The influence of increasing quantities of fat in the diet on the
quantity of water in the faeces.

     Increasing Quantities of Fat in Diet     on Metabolism  in Bogs.    305
      In normal dogs it is found that the increase of fat in the diet causes
  a progressive increase in the total quantity of water eliminated in the
  feces, while the percentage of water is decreased, the total quantity
 of the faeces increasing with the increase of fat in the diet.
     In partial removal of the large intestine there is also an increase in
 the total quantity of water, as well as apparently an increase in the
  percentage   of water.
     In complete removal of the large intestine there is an increase in
 the total quantity of water eliminated in the fasces, with an increase
 in the percentage of water eliminated by the bowel, the fasces increasing
 in quantity with the augmentation          in the quantity of fat in the
 diet.
    It   is thus seen that increase of fat causes  an increased quantity of
 feces in the normal dog, the increased quantity of faeces is accompanied
 by an increase of total water, but a decrease in the percentage of
 water eliminated in the faeces, while in the case of the removal     of the
 large intestine, the increase in the quantity of faeces is accompanied
 both with an increase in the total quantity of water and the percentage
of water.      (Table XIV.)
    6.   The influence of the removal of the large intestine on the absorp
tion from the alimentary canal.
    It has been already seen that the dogs passed a larger quantity of
feces when the large intestine had been removed, and this is to a small
extent brought out in partial removal of the large intestine.           It is
seen that the increase in quantity of fasces is principally due to the
increase in quantity of water, the total quantity being nearly five
times as much as in the case of the normal dogs.            The quantity of
nitrogen in the faeces is increased to nearly three times as much as in
the normal dogs, while the quantity of fat remains unaltered, and in
those cases which were examined           the fasces contained   no carbo
hydrates.
    It is therefore seen that as far as the absorption  from the alimentary
canal is concerned : —
    (a) The carbohydrates are absorbed equally well with and without
the presence of the large intestine.
    (b) The fats are also absorbed equally well.      The normal dogs show
a percentage of absorption from 94 to 98, according to the amount of
fat given.      This apparently better absorption occurs with the increase
of fat in the diet.
    In partial   removal of the large intestine the percentage is roughly
96,    while when the entire large intestine is removed, from 92 to 98
per cent, of the fat given is absorbed, so that the dogs with and without
the large intestine appear to absorb fat equally well.
    (c) The proteids, as indicated by the nitrogen in the faeces, are, how
ever, very markedly influenced.        In normal dogs 93 to 98 per cent.

  306        Influence   of Removal of Large Intestine,          &c., on Dogs.
  of the nitrogen given in the diet was absorbed, the quantity diminish
  ing with the increased quantity of fat.
      In partial removal of the large intestine from 89 to 90 per cent, of
  the nitrogen was absorbed, the quantity not decreasing as in the
  normal dogs with the increase of the fat in the diet.               When the entire
  large  intestine   is removed      only 84   per  cent,   of the nitrogen given in
  the diet was absorbed.          The quantity absorbed is uninfluenced by the
  increase of fat in the diet.*
     One may therefore conclude that 10 per cent, at least of the nitro
  gen in the diet is absorbed by the large intestine, and in all probability
  a very much larger quantity, as we have seen the large intestine itself
  excretes a nitrogen-containing substance.            (Tables III, V, VIII.)
     7. The effects of removal of the large intestine on the breaking up
  of fat in the alimentary canal.
     In comparing the separate analyses of the fat contained in the fasces,
 it is found the fat acids, neutral fat, and fat acids present as soaps
 remain practically the same in dogs with and without the large intestine.
 It would, however, appear that the quantity of cholesterin tends to
 decrease in the           faeces   in the absence of the large intestine.
 (Table XX.)
     8. The action      of    the removal     of the large     intestine  on   urobilin
 formation.
     In  normal dogs the fasces were found to contain no bile, but large
 quantities of urobilin, while when the large intestine was removed this
 was not always the case, as in some, especially soon after the operation,
 large quantities of bile pigment would be recognised in the faeces               with
 little or no urobilin.
     On examining the walls of the intestine it was found that the urobilin
 reaction in normal dogs as a rule could only be obtained beyond the
 ileo-csecal valve.     In two dogs in which the large intestine was removed
 only a slight urobilin reaction was discovered in the ilium.
     9. The influence of fat on the total alkaline and aromatic sulphates.
    In normal dogs increasing the quantity of fat in the diet causes,
 with the decrease in the quantity of nitrogen in the urine, a corre
sponding diminution in the quantity of total sulphates.                   This steady
decrease in the total sulphates is not due to a diminution in the quan
tity of the aromatic sulphates, but of the alkaline sulphates, since the
aromatic sulphates are only very slightly decreased.
    In consequence of this decrease in the alkaline sulphates the ratio of
A : B is decreased, so that if one only referred to the ratio one would
be led to believe that there was an increase in the intestinal putre
faction, while in reality there is no increase but rather a decrease, as
indicated by the slight diminution in the quantity of aromatic sul
phates.      (Table XX. Dogs 1 and 2.)

     10.  The influence of removal of the large intestine on the total
 alkaline and aromatic sulphates.
    The total sulphates are influenced in the same manner in the dogs
 without the large intestine as in normal animals by increasing the fat
in the diet. The alkaline sulphates decrease with the diminution in
the quantity of nitrogen eliminated in the urine. This diminution is
due to the decrease in the alkaline sulphates, the same as in the normal
 dogs.
    The increased quantity    of fat in the diet has no influence apparently
 on the quantity of aromatic sulphates eliminated in the urine. The
removal of the large intestine tends markedly to diminish the quantity
of aromatic sulphates daily eliminated, the quantity eliminated being
less than half the quantity found in a normal dog on the same diet ; so
 that the removal of the large intestine evidently causes a marked dimi
 nution in the intestinal putrefaction, or rather has removed the prin
cipal seat for intestinal putrefaction.     (Table XXVI. Dogs 4 and 5.)

          M.A., F.R.S., Fellow and Bedford Lecturer of Balliol College,
          and   Millard Lecturer of Trinity College, Oxford.                 Received
          December 15, 1898,— Read January 19, 1899.
   A very large number of observations have been made of the refrac
tive indices and densities of aqueous solutions of inorganic salte and
acids   in England, more especially, by Dr. J. H. Gladstone, who in a
          :
                                          '
paper  in the ' Philosophical Transactions for 1870, gave the values he
had obtained for the refractive indices and densities of some 160 salts
and acids; and in a series of papers published subsequently in the
'
  Journal of the Chemical Society,' has given the results of further
observations.
   Most, however, of these determinations have been made with solu
tions of different strengths, and at different temperatures, and, there
fore, I venture to bring before the Royal Society an account of some
observations I have made of the refractive indices and densities of
normal and semi-normal aqueous solutions of hydrogen chloride, and
the chlorides of the alkalis at a uniform temperature of 18°.
   The method was the ordinary hollow prism one, but special care was
taken to keep the solution at a definite known temperature.          An
alteration of 1° in the tempera ture of water in the neighbourhood of
20" makes a difference in the refractive index of nearly one unit in the
fourth decimal place.*
   The goniometer used was made by Messrs. Troughton and Simms ;
it has an 8-inch circle divided into 10', and is read by means of two
micrometers, directly to 10", and by estimation to single seconds.
The prism was made by Steinheil ; the value of its refracting angle, as
determined by ten independent measurements, was 60° 1'                       44".        The
prism table was supported independently of the divided                        circle         by
means of a steel axis.
  In order that the temperature               of the prism might be kept constant.
it was surrounded by               a water-jacket, the prism being in actual contact
with the metal casing containing the water, as, in some previous
experiments,t it had been found that when the prism was merely
surrounded by the water-jacket, without being in actual contact with
it,   a   considerable     time elapsed before the prism and water-jacket               were

       at the same   temperature.    In order that     the prism might be in contact
       with the water-jacket    it was necessary that this should be carried by
       the table  of the goniometer, and therefore that it should be as small
      and   light as possible.
         A slow stream of water from a tap was allowed to flow through a
                                   "          "
      coil of about 5 metres of      compo       pipe, placed in a metal water-bath
      supported    over a small  gas flame  ;   the temperature of the water being
      kept constant by means of a Harcourt gas regulator.             From the coil
      the water passed through a rubber tube to the water-jacket.               This
      consisted of two flat brass boxes l-5 cm. deep and 12 cm. in diameter,
      between which the prism was placed ; the lower box being circular, the
     upper annular.        The boxes were fixed together concentrically and
     their interiors connected by two vertical brass tubes 5-2 cm. long.
     The brass plate which formed the top of the lower box was 5 mm.
     thick and 15 cm. in diameter; the levelling screws, by which the
     water-jacket was supported on the table of the goniometer, worked
     in holes drilled in the overhanging edge of the plate, and the prism
    rested on it.
         A brass ring with a screw cut on its inner surface was fixed round
    the top of the central opening in the upper box, a brass tube 2-5 cm. in
    internal diameter, with a screw cut on its outer surface, worked into
   the thread on the ring, and by screwing this tube down on to the top
   of the prism, the prism could be held in position.            The object of this
   particular arrangement          was  to    enable    the prism to be filled and
   emptied by means of a pipette, without interfering with its position,
   and to allow a thermometer, and a platinum stirring wire, to be in
   troduced into the liquid whose refractive index was to be observed.
        The third face of the prism was in actual contact with the flat sur
  face of one of the vertical tubes, by means of which the two boxes
  were connected together.           The cross section of these two tubes was
  such, that the prism was, as far as possible, surrounded            by the water-
 jacket.         Paper tubes, fitted over the ends of the collimator and tele
 scope, projected into the openings in the water-jacket.                 By packing
  the spaces between these paper tubes and the water-jacket with cotton
 wool, the sides of the prism were, to a considerable extent, shielded
 from air currents, without preventing the adjustment of the prism and
 telescopes.
       Two small metal pipes were fixed to the top of the upper cylindrical
 box, the one ending just within the box, the other reaching down
 through one of the connecting tubes already mentioned, nearly to the
bottom of the lower box. To these metal pipes rubber tubes were
attached ; through the one the water from the coil flowed into the
jacket, through the other from the jacket to the waste.
      By keeping the temperature of the water-bath at about 20° (the
temperature necessary varied with the temperature of the room, an
                                                                      2  n 2

310       Sir    J.   Uonroy.       Refractive Indices and Densities of
underground one), the temperature of the liquid in the prism could be
easily kept within one or two tenths of a degree of 18°.
   The liquid in the prism was kept stirred by means of the platinum
wire, the end of which was bent round into a ring, and the bulb of the
thermometer was immersed in the liquid.
   The observations were made with sodium light only, as it had been
previously found that, owing to the brilliancy and constancy of the
sodium light, it was not only far easier to make observations with               it,
but that those observations would be more accurate than observations
made with light of other refrangibilities.
   The readings were made by moving the telescope first from left to
right, then from right to left, until the intersection of the cross wires
coincided with the image of the sodium line and the micrometer w.t-
                                                          ;
read in the same way. After four readings of the micrometer had been
made, the prism was reversed by rotating the table of the goniometer,
and adjusted for minimum deviation      four readings made, and then the
                                                :
prism again adjusted for minimum deviation, and four more readings
made the prism replaced in its original position, adjusted, and the
      ;
same number of readings made.
  The liquid in the prism was well stirred, and the thermometer                read
before each adjustment of the prism for minimum deviation.   Half               the
difference between the two  sets of eight readings was, of course,              the
deviation.  The readings were made thus in order, as far as possible,
to eliminate errors due to the position of the prism, and to slight
changes in temperature.
   For each solution observations were made with the prism at the
temperature of the room, and at 18°.  In the former case one set only,
as the temperature of the prism did not remain constant, and indeed
had usually risen slightly before the one set of readings could       be made     ;
in the latter case four sets were made.
  The densities of the solutions were determined by means           Dr.    of
Perkins' modification of the Sprengel density tube.* Two          these   of
tubes were used, continuing respectively 34-0376 c.c. and 25-1587 c.c.
After being filled, the tubes were placed in a water bath at 18° for              20
minutes, the volumes adjusted, and weighed against counterpoises made
of the same kind of glass, and having about the same surface areas                \
the tubes and their counterpoises were wiped carefully with                a    dry
cloth before each weighing, to ensure that, as far as possible, the             sur
faces were in the same condition as regards moisture.     After being
weighed,    few more drops of the solutions were introduced into the
             a
tubes, which were then replaced in the bath four determinations king
                                                         ;
made with each solution.
  The water-bath contained     Harcourt gas regulator, and
                                         a                                a    slow
stream of water from the main was run into it; without this the                 tem-

perature could not be kept down to 18°, the loss of heat by radiation
not being sufficient.
  The bath was kept stirred by bubbles of air which escaped from an
inverted   thistle-funnel connected by a rubber tube with a large
Woulfe's bottle.    A stream of water ran continuously into the bottle,
and drove the air out through the rubber tube and thistle funnel.
When nearly full of water, the bottle was emptied by a syphon ; thus,
by the combined action of a continuous stream of water tending to fill
the bottle, and the intermittent action of the syphon which emptied it,
the water-bath was kept stirred.
   The normal and semi-normal solutions were prepared by first making
up solutions which contained a gram-molecule       in about 800 c.c. or
900 c.c., then determining the strength of these solutions, running
the volume required from a burette into a measuring flask, and making
the solution up to a known bulk.      Distilled water, which had been
freed from air by being boiled and allowed to cool under reduced pres
sure, was used.
   The hydrochloric acid was prepared by redistilling the acid sold as
"
  pure redistilled."
   The potassium and sodium chloride solutions were prepared from
              "                      "
salts sold as    pure recrystallised   (solutions A), and also (solutions B)
from salts guaranteed as pure by E. Merck (" fiir analytische Zwecke                                     ").

The " pure recrystallised potassium chloride contained          good deal of          a
sodium, whilst that obtained from Merck contained hardly any.
   The lithium and rubidium chlorides were also purchased from
E. Merck, but were of ordinary commercial purity.

   Table  II shows that both the densities and the refractive indices as a
rule increase with the molecular weight, but that in the latter case
there is one remarkable exception.            The refractive index of potassium
chloride is slightly lower than that of sodium chloride.
   This fact has already been noticed by Bendert and Borgesius.}
Bender's observations were made by the hollow prism method, with
solutions containing from 0-5 to 4-5 gram-molecules in the litre, and at
temperatures between 16° and 21° ; he states (p. 92) that the solutions
of potassium and sodium chloride had nearly identical refractive
indices, those of the latter being slightly the greater, especially with
the more concentrated       solutions.

he   gives his results      as the differences     between     the indices of his solu
tions and that of water          ; his Table      I*  shows that the values for the
potassium chloride solutions were always               lower than those for the cor
responding sodiiun chloride solutions.
    The refractive index of the solution of           a  salt clearly depends on the
influence both of the solvent and of the salt in solution.                 In order that
the values obtained         with different salts should be comparable, it is
necessary that the solutions should be similar, i.e., that in unit volume
there should be the same weight of solvent and of salt, or the same
weight of solvent and weights of salt bearing the same relation to the
molecular weights of the salts.
    Such is seldom, if ever, the case with aqueous solutions at least. A
litre of a normal solution contains, together with the gram-molecular
weight of the salt, a weight of water               which    is different for different
salts.
    Hence the refractive indices of the solutions of any two salts cannot
 be taken as a measure of the influence which the several salts exert on
 the velocity of light, unless it has been shown that the unit volumes of
 the solutions contain equal weights of water, together with either
 equal weights of the salts, or weights which bear the same ratio to the
 molecular weights.
     Table    III gives the weight in grams of the water contained in 1000 c.c-
 of the solutions whose refractive indices and densities are given in
 Table    II,  obtained   by subtracting from the weight of 1000              c.c. of the
 solution the weight of salt contained in that volume.

     The table shows that in equal volumes of the solutions of the chlo
  rides of hydrogen, lithium, and sodium nearly equal weights of water
  are present, but that such is not the case with the solutions of the two
  other chlorides.
     In a  litre of  a normal solution of potassium chloride there are about
  10 grams,     and in a semi-normal solution about 5 grams less water than
                                   * Loc eit., p.  333.

in the corresponding solutions of sodium chloride ; hence if the chlo
 rides of the two metals had, when present in solution in molecular pro
 portions, equal powers of retarding the velocity of light, the solution
'of the potassium salt might be expected to have a lower refractive index
 than that of the sodium salt, as the unit volume contains, in addition
 to the salt, less water.
      At present we are not in a position to distinguish between the
 retardation due to the substance in solution and that due to the solvent.
 If, as a first attempt, we assume (which        is,
                                                   of course, improbable) that
 the presence of the salt merely causes the water to occupy a greater
 volume without altering any of its properties other than those which
 depend on its density, we can calculate approximately the refractive
 index of the water in the solution.

 we regard each gas as unchanged except that its density           isreduced by
 the admixture.        If  mixture of liquids  or the solution of     salt, where
                         is a
                                                                   a
 no mutual action           known to occur, be similarly regarded, we may
 consider each of the liquids or the solvent as changed only in respect of
 its density. If again we attribute the change of refractive index with
  temperature solely to the change in the density of the liquid, we may
 make the hypothesis that the effect on the refractive index of water of
a    change of density       the same when
                            is              it    expanded by admixture and
                                                 is
  whenit   is   expanded by rise of temperature.       No doubt such        hypo
                                                                             a
  thesis, resting upon two hypotheses each of which              improbable, luus
  itself
       a    very small probability, but  I   have thought  it is  worth while to
  reckon what the refractive indices of the water in the various solutions
  would be on this hypothesis.         The difference between this value and
  the observed value of the index of the solution furnishes more probable
  value for the influence which the salt may be supposed to exert on the
  velocity of light than that obtained by subtracting the index of water
  from the index of the solution at the same temperature.
      From Landolt and Bornstein's tables the temperatures were ascer
   tained at which water has the same density as that contained in the
   various solutions, and then from the same tables the refractive index of
   water for these temperatures and densities.
      The values for the differences between the observed indices of the
   various solutions and the index of water at 18° are given in the second
   and third columns of Table IV, and the differences between the
   observed indices and the values for the indices of water, calculated on
   the above assumption, in the fourth and fifth columns.
      The table shows that the differences between the refractive indices
   of the solutions, and that of water at 18° increase with the molecular
   weights of the salts in solution, except in the case of potassium
   chloride, but  if  the differences are calculated on the assumption that
    the refractive index of the water in the solutions    is   less than that of

water    in its ordinary condition, then potassium chloride no longer
forms an exception, and the differences increase with the molecular
weights of the salts ; the increase, however, does not bear any apparent
relation to the increase in the molecular weights.
   The differences for the normal solutions, calculated             in both ways,
are  slightly less than double those for the semi-normal.
   The object of these experiments was the determination of the
refractive indices and densities of normal and semi-normal aqueous solu
tions of hydrogen chloride and the chlorides of the alkalis at a uniform
temperature ; the results obtained at 18° are set forth in Table I, the
indices being given to six places of decimals and the densities to
five places.
   In Table     II the results corrected for small errors in the strengths of
the  solutions    are  given.    The table shows that both the densities and
the refractive indices increase with the molecular weight of the sub
stance   in solution, except in the case of the refractive index of potas
sium chloride, which is slightly lower than that of sodium chloride.
   Table    III  gives the weight of water contained in 1000 c.c. of each of
the   solutions, and Table IV the differences between the refractive
indices of the solutions, and the refractive index of water under
ordinary conditions, and also the differences between the refractive
indices of the solutions and the calculated indices of the water con
tained    in the solutions.
   [Note.
           — From the data given in Table I, it is not possible to draw
any satisfactory conclusions as to the sensitiveness of the different
solutions. The values for the indices at temperatures other than 18",
rest on single sets of observations, and in some cases there was not
sufficient difference between the temperature at which these observa
tions were made and 18°, to enable the rate of change of the index to
be determined at all accurately.                   «
   I have, therefore, made some further observations with the same
solutions of hydrogen chloride and the chlorides of lithium, sodium,

   and potassium, and also with water.               In both the rubidium solutions
   a  mould had developed, and therefore              no observations   were made with
   these two solutions.
       The observations         were   made    in the same way as those already
   described, except that (1) the gas regulator was removed from the
   water bath containing the coil, and the temperature was allowed to
   rise, and (2) all the measurements were made with the prism in one
   position.
       The temperature of the prism rose slowly, about 2° in an hour ; the
   prism was not reversed in order to avoid exposing its surfaces to the
   cooling action of the air of the room.             The object of the experiments
   being to ascertain the relative values of the index of a solution at
   different temperatures, and not the absolute value at any particular
   temperature, the result would not be affected by any small error due to
   the observations having been made with the prism in one position of
    minimum deviation and in one position only.
       The values obtained were plotted, one unit in the fifth place being
    represented by 1 mm., and the rate of change, the

"
    Sets  of Operations in Relation to Groups of Finite Order." By
         A. N. Whitehead,   M.A.,  Fellow of Trinity College, Cam
         bridge. Communicated by Professor A. E. Forsyth, F.R.S.
         Received January 19, — Read February 2, 1899.
                                             (Abstract.)
                                             Introduction.
   The present paper is concerned with the Theory of Groups of Finite
Orders.    The more general object of the paper is to place this theory
in relation to a special algebra of the type considered in the general
theory  of Universal Algebra.       This special algebra, which may be
called the Algebra of Groups of Finite Order, has many affinities to
the Algebra of Symbolic Logic ; and a comparison of it with this
algebra is given in the last section of this paper.
   Mathematicians are accustomed in the study of quaternions to the
idea of a vector symbol being considered from two points of view
according to circumstances, namely, either as a geometrical entity, or
as a symbol expressive of the operation of modifying some geometrical
entity into another geometrical entity.    Now from the point of view
of this paper it is natural to abandon the idea of a group of N opera
tions S0, Sj,    Sx_j on some unspecified object, as being an idea which,
however vaguely, appertains to a special interpretation of the symbols.
The N symbols S0, Sp         SN_j arc to be considered, as in the similar
case of quaternions,   primarily as N distinct objects. When two of
these objects are multiplied, as in S7 Sr, then a third object of the
group, such as Sp, is produced ; and in reference to this multiplication
one of the symbols,                  say Sg, may be looked on as an operation on             S,-
modifying            it   into   Sp.    But this is not the sense in which the symbols
are usually called operations   in the Theory of Groups. However, in
order not to disturb  the well  understood nomenclature of the subject,
the N objects S0, Sj,      SN_j will always be called the fundamental
operations, or, more shortly, the operations.   But the word operation
can simply be regarded as      name for the objects represented by these
                                         a
N  symbols.
   These N symbols arc considered to be capable of addition according
to the law
                                             S   +   S   =    S.
   This    the well known law of addition in Symbolic Logic, and the
                is
introduction of numerical symbols as factors        thereby avoided.
                                                                   is
   The sum of       selection of the                  N
                                             fundamental operations, such as
   +Sp  +  Sg+ S(,S, called  is a
                              set.    If set obeys certain special conditions
                                        a             a
it   called a group.
     is                 The  sum   of  the whole number (N) of fundamental

?>20                         Sir Norman Lockyer.                      Note on tlie
operations, namely, S0 + Sj +   + SH _v obeys these conditions. This
sum is called the complete group, and all other groups are its sub
groups.
   The first six sections of this paper are devoted to the detailed estab
lishment of this purely algebraic view of the subject.      At times the
modification  in treatment from    that adopted in the standard treatises
on the subject, such as Burnside's ' Theory of Groups of Finite Orders,'
is slight. Where the modification would be of no sufficient interest it
has been    simply omitted, and the theorems when wanted have been
assumed as part of the general knowledge of the subject.             Only so
much reasoning has been given as will establish the principles of the
Algebra of Groups of Finite Order, viewed as an algebra independent
of any interpretation, however vague.
    The more special object of this paper follows directly from the
(hanged point of view from which the Theory of Groups is here
regarded.      The idea of the group is no longer so absorbing ; the set
takes its place as the fundamental general entity which has to be inves
tigated.    A group is a special type of set. Accordingly in this paper
.some of the general properties of sets are investigated.     A set of opera
tions has numerous groups associated with            and these groups have it,
many   relations  with  each   other  which  this paper cannot pretend to
have exhausted.       The fundamental idea of this part of the paper
('/•  §

            is                       set    of an unending series of other

                  Enhanced Lines in         the  Spectrum of     a. Cygni.               321
unknown         origin, one in the hottest stars, the other in stars of inter
mediate     temperature.
   After the discovery of           a terrestrial source of helium by Professor
Ramsay, I showed in a series of seven notes communicated to the
Royal Society,* May — September, 1895, that the cleveite gases, which
I obtained by the process of distillation, accounted to a very great
extent for the first set.
    In 1897 in a series of three communications to the Royal Society,!
I pointed out that some of the other set of unknown lines in the stars
of intermediate temperature, taking a Cygni as an example, were due
to the enhanced spark lines of iron and othor metals, the arc lines
being almost entirely absent.
    During the last year, this research has been continued; and latterly,
by the kindness of Mr. Hugh Spottiswoode, the photographs                             of the
enhanced lines have been obtained by the use of the large induction
coil, formerly belonging to Dr. Spottiswoode, P.R.S.                     I am anxious to
express     here   my   deep    obligation    to   Mr.   Hugh    Spottiswoode        for the
loan of such a magnificent addition to our instrumental aids.
    The spark obtained by means of the Spottiswoode coil, is so luminous
that higher dispersions than those formerly employed can be effectively
used, and in consequence of this, the detection of the enhanced line*
Incomes more easy; their number therefore has been considerably
increased.
    The observations have already been mapped for the following
substances : — Fe, Mg, Ca, Si, Sr, Va, Ti, Ni, Mn, Cr, Co, Cu.
     In the accompanying photograph, a comparison is shown between
the lines of a Cygni and the enhanced lines of the above substances
thrown together.           The extraordinary number of coincidences is seen
:it a glance.       The facts are as follows :—
The      number     of lines measured in the spectrum of a Cygni at
        Kensington between X3798-1 and X4861-6 is                                         307
Of these the number             which approximately coincides with the
         enhanced metallic lines so far observed is                                       1 20
The number of lines (excluding the hydrogen series) in a Cygni
         of intensity over 4 (the maximum being represented by
         10) is                                                                             40
Of this number, the coincidences with enhanced metallic                          lines
         with the dispersion employed amount to                                             SS
     I shall deal in a subsequent communication, when the enquiry has
 reached a further stage, with the details for each element.

 the lines of hydrogen aud the high temperature line of Mg at X4481,
all the lines may be said to be at present of unknown origin. Some of
 the lines fall near lines of iron, but the absence of the strongest                line*
indicates that the close coincidences are probably accidental."

    In the Harvard     '
                          Spectra of Bright Stars             1897, p. 5, the following
words occur, relating to the same stars : —
    " This system of lines should perhaps                 be regarded     as forming s
separate class, as in the case of the Orion lines, and should not be
                '
described as metallic,' as has just been done in the absence of any
more distinctive name."
    From the fact that these unknown lines have now been traced to a
" proto-metallic " origin,         as effectively as the unknown lines of the
hottest stars have been traced to helium and asterium, we may expect
that the consequences of this determination in relation to stellar classi
fication and other connected matters, will be very far reaching. At
present I am using this new spectrum consisting of enhanced lines as
an explorer, in relation to some further details of stellar classification
having special reference to stars of Groups               III  and IV in which bright
as well as dark lines occur.

   On the Effects of Strain on the Thenno-Electric Qualities of
       Metals."     By Magnus Maclean, M.A., D.Sc. Communicated
       by Lord Kelvin, F.K.S. Eeceived January 23, — Read Feb
       ruary  2, 1899.
    1. Seebeckt discovered the great effect that hardness, or softness, or
crystalline structure, has on the thermo-electric properties of metals.
Magnus made a number of experiments by winding a hard drawn wire
on a reel.     Parts of this wire were softened and annealed. When
heat was applied to the parts of the wire which were between unan-
nealed and annealed, a thermo-electric current was obtained.                    In this
way Magnus found that the current passed from soft to hard through
the hot junction for silver,               steel, cadmium,        copper, gold, and
platinum ; and that it passed from hard to soft through the hot junc
tion for German silver, zinc, tin, and iron.

 extension gave the same effect as permanent lateral contraction    and                                        ;
 that this effect for  both was opposite to that experienced by   them
 when under      stress which caused
                            a            temporary strain. Thus for a

 copper         wire under               a       longitudinal stress the current was from the
strainedcopper to the free copper across the hot junction, and the
magnitude of the current increased with the increase of the longitudinal
stress.         If         the stress were removed and the wire left with                   permanent

copper        through the hot junction.                             Similar results were got with iron,
only the direction of the current was in each case opposite to the
direction of the current in the corresponding   case for copper.  The
highest temperature  used in these experiments was  about 100° C.

324             Dr. M. Maclean.        On the Effects  of Strain
view when     I  started  these experiments.     The arrangement is shown
diagrammatically       below.   One junction of the wires was kept in a
glycerine bath which could be heated by a Bunsen burner. This
junction was tied by a fine copper wire to the bulb of a ther
mometer T. The other ends of the wires were joined to short copper
wires which served as terminals of the low resistance galvanometer
used in the experiments.         These junctions were wrapped in paraffin
paper or cotton wool which contained the bulb of a thermometer T,
reading half degrees from 0°C. to 25° C.       A paper screen S was hanging
vertically between the Bunsen burner and the thermometer T and the
galvanometer to prevent any heat from the flame reaching the rest of
the circuit by radiation.         These precautions     were taken to make
certain that all junctions, except the hot junction, would be at the
same temperature.
    6. The constant of the galvanometer was determined by joining a
 Daniell cell in circuit with the galvanometer and with a resistance of
 over 30,000 ohms. The electromotive force of the Daniell cell was com
 pared with a standard Clark cell by means of a quadrant electrometer.
 In this way the current through the galvanometer per division deflec
 tion on the scale was determined.         The sensitiveness, in preliminary
 experiments,   was   0-612   mikroampere per division.       But by different
 arrangements     of the    controlling  magnets, the sensitiveness of the
 galvanometer     as now    used is 0'09 mikroampere per division.         The
 resistance of the galvanometer, at 15° C.    —  the average temperature of
 the laboratory during the experiments— is       1 -5 ohms.  Thus the electro

  motive force at the terminals          of   the galvanometer     as now     used   is
 0-135     mikrovolt per division.
      7.  A considerable lag was found in the thermometer              readings, and
 the following method was adopted to get rid of this effect.                 The hot
 junction was heated very slowly through a small range (5° C. or 10° C.)
 and then the Bunsen         burner was drawn slightly aside so as to give
 approximately      as much heat to the vessel which contained          the glycerine
 as    it lost by radiation.     The thermometer,       T, and the spot of light
 on the    scale were simultaneously       observed, and    when both were seen
 to be steady, the readings were          noted.    The circuit was then imme
 diately broken and readings taken of the galvanometer zero* and the
 thermometer T'.
     Very often the glycerine was allowed to cool slowly, and by means
 of a small Bunsen flame the temperature was kept steady for a short
 time and readings taken.          If the same precautions were taken as are
 described in the previous paragraph, the same deflections from zero
 were got for the same difference of temperature between the hot and
cold junctions.
     8. The metals so far tried are : —
     (1)  Copper wire from Messrs. Johnson and Matthey. This was
           pure electrotype copper wire with no impurity detected except
           an unweighable trace of iron.
    (2) Copper wire, ordinary commercial, from Messrs. Johnson and
           Matthey.     This was analysedt in the chemical laboratory of
           the University, and was found to contain : —
   *
       It was found necessary to take the zero immediately after eaoh reading as the
lero was by no means constant.      It was thought at first that the change of zero
was mainly due to the suspending fibre of the mirror in the galvanometer, but a
new plug and fibre did not lessen the variations of the zero during an experiment.
It is most likely due to the general laboratory experiments going on simultaneously,
which involve the moving of apparatus and the walking about of students with
knives and keys in their pockets in the near vicinity of the galvanometer.         For
example, my own pocket knife at the distance of the scale from the galvanometor
(a metre) gives a deflection of 10 scale divisions. The galvanometer is at a distance
of 11"74 metres from      the dynamo used in the electric light installation of the
Physical Laboratory, the two being separated by a stone wall. The stopping or the
Parting of tho dynamo altered the metallic zero of the galvanometer by 100
divisions.     The constant of the galvanometer was tested both when the dynamo
was running and when the dynamo was not running.          Practically it was the same
on both occasions.    Nearly all the experiments were done when the dynamo was
running.

No. 18 standard gauge.          A piece of the wire was taken and drawn
through  a draw  plate till  it was reduced to about No. 24 standard gauge.
This process of wire drawing subjects the wire to longitudinal extension
and to lateral compression.       Lord Kelvin in his experiments (' Mathe
matical and Physical Papers,' vol. 2 and section 3 above) showed that
thermo-electric differences were in the same direction for longitudinal
extension and transverse compression.         For drawn and undrawn wires
the direction of the current through the hot junction is from undrawn
to drawn for copper, reostene, and lead, and from drawn to undrawn for
platinoid, German silver, and manganin.         The magnitude of the current
per degree  difference of   temperature   is given in the following table.

   10.  The resistances of all the undrawn wires were carefully deter
mined by the usual bridge method.
   The specific gravities and cross sections of both the undrawn and
drawn wires were also determined by weighing known lengths in air
and in water.       The values are given in the following table. It will
be noted that the specific gravity of drawn copper, of drawn commercial
lead, of drawn platinoid, and of drawn manganin, is greater* than for
the corresponding undrawn wires ; that the specific gravity of undrawn
and drawn German silver wire is the same ; and that the specific gravity
of drawn reostene wire and of drawn pure lead wire is less than that
of the undrawn.

   11.   The resistances of the drawn copper and manganin wires were
compared with the resistances of the corresponding undrawn copper and
manganin wires by the fall of potential method, and it was found that
the resistances of the drawn wires (for the same length and cross section)
were slightly greater* than that of the undrawn wires.                      In calculating
the total resistance in the circuit external to the galvanometer, this
increase of resistance in the drawn wire is not taken into account. The
circuit consisted of 60 cm. of the undrawn wire, and 60 cm. of the
drawn wire, together with the low resistance galvanometer.                               By
multiplying the current per division, given in the table of Section 9,
by the total resistance of the circuit, the thermo-electric difference per
degree between drawn and undrawn wires is found.                        The numbers are

    13.  The   effect     of hardening by twisting has been partially tried.
Thus two pieces of laboratory copper wire were taken, and one was in
successive     experiments twisted 1 turn, 3 turns, 5 turns, 7 turns,
8| turns per cm.            The wire with 8| turns per cm. got quite brittle,
and broke when an attempt was made to put more twists into it.                           The
twisted wire was then heated red hot by an electric current, and
allowed to cool.         This partially annealed it.

    14.   The   effects  of twist on the drawn copper wire were also tried,
and    it  was found that 1, 2, 3 turns per cm. in the drawn wire slightly
diminished      the thermo-electric   difference obtained between the undrawn
wire and the drawn wire ; but that 4 and 5 turns per cm. in the
drawn wire gave the same thermo-electric difference as was found
between the undrawn wire and the untwisted drawn wire.
    15. The drawn and twisted copper wire was annealed by putting a
gradually increasing current through it till it got red-hot, and then,
without breaking the circuit, the current was gradually reduced till
the wire was at the temperature of the laboratory.               Trying it in this
condition along with the undrawn and untwisted copper wire, the
current through the hot junction was found to be reversed, being from
the drawn twisted and annealed wire to the undrawn wire.                        The
thermo-electric difference was 0-0081 mikrovolt per degree.
    16. Similar experiments        on platinoid wires as those described in
Section 14 on copper wires gave similar results.               Thus 1, 2, 3 turns
per em. in the drawn platinoid wire diminished the thermo-electric
difference obtained between the drawn wire and the undrawn wire;
but 4 and 5 turns per cm. in the drawn wire gave the same thermo
electric difference (T477 mikrovolts per degree) as was found between
the untwisted drawn wire and the undrawn wire.
    17. The drawn and twisted platinoid wire was partially annealed,
and the thermo-electric difference between it and the undrawn platinoid
wire was thereby reduced from 1-477 mikrovolts per degree to 0-567
mikrovolt per degree.
    18. A beginning has teen made of determining the thermo-electric
differences between free wires and wires previously permanently elon
gated 1, 2, 3, &c. per cent. by a simple longitudinal stress; also
wires while (u) under stress, stretching them within their limits of
elasticity ; and ('>) under stress,' stretching them beyond their limits of

                  The Constitution    of the  Electric Spark.                  331
"The Constitution of the Electric Spark."              By Arthur Schuster,
      F.R.S., and G. Hemsalech.              Received January 24,— Read
      February 2, 1899.
                                  (Abstract.)
   When an electric spark      passes between metallic      electrodes, the spec
trum    of the metal    appears, not only in immediate contact with the
electrodes, but stretches often across, from pole to pole.             It follows
that during the short time of the duration of the spark, the metal
vapours must be able to diffuse through measurable distances.
   The following investigation was undertaken primarily to measure
this velocity of diffusion with the special view        of comparing     different
metals, and different lines of the same metal.
   Feddersen published, in the year 1862, an interesting research, in
which photographs of sparks passing between different metal poles
are taken after reflection from a rotating mirror.          He could from his
experiments draw some conclusions which have a bearing on the subject,
but it was necessary for our purpose that the light should also be sent
through a spectroscope, so as to distinguish between the luminous
particles of air and those of the metal poles.
   The method of the rotating mirror tried during the course of several
years in various forms by one of us, did not prove successful.             On the
other hand good results were obtained at once on trying the method
used by    Professor Dixon, in his researches on explosive waves. This
method consists in fixing a photographic            film round the rim of a
rotating   wheel.   All  that is necessary  for ite  success is to have sparks
so powerful that each single one gives a good impression of its spec
trum on the film.         Were the sparks absolutely instantaneous, the
images token on the rotating wheel would be identical with those
developed on a stationary plate, but on trial this is found not to be
the case.    The metal lines are found to be inclined and curved when
the wheel rotates, and their inclination serves to measure the rate of
diffusion of the metallic particles.     The air lines, on the other hand,
remain straight, though slightly widened.
    To avoid the tendency of the film to fly off the wheel when fixed
round its rim, as in the original form of the apparatus, a spinning disc
was constructed    for us by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Com
pany.     The film is placed flat against the disc, and is kept in place by
a second smaller disc, which can be screwed lightly to the first.              The
 diameters of the two discs are 33 and 22-2 cm., the photographs being
taken in the annular space of 10-8 cm., left uncovered by the smaller
 disc. An electric motor drives the disc, and we have obtained velocities
 of 170 turns per second, though in our experiments the number of

   332             Messrs. A. Schuster and G. Hemsalech.
  revolutions was generally about 120, giving a linear velocity of about
   100 metres/second for that part of the film on which the photograph
  was taken.
      The electric discharges were obtained from a battery of six Leyden
  jars, having a total capacity of 0-033 microfarad, and being charged
  from an induction machine constructed for us by Mr. H. C. Wimshurst.
  This machine has twelve plates of 62 cm. diameter, and gives sparks
  which are 13 inches long.        The electrodes were, as a rule, placed
  1  cm. apart, and an image of the spark was projected on the slit of
 the spectroscope, the distance of the slit from the electrodes being
 equal to four times the focal length of the projecting lens, so that the
 image was equal in size to the spark.         The prism used was made by
 Steinheil, and had a refracting angle of 60°.
     We may now pass to the description of the results obtained when
 the spectrum of a single spark is taken on a moving film.                 A pre
 liminary trial with various metallic      electrodes had shown       us that the
 sharpest results were obtained with zinc, and we therefore chose that
 metal for our first investigation.     The principal lines of zinc as they
 appear on our photographs are the double line, the least refrangible of
 the two having a wave-length 4924-8, and the blue triplet, the wave
 length of the leading line being 4810-7. All the lines are curved on
 the photographs taken with the spinning disc, but the displacements,
 especially near the poles, are subject to considerable variations.          This
 is probably due to the fact that the path of the metallic particles is
 not always straight, and, if straight, its image does not necessarily
coincide with the slit.      A very slight error in measurement will also
affect the results considerably when the total displacement measured is
small.      Our results do not for this reason allow us at present to give
any opinion as to the maximum velocity of the particles near the pole ;
 but   if these are considerable, they drop down very quickly to speeds
 which, in the case of zinc, are not far off 500 metres/second.
     We have adopted two methods of comparison between dif0rent
photographs.       We have in the first place measured the displacements
at a number       of nearly equidistant points, and from these measure
ments we have deduced the time taken for a metallic molecule to pass
from the pole to a point 2 mm. away from it.            If this method could be
applied in every case, it would form a rational and consistent basis of
comparison.       But the curved lines which are to be measured are often
very diffuse near the pole ; this, and the continuous spectrum, may
render    it impossible to obtain satisfactory measurements at that        point.
In order not to have to reject unnecessarily       a large number of measure
ments because      the spectrum near the pole was indistinct, we have
adopted another method, which, though less rational than the first, is
found to give consistent results.      From all our measurements we may
deduce certain     figures  for the molecular     velocities   at different and

generally   equidistant points on the photographs, and may take the
average of all these figures as the mean velocity of the particle.     In
the tables given in the paper, V1 always refers to the mean velocity
between the pole and a point 2 mm. away from                         it,
                                                   while V2 refers to the
average    velocity  taken  for different distances, as just explained.
The influence of change of capacity and change in the length of the
spark was investigated in the case of zinc, and the following table
exhibits the results.    As the zinc lines are sharp near the pole, the
first of the above methods of measurement could be applied.

   The first striking result to be deduced from the table         the uni            is
formly higher velocity deduced from the double line 4925, as com
pared with that found when one of the lines of the triplet      measured            is           ;
for we have ascertained that the two first lines of the triplet are always
displaced by the same amount, and the third           so much mixed up is
with the air lines in its neighbourhood that     cannot be measured.

was one of the objects of the investigation to detect,            possible,          if
differences of this kind, which might be accounted for by the fact that
the molecules producing different lines of the same spectrum have not
necessarily the same mass.      We nevertheless hesitate to ascribe the
smaller apparent velocity derived from     = 4925 to this reason.
                                                           A.         This
line, as has been mentioned,      one component of
                                              is        double line, and        a

refrangible component of the doublet would be considered to be the
least refrangible edge of the doublet  but near the centre of the spark
                                                     ;
the   lightweaker, and the lines, owing to the motion of the wheel,
              is
ure drawn out towards the violet.   The most intense portion of the
image will here be that part where the two lines are superposed, and
in   wishing to set the cross           v.   ire on the edge of the line, we should be

334               Messrs. A. Schuster and G. Hemsalech.
tempted to set it on the edge of the most refrangible component.
There is reason to believe that this is the cause of the greater
deflection    of the double line, and the photographs show some signs
that if this source of error is eliminated,    the molecule giving out
the double     line moves more quickly than that giving rise to the
triplet.     We reserve the decision of this point until we have been able
to apply greater dispersion.
   Comparing the sparks obtained with different capacities, it is found
that when the spark gap is small, there seems a very curious diminuim
of velocity as the capacity increases ; this is not what should have been
expected at first sight, as with the large number of jars we should
expect higher temperatures, and therefore greater velocity of diffusion.
When the spark gap is 1 cm., the experiments do not reveal any
marked change due to capacity.      When the gap is increased still
further the sparks become very irregular and unsteady, and no certain
conclusions  can be drawn from our measurements ; the numbers marked
with a query are specially doubtful. When six jars are used practically
identical numbers are obtained for all sparking distances, but with
small capacity the centimetre spark seems to give a lower result than
in the two other cases. While we should not like at present to con
sider this as an established result, the table serves to show that the
centimetre spark and the highest capacity used gives the most con
sistent numbers, and our experiments with other metals were all made
under these conditions,except in the case of bismuth, where clearer
spectra were obtained with only two jars.
  Comparing different metals with each other, we find in the first place
that those having comparatively      low atomic weights,    viz.,    aluminium
and magnesium, have higher molecular velocities.     With magnesium
the metal vapour is scattered about to such an extent that no measure
ments could be made, but the average velocity of the aluminium mole
cule was fomid to be over three times as great as that of zinc, the
numbers   not laying any claim to accuracy.       Comparing zinc and
cadmium with each other, we obtain almost identical number's, both
for the corresponding doublet and triplets.
   Bismuth gave remarkable results. In spite of its high atomic weight
some of the lines are but little displaced, indicating an average mole
cular  velocity of 1420 metres/second.  For other lines            the velocity
falls down to that of zinc and cadmium, while one line       (A.    = 3793) has
a  still smaller velocity.
    We have not obtained satisfactory results with mercury          the best
                                                                     ;
 were those in which poles used were of zinc or cadmium, which were
 covered with amalgam.        Differences in molecular velocities were ob
 tained for different lines, but the result here     not so certain as with
                                                    is
 bismuth.      There  isobviously no simple law connecting these velocities
 with the atomic weight.

                       The Constitution           of the Electric Spark.                   335
  Dr. Feddersen was led through his researches to the conclusion that
the metallic particles after being once torn off from the electrodes by
the discharge took no further part in                 it,
                                       but were thrown irregularly into
the space surrounding the electrodes quite independently of the electric
current.    Although in some cases, and especially with magnesium
poles, there    some evidence that this
                  is                      partly true, we are led to take
                                                        is
the  following modified view of the matter.
   The initial discharge of the jar takes place through the air               must;   it
do so because there      at first no metallic vapour present.
                           is                                          The intense
heat generated by the electric current volatilises the metal, which then
begins to diffuse away from the poles             the subsequent oscillations of
                                                            ;
the discharge    take place through    the  metallic vapours and not through
the air.    We find confirmation of this view in             striking experiment
                                                                        a
which   is  easily repeated.       a coil of wire be inserted in the spark
                                        If
circuit of   a Leyden jar, which may be charged either by a Wimshurst
machine or an induction coil, the air lines disappear almost completely,
the metallic lines alone remaining.        According to our view we should
explain the experiment by saying that the coil which adds self-induc
tion lengthens the duration of the discharge, and allows time for the
metallic molecules to diffuse properly into the spark gap.                    great   A
part of the energy of the current may then do useful work by heating
up the metallic molecules instead of those of air.             Mr. Hemsalech                is
at present engaged in investigating the changes in the metallic spectra
which accompany the insertion of self-induction.
    The first spark passing through the air will give rise to                sound    a
wave which, during     the complete    time  of  the  discharge,  will  only travel
a  few millimetres.    We may therefore consider that the mass of metal
lic vapours suddenly set free           driven by its own pressure into the
                                             is
partial vacuum formed by the heated air.            It would seem more correct
to liken the process to that of           gas under pressure flowing into
                                                  a                                          a
vacuum than to that of         pure thermal diffusion.
                                    a                         There      not much
                                                                             is
difference between these views, and we may take               that in our experi
                                                                        it
ment we have approximately measured the velocity of sound in the
metallic vapours.     This gives      relation between their temperature and
                                         a
density.    If we neglect    the  differences   in the ratio of specific heat we
find approximately
                                        V    = 80     n/T>,
where   T   the absolute temperature and
             is                            the vapour density referred
                                                                p
to hydrogen.    Thus for cadmium the average molecular velocity found
was 560, and substituting    = 56 we obtain
                                    p          = 2700, which seems  T                        a
possible value.  Hence we conclude that the molecule of cadmium in
the spark cannot have mass whicha       much smaller than that directly
                                                      is
determined near the boiling point  of the metal.
   In conclusion wc have also taken some photographs in which the slit

 336                  Proceedings   and List of Papers read.
 was directly focussed on the sensitive film without the interposition oi
 the prism.     The photographs show a straight image of the slit followed
 by   a number of curved        bands extending from       both   poles   into  the
spark gap.
    The straight image we consider to be the initial discharge through
air creating sufficient heat to fill the space with vapour through which
 the oscillating discharges may then pass.            Our experiments point to
 the  fact that  the   periodic time  was  rather  too small in our experiments
 to give the best results.       The metallic molecule before it has had time
to reach through a sufficient          distance   was possibly affected in its
motion by the subsequent oscillation.           We hope to remedy this defect
by introducing still higher capacities          than those used. Our experi
ments allow us to give the following approximate                numerical data.
The air rendered luminous by the first discharge remains luminous for
a time of about 5 x 10~7 second, the metallic vapours then begin to
diffuse and reach the centre of the spark (the gap being 1 cm. long) in
a time which in the case of cadmium was about 6 x 10~6 second.                 The
periodic   time   of  the oscillations  with  our six jars and  a circuit  possess
ing as little self-induction as possible was about 2 x 10~6 second. The
metallic vapours remain luminous in the centre of the spark for a
longer period than near the poles, the duration of the time during
which some luminosity can be traced with a discharge from six Leyden
jars is about   1-5 x 10~6 second.

                                         (Abstract.)
    It has   long been known that iron which has been overstrained in
tension   —   that is to say, strained beyond the yield-point, so that it
suf0rs a permanent stretch — possesses very different elastic properties
from the same iron in its primitive condition.                   The material is said to
     "               "
be     hardened        by stretching,* since the ultimate effect of such treat
ment is to raise the elastic limit, and reduce the ductility                         of the
material.
    More recently attention has been called to the fact that, primarily,
the result of tensile overstrain is to make iron assume a semi-plastic
state ; so     that the elastic limit instead of being raised by stretching is
first of   all lowered, it may be, to zero.t This plasticity may be shown by
applying a comparatively small load to a bar of iron or steel which
has just been overstrained             by the application and removal of a large
stretching load.           When the small load is put on, the har will be found
to elongate further than it would had the material been in its primitive
state   ; and a slight continued elongation              — a " creeping " — may occur
after the small load has been applied.                   If  this load     be  withdrawn    a
quite     appreciable permanent, or semi-permanent, set will be fouud to
have been produced ; a set which diminishes                       slightly and, if small,
may vanish        provided time be allowed for backward creeping to take
effect.     It may also be shown that if the reapplied load be increased
the elongation produced will increase in a greater proportion.                         Thus
if a stress-strain curve be obtained from a recently overstrained bar of
iron or steel, it will show even for small loads a marked falling away
from the straight line which would indicate obedience to Hooke's law.
     It is the recovery from this semi-plastic state induced by overstrain
 to a condition of perfect or nearly perfect elasticity, with raised elastic
 limit, that is referred to in the title of the paper of which this is an
 abstract.       Such recovery is known to be effected by mere lapse of
 time,} and the object of the experiments                   described in the paper and

summarised here, is to show the effect of moderate temperature, of
mechanical vibration, and of magnetic agitation on this slow return to
the elastic state ; and further to illustrate this recovery by means of
compression tests.    One section of the paper deals with the phenomenon
of hysteresis in the relation of extension to stress which is exhibited
in a marked degree by iron in the overstrained state. Incidentally
attention is called to subsidiary points of interest.
   The experiments were carried out in the Engineering Laboratory of
Cambridge University, and were the outcome of suggestions by Pro
fessor Ewing.    It was on his suggestion that the effect of moderate
temperature   on  recovery from overstrain was tried, and the result of
that trial led to much of the work incorporated in the paper.
   The straining and testing were done by means of the laboratory 50-
ton testing machine, the specimens employed for the most part being
taken from steel rods one inch in diameter, of a quality which may be
described as semi-mild.    The small strains of extension were measured
by Professor Ewing's extensometer.*
   After referring to the apparatus and the material employed, and
describing the method of experimenting, there are first given in the
paper examples of the slow recovery of elasticity with lapse of time.
These examples are illustrated by stress-strain curves obtained, at
succeeding intervals of time, from extensometer readings similar to
those tabulated by Professor Ewing in his paper, referred to above,
" On Measurements of Small Strains in the Testing of Materials and
Structures." Kecovery is shown to be at first comparatively rapid ;
but latterly very slow progress is made, and weeks or montha may be
required before an approximately perfect restoration of elasticity is
effected.  When this is brought about, the specimen may be subjected
to a stress   few tons per square inch higher than that at which
               a
the virgin material yielded, before a yield-point is passed and the
materia] once more brought into a semi-plastic state.    If sufficient
time be allowed    to elapse after passing this second yield-point,              an
elastic state will again be assumed, and a third yield-point may                 be
obtained about as far above the second yield-point as the second               was
above the first.   In this manner four or five yield-points may                  be
obtained with the same specimen before fracture occurs.  A specimen
broken in this manner shows greater ultimate strength, but less ulti
mate elongation   than would have been obtained had fracture been
brought about in the usual fashion, that              is,
                                             without allowing inter
mediate recoveries of elasticity to take place.
Reference might also be mude to Lord Kelvin's discovery of the effect of a Sunday's
rest on wires which had been subjected to torsional vibrations throughout the pre
ceding week.

                            On the Recovery   of Iron from Overstrain.                         339
  The question                  of elasticity under stress is next con
                              of recovery
sidered in the paper, and it is shown that the process of recovery pro
ceeds at practically the same rate whether the material is kept stressed
or isallowed to rest free from load. A slight difference, however, is
shown in the two cases, as restoration of elasticity takes place about
the position of continued stress.
   Alter this, the phenomenon of hysteresis in the relation of extension
to stress is considered,              and a closed    cycle is shown, having features
analogous to those exhibited by a magnetic hysteresis cycle.*
  The effect of moderate temperature on recovery from overstrain                                 is
next treated of, and it is shown that a slight increase in temperature
hastens the restoration of elasticity to a remarkable extent.  Three or
four minutes at 100° C. proved to be more efficient than a fortnight's
rest at the normal atmospheric     temperature.   The effect of various
temperatures                   is then investigated, and so moderate a
                            below   100° C.
temperature as 50'' C. is shown to have a large influence in hastening
recovery from overstrain.   The manner in which recovery proceeds with
time when the specimen is kept at a constant temperature is shown in
the paper by means of curves. These curves show that at first — that                            is,
before        elasticity       is   fairly well restored — the amount            of   recovery,
measured by the diminution in the elongation produced by a maximum
load,    proportional to the square root of the time.
         is                                                For example, the
effect produced by, say, four minutes at 80° C. was approximately
double of that produced by one minute at the same temperature.
   By subjecting an overstrained specimen to temperatures above 100°
C, no effect (other than the recovery from the temporary effect of over
strain) was found to be produced until        red heat was almost attained.

    by means of compression tests. The lowering of the compression yield-

        The organism   which forms the subject of these investigations was
    isolated from clayey and gravelly soil, at a depth of about an inch
    below the surface.   It    straight, or slightly curved bacillus
                               is   a                                of
                                                                     rather
    large size, measuring 3-4 — 7-7/* x 1*2 — 1*5/*, and occurs either       as
    isolated rods or in the form of long chains.    Its peculiar interest   lies
    in the fact of its marked predilection for acid media, and its behaviour
    in the presence of carbohydrates.     It also offers peculiar advan0ges
    for the study, by direct observation in hanging drops, of the formation
    and germination of the spores, the formation of gelatinous sheaths, the
    co-existence of motile and non-motile stages, and the rejuvenescence      of
    so-called involution forms, the former process especially being very
    rapid under suitable conditions.
       The organism forms on solid, acid media, such as saccharose-gelatine,
    large, domed, translucent drops, consisting of chains of rods provided
    with thick, firm, and gelatinous sheaths. The latter character           is
    exhibited only in media containing carbohydrates, especially cane sugar   ;
    in media devoid of carbohydrates the colonies are slimy rather than
    gelatinous, and consist of almost naked rods and chains.     Moreover,
    even in the presence of sugar, the formation of an investing sheath      is
    largely dependent upon the age of the culture, the vigour          the
                                                                      of

   material,   and the degree of condensation of the medium.         Thus if a
   gelatine culture becomes liquefied, either by the normal liquefying
   action of the bacillus itself, or by the addition of water, the sheath
   gradually dissolves, and the colonies disintegrate into flocculent masses
   of rods possessing only very thin sheaths.          In liquid cultures the
   rods are   practically non-capsuled   from the beginning, and the same is
   true of cultures    on solid,  saccharine media, if the material used has
   been  previously attenuated by being subjected to temperatures below
   15° C.    As has been said, the organism slowly liquefies sugar-gelatine ;
   on peptone-gelatine the same effect is produced, but more rapidly.        In
   neutral media growth is extremely slow, even under the most favour
  able conditions otherwise.
      The growing organism is somewhat intolerant of low temperatures,
  and very susceptible to changes of temperature, a variation of two or
  three degrees exercising a very marked effect upon the rate of growth.
  It is probable that the minimum temperature for growth is in the neigh
  bourhood of 10° C, and the maximum about 35° C.            At a temperature
  of 22° C, growth is rather slow as compared with some other species,
  notably B. subtilis, Ehr.      The spores are able to withstand a tempera
  ture of 100° C. maintained for five minutes.         Although the organism
  is normally aerobic, growth occurs with almost equal vigour in vacuo
  or in pure hydrogen as in air, provided that vigorous material is used,
  and that both the medium and the temperature are favourable.            It is
  therefore a facultative anaerobe.
     When growing directly on the surface of the gelatine, the colonies
  tend to take the form of coiled and twisted strands, composed of long,
 parallel, septate filaments.
     In' milk, the organism        produces   peptonisation  and an alkaline
 reaction, but without coagulation.        On potato the growth is spreading,
 whitish and slimy or -viscous,     and  consists of non-capsuled rods. Later
 it becomes dry and cheesy, and eventually distinctly yellow in colour.
     On agar, whether in the presence of sugar or peptone, flat, circular,
 cheesy colonies are produced, which are tawny in colour, and emit a
 strong odour resembling melted glue.
     Spores are produced abundantly on various media, the time required
 varying from twenty-two to seventy hours, according to the medium
 and    the temperature.      Spore-formation    proper is preceded by peri
pheral condensation of the cytoplasm on the walls of the rod, leaving
one or two large central vacuoles.          The bulk of the cytoplasm then
collects at one end of the rod, minute portions being left behind as a
thin, irregular lining on the walls, and on the septum dividing the rod
from its neighbour.         The distal portion of the cytoplasm then con
denses,    and finally forms an oval spore, occupying an oblique position
in one end of the rod, and measuring 2 — 2-8/x x 0-8 — 1//.         It escapes
by the dissolution of the thinner portion of tho wall.              The- spore
                                                                 2 D 2

  342    A  Soil Bacillus of the Type of Dc Barfs       Vi. megatherium.
  germinates at one end in a direction parallel to the longer axis.       The
  subsequent growth of the chains is intercalary as well as terminal.
  The rate of growth was obtained by taking consecutive measurements
  of vigorous rods or chains, and noting the time required for the original
  length to double.     This time, according to the terminology suggested
  by Marshall Ward, is known as the
                                           " doubling period." In this case
  the doubling period in saccharose-broth at 22-5 °C. is forty-eight minutes,
 at 19-5 — 20-5°C, 120 minutes.       The slow growth of this organism at
 these temperatures, and its sensitiveness to slight changes of tempera
 ture, are well illustrated by these and similar observations.
     When united in long chains the organism is non-motile, but rods
 and short chains freshly produced from spores or involution-forms in
 liquid media exhibit active motility, especially at temperatures between
 23° C. and 33° C.        This consists of progressive, undulating, and
 rotary motions, and may last for several hours.            It is confined to
 isolated rods, and to chains of not more than three to six individuals.
 Progressive motion is never observable in chains of more than three
united rods.
    Involution-forms are produced commonly in old cultures, or in
cultures made at low temperatures.            They consist of enormously
swollen, fusiform, or drum-stick bodies, the contents of which are com
posed of coarsely granular cytoplasm and numbers of oily globules.
In some cases the cytoplasm is found to have undergone plasmolvsis,
but if this has not gone too far, the involution forms are able to
develop into normal rods if transferred to a suitable environment.
The organism is non-pathogenic, produces no pigment or evolution of
gas, and stains readily with carbol-fuchsine, aniline-gentian-violet, or by
Gram's method.
    In conclusion   it may be said that this bacillus presents many points
of resemblance to certain well-known species, but at present it may be
impossible to refer it accurately.         From B. aerophtius, Lib., it is
distinguished by its facultative anaerobism, its colour, its mode of lique
faction, &c. ; from B. subtilis, Ehr., B. viilgalus (Fliigge), Wig., and
B. mesenterial* (Fliigge), Lehm. andNeum., by various minor characters.
The description of Russell's B. granulosus is not sufficiently detailed to
make an accurate comparison possible.          That it is closely allied to
De Bary's B. megatlierinm is very evident, and it is quite possible that
prolonged investigation of the two forms side by side may prove them
to be identical.    In that case added interest will attach to my investiga
tions, in the way of showing the remarkable variations which may be
produced within the limits of a single species, by different methods of
treatment, De Bary's form being nearly twice as thick as this one.

     One of us (StC. T.) has had under his care for some years a young
woman      who has suffered from continuous dripping from the nose. The
ease    has not been amenable to any treatment.        At first it was thought
to be one of nasal     hydrorrhcea,   but certain  characters in the affection
convinced the observer that this could not be so, and that the fluid,
which dropped from one nostril only, was cerebro-spinal fluid.             This
was supported by the results of the chemical examination of the fluid.
The escape of cerebro-spinal fluid from the noso has long been known
 to follow traumatic injury to the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone,
 but the possibility of its spontaneous escape from the nose does not

  appear to have been fully established before the present instance.
   However, considerable research into the literature of the subject has
  shown that there are       several cases recorded in which, though no history
  of injury existed, the     flow of fluid from the nose was of such a character
   that they must have       been similar to the present case, although in the
   majority of instances     the true nature of the fluid escaped observation.
      Many of these patients exhibited cerebral symptoms in the course
  of the disease, and some ultimately died from inflammation of the cere
  bral meninges, which had probably spread from the nose through some
  opening in the bony lamina that normally separates the cranial and
  nasal cavities.   The full clinical details of this rare case and of the
  similar ones just referred to are, however, reserved for publication else
  where.    The present paper is concerned only with the composition of
  the fluid and the variations it presents under different circumstances.
                                 Characters  of the Fluid.
      Our opportunities for examining the fluid chemically have been fairly
  frequent. The fluid was always collected in sterilised glass vessels,
  and the examination made as soon as possible by one of us (W. D. II.)
  at King's College, London.
      The fluid is perfectly clear and colourless, looking like water ; its re
  action is faintly alkaline ; its specific gravity is about 1005. On micro
  scopic examination      it shows no cells or other deposit. It gives no
  precipitate with acetic acid. It contains a trace of proteid, coagulable
  by heat, but the quantity is too small to give more than an opalescence.
  In another portion of the fluid it was ascertained that this proteid is
  precipitable by saturation with magnesium sulphate ; it is therefore a
' globulin.    Albumin and other proteids are absent.
      The fluid contains a substance which reduces Fehling's solution.
  A portion of the fluid was treated with excess of acidified alcohol ; the
  proteid so precipitated was filtered off. The filtrate was evaporated to
  dryness over a water bath ; the dry residue was taken up with alcohol.
  filtered, and again evaporated to dryness.                 Part was evaporated to
  dryness on a glass slide; the residue examined microscopically was
  seen to contain the needle-like crystals, occurring singly and in bundles,
  similar to those previously described and figured by one of us
  (W. D. H)* as obtainable from cerebrospinal fluid. The residue had
  also the characteristic      pungent taste of pyrocatechin.
      The remainder of the dry residue was dissolved in water and filtered.
  The filtrate reduces Fehling's solution well, but it does not ferment
  with yeast, nor does it give any osazone crystals on treatment with
  phenylhydrazine hydrochloride and sodium acetate.                  Control experi
  ments with a weak solution of dextrose, which gave about the same

               The Cerebrospinal        Fluid in   the  Human Subject.        345
amount of reduction with Fehling's solution, gave both these tests in a
typical way.
   The fluid was tested for creatinine with negative results.
   The same results relative to the reducing substance have been
obtained over and over again in various specimens of this fluid. They
agree with the observations of nearly all writers on the cerebro-spinal
fluid, but differ from those of Nawratski,* who in a recent paper has
affirmed, principally from observations on the cerebro-spinal fluid of the
calf, that the reducing substance present is dextrose.
   The principal points to be noticed in the properties of the fluid
which lead to the conclusion that it is cerebro-spinal fluid are the
following :—
   (1)   Its clear, watery character.
   (2)   Its low specific gravity.
   (3)   The small amount of proteid in it and the absence of albumin.
   (4)   The presence in it of a substance which reduces Fehling's solu
           tion, but is not dextrose.       It is possibly a substance related to
           pyrocatechin.
   In   comparison with this fluid, we examined also the secretion in some
cases    of true nasal hydrorrhcea.          This fluid is opalescent, somewhat
viscid, and on microscopic examination shows amorphous matter with
mucous corpuscles.         It gives with acetic acid a precipitate of mucinoid
nature.     It sometimes does and sometimes does not contain a reducing
substance, and this substance when present is sugar.
   A quantitative analysis of one of these nasal fluids showed that the
percentage of solids, especially organic solids, is higher than in cerebro
spinal fluid.    The results of the analysis are as follows :—

    Our observations on the characters of the cerebro-spinal fluid were
followed by others in which we sought to answer the following ques
tions : —
    The rate of flow.
    The difference of composition at different times of the day.
    The influence of straining, posture, and abdominal compression on
       the flow and composition of the fluid.
    The effect on blood pressure of intra-venous injection of the fluid in
       animals.

                                 The Rate of Flow.
    One portion, collected by the patient herself in the course of an hour,
measured 4 c.c.       Another portion, collected under the supervision of
one of us (StC. T.) in ten minutes, measured 3-9 c.c.
   If the first portion is taken as a measure of the rate of secretion, the
amount formed in the day will be 96 c.c. Taking, however, the second
observation as being more accurate, the amount formed in the twenty-
four hours will     be over half   a litre (561-6 c.c.).    It  is possible that this
estimate is too high, as doubtless the patient, being under the observa
tion of a physician, would be somewhat excited, and the consequent
alteration of the circulation would, as we shall immediately see, cause
the flow to become more abundant.
                 Comjxirison of  the Morning and Evening Fluid.
   Cavazzani,* from experiments on dogs, found that the cerebrc-spinal
fluid collected in the morning was more alkaline than in the evening,
and contained more solid residue.            He considers that this is related to
the activity of the nervous system, and that it confirms Obersteiner's
theory of sleep. He obtained corresponding results in the case of a
man with traumatic fistula of the frontal bone.
   We considered it worth while to repeat this observation.
   The qualitative examination of the fluid collected first thing on
several mornings gave the same results as that of specimens collected
the last thing in the evening.             Both were distinctly alkaline, but no
estimation of the relative alkalinity was made.                 The following table
gives   in percentages   the results    of  the  quantitative  analyses : —
                                          Morning fluid.     Evening fluid.
                Water                         99-004              99-027
                Solids                          0-996              0-973
                  Organic solids                0-118              0-100
                  Inorganic solids      ...     0-878              0-873
    The evening fluid is thus slightly poorer in both classes of consti
tuents than that of the morning ; the difference is chiefly due to an
alteration in the organic solids.            This is just what we should expect,
as the decreased capillary pressure during sleep would lessen the rate
of exudation of water.       Without committing ourselves to any theory
on nervous activity or sleep, we may say that our experiments confirm
those of Cavazzani.

 The Influenee         of Straining and Posture on      the   Flow and   Composition    of   the
                                          Fluid.
     In     a monograph       on the cerebral     circulation* one of us (L. H.) put
forward         the view that the rate of secretion of the cerebro-spinal fluid,
when the          cranio-vertebral cavity is opened, depends directly on the
difference between   the pressure in the cerebral capillaries and that
of the atmosphere.     At the same time it was shown that cerebral
capillary pressure varies directly and absolutely with vena cava pres
sure..  Thus the cerebral capillary pressure can be raised with great
ease  by any agency which causes a rise of pressure in the vena cava or
cerebral veins.   On the other hand, cerebral capillary pressure varies
directly,  but  only proportionately, with aortic pressure, for between
the aorta and the capillaries there lies the peripheral resistance.
   It follows from the above that the easiest methods of raising the
cerebral capillary pressure in man are :—
     (a)    By compression of the abdomen.
     (b)    By the assumption of the horizontal posture.                   In this position,
                however, the rise of venous pressure may be compensated by
                the fall of arterial pressure, which normally occurs when the
              body is at rest. This is, no doubt, the case during sleep. .
      (e)   By straining or forced expiratory effort, with the glottis closed.
     By all these methods the vena cava pressure                  is   considerably    raised  ;
and  by the last method the venous inlets into the thorax may be com
pletely blocked, and the pressure in the cerebral capillaries raised to
something like aortic pressure.
  It true that by such a forced expiratory effort the aortic pressure
           is
is lowered.    Nevertheless, the total effect on capillary pressure                       is   a
very great rise, for     fall of aortic pressure of 25 mm. of mercury
                                  a
produces     fall in cerebral capillary pressure of less than
                 a                                               mm. of          5
mercury, while      rise of vena cava pressure of 25 mm. of mercury
                         a
produces    riseaof cerebral  capillary pressure of 25 mm. Hg.
     The present                   unique opportunity of testing the cor
                          case gave us a
rectness of these views on the living human subject, and our experiments
entirely confirm them. As will be seen from the following figures, the
flow of cerebro-spinal   fluid     accelerated by all those circumstances
                                         is
which raise the cerebral capillary pressure.     The increase in flow                          is,
moreover, accompanied by a decrease in the percentage of solid
matter.
     The experiments           were conducted under the supervision of two of us
(StC. T.         and     L.   H.); the chemical investigation of the fluid was
performed,           as before,   by the third (W. D. H.).

   1.  Patient sitting quietly without            straining.      In   five  minutes
23 minims (1-357 c.c.) were collected.
   2. Patient sitting and straining.              In    five   minutes    35 minims
(1-965 c.c.) were collected.
   3.  Patient sitting quietly.       In  five successive minutes       the amounts
collected    were, respectively,     8, 7, 5, 5, 5 drops.      The total measured
19  minims (1-021 c.c.).
   4. Subsequent    to this, five minutes were occupied by the patient in
straining, and the amounts collected in consecutive minutes were 12,
10, 8, 9, and 10 drops respectively.            The total measured 33 minims
(1-947 c.c.).
   5. Patient lying down and not straining.              The drops fell as follows
in five consecutive minutes — 9, 6, 5, 5, and 5, and the total measured
27 minims (1-593 c.c.).        Here the arterial pressure was probably not
decreased owing to mental excitement, while the cerebral venous pres
sure was increased.
   6.  Patient lying flat on the stomach and head hanging over the end
of  a sofa.    The drops fell as follows in five consecutive minutes, 8, 7,
6, 7, and 7.    The total measured 28 minims (1-652 c.c.).
   7. Finally, after the last experiment,            the following was collected
during quiet dropping, while the patient was sitting with the head
forward. The drops fell as follows : — 5, 4, 4, 4, and 4, in five successive
minutes ; and the total measured 15 minims (0-885 c.c.).
   The following is the report on the chemical examination of the
fluids : — '
   So far as the small quantities available admit of analysis, the fluids
are the same      qualitatively.     The liquid which escaped passively, and
that which passed under straining, both contained a small quantity of
organic and inorganic solids. Among the organic substances present
are the reducing substance and a trace of proteid.                   Judged by the
amount of precipitate produced by alcohol in equal amounts of the
two fluids, the proteid is less abundant in the fluid passed during
straining, but the amount is too small to weigh.
   Determination of the total solids gave the following results, expressed
in percentages : —
   A. The fluid passed passively, Tl per cent.
   B. The fluid passed during straining, 0-43 per cent.
Even the higher of these numbers is less than in cases of ccrebro-spinal
fluid from meningocele and hydrocephalus, previously recorded by one
of us (W. D. H.).*
   In addition to the foregoing, two specimens were collected at home
by the patient herself. Analysis of these gave the following results :—
   A. Fluid collected while patient was sitting upright quietly.                The
           percentage of solids was      I'l1.

      B.  Fluid collected while        she was lying down.              The percentage of
             solids was T03.
      The effect of the horizontal posture is in the same direction, though
   not so marked as the effect of straining.                    This is what was to be
   expected, for the horizontal posture would not raise the venous, and
   thus the cerebral,      capillary pressure so much as powerful expiratory
  efforts   would.    Moreover, the arterial pressure falls during quiet rest
  in the recumbent      posture, as one of us has determined               (L. H.).*
     In order to note the   effects of straining on the retinal circulation, Mr. Vernon
  Cargill  was  asked to   examine   the patient, and he kindly reported as follows :—
  "
    I noticed that when a straining effort was mads, a decided but transitory narrow
  ing of the retinal arteries on and adjacent to the disc, and also a marked pulsation
  in the trunks of the retinal reins occurred."
     The transitory narrowing of the arteries points to the temporary lowering of the
 aortic pressure, while the pulsation of the veins is a sign of the capillary engorge
 ment due to venous congestion.
                   Experiments made with Abdominal               Compression.
     These     experiments       were made in order to complete and confirm
 those     just recorded.        The patient was seated, and the abdomen was
 compressed as firmly and evenly as possible by one of us (StC. T.),
 spreading both hands over the front of the abdomen.                        The number of
 drops per minute were counted as before, and periods of compression
 lasting five minutes were alternated with periods of the same duration,
 during which the patient was sitting quietly.
     The following table gives the results succinctly : —

Abdominal compression raises the vena cava pressure, and so leads to
increased cerebral capillary pressure, and in this way to increase in the
volume of the cerebro-spinal fluid secreted.                   Increase of volume, a*

contains a toxic substance, choline, doubtless derived from the dis
integration of lecithin in the brain.                 Injection of such fluid into the
jugular vein of animals (dogs, cats, rabbits), anaesthetised with                     ether,

cardiac in origin, but principally due to the local action of the                   poison
on the neuro-muscular            apparatus of the peripheral        vessels, especially   in
the splanchnic         area.*

similar way.          Quantities varying from 7 to 10 c.c. were injected into
the circulation in dogs, but with entirely negative results.                       Such a
quantity in the case of fluid from a general paralytic would be quit*
sufficient to cause a marked fall of arterial pressure.
    Similar negative results, both as regards blood pressure and respira

              Crystallised Normal Sulphates of Rubidium, i?r.              ool
The employment of the compensated method has proved highly suc
cessful, extremely concordant results being afforded with crystals not
necessarily more than 5 mm. thick.          The twenty-nine different parallel-
faced crystal-blocks employed varied in thickness from 4-8 to 107 mm.
The main conclusions from the work are given in the following
summary.
    The coefficients of cubical expansion exhibit a progression, corre
sponding to the progression of the atomic weights of the three respective
metals.      This is true of both the constants a and b in the general ex
pression for the coefficient of cubical expansion, a = a + 2bt, for any
temperature f. The actual values are shown in the following table : —
                                     o.                    b.

    The order of progression of the two constants is inverted ; a, the
coefficient for 0°, diminishes with increasing atomic weight of the metal,
 while b, half the increment of the coefficient per degree of temperature,
increases.     Consequently, the coefficients of cubical expansion of the
 three salts converge, with rise of temperature, and attain equality in
 pairs.    Identity is attained for potassium and rubidium sulphates at
 114°, for potassium and caesium sulphates at 136°, and for rubidium
and caesium sulphates at 168°.         At 136° equality for all three is only
 deviated from by one unit in five hundred.          Beyond the temperature
 of identity divergence occurs, and an increase of atomic weight is now
 accompanied by an increase of expansion.
     The   thermal   deformation is of the nature of an expansion in all
 directions   in the crystals of all three sulphates.
     The differences between the coefficients of linear expansion along
 the three axial directions of any one salt, although only amounting to
 one-eighth of the total coefficient, are large compared with the differ
 ences between the values for the same direction of the three salts.
  This, together with the fact that the replacement of one metal by
  another is accompanied by considerable modifications of the relations of
  two of the three values for the original salt, those corresponding to the
  axes a and c, prevent the coefficients of linear expansion for any one
  direction of the three salts from exhibiting any progression correspond
  ing to that of the atomic weights       of the three  metals.    These direc
  tional perturbations are, however, mutually compensative, so that the
  effect of interchange of the metals is clearly exhibited by the solid
  deformation, the cubical expansion, in the progressive manner already
  indicated.
      The increment of the linear coefficient of expansion along the axis c
  of  each salt is about twice as large as the increments for the other two

directions,          for which latter the increments are nearly equal.
                 a and       b,
This is analogous to the optical behaviour, the refractive power being
altered (diminished) by rise of temperature much more in the direction
of the axis c than in the other two directions, in which the lesser
amounts of change are nearly equal.
   The amount of expansion along the direction of the axis b is approxi
mately identical for all three sulphates, indicating that interchange of
the metals is without influence on the thermal behaviour along this
axis.  The crystals of all three salts expand least in this direction,
which      is,
           therefore, the common minimum axis of the thermal
ellipsoid.

maximum and intermediate   axes of the thermal ellipsoid for rubidium
sulphate, compared with their directions in the potassium and ca;sium
salts.  The maximum thermal axis         for the two latter salts, but

rubidium sulphate.     The maximum thermal axis       identical with the     is
first median line in all three salts.
   At high temperatures the same relations continue to hold for the
potassium and caesium salts, both thermally and optically.    But owing
to the increment of expansion along being so much greater than for
                                                        c
the other directions, the intermediate expansion along for rubidium               c
sulphate attains equality at 50° with the expansion along a, and beyond
this temperature     becomes the maximum thermal axis for this salt, as
                         c
it    for the other two sulphates.
     is                              Consequently, at 50° the crystals                                of
rubidium sulphate are apparently thermally uniaxial. At tempera
tures varying 10° each side of 50° for different wave-lengths         light,              of
they have previously    been shown  to  simulate  uniaxial  optical proper
ties.   The thermal and optical ellipsoids of revolution are not, how
ever, identically orientated, the axis of the former being      and      the       b         of
latter a. Further, the change of direction of the maximum thermal
axis of rubidium sulphate from      to     followed optically at 180°

and consequently       the progression is undisturbed by the modification
of the    directional differences for the same salt, which are relatively so
much      more important in the case of the thermal constants.
  The net effect of the replacement of one metal by another has, how
ever, been shown to be clearly demonstrated by the progression of the
coefficients of the cubical expansion and their increments.
      The final conclusion         of the investigation, therefore,                  is that   :
   The thermal deformation constants of the crystals of the normal sulphate!;
of potassium, rubidium, and cassium exhibit variations which, in common with
the   morphological,     optical, and other physical properties previously investigated,
follow the order       of progression of the         atomic weights      of   the   alkali   metals which
the   sails contain.

        December 12, 1898,— Bead February 16, 1899.
  The following experiments were made during the months of May,
June, and July, 1897, in the Physiological Laboratory of Leipzig,
under  the guidance of Professors Hering and v. Frey, to test whether
in the frog, reflex electrical changes could bo demonstrated   at the
central   end—

                                III.     Of posterior roots alone.
   As regards the first two heads, the end in view was simply the actual
verification of an extremely probable phenomenon, preparatory to an
examination of the third head, viz., reflex electrical effects propagated
down the posterior roots, which, in 1891,* were pointed out by Gotch
and Horsley, and offered as proof of the passage of centrifugal nerve
impulses in normally afferent nerve channels.     The results obtained in
the present experiments being somewhat difficult to interpret, the notes
were laid aside until opportunity should offer for carrying the investi
gation further.   Professor Bernstein having, however, quite recentlyt
discussed the question of the reflex negative variation of the nerve
current, the moment seemed opportune for submitting these results
as they stand to the attention of those interested in the subject.
   The galvanometer   used was on the lines of Thomson's reflecting
instrument,   with modifications  by Carpentier.       The leading-off

   current of injury was compensated in the usual way. In the exciting
   circuit, the Du Bois Reymond induction coil was supplied by a single
   Daniell cell, the stimulating electrodes were of platinum wire, and hail
   an extra loop of wire (Hering's pattern) to guard against unipolar
   effects.
      Frogs of the Esculenta species were used ; they were cooled, i.e., kept
   for six or seven days on ice to ensure a high degree of excitability.
   The frog was prepared with as little loss of blood as possible, the brain
   above the medulla being destroyed by insertion of a small peg of wood.
   For experiments under head I, the frog having been firmly secured,
   the two sciatics were exposed, cut at the knee-joint, and isolated in
   their full extent.    The nerve of one side was then raised, supported by
   a glass hook, and connected at transverse and longitudinal surfaces
   with the galvanometer electrodes — the hook was so arranged as to
   obviate any possible shifting of contacts.     The sciatic of the opposite
   side was then also raised, and its lower end laid across the stimulating
   electrodes.   In one or two preliminary experiments, one branch only
   of the sciatic was divided at the knee and led oft' to the galvano
   meter, the other branch being left in connection with its muscles to
   serve as a control ; under these conditions, on stimulating the sciatic of
   the opposite side, the electrical and muscular effects corresponded,  both
   sometimes failing to appear.

    In experiments where the nerve roots were to be led off to the galva
nometer, the frog was always curarised.                A sciatic having then been
prepared as before for stimulation, its nerve roots (7th, 8th, and 9th
pairs), or the corresponding pairs of the opposite side, were exposed In-
opening up the lower part of the spinal column ; the roots were then
carefully separated and those to be led off to the galvanometer were
cut   as far as   possible from      the cord (just above the ganglion, in             the
case of posterior      roots).    Two roots were usually taken together               and
their central ends connected with the brush electrodes.
   In cases where the bulb was stimulated, the brain and upper half of
the cord were exposed, and the brain cut off at the bulb. The cord
having then       been   severed from      its attachments,       was carefully    raised
and the bulb laid upon the stimulating electrodes.

   In these last nine experiments where the lead-off was from posterior
roots   the   deflection   had not       the characters      of a reflex    deflection —
viz.,  delay    and    exhaustibility ; the negative variation followed at
once on stimulation and could be repeated without the pause necessary
in the case of an ordinary reflex.             The same thing was also observed
on one occasion in the case of anterior roots (experiment of June 29).
In the remaining experiments III (3) where, the bulb being stimulated,
the posterior roots were led off to the galvanometer,                   this non-reflex
effect was observed in certainly two cases (June 29 and 30).

   No exact quantitative estimation of electrical effects was aimed at in
these experiments, but as a rough term of comparison, the negative
variation of a directly stimulated sciatic was occasionally noted, this
deflection was seldom less than 250° of the scale.                    The average effects
obtained in the six series of experiments              are given below.

     Throughout the experiments fallacies arising through induction were
 carefully guarded against, the negative variation was tested by re
 versing the direction of the stimulating current ; and as a final test for
 current escape    the led-off nerve was cut through with wet scissors in
 such a way that the severed ends remained in contact, though physiolo

           (From the Physiological Laboratory,   University College, London.)
     In   a paper communicated by one of us, in April last, to the Koyal
 Society,* a calorimeter was described for determining the heat emitted
 by man, which, on being tested, was found to give very reliable results.
 At the same time a short history was added of the various instruments
 used by physiologists to estimate the heat given out by man and
 animals; from that list was accidentally omitted the calorimeter of
 D'Arsonvnl.t
     This calorimeter consists of two cylindrical concentric vessels, with
 an air space between them, and standing in an annular groove full of
 water, thus making an air-tight joint.              The outer chamber (annular
 space) has a manometer connected with it which registers in a graphic
 way the variations of pressure in that chamber throughout the experi
 ment.      The subject of the experiment is enclosed in the inner chamber
into which fresh air is continually being drawn by means of a flue
 where a gas burner is kept alight.           The whole apparatus is suspended
from the ceiling by a pulley, and balanced with a weight. It might be
recollected that Marcet's calorimeter which we made use of, consists of
 a wooden chamber covered with felt inside and out, enclosing another
made of sheet copper, carefully polished inside, with an air space
between them.        The size of the inner chamber is sufficient to admit of
a person sitting down comfortably on a chair, with free elbow and head
room.       Two ventilators (agitators), worked by electric motors, con*
stantly mix up the air inside the calorimeter, while the air from one of
these ventilators impinges on a trough full of ice ; the water from the
melted ice is collected in a flask, and its temperature read at the end of
the experiment.
    Thermometers      with stems projecting above the chambers show the
temperature of the air in the copper chamber and the annular space,
and another gives the temperature of the copper walls ; these thermo
meters are divided into fiftieths of a degree centigrade.                 For further
particulars we beg      to  refer to the   original paper.     The    amount   of heat
evolved is easily calculated from the weight of ice melted, the tem
perature of the resulting water, and the change of temperature of the
chamber, the annular space, and the copper.

  gas, gave a figure (34,428 calories) almost identical with that found by
 Favre and Silbermann (34,462).
     After having used that instrument towards the estimation of the
 heat given out      in a state of rest,* it appeared to us of interest to apply
 it to the determination of the heat emitted under exercise, so as to
 obtain finally a figure for the mechanical energy of the human machine,
                                                        '
 or, as termed by Verdet in his book on the               Mechanical Theory of
 Heat,'t the economic coefficient of the human machine.
     In 1861 Helmholtz, making use of Edward Smith's experiments on
 the treadmill,       calculated by an ingenious mode of argument what
 ought to be the value of this coefficient.       He reasoned in the following
 wayj :— A man in a state of repose emits exactly, in one hour, the
 amount of heat that would be required theoretically to raise his body
 uphill to a height of 522 m., which he looks upon as a fair rate of
 climbing in one hour ; but, in order to accomplish this work, he would
 expire five times as much CO., as in the state of repose, and, therefore,
 produce five times as much heat, consequently the relation is 1 : 5, and
 therefore the economic coefficient would be 1/5.
     Following this mode of argument, it will be readily seen that the
 supposed subject of this experiment, taking as an average weight 65
kilos., would have to emit in the state of rest 80'2 cals. per hour,
because,     on multiplying 80-2 by 423 (the mechanical equivalent of
heat), the result would give 33,925 kilo.-metres ; on the other hand, a
 man weighing 65 kilos, while raising his body by 522 m., would effect
an    amount of work = 33,930 kilo.-metres.         Therefore the heat emitted
in a state     of     rest  in one hour would be exactly the          same    as the
theoretical heat necessary to raise the body 522 m. ; but as (according
to Helmholtz) Edward Smith says it is necessary to give out five
times more C02 than when at rest, to do that work, the coefficient will
be    1/5.
    This argument can be criticised as follows : —
    1. Most authors give a little over 100 cals. per hour as the mean
amount of heat emitted by a person in a state of repose, while, from
ninety-two experiments on three different persons, we found from
79-056 cals. to 137636 cals. with a mean of 102260 cals., these figures
being very far from 80-2, which are required to fit the present theory.
    2. An ascent of 522 m. (1712 feet) in an hour is more than anybody
can do going uphill ; such exercise might perhaps be kept up for a
minute or two, but the average height a man can ascend is usually put
down at 1000 feet per hour (perhaps 1200 feet).            It is difficult to say
what amount of air a man would breathe during such exercise, but it

  362       Dr. W. Marcet and Mr. R. B. Floris.       The Efficiency
   would probably happen that if a person could climb at the rate of
   522 m. per hour, as Smith did on the treadmill, then he would expire
   about five times as much CO, as in the state of repose ; there is no
  reference to the oxygen absorbed in addition to the carbonic acid
   expired.    From these considerations it will be understood how Helm-
   holtz obtained the figure accepted in a general way as the value of the
  efficiency of the human body, and which is close to the figure we have
  found.
      In order to determine   experimentally the heat given out under a
  definite exercise, and ascertain that utilised in the work done, a brake
  was used, being a modification of that known to engineers as Pronie's.
   This brake (see diagram) consists of an iron fly-wheel resting on an
  iron stand and worked by a handle projecting inside the calorimeter
  through a stuffing box ; a counter registers the number of revolutions
  throughout the experiment.      The wheel is brought into contact with a
  semicircle of hard wood in sections fastened to a strap ; by tightening
  this strap the semicircle of wood can be pressed more or less against
  the wheel, and thus the friction can be regulated.
     On    turning the wheel pressing against the wooden blocks, the
  tendency would be to give the blocks a revolving motion, but the force
  applied, instead of carrying them round and round, causes the wheel to
  slip over their surface, and in doing so to exert a degree of friction
  sufficient to raise a lever weighted at the end, and maintain it in a
  horizontal position as long as the wheel is rotated.
X

          of Man, or Economic Coefficient of       the  Human Machine.         863
    Therefore the power necessary to overcome the friction is exactly
 balanced by the weight at the end of the lever, and the work done will
 be a function of the weight multiplied by the length of the lever, or
may be expressed as the work done in raising the weight by means of
a cord wound round a drum, having for its radius the distance between
the suspension of the lever and the end of the beam where the weight
is hung.     It should be understood that the beam is balanced by a
 counterpoise before the weight is suspended to its extremity.
    The only objection that could be made to the use of this instrument
might be the friction to overcome on turning the wheel ; but there is no
appreciable friction, the wheel revolving on ball-bearings like those of
a bicycle.    The weight can be altered, and it will be readily found that
if a person works the wheel as hard as he can for a given time, by
doubling the weight at the end of the lever the number of revolutions
he can make in that same time will be half that registered with the
lighter weight.
    The experiment in the calorimeter is made as follows : —
    The subject is shut up in the chamber as usual, and there he remains
for thirty minutes quite quiet ; during that time the temperatures are
recorded, and the water from the melted ice is collected, thus the heat
given out in the state of repose is determined.            Then the person is let
out of the calorimeter, and the chamber left full open for its ventila
tion, and about twenty minutes later he returns into the chamber.               At
once the work of turning the handle begins,           to  be   continued for about
half an hour.     Then a rest is taken for another half hour inside the
calorimeter, and the experiment is over.
    By so doing the heat emitted in the state of rest is first determined ;
this is followed by the determination of the heat given out when at work
and   while the body is returning to its normal state of rest.            It might
be thought that the amount of work done had better be determined by
first working the wheel perfectly free and therefore effecting no work,
and then putting on the brake while the lever is weighted and doing a
certain amount of work ; the heat emitted in the first case would be
subtracted from that given out in the second.              This plan, however, is
not admissible, because, at any rate, no work can be done without
moving the arm, so that the arm is a necessary factor of the work.
    The first question was to ascertain whether the mean relation of the
oxygen absorbed under work to the calories emitted was the same as
the corresponding mean relation in the state of rest.            In order to settle
this point, the C02 emitted and 0 absorbed were determined while in
the calorimeter, together with the calories, both when sitting quiet and
during exercise, the relation at rest having been fully investigated in
our last paper and found to be 1 : 4-000.*
   * It was stated in the previous paper that Hirn had found that while sitting
 quiet, 1 gram of oxygen gave rise to a mean of 6-22 calories.

   Consequently the oxygen absorbed does not follow exactly the.
amount of heat produced ; but a number of experiments for separate
individuals show in each case means somewhat approximating each
other, though less obviously than in the state of rest.

   Therefore it will be readily seen that 1 gram of oxygen will give
rise to more heat in a state of rest (1 : 4-000) than under exercise
(1 : 3-246), and it cannot be admitted that the same mean amount of
heat is produced by a given weight of oxygen absorbed in repose and
under exercise ; Hirn observed a similar occurrence.     It may therefore
be concluded that the human body in the state of rest makes a more
efficient use of its oxygen than it does under exercise in the proportion
of about 4-000 : 3-246.
   The next, and perhaps most important subject for consideration, is
the efficiency or economic coefficient of the human machine.
   The efficiency of the body as a machine is the relation between the
theoretical heat corresponding    to the work done* and the actual
amount of heat that the body requires to do this work. According to
this definition the result sought for in our inquiries was obtained by
dividing the theoretical amount of heat necessary for the work done in
each experiment by the heat given out during the work, less the
normal heat emitted in the same time plus the theoretical heat neces
sary for the work.    This statement can be expressed in the form of a
formula.

                 = Efficiency of the human machine.
           T E   = Theoretical calories necessary for the work done,

   The weight suspended from the end of the lever forming part of the
brake was 485 grams, and knowing the length of the lever (48-275 cm.)
it was easy to calculate that each turn of the wheel performed an
invariable amount of work = T471 kilogram-metres.

    The fire tables include sixty-seven experiments, being all those made (seventy-
one in number) with the exception of four ; these, which were undertaken on four
consecutive days, when the work was resumed last autumn, yielded for the value
of the efficiency, at any rate in three coses, figures obviously much too high, and
 which have been omitted on that account; they were the following: — forE. E.,
04G2,    0-231, 0-384, 0-363.         These irregularities       are apparently     due to     some
accidental mis-estimation of the water from the melted ice.
   In every     case, as    will be readily       seen      from the foregoing tables, the
amount of heat emitted under exercise is largely in excess of that
given out in a state of rest during the same time ; this excess, in the
case of the five persons under experiment, amounted to

     Therefore the maximum mean efficiency was 0-193 in the case of the
woman from seven experiments, and the minimum mean efficiency was
0-174 for E. R. from seventeen experiments ; the general mean from
five different persons was 0'183.
     The general results obtained from this inquiry can be summarised as
follows : —
     (1) There is no fixed relation per individual experiment between the
oxygen absorbed under excercise and the corresponding heat emitted,
although the mean for each person somewhat approximates a constant
figure which is 1 to 3-246.            Considering that in the state of rest we
found the corresponding ratio to be 1 to 4-000, it may be concluded
that the oxygen is better utilised for the production of heat in a state
of rest than under exercise.
    (2) There is a marked excess of heat over normal given out under
exercise, this excess ( + theoretical heat) produced in doing a definite
amount of work (say 1000 kilogram-metres) varies for each of the five
persons under experiment.
    (3) The efficiency, or economic coefficient, for the five persons under
experiment varied from 0-193 to 0-174 with a mean of 0-183 ; or 18-3
per    cent. of the excess heat produced              +     the theoretical      heat corre
sponding to the work done.             This is a   little less than      a  fifth.

370            Mr.  J. Brown.      Some Experiments bearing
condensed    on their surfaces from the atmosphere (vapour or gas) in
which the metals are immersed.         From this view it would naturally
follow that, if all chemically active films and all atmosphere competent
to produce them could be removed, the difference of potential would
disappear also.    This inference has been pointed out and acted upon
by previous experimenters, as is well known : but it appeared to me
that no certain test of the theory could be obtained in the way they
suggested without elaborate precautions as regards details ; and the
experiments here to be described were undertaken in the hope that
more definite results might follow greater care in the work.
    The method adopted was to enclose a copper-zinc volta condenser in
 a glass  tube containing nitrogen at a small pressure, together with
 metallic potassium and sodium, the expectation being that these metals

                              the whole system in its glass tube.       To the
                              prolongation   A  of the copper plate is hinged,
                              on pointed screws, a brass sleeve, into which
                              is cemented the glass plate G, as an insula

                              the glass plate hangs in a notch in the fitting
                              E, and can move to the extent of the width
                              of this notch, so as to separate the plates
                              when the condenser with its tube is tilted
                              over till the zinc falls away from the copper.
                              Two curved springs of strip steel are placed
                              between the glass and the zinc, to keep them
                              apart ; while they are held together by three
                              screws, passing through the glass, and about
                              half way through the zinc. These screws
                              also serve to keep the copper and zinc, when

53 mm. diameter,     and about 30 cm. long, with a leading tube attached
on one side.    The measurement of the difference of potential was made
by a well-known zero method.          The deflection given by a quadrant
electrometer, on separating the condenser plates, was annulled by
connecting the plates to points in a circuit of variable high resistance,
containing a large gravity Daniell cell ; the electromotive force required
thus to annul being taken as equal and opposite to the difference of
electrostatic potential at the plates. Three similar sets of measurements
were made with this apparatus, continuing after it had been sealed up
respectively six months, one and a half years, and seven and a half
years.    In the intervals between observations the plates remained out
of metallic contact, and were kept, in Experiment I at their greatest
distance apart ; in   III  generally at their least. My notes of Experi
ment   II  are not clear on this point.
    Experiment I, started December 12, 1888. — The plates having been
cleaned with fine glass paper, the condenser was slipped into its tube.
A small porcelain cup of phosphorus pentoxide was introduced, in
order to dry out the interior, and the tube was then temporarily closed.
The difference of potential was then found to be
                                  0-74 volt.
    The end of the main tube was then sealed at the blowpipe.          The
tube was exhausted through the side tube by a Sprengel pump, then
filled with nitrogen, again exhausted, and then refilled with nitrogen.
The condenser plates were now found to be in metallic contact, pre
sumably due to the accidental sucking in of some minute globule of
mercury from the pump.         In three days this contact ceased.    About
3 grams of potassium and 1 gram of sodium, in small pieces, were
now inserted by the side tube.      (My notes do not state that the capsule
of phosphorus pentoxide was removed before closing the tube, but
probably it was.) The tube was again, December 17, exhausted to
3 mm., and refilled with nitrogen, when the difference of potential was
found to be about
                                   064 volt.
    The tube was finally exhausted to     4-5 mm.,   and the side tube was
sealed off, the difference of potential being
                                  061 volt.
    The following observations were then made at the intervals noted
in days after thus starting the experiment     : —

372                       Mr.   J.   Brown.     Some Experiments bearing
     It   remained to ascertain whether the fall in potential-difference was
due       to the gradual absorption of chemically active matters by the
potassium and sodium, or to the well-known effect of gradual tarnish
ing of the zinc surface. If, on admitting air and moisture to the tube,
the   potential-difference increased, the former alternative would be
indicated, and the absence of such increase would indicate the other
alternative.
   Before testing this point, it was thought desirable to ascertain
whether the pressure originally in the tube had changed. To measure
the pressure, the sealed end of the leading tube was joined by a
rubber tube and mercury seal to the Sprengel pump, which was worked
tillthe pump gauge showed a pressure of about 2 mm.         The end of
the leading tube was then broken off in the inside of this rubber tube,
a notch  having previously been filed to facilitate breaking. The pump
gauge then fell, and ultimately stood at 90 mm. pressure, showing that
a considerable amount of gas had been evolved in the tube during its
six months' trial.
   The leading tube was now removed from the pump, and air admitted ;
air was also blown in by the mouth, to introduce moisture.    The differ
ence of potential at once rose to
                                     0-39 volt, and later to 0-48 volt.
     On taking out and examining the condenser, the zinc was found                            to
be tarnished at the edges, but not much in the middle of its surface ;
the sodium was scarcely altered, but the potassium had a thick coat of,
no doubt, oxide or hydrate,                covering a core which burned on water.
     Experiment           II,   started December 9, 1889. — This was intended to              be
practically           a   repetition of Experiment I."       In closing the end of the
main tube, a considerable amount                     of fumes and moisture from the gas
blowpipe was observed to get into                    it,
                                     which may have affected the con
dition of the zinc surface. The   moisture was removed by warming
the         and washing out with air.
          tube                                  grams of potassium were
                                                             8
inserted, but no sodium.      The nitrogen pressure before sealing off was
5 mm.     After sealing off, the difference of potential was found to be
                                                0-70 volt,
and fell thereafter more or less regularly for                   a   year and   a   half, when,
on     June      9,   1891,     it   had diminished to
                                                0-52 volt.
   On opening the tube this value did not sensibly change.     The fall                       in
difference of potential was therefore probably due to tarnishing        the              of
zinc merely.   The potassium  in the tube was very little altered.
   Experiment III, started June 15, 1891. —The arrangement was the

                        on the Tlieory    of Voltaic Action.                 373
same as     in Experiment I, except that, after the tube had been exhausted
and finally sealed off, the 9 grams of potassium and 3 grams of sodium
which had been introduced, were fused together, forming the alloy that
is liquid at ordinary temperatures.           The difference of potential was at
first about
                                       0-75 volt.
     During the first year, the whole tube (except when being examined)
was kept immersed in a bath of petroleum, to prevent leakage of air.
in case of minute imperfections at the sealed-in wires or elsewhere.
The difference of potential on July 22, 1892, was about
                                       0-67 volt.
     The tube, no longer kept in petroleum, was examined occasionally
for the next six and a half years, till November 4, 1898, when it was
opened.       The pressure had risen to about 59 mm. of mercury.             The
difference of potential just before opening was about
                                       0-49  volt;
and after opening and blowing in there was little appreciable change in
this value. If anything, it seemed rather lower; though the rapid
tarnishing of the potassium-sodium alloy, when a new surface of it was
exposed, indicated the presence of an ample amount of oxidising
medium.        The decrease of potential difference, in this case also, was
therefore probably due to tarnishing of the zinc surface.                The zinc
was almost as bright as when enclosed seven and a half years before ;
but potishing a small portion of its surface with glass paper showed
that a slight film had formed.
     Of the three experiments, the first is the only one that lends any
 support to the hypothesis they were designed to illustrate.                 The
 laboratory notes show no difference between the first experiment and
 the other two, beyond what may be gathered from the foregoing
 account.      It seems unlikely that the three days of accidental metallic
 contact in the first experiment or the distance apart of the plates in
 intervals between observations can have affected the result ; and I am
 unable to suggest any other explanation except the possibility that the
 phosphorus pentoxide was left in the tube as well as the potassium
 and sodium.       I found on a previous occasion,* that when this substance
  was enclosed     with a copper-zinc pair, so as to dry the air surrounding
  the pair, the difference of potential fell in 1 34 days by one-sixth of its
  first value, and rose to its original amount immediately on admission of
  the ordinary atmosphere.         In No.     Ill   certainly no phosphorus pent-
  oxide was enclosed, and there is no mention of it in my notes of
  No.   II.

374        Prof. F. Clowes.      Deposition     of Barium Sulphate
   Though the experiments cannot be quoted as confirming the chemical
hypothesis, which I still think to be supported by an overwhelming
weight of evidence, it has been thought worth while to describe them,
if only to show the extreme difficulty of eliminating the last traces of
active matter from the gas employed.             That this is the real difficulty
in the way of obtaining positive results is well illustrated by the
ingenious experiments of C. Christiansen.*              He found, among other
things, that when the metal (of a pair) near which positive potential is
usually observed is exposed, for a minute fraction of a second, to an
inactive gas, such as hydrogen, the observed potential difference is
very much smaller than when the exposure lasts for a considerable
time.    The metal exposed by Christiansen was a jet of liquid amalgam,
flowing from a drawn out glass tube. Its surface was thus perfectly
clean, and the time of exposure to the surrounding gas was merely the
interval between the instant at which the amalgam left the nozzle and
that at which it broke into drops. The difference of potential observed,
when carbon was opposed to a jet of zinc amalgam in hydrogen in this
manner, was only 0-15 volt ; while in air it was 0-89 volt.             If more
time had been allowed, the impurities in the hydrogen would have
diffused in larger quantity towards the zinc, and given a larger effect,
similar in character to that observed in my experiments, where the
metals are exposed to the gas for a period amply sufficient for all such
action.

  Deposition of Barium Sulphate as a Cementing Material of
      Sandstone."      By Frank Clowes, D.Sc., Emeritus Professor,
       University College, Nottingham.           Communicated by Professor
      H. E. Armstrong,          F.B.S.        Eeceived    February 7, —Read
      February 23, 1899.
   Some years ago    I described the occurrence of a peculiar sandstone
over a large area in Bramcote and Stapleford, near Nottingham.t              The
sandstone was remarkable for its high specific gravity, and chemical
analysis, supported by microscopical examination,             proved that the
high specific gravity was due to the existence in the sandstone of a
large proportion of highly crystalline barium sulphate.            In the rock
itself the percentage of the sulphate varied from 33-3 to 50-l : and
it evidently served as the binding or cementing material which held
the sand grains together.     The occurrence of this sandstone was stated
by geologists to be unique in the United Kingdom.
   Mr. J. J. H. Teall made an examination of a portion of the sand
stone, and stated that after breaking up a portion of the rock, he easily

effected    a separation   of the sulphate from the sand by shaking the
powder about in water : the small cleavage flakes thus obtained gave
the optical characters of crystallised barium sulphate.                    Mr. Teall
further stated that the barium sulphate occurred in large irregular
crystalline patches, which included the sand grains ; the sand grains,
therefore, interrupted the reflections from the cleavage surfaces of the
barium sulphate, giving rise to the appearance generally known as
" lustre mottling " in petro-graphic literature.
    I had noted this irregular distribution of the barium sulphate. In
some parts of the rock the sulphate occurred in reticulated                      veins
inclosing small patches of more or less loose sand grains ; while in
 other parts of the rock the sulphate occurred in spherical or oval
 masses,    between    which    looser    sand    was interspersed    :  occasionally,
 however, the barium sulphate was uniformly distributed.
     The appearance presented by the weathered surface of the rock
 varied much according to the mode in which the resistant sulphate was
 distributed.     When it was uniformly distributed, it formed an almost
 complete     protection against weathering : this was seen on the cap of
 the great pillar of this rock, which is locally known as the " Hemlock
 Stone." The reticulated distribution of the sulphate caused the surface
 of the weathered rock to present a fretted surface, with the thin veins
 of sulphate projecting from the surface. -When the sulphate had bound
 together spherical or oval masses in the substance of the sand, these
 were left in pebble-like forms as soon as the loose sand had been
 washed out from between them ; and the resulting layers of loose sand,
 inclosing the rounded masses of sand bound together by the sulphate,
 'had been not unnaturally classed by the geologists who had visited
  the district, as pebble-beds.
      In discussing various ways in which this barium sulphate might
 have been deposited, I drew attention to the frequent deposition of
  barium sulphate from colliery water in the neighbourhood of Newcastle-
  upon-Tyne, and described some of these deposits.* And I further pointed
  out that Dr. Bedson had shownt that barium chloride was a common
  constituent of the colliery waters in the district in which these barium
  sulphate deposits occur : and that it was present to the extent of 137-2
  parts per 100,000 in some of these waters.             It was evidently only neces
  sary that   water   containing sulphuric        acid,  or a soluble sulphate should
  mingle with the barium chloride water in order to explain the deposi
  tion of barium sulphate in the positions in which it was found.                    In
  colliery districts a frequent source of ferrous sulphate and of sulphuric
  acid is found in the iron pyrites in the beds of coal and shale. And I
  suggested that the constant occurrence of fine veins of calcium sulphate
   throughout the sandstone of the Nottingham district would account
                            * '

 for a sulphate finding its way into the water which had been in contact
 with the rock.     But in the Nottingham district all evidence of barium
  chloride in solution was wanting.
     The occurrence of barium chloride in water from an artesian boring
 at Ilkeston has, however, recently been pointed out by Mr. John
  White, and he has described the nature of the strata through which
 the boring passed, and the results obtained by him in the chemical

 examination of the water, in        The Analyst (February, 1899).       The
 Ilkeston boring has been made in the immediate neighbourhood of
 the Bramcote and Stapleford sandstone which contains the large pro
 portion of barium sulphate.      Since the barium chloride is found to the
  extent of 40-7 parts per 100,000 in the water from this boring, and
 seems to be a normal constituent of the water, it would appear that
 soluble barium salts are still abundant in the district, and may there
 fore have given rise to the deposition of the barium sulphate in the
  original sand beds. The crystallisation of the sulphate around the
 sand grains would then cause it to act as a compact, insoluble
 cementing material.
     It is worthy of note     that one of the samples of water from the
 boring   contained  a small  amount   of barium in the presence of a large
 amount of sodium carbonate ; in this case the barium must therefore
 itself have been present as bicarbonate.
     Water containing barium chloride to the extent of about 9 grains
 per 100,000 has recently been found at Llangammarch in Breconshire.
    Since the publication of my original paper on the occurrence of
barium sulphate in the Bramcote sandstone, I have continued my
examination of samples of sandstone from the basement of the pebble
beds of the Bunter, with the object of ascertaining whether the occur
rence of barium, either as sulphate or in other forms of combination,
was characteristic of the sandstones of that geological period.       I have
thus far failed to find any similar rock to that at Bramcote, and it
therefore seems probable that the occurrence of barium sulphate,
although     it extends over a very extensive area at Bramcote and
Stapleford, must be looked upon as being due to purely local causes.
    [February 22. — Mr.  J.  Lomas, in a letter dated 20th instant, draws
my attention to a paper read by him and Mr. C. C. Moore before the
Liverpool Geological Society, on February 8, 1898, in which the
authors draw attention to the occurrence of large proportions of
crystallised    barium sulphate in triassic sandstones at Prenton and
Bidston. Mr. Lomas had previously mentioned the presence of the
sulphate in the Bidston sandstone thirteen years ago in a paper to the
above Society.
    In different   specimens of the sandstone the percentage of the
solphate varied from 12-4 to 33-8 per cent.      It is colourless and highly

 crystalline, and is adherent     to the sand grains in such a way as to
 show that it has been deposited in situ subsequently to the sand grains.
 Mr. Lomas states that the occurrence of barytes in the trias is fairly
 common,    and mentions the following localities, in which its presence is
 well known : — Beeston, Alderley Edge, Oxton, Storeton, and Peak-
 stones  Rock, Alton.    The sulphate is also stated to occur at West
 Kirby, in Cheshire, and elsewhere as a joint filling, the joints often
standing out from the surface of the rock, owing to the resistance of
the sulphate to weathering.]

sealed into the glass of an elongated annex.           The tube was exhausted
to about 0-000005 atmosphere, and the arrangement was such that the
paracathodic rays proceeding from A, cast a sharp shadow of B upon
the glass at D.     The distance from B to D was made long so that a
small horse-shoe magnet, held so as to embrace the annex between B
and D, would deflect the paracathodic rays without materially affecting
the cathode rays passing from C to A.            With this arrangement it was
found that the shadow of B, cast by the paracathodic rays, was always
moved by the magnet in the same direction as it would have been
moved had it been cast by cathode rays proceeding from A, thus show
ing that paracathodic rays are magnetically deflected in the same
direction as cathode rays.
   This would point to the paracathodic rays consisting of negatively
charged particles, as does also the fact, noted by Professor S. P. Thomp
son, with a somewhat similar tube, and confirmed by the writer, that
when the wire B is positively or negatively charged from a separate
electrical source,    the  consequent      contraction    or enlargement of its
shadow at   D  denotes electro-static      attraction or repulsion between B
and the rays.
   However, as previously noted by the writer,* an exploring pole
immersed in the paracathodic          rays, acquires a positive charge, and
the wire B in the tube illustrated in fig. 1, was found invariably to
have a slight positive charge, if tested with an electroscope when the
tube was being used as in the first experiment described above.                  On
the other hand, it was found that when the wire B was used as anode
instead of A, the latter also acquired a positive charge, though directly
played upon by the cathode rays.
   It was therefore decided to determine          the nature of the    electrifica
tion of the paracathodic rays by means of the Faraday cylinder method
employed by Pen-in for testing cathode rays.              It is generally agreed
that this method gives more conclusive results than those obtained
with exploring poles, where the effects of induction and possibly other
causes appear to introduce errors.
   A tube was therefore constructed as shown in fig. 2, in which C is
the cathode and     A  is both anode and anti-cathode        ; F is the Faraday
cylinder of brass, pierced by a small aperture through which the para
cathodic rays from A can enter, and connected by means of a wire
entirely enclosed in glass, with the terminal T. The Faraday cylinder
is enclosed in another coaxial brass cylinder, also having an aperture
facing the anticathode, and connected with the terminal B, which
during the experiments was connected to earth, so as to screen the
Faraday cylinder from outside influence.            The Faraday cylinder was
connected through T with the leaves of an electroscope, and when the
tube was put into action and the paracathodic rays entered the cylinder,

                     On the Reflection      of Cathode Rays.                 379

it was found that the gold leaves invariably diverged with a negative
charge.    The divergence of the leaves was increased by connecting A
to earth, and when a horse-shoe magnet was held so as to deflect the
paracathodic   rays, and prevent them from entering the Faraday cylinder,
the  closing together of the leaves showed that the cylinder no longer
received any charge at all.
   These experiments appear to show conclusively both that para
cathodic rays are deflected magnetically in the same way as cathode
rays, and also that they behave similarly to the latter in conveying a
negative charge.      In addition they     cause green fluorescence of the glass
upon which they fall, and as the writer has already shown,* they also
generate Rontgen rays where they impinge upon a solid body.
   Paracathodic rays appear therefore to be simply reflected cathode
rays.
           The Mechanical Force Exerted         by Reflected  Cathode Rays.
   These reflected cathode rays appear however to be relatively of very
feeble intensity.      The amount of Rontgen rays that they generate
where they strike the glass is very small ; while, so far as the writer
 has been able to ascertain,     they exert no appreciable mechanical       force
 on the most delicately     arranged radiometer mill wheels.
    At  one time  it seemed possible that reflected cathode rays might be
 the cause  of the  inverse rotation of mill wheels placed just outside of
                    *  '

 the cathode stream, described      recently by the writer in two papers to
 the Physical Society.*
    For the purpose of testing this, several experiments were made.
 Firstly, a tube was constructed in which the anticathode was mounted
on an axis,    so that by rotating it through a small angle the cathode
 rays could be reflected on to one side or the other of a very delicately
pivoted mill wheel with mica vanes. That the rays were so reflected
was apparent from the fluorescence of the glass and the shadows cast
by the vanes, but the rotations of the wheel were quite inconclusive,
and did not appear to have any definite relation to the direction of the
reflected cathode rays.
   The tube shown in fig. 3 was next constructed.           In this tube there
is a diaphragm of mica, that divides the tube into two portions.
One portion contains the six-vaned mill wheel M, and the other the
 cathode C, and an inclined anticathode      A. The diaphragm is pierced with
 two oblong apertures, and the anticathode arranged on a sliding stem
 so that it can be placed to reflect the cathode rays through one or other
aperture on to one side or the other of the wheel as desired. When ex
hausted and connected either to an induction coil or influence machine,
the reflected cathode rays from A in either position passing through
the corresponding aperture in the diaphragm, gave a distinct patch of

 fluorescence    on the glass beyond, throwing upon the latter a well-
 defined shadow of the vanes of the mill wheel.             Under these conditions
 the   wheel was found to rotate, but not in the direction anticipated ; in
 fact, for either position of the anticathode           the direction of rotation
 was most persistently opposite to what would be expected on the
 supposition that the driving force was the impact of the reflected rays.
 When the position of the anticathode was suddenly moved so as to
 reflect the rays first through one aperture and then through the other,
the direction of rotation immediately reversed itself, the direction of
 rotation being always as though there was some attractive force between
the anticathode and the particular vanes upon which the reflected rays
 were at the moment falling.
     These and further experiments, made with another arrangement in
 which instead of a single bulb divided by a mica diaphragm, two sepa
 rate bulbs were used, one containing the cathode and anticathode and
 the other the mill wheel, united by a pair of glass tubes corresponding
 to   the apertures   in the mica, appear to show that whatever may be
 the cause of the inverse rotation of mill wheels which are not directly
 acted upon by cathode rays, this is not due to the direct mechanical
 force exerted by the impact of reflected cathode rays, but to some
other force or forces of a much more potent nature.
                     The Mode of Reflection     of Catlwde Rays.
     The reflection of cathode rays is largely diffuse, but does not appear
 to be altogether so, as the writer has already pointed out,* and since
 more completely verified by the following further investigations.
     In the first place, experiments were made to see whether any direct
 visual evidence of specular reflection of cathode rays could be obtained
"with a spherically concave reflector.         For this purpose the tube shown
in fig. 4 was constructed.        In this tube the cathode C is made of alu
 minium T25 inches diameter, and is spherically concave on its active
 surface with a curvature of a 10-inch sphere, so as to give a fairly
 parallel beam of cathode rays.          The anti-cathode A consists of a cir
 cular disc of platinum about 0-9 inch diameter, stamped into a mould
 having a curvature equal to that of a 10-inch sphere, the concave sur
 face of the platinum being highly polished.                     The anti-cathode is
 mounted on     a  vertical spindle, arranged      in  guides, and furnished with
 a small brass bob weight attached to a horizontal arm, so that by
 tapping the tube the anti-cathode can be rotated round its vertical axis
 into any desired position.        The diameter of the spherical bulb, at the
  centre of which the anti-cathode is placed, is 3-6 inches, and an addi
  tional wire electrode is provided in an annex at the top to serve as
 anode.     In experimenting with this tube, a 10-inch induction coil, with
                         * ' Boy. Soc. Proc.,' toI. 63, p. 43fi.

                                  Fio. 4.
                                rt\
mercury   contact  breaker,  working at about one-half full power, was
employed, and when this coil was connected through two spark gaps to
the cathode C and the spare anode, the anti-cathode A being connected
to earth, the following phenomena were observed.
   With the anti-cathode so placed, as shown in fig. 4, that the cathode
rays impinged on its concave side at an average angle of about 135°, in
addition to the slight general green fluorescence of about half the bulb,
due to the diffuse reflection of the incident cathode rays by the con
cave anti-cathode, which fluorescence, as indicated in the illustration,
did not differ from what is usually observed in focus tubes, there
appeared two very bright and somewhat unstable fluorescent patches
upon the glass of the bulb facing the concave side of the anti-cathode.
One of these patches, E, which was approximately of circular form,
was directly opposite the concave side of the anti-cathode, and was
connected to the latter by a faintly luminous beam, while the other, F,
which was of a horizontally elongated form, had a position correspond
ing with the extremity of a second luminous beam apparently of
cathode rays reflected from the anti-cathode in true specular fashion.
Further, on the glass facing the convex side of the anti-cathode, there
at the same   time appeared   a large-diameter  hollow ring of very  faint
fluorescence, GG'.
   On slightly rotating the anti-cathode in either direction, both the
patches and the ring were also found to move, the circular patch E,
and the ring GG', maintaining a position respectively exactly in front

                    On the Reflection   of Cathode Hays.                383
of and behind the anti-cathode,     while the elongated patch, F, moved to
an extent that showed that the angular displacement of the reflected
beam of cathode rays that occasioned it was twice the angular dis
placement of the reflecting surface.
   The patch E, and the ring GG', appear to be due to some description
of rays given off directly by the anti-cathode normally to its concave
and convex surfaces respectively, and independently of the position of
the anti- cathode on its axis.     The exact nature of these normal anti-
cathode rays at present appears uncertain, and calls for further investi
gation.
   The fluorescent   patch F, from the manner in which both its move
ments and form     obey the usual laws of reflection, seems undoubtedly
to be due to cathode rays proceeding initially from the cathode C, and
reflected specularly by the concave surface of the anti-cathode.
   It should  be mentioned     that though, when obtained, the fluorescent
patches described above are most distinct and unmistakable, they are
not always obtained very readily.         With the tube used, the patches
increased   in brightness   when    the spark gap included in the circuit
between the coil and the anode of the tube was made fairly large.
The patch F was best obtained when the angle between the incident
and reflected beams is greater than 90° and less than 180°. This patch
could not   be obtained  satisfactorily when the angle was much less than
90°, possibly owing to the incident beam interfering with the reflected
beam.     In order to obtain satisfactory patches, it was found that the
anti-cathode must not be used as anode, and must be connected to
earth ; that there must be at least one spark-gap in the circuit, and
that the anode must not be connected to earth.             The patches are
generally somewhat unsteady as regards position, being apparently
affected by the varying electrification of the glass walls of the tube.
   The patches were best obtained with the tube exhausted to about
0-000024 atmosphere, when the general green fluorescence over half
the bulb, due to diffusely reflected cathode rays, was but faintly
visible.   When the degree of exhaustion was raised above that stated,
the patches became larger and fainter, and finally disappeared, merging
in the general fluorescence.
                             Quantitative Results.
   Endeavours were next made to obtain           accurate quantitative mea
surements of the cathode rays reflected from a flat and highly polished
platinum surface by catching a definite portion of the reflected rays in
a movable Faraday cylinder connected to earth through a galvano
meter, and noting the amount of charge imparted to the cylinder for
different angles both of incidence and reflection.
   The first tube constructed for this purpose is shown in fig. 5.     Here
                                                                            .

the spherically concave cathode C is 125 inch diameter and 0-75 inch
radius of curvature.      A is the anti-cathode reflector, consisting of a
plain disc of polished platinum 05 inch diameter, mounted on a
vertical axis held in guides, and provided with a small bob weight, so
that by tapping the tube, the reflector can be set in the position necessary
to give any desired angle between its surface and the incident cathode
rays.   The electrode B is provided for use as anode.           The Faraday
cylinder is constructed with an inner and outer cylinder of brass, F
and G, similar to those described in connection with fig. 2.             The
apertures into both cylinders are about 0'08 inch diameter.              The
cylinder  is  carried by  a curved   arm   of glass tube,  fixed to the glass
stopper S, which is very carefully ground into the neck of the tube ; a
copper wire passing through the tubular arm serves to connect the
inner Faraday cylinder with the terminal F', while a thick coating of
copper electrolytically deposited over the entire outside surface of the
glass arm, and connected at one end to the outside Faraday cylinder G,
and at the other end to the terminal G', can be earthed and serves to

 screen the inner  cylinder and its connection from all outside influence.
 The experiments were conducted with the tube connected to the
 mercury pump, and the ground-glass stopper S being lubricated with a
 little vaseline was found to maintain the vacuum very well for con
 siderable periods, while at the same time permitting of easy rotation of
 the Faraday cylinder round A into any desired position without the
 vacuum being impaired.      A circular scale of cardboard attached to the
tube around the neck near S, allowed of the angles made by the sur
face of A and the axis of the cylinder F with the axis of the cathode
stream proceeding from C being accurately determined.         The cathode
C and the anode B were directly connected, without spark gaps, to a
 10-inch Ruhmkorff coil with mercury contact breaker, working at about
| full power. The reflector A, as also the terminal G', were joined up
to an   earth connection which special tests had shown to be efficient,
while the inner Faraday cylinder was connected by means of F' also to
earth through a D'Arsonval mirror galvanometer, having 250 turns of
wire in its coil.   The tube was connected with a mercury pump, and
also with a McLeod gauge.        Even after prolonged exhaustion, it was
found that much electrical power could not be applied to the tube for
any length of time without largely deteriorating the vacuum, but with
less power the latter was more constant.        Even then the vacuum was
found .always to be slightly lower at the end of a series of observations
than at the beginning, and in order to avoid this disturbing factor,
every series was taken first one way and then again in reverse order,
the mean of the two sets giving results from which the influence of
the gradual decrease in the degree of exhaustion          was very nearly
eliminated.

   It will  be observed that      as the     reflector    was rotated    the galvano
meter deflections gradually increased in value up to a certain point.
and then decreased again ; also that the maximum mean deflection was
obtained   with the reflector at         140°, i.e., very    nearly at that    position
which would give equal angles              of incidence      and  reflection   for   the
cathode rays.
   Next, the reflector was kept stationary, and the cylinder moved so as
to explore the field of reflected rays.              A specimen set of the results
thus obtained is given in Table II.
   In this instance, on the assumption of partial specular reflection, the
maximum galvanometer deflection should of course be obtained with
the cylinder as near to 0° as it could be placed without interfering
with the primary cathode rays. It was not found practicable to place
it nearer than    45°, but, as  will  be observed, the deflections rise steadily
up to this latter position.
   Several other series of observations            were made with this tube, with
the cylinder stationary at 45° and at 130°, with the reflector at varying
angles, and also with the reflector stationary at 70° and at 135°, and

deflection   was   obtained  with   positions  that   made    the angles of incidence
and reflection approximately equal, and smaller and smaller deflections
resulted the further this position was departed from.                      However, as
more accurate readings were afterwards obtained with another tube
and more delicate arrangements, described below, it has been thought
best to omit detailed particulars of these observations.
   The above have, however, been mentioned to show that two tubes of
different descriptions gave similar results, and also that the galvano
meter method of measuring the charge imparted to the Faraday cylin
der, as described above, gave similar results as the quadrant electro
meter used in the further experiments.
   The new tube with which experiments               were next proceeded with is
shown    in fig.   7i  The arrangements for rotating the reflector in the
previous tube having been found somewhat unsatisfactory, in the new
tube both the reflector and the Faraday cylinder were attached to
ground stoppers, and furnished with pointers and scales, as in fig. 6,
so that the angles could be adjusted with great nicety.                       Further, in
order to obtain greater parallelism in the primary cathode stream, an
arrangement of cathode and anode was adopted similar to that used by
Professor J. J. Thomson.* According to this arrangement the cathode
rays from C are directed through two apertures about 0-l inch diameter
in the hollow brass cylinder B, which is ground into a glass neck, and
by means of the terminal B' is used as anode.
   It being found that the employment of little electric power was con
ducive to the maintenance of a constant vacuum, a 6-inch Ruhmkorff
coil was substituted for the larger one used previously, and as with the
 diminished power, and with the very attenuated beam of cathode rays

that could pass through the small apertures in B, the D'Arsonval galva
nometer would not give satisfactory readings even when a coil with 500
turns was used, a reflecting quadrant electrometer was employed
instead.    The needle of this electrometer was connected to the inner
Faraday cylinder F by means of an insulated wire threaded through a
lead pipe connected to earth so as to exclude all outside influence, and
the electrometer was otherwise connected up according to Mascart's
method.      The deposition of moisture upon the tube being found to
affect tb.3 results, incandescent electric lamps were arranged so as to
keep the whole at a uniform temperature slightly above th.it of the sur
rounding atmosphere.       In the subsequent experiments the anode B was
always connected to earth.
   In the following tables      each unit of the number given as the de
flection  of the electrometer    corresponds to a mean pressure of about
3 volts, though very probably, owing to the intermittent nature of the
discharge, the actual instantaneous value was much higher.- In each
case the readings of the second series of observations     were taken in

                      On the  Reflection of Cathode Rays.                    389
reverse order to those of the first series, and P, the pressure given in
millionths of an atmosphere, was obtained by the McLeod gauge at the
commencement and end of each series. Deflections indicating a posi
tive charge given to the Faraday cylinder are so marked ; all others
denote negative charges.

                       On  the Reflection of Cathode Rays.                393
    The above are       a few   typical examples of a much larger number of
sets of observations,     all giving similar results.   On examination it will
be seen that in all, both in the cases when the reflector was moved so
as to reflect the cathode rays at different angles into the stationary
Faraday cylinder, and also when the reflector was stationary and the
field of reflected rays explored by moving the cylinder, the effects are
approximately similar. In each case the electric charge imparted to
the cylinder, as measured by the electrometer deflection, is greatest for
almost exactly those positions of reflector and cylinder relatively to the
primary cathode rays that would make the angle of reflection most nearly
equal to the angle of incidence, the electrometer deflections diminishing
gradually, though not at a uniform rate, the greater the departure from
this condition. Any slight discrepancies are readily accounted for by
the difficulties of maintaining a constant vacuum and uniform action of
the induction coil contact breaker, and are also possibly, in some in
stances, due to electrostatic repulsion experienced by the reflected cathode
rays. It would, therefore, appear that the reflection of cathode rays
by    a flat polished  platinum surface is not altogether diffuse, but takes
place to some      considerable extent in a more or less specular manner.
     As will   be  observed in several of the sets of observations, a small
reverse deflection of the electrometer, indicating a slight positive charge
of the cylinder, was obtained either at the end or beginning of a series,
 when the relative positions of reflector, cylinder, and primary cathode
rays would allow of no reflected cathode rays entering the cylinder.
This curious fact requires further investigation.
     In order   to ascertain whether the intensity of the reflected cathode
 rays would increase      as the incidence was made more slanting, several
 series of observations     were made, where both the reflector and cylinder
 were moved, the latter at twice the rate of the former, in such a manner
 as to measure the maximum intensity of the reflected rays for varying
 angles of incidence.        The following table (Table X) gives the mean
 deflections obtained with four series, which appear to show that the
 intensity of the reflected rays does increase as the incidence is more
 slanting. The increase in the early stages is not, however, great ;
 while it is possible that in the latter stages some direct cathode rays
 obtained access to the cylinder.
                          Charge Imparted to the Reflector.
     Experiments were also made to ascertain whether the charge imparted
 to the reflector varied with the angle of incidence of the primary
 cathode rays.       The results are given in Table XI, from which it will
 be seen that the electrification     of the reflector while strongly negative
 for normal incidence of the cathode rays, becomes zero at an angle
  between 130° and 135°, and slightly and increasingly positive for still
  larger angles.     Comparing this result with that obtained in the pre-
                                                                 2 H 2

                     On the Reflection     of Cathode Rays.                     395
    The writer    has  previously described*          how with     an  anticathode,
inclined at an angle of 45° to the axis of a conical cathode stream, he
found, by examination with a pin-hole camera, that those portions of
the stream    which impinge most normally upon the anticathode are the
most efficient in producing Rontgen rays, while those portions of the
stream which strike the anticathode surface very much on the slant
are less efficient in producing Eontgen rays.             There is probably some
connection between this and what is indicated in Tables X and XI.
The fact that the more normal is the angle of incidence, the greater
is the amount of negative charge imparted to the anticathode reflector,
the greater the amount of Rontgen rays produced, and the less the
amount of charge in the reflected cathode rays, would seem to support
the view that the Rontgen rays are actually generated in some way
by the electric charges carried by the cathode ray particles being
imparted to the anticathode.
                                     Conclusion.
    The results of the experiments described above differ in at least one
important particular from those obtained by Mr. H. Starke, an account
                                                           '
of whose researches appeared in Wiedemann's Annalen,' No. 9, p. 56,
 1898, while the writer's investigatons were in progress.                Mr. Starke,
using    a form of  tube   in which  the   arrangement       of cathode, anode, and
reflector was very similar to that shown in fig. 9, but with a Faraday
 cylinder fixed in one definite position, as in the tube illustrated in
 fig. 2, and using the galvanometer method of measuring the charge con
 veyed to the cylinder by the reflected cathode rays, appears to have found
 that so long as the same face of the reflector was turned towards both
 the cathode and cylinder, the orientation of the reflector did not affect the
amount of charge conveyed to the cylinder. This is so totally at variance
 with the results given above, which were repeated over and over again,
 that the writer can only assume that the methods employed by Mr.
 Starke were not as sensitive as his own, particularly as in the case of
 the writer's results those obtained by rotating the reflector, with the
 cylinder stationary, are confirmed by those obtained with a stationary
 reflector and a movable cylinder — the latter method not having been
 employed by Mr. Starke.
    In conclusion, the writer desires to express his great indebtedness to
 the valuable assistance of Mr. J. C. M. Stanton and Mr. H. L. Tyson
 Wolff in carrying out the above investigations.

   In a paper on the " Chemistry of the Hottest Stars,"* in                         1897, 1
stated the results so far arrived at concerning the order in which cer
tain spectral lines appeared and others disappeared in stars arranged in
a   series   of  ascending temperatures.           Since that paper was written
many important advances have been made, so that                       I  have been able
in the meantime to considerably extend the research. Among these
advances     I  may mention the following :—
   1. With regard to the metals, my recent note on the enhanced lines
in the spectrum of a Cygni t enables us to deal with the lines observed
at the highest temperature        in the spectra of the following              substances,
Fe, Mg, Ca, Sr, V, Ti, Ni,       Mn, Cr, and Cu.
   The temperature ranges         of the enhanced        lines of these metals        have
been investigated with the        following results —    :
                     Bange of temperature                     Range of temperature
    Metal.

      Fe            a Tauri to ? Tauri                       /3 Persei to Arcturus.

      Sr             a Tauri to a Cygni                      Sirius to Arcturus.
   I  pointed out in the note referred to that the enhanced lines of the
above substances seemed to account for almost all of the more marked
lines in a Cygni.                                          I
                       It is on this ground that have investigated their
behaviour in other stars before waiting for the results of the complete
inquiry.      Another reason has been that although in addition to                      the
enhanced lines of the metals shown in the foregoing table, those of
Ba, Cd, Mo, La, Sb, Pd, Ta, Rh,          Er and Yt,        Ce, Wo,     U, Zr, Pb, Co.Bi,
have already been investigated with lower dispersion, and a spark ob
tained with the use of a much less jar capacity, so far I have no

stars   of intermediate temperature.
    2.  The temperature ranges of the arc lines of some of the metals
have    also been investigated, and the results are shown in the following
table   : —•

    3.  The new series of lines discovered by Professor Pickering, and
described by him as representing a new form of hydrogen,* has been
found in the spectra of (, e, S, and k Orionis photographed at Kensing
ton in 1892, and Mr. McClean has traced the lines in y Argfts.
    We are therefore now in a better position to determine the relation
of this new gas to other gases, both known and unknown, appearing in
stars of nearly. equal temperature.
    4. In addition to the unknown lines at X\ 4089-2 and 4649-2, referred
to in my last communication                  on this subject,t three other unknown
lines occur in y Argus.
   As these most probably reveal still undiscovered gases, I include
them in the following table, showing the limits of stellar temperature
to which the various known and unknown lines, probably of gaseous
origins, extend.

398        Sir Norman Lockyer.          On  tlte  Order   of Appearance of
    5.  Mr. McClean has stated that certain of the oxygen lines (amongst
which is the strong triplet at XX 4070-1, 4072-4, and 4076-3) appear in
the spectrum of /? Crucis and other stars of nearly equal temperature.
My own observations so far as they have gone tend to confirm this
view, but other      photographs and more laboratory work are needed to
explain certain changes of intensity which have been observed.                   The
lines   attributed   by  Mr.   McClean   to oxygen      have   been   noted  between
a  Crucis and f Orionis in the upward series, and in stars at about the
a Eridani stage of temperature in the downward series.
    6. There is evidence that the strongest lines of nitrogen at X 3995-2
and X 4630'9 make their appearance in stars at about the temperature
of a Crucis.      These lines appear from Eigel to f Orionis in the upward
series, and are present in stars at the a Eridani stage in the downward.
    7. I pointed out many years ago* that at high temperatures                     the
flutings of carbon in the violet are replaced by a line at X 4267-5.
 There is a line at this wave-length in the spectra of stars ranging in
temperature from that of Eigel to f Orionis on the up side, and from
 a Eridani to fi Persei on the down side, of the temperature curve.
    There is no known line of gases or metals to which this line can be
 assigned.      It is probable therefore that carbon exists in stars of the
 same temperature       as that at which oxygen and nitrogen have been
 traced.
     8.  Two lines in the spectrum of silicium (X 4128-5 and X 4131-5)
 have     been traced in stars between the temperatures of a. Ursse Min.
 and a Crucis in the upward series and between those of a Eridani and
 Procyon in the downward.
     The accompanying map shows the facts relating to stars as hot as,
 or hotter than, the sun, as we know them at present.
                                 Description of Map.
     The map is arranged on the following plan : The temperature of
 the sun and Arcturus forms the lowest stage.                     The upper limit is
 defined by y Argfis, the hottest star so far known.                 On the left the
 stars named are those of increasing temperature ; on the right those of
 decreasing temperature.          Those on the same horizon represent equal
 mean temperatures so far as the cleveite gas and enhanced lines help
 us to determine them.          The blank spaces indicate that so far no star
 has been photographed in the spectrum of which the enhanced lines
 exactly match those on the opposite side.
     The names of the various chemical substances included in the dis
 cussion are given at the top.        I  have retained the prefix
                                                                          " proto-" to
 that condition of each metallic vapour which gives us the enhanced
 lines alone, and I have added it to that form of hydrogen seen only in
 the hottest stars.

   The behaviour of the most typical line of each chemical substance                             is

length  and  varying    thickness of  the lines in stars on both sides of  the
temperature     curve are derived from the observed appearance and
intensity of  the  lines, noted in the different stars.

   The wave-lengths          of the lines discussed are shown at the bottom of
the map.
                                        Addendum.
   The facts embodied in the map present to us the spectral changes
noted in stars         of Groups III, IV, and V, of my classification,* and
are a result of a more general inquiry than those referred to in my
previous papers,t the origins of a very considerable number of stellar
lines having since then been traced to enhanced lines of metals and to
known gases.
    It will be seen that this more general inquiry entirely justifies the
prior statement} that the metallic lines are thickest in stars increasing
their temperatures, and that the hydrogen lines are thickest in stars
decreasing their temperatures ; in other words, on the opposite arms
of the temperature          curve.      I  have already stated a possible explana
tion^
    It will    be observed that, so far,      I have not been able to find stellar
spectra on the downward side corresponding to those of y Argus and
£ Orionis ; but it is more than probable that near the apex of the curve
only a small change will be observed ; their default, therefore, is of
less consequence than         it might have been.
    The     same  remark    applies to a Cygni and Sirius ; but here it is cer
tain that the differences in the relative intensities of the gaseous and
enhanced lines will be considerable, judging from what happens above
and below the heat stages represented by them.
    The stars used in the discussion give us                    very definite results,
showing        that  the  various    chemical    forms    are introduced    at six very
distinct heat levels.
    I next proceed to make some remarks upon the series of facts now
for the first time brought together; it must, however, be borne in
mind that all the chemical elements and all parts of the spectrum
have not yet been included in the survey.
    1.    Hydrogen appears throughout both series of stars from top to
         bottom.      Proto-magnesium and proto-calcium follow suit very
         nearly ;   but  the highest intensity of the former is reached at the
         stage represented by u Cygni, and of the latter at the solar tem
         perature represented by a Tauri and Arcturus.
    2.    With the above exceptions, all the chemical forms so far traced
         are relatively short-lived.
    This is the first important differentiation.               In the light of (1) we

           CJunnical Substances at different Stellar Temperatures.        401
 are justified in assuming that the substances in (2) would be visible
 in the stellar reversing layers if they were there.
    3.  In the stars of higher temperatures we deal generally with gases.
       Below the stages represented by /? Orionis and y Lyrae we deal
       with proto-metals and metals, hydrogen being the only exception.
    4.  The proto-metals make their appearance at about the same heat-
       level at which the gases (with carbon), always excepting hydrogen,
       begin to die out.
    This is the second important differentiation.        It is interesting to
 notice   the distinct difference  of behaviour of carbon and silicium in
the descending series ; the former goes through the same stages as
 oxygen and nitrogen, the latter behaves like the proto-metals.
    5.  With the exception of iron the metals, as contradistinguished
       from the proto-metals, only make their appearance in stars at and
       below the heat-level of Sinus.
    This is the third important differentiation.    It is accompanied    with
a  notable diminution of hydrogen and proto-magnesium,          and with an
increase of proto-calcium : indeed the latter seems generally to vary
inversely with the hydrogen.
    In all these changes we seem to be brought into presence of succes
sive polymerisations due to reduction of temperature.          Of the origin
of proto-magnesium and proto-calcium the stars as yet tell us nothing,
but it is difficult to believe that the earliest forms of the other metals
are not built up of some of the constituents of the heat ranges repre
sented by those between y Argus and a Crucis.
   The question arises whether the order of visibility at reduced        tem
peratures now indicated does not explain the absence of proto-hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen from the spectra of the sun and nebulae, the
metals present in, and the absence of quartz from, meteorites, and the
similarity of the gaseous products obtained from them and metals,
native and other, in vacua at high temperatures.
   I have finally to express my obligations to those who have aided
me in the present inquiry.       For some of the metals used I am indebted
to Mr. George Matthey, F.R.S., who has kindly placed the resources of
his establishment so entirely at my disposal that I feel it is impossible
to thank him sufficiently.     For the determination of wave-lengths and
the correspondence of terrestrial and stellar lines, Mr. Baxandall is
responsible, while Mr. Fowler has assisted in the determination of the
various stellar groups. The photographs of the enhanced lines obtained
by the use of the Spottiswoode coil have been taken by Mr. Butler.
The actual construction of the map from the available photographs
has devolved upon Mr. Baxandall, Dr. Lockyer co-operating in the
case   of stars of the highest temperature.

     When the present investigation was undertaken,                  our knowledge        of
 the perturbations of the Leonids was due to an investigation carried
 on thirty years ago by Professor J. C Adams.*
     His object was to compute the shift in the nodes of the meteoric
orbit due to perturbations, and to compare the calculated amount with
the amount which had been deduced by Professor Hubert A. Newton
from observations made at intervals during the last 1000 years, t
     For Professor Adams's purpose the perturbations to be computed

    were the average perturbations ; and he accordingly employed Gauss's
    method, in which the mass of the disturbing planet is supposed to be
   distributed round its orbit in quantities proportional to the time that
    the planet occupies in travelling over each portion of its course.             This
    elegant   method   furnishes    the average  amount    of  each   perturbation   on
   the supposition thaf the periodic times of the disturbed body and of
    the disturbing planet are incommensurable, so that in the course of
    time the two bodies present themselves in every possible position to
   one another.
        This condition, however, has been but imperfectly fulfilled within
    the limited period of 1000 years over which the recorded observations
    extend, especially in the case of the three planets which influence the
    Leonids most, and indeed are almost the only planets whose attraction
    needs to be taken into account. These are Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.
    A comparison of the periodic times shows that fourteen revolutions of
    Jupiter approximate in duration within about one-fifth of a year, to five
    revolutions of the meteors ; two revolutions of Uranus occupy about
   one and three-quarters of a year more than this same time, and nine
    revolutions of Saturn correspond within a fraction of a year to eight
   revolutions of the meteors.
        These cycles have been several times repeated within the period
    over which the observations extend; and one consequence of these
   cycles is that there have been oscillations in the rate of the advance of
    the node about its mean value, so that the times for the showers
   assigned by applying to the orbit the average shift of its node, have
   usually differed by several hours from the actual times. On one occa
   sion — in A.D. 1533 — the shower anticipated the computed time by
   about twenty-six hours, and, as the present investigation shows, a
   deviation of comparable amount and in the opposite direction is to be
   expected this year.        Accordingly, even if our sole object were to enable
   astronomers     in future     to predict more satisfactorily the times of the
   greater Leonid showers, it would be necessary to prepare for the task
   by first studying the actual amount of the perturbations in each revolu
   tion, and moreover, for meteors occupying various stations along the
   stream.
       For, in fact, the perturbations have not only differed in different
   revolutions, but even within a single revolution, the meteors which
   occupy successive positions in the procession are differently affected by
   the surrounding planets, as is confirmed by the definite results which
   Herr Berberich has obtained by assuming successively two epochs for
   the perihelion passage.* The dense part of the stream, with which we are
   chiefly concerned, and which we may call the ortho-stream, t is now so

      t In order to facilitate the study of the Leonids it is convenient to distinguish

 long that it takes between two and three years to pass each point in
 its orbit, so that the configurations in which the several parts are pre
 sented to the disturbing planets are markedly different.     Accordingly,
perturbations    must  have produced  in this long stream  both  sinuosities
and an unequal distribution of density ;* and the first step towards
increasing our acquaintance with these and other kindred phenomena,
as well as towards gaining a better insight into the past history of the
swarm, is to aim first at securing a more intimate knowledge of the
perturbations.
    With this end in view it was decided, as a first step, to compute the
actual perturbations of a definite part of the stream over the whole
of one revolution, taking that part of the ortho-stream of which Adams
had determined the orbit, and extending the computation over the
revolution from the date of the great shower of November, 1866, until
that day in January, 1900, when the same part of the stream will return
to the earth's orbit.
    Adams's calculation was based on determinations of the radiant point
which were made in 1866, before photography had lent the aid to
astronomy which it now yields.       Moreover, the circumstance that the
earth deflected the meteors which were then observed by an amount
which varied as the shower progressed, was not at that time attended
to by observers.       Owing to these imperfections,         there is a considerable
probable error in the mean of the determinations which were made in
1866, and a corresponding uncertainty in the values of the elements
computed from that mean.    We are accordingly only justified in em
ploying Adams's orbit as approximate. But, fortunately, an error in
the orbit, of such an amount as is at all            likely to exist, will not ma
terially affect the perturbations of the orbit, which are what we have
at present in view.
   The main stream of Leonids — the ortho-stream — is narrow and very
long, and it is convenient to divide it into segments, each of which
between a great body of them — the ortho-Leonids — which are travelling round
the eun in nearly identical orbits, and another class of Leonids which we may call
clino-Leonids, that are pursuing courses which differ in a more considerable
degree from the ortho-orbit.   By the ortho-orbit is to be understood the mean of
the orbits of the ortho-Leonids.
  The ortho-Leonids at present form    a compact stream of such a length that it
takes nearly three years to pass each point of its orbit, and so narrow that when
the earth passes obliquely through it the transit occupies only some five or six
hours; whereas the clino-Leonids form a less dense and wider stream, which has
spread itself the whole way round the ring, and which produces in every
November, when the earth passes through      it,
                                               a   feeble meteoric shower that lasts for
several days.
 *   One consequence of the existence of irregularities in the stream of ortho-
Leonids  is that the ortho-orbit at one cross-section of the stream (i.e., the mean
of the orbits of the meteors occupying that situation in the stream)      in general
                                                                            is
not absolutely   identical with the ortho-orbits at other cross-sections.

 shall be of moderate length.      Through one of these, which we may call
 segment A, the earth passed in November, 1866, and on that occasion
 there was withdrawn from it that small portion which consisted of
 meteors which either encountered       or passed close to the earth.    Those
 that actually plunged into the earth's atmosphere were destroyed :
 those that passed near were deflected, and were also either accelerated
 or retarded, and they thus became clino-Leonids. It is with the great
 majority of the meteors in segment A, which escaped both these fates
 and continued to be ortho-Leonids, that Adams's investigation is con
 cerned.   He ascertained their orbit ; and starting from the elements of
 the orbit as determined by him, the actual perturbations which it has
 since undergone have been computed, and the main results thus arrived
 at are embodied in the following table.
    As already stated, the calculation has been extended over an entire
 revolution of that portion of the stream which we have called seg
 ment A ; and in computing the perturbations, account has been taken
 of the attraction exercised upon these meteors by Mars, Jupiter,
 Saturn, and Uranus. At first Venus and the Earth were included,
 but as the influence of these planets was found to be insensible, they
 were omitted from the latter part of the calculation.
    The expense of carrying on the work has been met partly out of the
 Government Grant administered by the Royal Society, and partly out
 of the Royal Society's Donation Fund.         The computations have been
 made by Messrs. F. B. Cooper, J. H. Bell, and W. H. Walmsley,
 members of the staff of the Nautical Almanac office. We are also
indebted to Mr. E. Roberts, the chief assistant, for his aid in various
parts of the work.      The method adopted was that by mechanical
quadratures,   the determinations    of the variations of the elements being
made at intervals of thirty-six days, except for the period from May,
 1871, to December, 1894, during which time the perturbations were
small and progressed so regularly that it was found sufficient to make
the computations at intervals of 216 days.
    The most noteworthy features are a near approach to Saturn in April,
 1870, and a near approach to Jupiter in August, 1898, at which
latter time the meteors in segment A of the stream were at a distance
from the planet of only 0-9 of the mean radius of the earth's orbit.
The consequences of these near approaches are brought out in the
table.   Uranus produced but little effect in this revolution.            The
planet was at a distance when the swarm crossed his orbit.           And the
influence of  Mars  was  trifling.   So   that nearly  the whole  of  the per
turbations during this revolution have been caused by Jupiter and
Saturn.

   In consulting the table, it has to be borne in mind that           e, which is
there designated, in compliance         with   the  usual  convention amongst
                   " mean longitude in the orbit," is in
computers, the                                                reality the sum of
two angles lying in different planes, viz., the longitude of the node +
the angle between the radii from the sun to the node and to an imagi
nary body starting from perihelion at the same epoch as segment A of
the meteors, and thenceforward moving uniformly in a circular orbit
round the sun in the same plane and with the same periodic time as
the meteors.      So again it, the so-called " longitude of perihelion," is
the sum of two angles, viz., the longitude of the node measured along
the ecliptic + the angle from the node to the perihelion measured in
the plane of the orbit.        The second angle in each case, that in the
plane  of  the  orbit, is  measured  in the direction of positive motion.
   The perihelion distance in Adams's orbit, of which the elements are
in the first column of the table, and which was the osculating ellipse on
 1866, November 13, is 0-9855 ; that of the osculating ellipse on 1900,
January 27, of which the elements are in the last column, is 0-97296.
There is a corresponding difference in the distances of the node from
the sun, a difference which would be enough to carry segment A of the
meteoric stream inside the earth's orbit without intersecting it when it
passes   the earth's orbit on    January 27,    1900, unless the depth    of the
stream towards the sun is greater than its width at right angles to that
direction — a width which from observation has been estimated to be
about 100,000 miles.        We have, however, satisfied ourselves, from the
dynamical conditions which must have prevailed when the Leonids
joined the solar system, that the depth of the stream is much greater
than its width.
   The longitude of the node at the epoch 1900, January 27, would be
52° 25', if computed in the way which has been hitherto usual, by apply
ing to the longitude at the time of the shower of 1866 the average
apparent shift of the node as determined from observation by Professor
Newton, viz., 102"-6 annually; whereas in the orbit of our table it is
53° 42'.    It thus appears that the amount of this perturbation upon
segment    A  of the stream has been more than three and a half times its
average amount, and, doubtless, the perturbations in this revolution of

         The active Agent      in producing     Photographs    in  the  Dark.   409
the other     elements have       also been excessive     as  compared with their
average amounts.
    Thus, the mean distance of the meteors occupying segment A of the
stream has been undergoing so much extension, that the meteors will at
the end of the revolution find themselves             with a periodic time longer
by   one-third   of  a  year —  an  amount   of  change which must largely affect
their future history, unless this great perturbation is compensated by
what happens elsewhere or at other times.
    At the epoch 1899, November 15, the longitude of the node will be
53° 41,-7, a position which the earth will reach on 1899, November 15d.
18h.      It is probable, therefore, that the middle of the shower of the
present year (1899) will occur nearly at this time, since segment A in
the stream, for which our calculations have been made, is situated in
the stream less than three months' journey of the meteors behind
the segment which the earth will encounter next November, and which
we may call segment B. This conclusion, however, rests on two
assumptions: (1) That segments A and B were, in 1866, moving in
orbits that did not much differ ; (2) That the perturbations which seg
ments A and B have since suffered have not much differed.                      Both
assumptions are probable, but unfortunately neither is certain ; so that
the prediction can only be offered with reservation.                  If the shower
occurs at the time anticipated, it will be visible from both Europe and
 America.
 " On
        Hydrogen Peroxide as the active Agent in producing Pictures
        on a Photographic Plate in the Dark."                  By W. J. Russell,
        Ph.D., V.P.RS.            Received February 18,— Read March 2,
        1699.
    In previous papers it has been shown that certain bodies are able, in
 the dark, to act on a photographic plate and produce a picture. The
 purpose of the present communication is to show that in all the cases
 which have been examined, and probably in all others of a similar
 kind, the action which occurs is due to the presence of hydrogen per
 oxide.     As  a sensitive      plate always contains moisture, and probably
 would be inactive if quite dry, it does not seem possible to test the
 truth of this statement by ^the total exclusion of moisture ; there
 fore more indirect means have to be adopted.               In the following paper
 no attempt      is   made    to  explain  the  reactions which   occur in the plate
 itself ;  that is  a  distinct question, and at present the object is to con
 sider the means by which these changes, whatever they may be, are
  brought about. These changes are rendered visible by exactly the same
  processes as those adopted for the development of an ordinary light
  picture. Any of the ordinary photographic plates may be used in

 410         Dr. W.   J. Russell.   On Sydrogen Peroxide as the
 these experiments,     but as many of the pictures      are only formed after
 a  long exposure, it is well to   use  rapid plates.     In the following ex
 periments     the plate used has been      in almost all cases the " Ilford
 special rapid," and the process of development         has in every case been
 that recommended for their ordinary use.
     The first step towards demonstrating that hydrogen peroxide is ihe
 active agent in producing these pictures, is to show that all the results
 produced both by metals and by organic bodies on a photographic
 plate, can be produced by hydrogen peroxide.          This body is now made
 in considerable quantities and sold in aqueous solution of a given
 strength.     This commercial article appears to act equally well to a
 carefully prepared and pure specimen of the        same strength.
     A convenient     way of testing   the action of any liquid on a photo
graphic    plate is to use a small  circular glass dish, such as is made for
bacteriological experiments, the photographic         plate resting on the top
 of the dish, and the amount of the liquid used determines the distance
 the plate is from the active surface, the experiment being carried on in
complete darkness.       If pure water be tested in this way, it is found
that no picture, that is no darkening of the plate, occurs on its being
treated    with the developing solution.        The plate can be left over the
water for eighteen to twenty hours, but if left longer than this, the film
is destroyed by the aqueous vapour.          If to the pure water in the dish
a mere trace of hydrogen peroxide be added, a darkening of the plate
will quickly occur. For instance, if the liquid contains only one part
of the peroxide in a million of water, and the plate be exposed to ita
action for eighteen hours, a faint picture is produced.             Bearing in
mind the small amount of evaporation which takes place under these
conditions,    and consequently the minute amount of the peroxide which
comes   in  contact with the plate, it clearly shows the exceeding delicacy
of the reaction.
    Again, if a piece of Ford blotting paper, which by itself is inactive,
after being wetted with a solution of one part of peroxide in 500,000 of
water, and hung up in a warm room for three quarters of an hour to dry,
is placed in contact with a photographic plate for two hours at a tem
perature of 55° C, on subjecting the plate to development a distinct
picture is produced.       In fact, moistening good blotting-paper with a
solution which may be strong or weak, and allowing it to dry for a
long or short time, is a very good way of applying the peroxide. In
place of blotting paper any inactive porous substance may be used.
    Plaster of Paris wetted with a peroxide solution and allowed to set.
continues for a long time to be an active body. If by any of these means
a large,  in place of a small, amount of the peroxide be allowed to act
on a plate, then in place of a dark, a light picture is obtained, a pheno
menon similar to what is known to photographers as reversal.
    The conditions under which certain metals and cortain organic bodies

          active Agent    in producing Photographs in         the   Dark.     411
act on photographic plates, and how pictures of the structure of paper,
skeleton leaves, lace, and other bodies can be obtained, has already
been described, so that now it is only necessary to say that substitute
for these active bodies peroxide of hydrogen, and exactly correspond
ing results are produced.     Writing with ordinary ink, or with a solu
tion of ferrous sulphate, or potassium ferrocyanide, has been shown to
be opaque to the action of zinc and of turpentine, so is it to the action of
the peroxide of hydrogen.     Further, the action exerted by the metals
and the terpenes, is unable to pass through glass, mica, selenite, &c.,
but is able to pass through thin sheets of gelatin, celluloid, gutta
percha, india-rubber, tracing paper, gold beaters' skin, parchment, &c.
Peroxide of hydrogen acts exactly in the same way ; every body which
is known to be either opaque or transparent to the action of the metals
or terpenes, is opaque or transparent to the action of the peroxide ; so
that as far as the production of similar phenomena goes, the agree
ment is complete.     Of the acknowledged tests for the presence of
hydrogen peroxide, the one with the titanic acid dissolved in sulphuric
acid is exceedingly delicate ; so also appears to be the tetramethylpara-
phenylenediamine paper of Dr. Wurster, and both of them have been
made use of.
   The next point which naturally suggests itself           is,
                                                          whether peroxide
of hydrogen    is,
               or    likely to be, present
                     is                    in all the different cases, when
action on the sensitive plate occurs. First, with regard to the metals.
The list of the active metals, which has already been given,     as follows,
                                                                     is
arranged approximately in order of their activity Magnesium, cadmium,
                                                    :
zine, nickel, aluminium, lead, cobalt, bismuth, tin.       Now these are
certainly  the  metals which  might  be expected  to decompose water, and
in the presence of oxygen cause the formation of hydrogen peroxide              ;
and still more the order in which they stand in the above list, judging
from their general properties,    is  that in which they would probably
induce the formation of the peroxide.        Itis also satisfactory to note
that this list of metals and their order of activity was drawn up
simply from experiment, when there was no idea that hydrogen per
oxide had anything to do with the reaction.       Again, as a confirmation
that hydrogen peroxide      is formed when these metals oxidise in moist
air, pieces of Dr. Wurster's tetra-paper were moistened and laid on
bright surfaces of the metal.     With the metals that head the foregoing
list a considerable amount of blue colour was rapidly developed, with
the metals at the end of the list the amount of colour was less, and the
reaction slower  ;   and with other metals, such as silver and platinum,
there was no action.     With copper and with iron very slight amount
                                                        a
of action did occur, but these metals do not appear able to produce
definite pictures.   Iodide of potassium and starch paper, when used in
the same way, gave a blue colour with all the active metals, but none
 with copper nor with iron.
                                                                     2i   2

412        Dr. W.    J.   Eussell.    On Hydrogen Peroxide as the
   On the supposition       that hydrogen peroxide is the active agent in the
action exerted by        the  metals, it seemed probable that on supplying
to the metal more moisture than it obtained from the air and photo
graphic plate, more action would take place, and this was found to be
the case.    Two pieces of polished zinc were placed in contact with
photographic plates in small iron boxes ; one box was quite dry, and
put in a bell-jar over calcium chloride, and into the other box some
damp paper was introduced, and the box was placed with a little water
under a bell-jar.         On examining the plates after three days it was
found that the damp plate had much the darker picture on it.
   With the object of obtaining an increased amount of action, experi
ments were made by passing a current of warm moist air over zinc
turnings. A glass tube, 6 feet long and 1 inch in diameter, was packed
with zinc turnings, and placed within a large brass tube to which
steam could be admitted.         The amount of action, if any, was indicated
on a plate, placed in a dark box at the end of the tube.           P]ven under
the most favourable conditions no very large amount of action took
place.   When a current of moist warm air was passed through the tube
for an hour a fairly dark picture was obtained.         If the air was dry no
picture appeared.        If amalgamated zinc was used in place of pure zinc
a darker picture was formed, and, as a check on these results, dry and
moist air, both warm and at ordinary temperatures, was passed through
the tube, no zinc being present, and then no action took place. Also
when ozonised air was passed through the tube there was no action.
Passing now from the metals to the organic bodies capable of acting on
a photographic plate, it has been found that they belong essentially, if
not solely, to that class of bodies known as terpenes, and it is a general
property of all this class of bodies when oxidising to give rise to
hydrogen peroxide.          Thanks to Dr. Tilden, experiments have been
made with most of the terpenes, and all were found to be very active
bodies ; both pinene and limonene were tried, in their dextro- and
laevo-rotatory state, but their activity appeared to be the same.         Oxi
dised and     other    compounds      connected with   the terpenes, such as
terpineol camphor, thymol cymene, have no power of acting on a
photographic     plate, but ordinary turpentine and terebene are very
active bodies.
   Most of the ordinary essential oils, such        as bergamot,   peppermint,
pine, lemons, cajuput, &c., have been experimented with, and, without
exception, have been found to be active bodies.         It is well known that
they all contain terpenes.          They are also characterised by a strong
odour, and as ordinary scents contain some of these bodies, it follows
that almost all vegetable bodies having a strong smell are capable of
acting on a photographic plate.         Eau de Cologne gives a good picture,
so do many wines and brandy, and coffee, guaiacum, cinnamon are also
active substances    ;  thus the photographic   plate becomes a very delicate

          active Agent   introducing Photographs in the Bark.             413
test for the presence of all these bodies, and as the action is cumulative
it may even compete with the sense of smell.
   In addition to the essential oils, the ordinary vegetable oils, such    as
linseed oil, which is the most active, and colza and olive, which are
much less active and have much less power of absorbing oxygen from
the air, can act on a photographic plate.  The tetra-paper readily goes
blue if suspended in a bell-jar which has a few drops of linseed oil in a
dish within it.
   The mineral oils are, on the contrary, devoid of this power of acting
on the sensitive plate, and the same applies to bodies such as benzene,
phenol, naphthalene, aldehyde, methyl alcohol, coal naphtha, &c.
   It would seem, then, that all the organic bodies capable of acting on
the photographic plate are capable of giving rise to the formation of
hydrogen peroxide when they oxidise in moist air.
   In former papers it has been shown that the active bodies, both
metallic and organic, are able to act on a photographic plate even
when thin layers of many different substances are interposed; for
instance, if a thin sheet of gelatin be laid on a polished zinc plate it
only very slightly modifies either the sharpness of the picture or the
time required for its production. If the gelatin plate be thicker the
action will still pass through, but the picture will be more indistinct,
and the time necessary for its production longer.        If a 2 per cent.
solution of hydrogen peroxide be poured into one of the small glass
dishes, and a sheet of gelatin O0013 inch thick be placed over it     \
                                                                      inch
above the liquid, a picture will be obtained in fifteen minutes.   If the
sheet  of gelatin  be  0'008 inch thick, then the exposure must be for
one hour; and if the gelatin be 0-01 inch thick, an exposure of three
hours is necessary.      If a sheet of celluloid be substituted for the
gelatin, and it be 0-005 inch thick, the action still passes through, but
more slowly than through the gelatin, and the plate now requires one
hour exposure to give a good picture. With a plate of celluloid of
double the above thickness, the exposure must be four times as long;
and if the thickness be 0-033 inch, the time of exposure has to
be thirty hours.      These determinations  show well what happens in
these cases, but are only good approximations, not standard results.
In addition to gelatin and celluloid, guttapercha tissue, india-rubber,
tracing paper, collodion, albumin, gold beater's skin, parchment, &c.
also allow the action to take place through them, and the obvious
question which presents itself   is,   If
                                        hydrogen peroxide be the body
which gives rise to the action, how does     pass through these different
                                            it
bodies?   Take the definite case of zinc    ;   a plate of this metal be

and it  might have been expected that when the action took place
through even  avery thin sheet of gelatin the picture of the scratches

would have no longer been visible, or at least only indistinctly so, but
experiment shows this is not the case.      How then does the peroxide
permeate    the gelatin % Not  by the ordinary process of diffusion, for
hydrogen cannot diffuse through        so that   it,
                                                must be by a process of
                                                                it
dissolving, or very feebly combining with the medium, or with       con                  a
stituent of       it,
                and thus travelling through escape on the other side.
That the action        of this nature seems rendered probable by the
                            is
following experiments, which show, at least to some extent, what takes
place.
    A   2   per cent, solution of hydrogen peroxide was placed in a dish
with    a   sheet of the thinnest gelatin, about one hundredth of an inch
thick   ;   above     and on the gelatin
                       it                     photographic plate was placed,
                                                       a
and allowed to remain              for twenty minutes.
                                       there                No picture was
formed.    Immediately on removing this first plate from the gelatin,                         a
second one was put in its place, and allowed to remain there also for
twenty minutes.     This plate gave     faint picture, the third one gave
                                                 a                                            a
darker picture, and the fourth one was still darker            but the fifth,
                                                                         ;
sixth, and seventh plates were, as far as could be judged by the eye, of
the same degree of darkness.        Thus the amount of peroxide given off
on the upper surface of the gelatin went on increasing for one hour
and twenty minutes, and then the action became uniform.            The same
kind of action occurs      zinc be used in place of peroxide solution.
                                 if                                                          If
a  thin sheet of gelatin be laid on a piece of zinc and allowed to remain
there for    week, then, on placing above
              a                                 a sensitive plate, a picture
                                                           it
will be produced in about one-third to one-fourth the time which would
have     been necessary           if   the previous      exposure    to the      zinc   had not
taken place.     Celluloid was found to act exactly in the same way as

hours,   itacted in the same way as the other specimens, but required
ten and a half hours before the action became uniform.                           If

It   is thenevident that the action arising from zinc and other active
bodies can, by an intermediate and inactive substance, be carried away
and allowed to expend itself at another time and at another place.
  With regard to the transmission of the action through gelatin, the
water which it contains is probably the body which enables the per
oxide to pass through.    It can also be shown that it aids the trans
mission of the action through other inactive bodies, for instance if
Bristol board in its ordinary condition be placed on a polished piece of
zinc,             of the zinc only slowly passes through
         the action                                         but       it,
                                                                    the          if
board be damp the transmission takes place much more rapidly.      The
following comparative experiments   illustrate this. Two similar pieces
of  Bristol board were taken, one was dried and then placed between                   a
piece of perforated zinc and     sensitive plate and put under
                                     a                          bell jar    a
with calcium chloride   the other piece of Bristol board was suspended
                           ;
over water until    was thoroughly damp, and then placed between per
                      it
forated zinc and       asensitive plate under     a  bell jar with   a little water
present.     Both experiments were continued for twelve days, when               was
                                                                                 it
found that with the dry board there was no picture produced, but
with the damp one there was a good and dark one.                If   copal varnish
be used in place of zinc, similar results are obtained, and                 ifparch
ment be     substituted  for Bristol   board   the results are the same.
   These experiments are however not conclusive, for          it  has been shown
that with additional amount of water some of             it  finds its way to the
zinc, and there induces the formation of more peroxide which may
account for the darker pictures.          Even with the terpenes the additional
amount of water may induce the additional formation of peroxide.
This objection can however be obviated by cutting off the moisture in
the damp medium from the active substance, or by using the aqueous
solution of the peroxide as the origin of the action.            In order to stop
the aqueous vapour from either passing from the damp Bristol board
or to     from the peroxide solution,
         it                                 a  piece of tracing paper       is inter
posed   which   allows  the  action   to  pass through  it, but  not  any appreci
able amount of aqueous vapour.           On placing sheet of tracing paper over
                                                   a
a  glass dish containing the peroxide solution and above             it dry Bristol
boardSvith photographic plate, in one and half hours just an indication
               a                                 a
of   a picture was produced, but when under the same conditions Bristol
board which had been over water for nineteen hours was used, then                     a
dark picture was formed.         Again similar experiments were made using a
not highly glazed paper in place of the Bristol board, and the results
 were the same.
    In place of tracing paper, celluloid was used and the dry Bristol
board gave, under similar conditions, no picture, but the damp one gave
a  very distinct picture. In order to avoid having so much water present,
 plaster of Paris set by        little of the peroxide solution was used in
                                a
 place of the aqueous solution, and exactly similar results were obtained,

416        Dr. W.   J.   Russell.            On Hydrogen Peroxide as the
so there is no doubt that hydrogen peroxide                           can readily pass through
a porous body by the aid of water.
   Alcohol acts in the same way as water, for when plaster of Paris
wetted with peroxide solution was poured into a couple of similar
dishes and allowed to set, and over one a piece of dry and over the
other a piece of Bristol board moistened with alcohol were placed, and
sensitive plates above them, after fifty minutes only a very faint
picture was formed above the dry board, but a daik one over the
wetted board.
  Celluloid is however nearly          transparent to these actions as gelatin,
                                            as
and water in this case cannot       be the transmitting medium, so that the
question is whether there be any constituent of the celluloid which
may act in a similar way to that of water in the gelatin.              From the
following experiments it seems that camphor can do so :          —
   Camphor itself like water is a perfectly non-active body.           To obtain
a thin non-porous layer of this body is difficult, but it is easy to prove
that the emanations from hydrogen peroxide solutions, from zinc,
copal, or other active bodies, are readily absorbed by               and readily  it,
pass through it.        For instance,            piece of camphor be placed
                                                 if      a
about quarter of an inch above                per cent. solution of hydrogen
                                                 a   2
peroxide for seventeen hours and be then removed and placed on                                  a
sensitive plate for fifteen minutes,           gives it dark picture, and when
                                                                  a
a similar experiment             made using drying oil in place of the
                                  is
peroxide solution, and the camphor be exposed to its action for
three days and then brought in contact with the sensitive plate
for one day,   a  dark picture         is
                                    produced.      This action can however be
easily carried still further and proved to pass through even a thick
layer of camphor.       A piece 0-137 inch thick was placed about inch                      \
above  a   2per cent. solution of peroxide             dish, for sixty-six hours,
                                                             in   a
and a sensitive plate placed on the top of              on treating this photo

graphic plate    with  the   developing    solution     was found that
                                                                  it           con          a
siderable amount of action had occurred.            Thus the camphor which                      is   ,.
a principal constituent of celluloid may enable hydrogen peroxide to
pass through it.
   That guttapercha and pure india-rubber should allow the action to
pass through them       isremarkable.     The substance known as guttapercha
tissue has a thickness of about 0'003 inch, and allows the aetion to pass
readily through    it
                    ;   in fact,     even two thicknesses of this tissue Ik
                                       if
placed over the     2   per cent. solution of the peroxide for seventeen
hours, a   dark picture      obtained.

 there for a  fortnight  a  fairly good picture      obtained.

 used,  the  action   will  pass through     the   guttapercha   in  three days.
 With regard to this transmission of the action, although the chemical
 constitution of guttapercha          not well established,
                                        is                           said to be

body related to camphor,* and hence the action passes through it as it
does through celluloid, and this is borne out by the fact that if a piece
of guttapercha be placed for eighteen hours over the 2 per cent. per
oxide solution, and then placed for twenty minutes on a sensitive plate,
it evidently has become active, for it then gives a good picture.
   The above remarks apply also to india-rubber. The thinnest sheet
that has been experimented with is 0-017 inch thick ; this allowed the
action to pass through          it,
                           but was too thick to give    picture, but, like a
the guttapercha,    placed over the peroxide solution
                   if                                      became active,    it
and produced considerable action on      photographic plate.

   With regard to other substances which allow the action to take place
through them, the most interesting are true gold beater's skin, and albu
men.    If Bristol board or paper be carefully painted on one side with
white of egg and allowed to dry in the air,     forms   medium through
                                                                 it         a
which the peroxide can pass.     Collodion also allows the action readily
to pass through it.   In all these cases the tetra-paper may be used to
confirm the results obtained.

through them.      Paraffin     one of them.

over the peroxide solution for twenty hours and then tested by placing
it   on a sensitive plate produced no action.

simply a question of hydration, and                      is   confirmatory of what has been
said before with regard to the action of water.     Some unglazed paper
was painted on one side with two coats of good gum arabic, and some
of    was dried at 55° for some days, and another portion of
     it                                                            was air-       it

   When experimenting some time ago on the general nature of these
reactions, polished zinc was placed below some inactive liqiuds to test
whether any action took place through them.         The small glass dishes
were used, and   a disc of bright zinc laid inside, and the liquid to be
tested poured upon      itthen the photographic plate was placed on the
                           ;
top of the dish.   After remaining there for three or four days the plate
was generally found acted on as       the zinc had been able to exert its

extended, and, as indicating the extreme delicacy of the reaction with
the photographic plates, are of interest.    The form of experiment was
the same as described above, and the liquids used were alcohol, ether,
ethyl acetate, chloroform, benzene, petroleum spirit.     All these liquids

above them no action after a week's exposure took place.      However,
when a zinc disc was introduced below the inactive liquids the photo
graphic plate. was generally acted on, but with the benzene and petro
leum spirit sometimes no action occurred. These rather singular results
were next tested in another way.      Portions of these inactive liquids
were put into stoppered bottles with polished strips of zinc foil, and
allowed to remain there for a week, and it was then found that the

"On Flapping Flight of Aeroplanes."                 By Maurice F. Fitz

   It has been long known, principally through experiments on soaring,
that a large, if not by far the largest, part of the supporting force obtained
by birds in regular flight, is probably furnished by upward air pressure
on their wings, regarded as planes moving horizontally, with their
surfaces slightly inclined to the direction of motion.
                " Experiments on Aero-dynamics " furnish some numerical
   Langley's
data for estimating the power required to sustain an aeroplane of
given weight, propelled horizontally by a known force, and he applies
these to the determination of the problem whether this could be
effected by screw propellers, analogous to those of a ship, actuated by
machinery of existing type.
   The older mathematical investigation by Navier of the problem of
flapping flight, seems to be quite discredited, and, indeed, the results
brought out      always laboured under the physiological difficulty of
demanding an amount of horse power per pound of muscle in birds
which surpassed, to an almost incredible extent, that available from the
better known muscular tissues of other animals.          One horse power is
550 ft.-lbs. per second ; a horse can ordinarily exert about two-thirds
of this, and if we take him to weigh about 10 cwt., we get about a
third of a ft.-lb. per second per pound of horse. A man can work at
the rate of about 50 ft.-lbs. per second ; this, again, is about a third of
a ft.-lb. per second per pound of man ; and so on with other animals.
But, for the flight of birds,     it was made out that from about 30 to
 1300 ft.-lbs. per second per pound of bird were necessary, which, even
after all allowance for higher temperature of their bodies, and large
relative mass of wing muscles, compared with those of the limbs of
horses, men, &c., seemed highly improbable.
   In the following paper an attempt is made to indicate how both
progressive and hovering flight may be effected by aeroplanes, attached
to a heavy mass, and flapped after the manner of wings, under con
ditions sufficiently nearly approaching those of Langley's experiments
to justify the inference, from his figures, of numerical results, not
indeed presumably exact, but sufficiently indicating the order of magni
tude of the quantities involved.          The figures given may be taken,
commercially speaking, as near enough to the truth to enable us to
judge whether we are dealing with pomids or with pence, though not
exact enough to adjust the change out of half-a-crown in paying for
our power.
   Let, then, a heavy mass be supposed          to be flying through the air

                          On    Flapping Flight of Aeroplanes.                 421
horizontally,       and    be       by wings, consisting of planes of
                                 supported
negligible mass, held nearly edgewise to the direction of motion, and
moved vertically up and down by some machinery          carried by the
heavy mass.     Let there be in addition some arrangement of the
machinery by which the angle of inclination of the planes or wings
to their direction of motion is variable. We shall suppose the velocity
of              high, and variations
      progression                     of the propelling force small
enough for changes of forward velocity to be neglected, compared to
the average forward velocity.  This is justified by Langley's experi
ments, which show that,     for small inclinations of an aeroplane, the
direct resistance to forward motion is small compared to the supporting
force.   We shall also, in the first instance, neglect direct air resist
ance on the heavy mass as small compared with that on the aeroplanes ;
and, for convenience, we shall call the heavy mass the bird's body
and the attached aeroplane the wings.
   The case differs from that of a real bird most notably by the circum
stances that the aeroplane in our theoretical case has no mass, whereas,
a bird's  wings have one of very sensible magnitude compared with
that of its body, and the aeroplane is supposed to be moved up and
down, relatively to the mass, as a whole, instead of being pivoted to
it, as  a bird's wings are to its body, besides being of constant area,
which wings are not. Consequently, as before remarked, numerical
results can only be regarded as indicating the order of magnitude of
the quantities calculated, not their exact values.
   The inclination of the wings being variable, and their motion being
compounded of an up-and-down one with          forward one,
                                                       a         evident
                                                                 it   is
that the supporting force may be periodically variable also, and con
sequently the bird's body will move in a sinuous or wavy path, on the
whole horizontal, and the stroke of the wings will be the relative
motion of wings and body.          the horizontal velocity be high, and
                                            If
the amplitude of the wing stroke relatively to the air moderate, and
the variations in the supporting force not too great, the path of the
bird's body will be only slightly waved, so that fig.   may be taken as,

by an engine forming part of the bird's body, when the supporting
force    is,

iorce   is,
        on an average, equal to that required, on an average, to propel
the aeroplane at its average inclination.   Observe that the force P„
depends for  its magnitude, not on  the actual inclination of the -wing
path at all, but on the angle between that path and the plane of the
wing, while its horizontal component depends on both angles, so chat
although, as long as there        any supporting force, there
                                    is                           a resistance                   is
to forward motion along the wing path, there may nevertheless be a
forward force acting horizontally on the whole machine, wings and
body taken together, as in the first position shown, for instance.
   The thing to do, then,         to formulate this in symbols, and for the
                                   is
present purpose     it will suffice to make some simplifying approxima
tions to facilitate the  work. We shall then take        that the inclination        it
of the wing path to the horizontal, and the inclination of the plane of
the wing to the wing path, are both small enough to assume that for
cither of them, as well as their sum, the circular measure, the sine, and
the tangent do not sensibly differ, and the cosine       unity, for example.         is
for 20° circular measure = 0-349, sine = 0-342, tangent = 0363, and
cosine = 0-94 so that, up to this at any rate, we shall not be incur
               ;
ring errors exceeding      or per cent. by this assumption.
                           5        6
   We shall also assume that for small angle (a) of inclination of an
                                                  a
aeroplane to its path, the resultant air pressure      given by the formula     is
Pa = 2£V2 sin a in pounds per square foot, where              velocity in feet        V    is

                   is                                    This agrees nearly
with Du Chemins's formula at small angles, as pointed out by Langley.
   Now let the angle a be varied according to the law
                                    a = m(l             -    /i.   cos 2't),

   By fig.     1   we see that         if F       be the    vertical supporting force,
                             F    =     P.       cos (s + a) = P« sensibly,
since   ($ +   a) is supposed               a     small angle; and          if H be the horizontal
component of P«,

                                                  =    - Po(s + a) nearly.
   This is the resistance to forward motion horizontally, and the work
done against         it,   taking the average rate of working,                      is

   Again,    if     the bird's body be rising at the rate dZ|dt, and the wings
at a lesser rate, dz|dt, the engine attached to the body, which exerts a
downward           force,   F,    on the wings,              is     doing work,     so   that, when   F   is
positive, and —-             (Z   -   .:)   positive,      the engine       does work, and this           is
to be the same work, on the average, as that done to overcome the
resistance of the air to the plane taken along its actual path, and                                       is

applies to flight at 60 feet per second, if the wing area is 1 square
foot per pound carried, 30 feet per second with an allowance of 2

   The principal things to note about the curves are that, in the first
place, W has a minimum value, in this case 2-5 ft.-lbs. per second
per pound carried.       This occurs when j/S cos 6 is infinite, and practi
cally implies that when the rate of flapping is very high, keeping the
same stroke, the horse-power required comes very near the minimum,
and, remarkably enough, the wing becomes, virtually, exactly equi
valent to a plane of area A, inclined at a constant angle a = m,
moving horizontally, as in Langley's experiments.        This is not acci
dental, but seems to follow from the circumstance that 2 W = /xpS cos 6,
and if pS cos 6 be infinite and W finite, p must vanish, and, conse

                         that the bird may be able to fly with the exertion

quite unnecessary.     Further,    appears that, within

  This seems  to bear on the  explanation of the great range of variation

ducks) flapping very fast, others (as seagulls and herons) flapping but
slowly,   without any physiological reason for expecting   material

 There are, no doubt, plenty of other reasons, but until experiments
 can be made on planes or other surfaces flapped by pivoting on an
axis, numerical data for conditions of calculation       agreeing more
nearly   than  those here used with conditions ofj   fact,  seem to be
 wanting.
    Another point brought out is that j S cos 6 has a minimum value
as well as W, but /i has not.    This means that the phase of the wing
motion, relatively to the twisting of the wing (on which the angle a
depends) is important, and if these are out of beat, so to speak, by
more than a certain amount, with a given frequency and stroke, the
flight cannot be maintained at all. The values of /x which exceed

unity imply (on reference    to the equation a. = m (1  - /a cos pt)) that
there is a reversed pressure  on  the wing during part of the stroke, as
shown in fig. 1 at the third position, where P3 is directed partly down
wards.    This condition is however unfavourable, probably in all cases,
to economy     of labour, though it may be favourable to forward pro
pulsion. At all economical rates of working p. is quite small, that
is, the inclination of wing plane to wing path varies but little.
    It may also be observed that, for any value of pS> cos 6, there are
two of W, one of which lies close to its least possible value, and the
other is very large — e.g., for pfi cos 6 = 15, W = 2-65 or about 40,
so that a person who was going on observed values of ^S and took
cos 6 to be nearly unity, might easily overlook the small value of W,
and base his estimate of work on the large one.           This is the more
likely as the curve  of  ^iS cos 6 is of the third degVee, and the solving
of a cubic by a direct process, especially when there are three real
roots, is troublesome, and avoided in consequence.       Whether anything
of this kind occurred in Navicr's or other earlier investigations,     the
present writer is unable to say.      Langley says that Navier added the
work done, here expressed by the right-hand side of equation (A) to
that on the other to find the whole.       Why it should have seemed
necessary to do this is not clear, for if the wing has no sensible mass,
as here assumed, the pressure of the engine downwards cannot exceed
F, and no work can be done by a vertically moving engine, except
that expressed on the right-hand side of equation (A).      The way in
which forward motion is maintained bears some analogy to the process
of so-called
              " invisible " skating, and to screw propulsion, wherein
it would be manifestly absurd to add the work done against the ship's
resistance to that given by the turning moment applied to the screw,
to find the horse-power of the engine.      In fact, the construction of
Langley's whirling table virtually made the aeroplane a portion of a
screw propeller with axis vertical, and his coefficient k has, bound up
in it, the inefficiency of the propeller in converting horse-power of
turning couple into thrust.

Dropper       seem to show that this is by no means the case, but, un
fortunately, he was unable, through uncontrollable circumstances, to
determine the proper value, which is some function of the velocity, and
may possibly be so small as g|3 at his highest velocities.          If so ntY
which is the minimum value of W requires corresponding reduction,
and, in the case taken, the scale of W is about three times too large,
reducing the necessary work to about 1 ft.-lb. per pound carried or
thereabouts.      It is now evident how the energy expenditure of birds
may lie within quite reasonable limits, though we cannot, with any
approach to accuracy, make the calculations for the design of a flying
machine with flapping wings.          We can say it will not in a given case
cost   a  pound    an  hour  for  power, but we cannot tell whether it will
cost only sixpence, or as much as half-a-crown or three shillings.
    To allow for head resistance of the bird's body some term must be
added to the left-hand side of equation (A), which will alter the
absolute term of equation (C) and the £ under the square root in equa
tion (E) so as to increase W, and a number of small corrections of
other kinds might be made, which, however, considering the roughness
of the numerical data we have to go upon, are not worth taking into
account.
    The justification of the assumptions as to the smallness of a and ,*
is best exhibited by a numerical example.           Taking then AV =120
 with A    =  2 square feet per pound of bird, and assuming S = 0-5 (a
stroke of 1 foot) we find that if p = 30 (about 300 downward strokes
per minute, which sea-gulls in regular flight often exceed) and cos 6 =
 1, SpcosO = 15, and W = 2-65; while /* is 0-35, and m is 0-041.
The maximum value of a is then 0'041(1 +0-35) when pt = -r.
This is 0-0554, the circular measure of 3° 10' nearly. The maximum
value of 8, the slope of wing path, is pB|V = 025 ; the circular
measure of 14° 20'; but these do not occur simultaneously.
    It will be found that their sum is a maximum when pt = 0 and is then
0-28, the circular measure of 16° ; thus lying well below the limit of 20'
suggested in the earlier part of this paper.      The body-path, on integra
tion, and taking Z = 0 and dZ|dt = 0 initially, is Z =     - pg|P2 (1 ~ cospl)
and the amplitude is 0-0125 foot.             The body, therefore, pursues
a simple harmonic         path,  whose   average level is about 5/32 inch
below the mean level of the wing-path, and whose total rise and fall
from crest to hollow is almost 5/16 inch.       The relative motion of wing
and body does not sensibly differ from that of the wing alone.
   The investigation of the question as to hovering is far less satis
factory. We might assume, for instance, that the centre of pressure of
the wings followed a circular or elliptical orbit, the plane of the wings
making a small angle with the tangent to the orbit, and being variable
as before, so as to maintain, on the whole, an upward pressure.          If we
make    this  angle a  =  m sin pt, and form the equation d-Z|dt-  =       -
                                                                      g(F 1)

as   before, remembering,     however, that though a may be assumed
small, the angle of slope, s, of the wing path, is not, we shall find, if the
orbit be taken to be circular, m = I|kY2 where V is the velocity of
the motion along the orbit.       In order that m may have values similar
to those in the case of progressive flight, the frequency of flapping
must be much higher, twice as fast, or thereabouts.           But there are
several considerations which render results of this kind much more
unsatisfactory than those previously obtained.           In the first place
the motion assumed is very much less like that of a bird's wing
than in the former case, inasmuch as it involves complete revolution
of the plane of the wing about a horizontal axis in its own plane,
and, in the second place, the edges of the plane are continually cutting
across the eddies, created by their previous motion, in a very different
way from that in which they interfere with those created in progressive
flight, so that the numerical value of k, and the value of the function
of V which is put down as 1 in the formula cPZ|dP = g{F 1) are      -
really unknown, and cannot be inferred from experiments with soaring
 planes, or even propellers.    We can only expect that the actual num
 bers will be tolerably like those given by Langley's and other such
 experiments.
     All that can be inferred, therefore, is that, provided a sufficiently
 high speed of flapping is attainable, we may reasonably anticipate that
 the horse-power for hovering need not differ very materially from that
 for progressive flight. Internal stresses in the wings or machinery,
 due to their inertia, as well as physiological difficulties connected with
 high velocities of reciprocation, may also come in to limit the rate of
 flapping,   and prevent an equally economical      rate of working being
 attainable    in hovering, as in progressive     flight.    A considerable
 simplification of the mere mathematics could have been effected by at
 once assuming that the arrangement        for altering the angle a was so
 contrived as to make the pressure Pa, or its vertical component, F, an
 assigned function of the time; but this has the objection that, there being
 then no expressly formulated relation between a and P or F, experimental
 evidence would be wanting to settle the values of the numerical con
 stants involved.       In fact, the more the mathematical          work is
 generalized, the less definite do the numerical results become, in the
  present state of our experimental knowledge, and this must form the
  writer's apology for working out, in a mathematically clumsy way, so
  limited a case of a problem which has been treated already, in a much
  more powerful and general way, by far abler hands.           For example,
  Thomson and Tait mention, as an example of motion of a solid in a
  liquid, the vibratory and irregular movements of such an object as an
  oyster shell sinking pretty slowly with a swaying motion when thrown
  flatwise into water.    The rate of expenditure of energy necessary to
  prevent its sinking would, if these motions were forcibly produced,

correcting disturbances of     a  rotational kind in both the vertical and
the horizontal plane, but its management plainly cannot involve any
material alteration in the work to be done.          The author conceives it
to be possible,  if not highly probable, that the motion in flying is, in

also to be added to Y, but lead to nothing up to the order of quantities

     During the past six years          I   have been studying the cell-inclusions
found in cancer, and their relation both to the origin and course of
 the disease;     and for this work         I  have    had to examine      1278 cancers
 taken from various organs and parts, and of all possible varieties.                 Out
of this large number of cases there have been a few                   —  nine in all — in
 which the cell-inclusions have been extremely numerous ; so that at
 the growing edge, and even far into the tumour, scarcely a cell could
 be found without an inclusion, sometimes with as many as thirty-six
even of these inclusions in one cell ; and these bodies have been similar
 to those which Mctschnikoff, Buffer, and others, as well as myself,
 have regarded and described as parasites, standing in causal relation
 ship to the disease.         In two out of the nine cases mentioned, these
 bodies have been present in enormous numbers ; and I have succeeded
 in isolating from tho last of these remarkable cases, an organism,
 which is pathogenic, in a peculiar manner, to certain animals, and
 whose virulence         I have been able to keep unimpaired for some
 months.
     Previous Work on     the  Experimental Production of Tumours in Animals.
     The only work, I think, that needs mention here in connection with
  this heading is that of Sanfelice, in Cagliari, and of Boncali, in Borne.
  Sanfelice has produced tumours in animals with organisms which he
  isolated from infusions of various fruits ; and they both have isolated
  organisms from cancers, which, I believe, from their descriptions — I
  have not seen their cultures — are morphologically somewhat similar to
  those   I   am about to bring before you.                 But Sanfelice's organism
  appears    to have  been     very    difficult  to  isolate  in a virulent form from
  human cancer, and to keep virulent ; so that in his last paper,* he
                            *  '
                                 Zeitschrif t fur Hygiene,'  1899.

432       Mr. H. G. Plimmer.           Note upon certain Organisms isolated
treats only of the organisms derived from fruit infusions, and of their
effects upon animals.           Most of their statements are doubted by the
German pathologists, including such a good observer as Baumgarten.
But, from my own experience, I do- not find any reason to doubt any
of Sanfelice's statements; and I think that he deserves the greatest
credit for removing the study of the setiology of cancer from the
histological to the experimental region of work.
                          On the Method    of Isolation  adopted.
    The cancer, from which the organisms I describe were isolated,
and with       which my experiments have been made, was token from
the breast of a woman, aged thirty-five years; it had a history of
only two months' duration, and it was growing rapidly at the time
of the operation.          Immediately after removal, I examined a fresh
scraping, and, finding such an extraordinary number of the bodies
I have mentioned in the cells, I cut, with all possible precautions
against contamination,            with a carefully sterilised knife, very thin
slices    from the growth, which I placed with a little of the juice
scraped from the cut surface in a flask containing the following liquid,
which was of course carefully sterilised.             This medium consisted of an
infusion made from cancer, just as the ordinary beef infusion is made,
to which was added, after careful neutralisation, 2 per cent. of glucose
and    1  per cent. of tartaric acid.          This medium was the outcome of
many trials with all kinds of mixtures, and I tried it in this case as I
had already got similar organisms to grow in it from two previous
cases ; but they had no pathogenic properties, and this, I think, was
due to the omission           of the next step. This medium, too, is particu
larly    useful,  as hardly any bacteria, however hardy, will grow upon it.
    Then, remembering that in the body these organisms were under
anaerobic      conditions,    I  exhausted   the air from my flasks, and passed
hydrogen into them, finally sealing them up. This                   I have found is of
great importance as regards the maintenance of the virulence ; and                     I
find, consequently, that there is no falling off in the virulence of my
cultures, which are as active now as they were four months ago.                  Five
flasks were      made  in   this  way, but,  in  spite   of  precautions, two became
contaminated with moulds ; in the other three, however, I got, after
from three to five days, a pure culture of the organism                    I descrilie,
and which has been kept growing in this and various other media
ever since.
                          Morphology and Relation       to  Media.
    The organism        is   apparently a saccharomyces ; but I am informed
 that,    according   to some authorities (such as De Bary, Cuboni, and

       from Cancer, and their Pathogenic Effects upon Animals.         433
Duclaux),   the Saccharomycetes are nothing but the developmental
stages of fungi which really belong to either the Phyco-, Asco-, or
Basidio-mycetes.     Moreover, they state that in some species of myce
lium-forming fungi, single parts, especially conidia, can grow in the
saccharomyces form on certain nutrient media : so      I will not attempt
to locate this organism at present.     Sanfelice and Roncali, however,
definitely state that the organisms they have isolated are Blasto-
mycetes.
    When grown in the medium described, these organisms produce a
cloudiness   which becomes visible in about forty-eight hours, and
increases till about the sixth day, when the growth sinks to the
bottom, the medium then becoming clear ; no scum or pellicle is
formed.
    When grown on this medium solidified with agar, the organisms
form small round colonies which remain separate ; after some weeks
the colour, which was originally white, becomes yellow ; the colonies
do not attain a much greater size than those here shown.
    Gelatin is not liquefied, but the growth on this medium is never
luxuriant.     On potato, a thick white layer is formed, which in about
two weeks will cover the entire surface, changing then to a yellowish-
brown colour.
   They will grow aerobically, but not so well, at any rate at first ; and
they lose their virulence in a short time if continuously grown in this
way.
    Microscopically, they are round bodies, frequently growing in
 clumps, with a nucleus which stains deeply, and, in most cases, with a
thin, strongly refractile capsule, which sometimes shows a double con
tour ; but some young forms can be seen which are apparently with
 out a capsule.   The size varies from 0-004 mm. to 0'04 mm.
    Their reproduction appears to be by budding, but I have fancied
that I have also seen, in a few instances, endogenous budding ; of this,
however, I am not certain.
    These bodies correspond morphologically with those found in the
 original tumour, and also with those described by Buffer and myself,
 and by some others of those who have worked at the microscopical
 appearances of cancer.
                            Experimental Results.
    I have selected, from the experimental work which I have done with
these organisms, those experiments which seemed to me to be the most
 important.    Up to the present, I have not been able to make any
 experiments upon such animals as would allow of the easy bringing of
 these organisms into contact with a likely epithelial surface, with
 the exception of the cornea (vide Experiment     4 below); but, through

434    Mr. H. G. Pliramor.       Note upon certain Organisms isolated
the kindness of Dr. Bradford,     I have been enabled       now, at the Brown
Institution, to inoculate a   bitch in the mamma;, but the time is as yet
too short to enable me to make any statement as to the result.
   The cultures used in the following experiments were made in the
medium previously described.
  (1) Rabbit.
               — Intravenous injection    of  5   c.c.   of an eight days old
            culture.
          No obvious result.
          The rabbit was killed thirteen weeks after and found appa
            rently normal.
               —
  (2) Babbit. Intraperitoneal injection of 10 c.c. of a twenty-one days
            old culture.
          No obvious result.
          The rabbit was killed eight weeks after and found apparently
            normal.
               — Subcutaneous    injection of                               old
  (3) Rabbit.                                   5   c.c.  of a three days
            culture.
          No obvious result.
          This rabbit was used later for experiment No. 4, and when
            killed, fourteen weeks after this experiment, was found
            normal ; nothing was found at the seat of injection.
  (4)  Rabbit. — Both cornese were scraped, and the sediment of a ten
            days old culture rubbed over them.
          The rabbit was killed in forty-eight hours.
          There was considerable proliferation of the corneal epithelium,
            which had forced its way into the subjacent tissue.
          The organisms were found in the epithelial cells, after fixing
            and staining, with appearances similar to those of the inclu
            sions in cancer cells, as described by Ruffer and myself.
   (5) Rabbit. — Trephined and inoculated beneath the dura mater with
            5 c.c. of a seven days old culture.
          The rabbit died in nine and a half days ; wound healed.
          The brain and cord contained the organisms in large numbers.
            Pure cultures were obtained from brain, liver, and kidney.
            Nothing obtained from blood, spleen, or peritoneal fluid.
  (6)  Rabbit. — Trephined and inoculated beneath the dura mater with
            5 c.c. of a three days old culture, made from brain of No. 5.
          The rabbit died in eight days ; wound healed.
          Organisms found in heart, blood, brain, and cord.           Pure cul
            tures made from brain, cord, kidney, and liver.
   (7) Guinea-pig. — Subcutaneous injection of 5 c.c. of a ten daj-s old
            culture.
          No obvious result.
          The guinea-pig was killed in fifteen days, and was found appa
            rently normal ; nothing was found at seat of injection.

      from Cancer, ami their Pathogenic Effects upon Animals.              435
                 —                      injection of   10 c.c. of a three weeks
  (8) Guinea-pig. Intraperitoneal
          old culture.
          Died in twenty days.
          Liver, lungs, and peritoneum studded with new growths of a
             white colour ; lymphatic glands in abdomen enlarged. Pure
             cultures made from liver, lungs, and abdominal glands ;
             nothing obtained from blood.
           Sections of the above mentioned     parts showed new growths of
             an endothelial   nature,   with the organisms within the cells,
             and free in the tissues.
                  — Intraperitoneal injection of 10 c.c. of an eight days
  (9) Guinea-pig.
          old culture, made from abdominal glands of No. 8.
           The guinea-pig died in seventeen and a half days, and showed
             the same appearances as No. 8.
           Cultures were made as before, and also from the blood. In this
             case the omentum was also studded with new growths.
  I have given here some of the failures and successes which have been
constant; and I should like to add that Professor Wright, of Netley,
has repeated some of the experiments       I   have made, and that his results
coincide with mine.
  The important point, of course, of all this is — the experimental        pro
duction of malignant tumours in animals by an organism isolated from
a malignant tumour in man.      That these experimental tumours are, so
far, of endothelial origin  is due   to the fact that until I was enabled
to inoculate a dog, I found it very difficult to get the organism in con
tact with likely epithelium ; all the above methods of inoculation, save
one, could only bring them into contact with endothelial surfaces.
No. 4 (the corneal experiment) is the only one in which an epithelial
surface was tried; and in this case the great proliferation of the
epithelium, the appearances of the organisms in the cells, and the
irritation produced, are very striking. But the fact of being able to
excite a malignant growth with an organism isolated from cancer            is,   1
think,a  point of some importance in the aetiology of cancer.
I    am at present experimenting with the view of observing the effects
produced by these organisms when brought into contact with epithelia.
   The deductions which      think may fairly be made from these obser
                             I
vations and experiments are as follows —   :
   (1) That there are certain cancers, which occur very rarely, in which
there are, in enormous numbers, intracellular bodies of the kind
described by Ruffer, myself, and others, as parasitic Protozoa.    (From
the rarity of these cases and their comparatively acute course, one          is
tempted to think that they are not due to the same cause as ordinary
cancers;  but there      really no more difference between them and
                        is
ordinary cancers than between acute and chronic tubercle.)

  On the Gastric Gland of Mollusca and Decapod Crustacea : its
      Structure and Functions."                 By C. A. MacMuxx, M.A.,
      M.D. Communicated by Dr. M. Foster, Sec. E.S.                         Keceived
      February 23 — Eead March 9, 1899.
                                      (Abstract.)
   In 1883   I communicated       a paper*    to the Royal Society, in which         I
described   the occurrence      of    a  pigment    closely    resembling   vegetable
chlorophyll in the so-called liver of Invertebrates, and in 1885 a further
contribution in continuation of the same subject, which was published
in the ' Philosophical Transactions' (Part I, 1886).
   I named this colouring matter " enterochlorophyll," because after
comparing it with all the animal pigments and plant pigments known
to me, it seemed to resemble, both in its chemical and spectroscopic
characters, the chlorophyll of plants.
   In the latter paper, I endeavoured            to describe the microscopic cha
racters of this pigment, as it was found in the digestive gland, and 1
applied all the tests then considered to be distinctive of chlorophyll to
the solutions of the pigment.           I found that whereas enterochlorophyll
appeared to be a chlorophyll, or a modified chlorophyll, it yet differed
in some respects from chlorophyll, as it is obtained diredly from fresh
green leaves.     Some recent writers have called in question the right to
call this pigment       by the above name, so I have reinvestigated the
whole subject.
   It was, however, necessary first of all to study the histology of the
digestive gland, or gastric gland, as it is now named, and the micro
scopic characters of the pigment found in it.               This has been done by
Max Weber and Frenzel for the gland of crustacea, and by Barfurth
and by Frenzel for the gland of mollusca.f
   As can be gleaned from these observers, great difficulties attend the
preparation of this gland for microscopic observation.                  I found after
 numerous failures that formol is the best fixative, used in stronger
solution than it usually is employed in vertebrate histology.                 Thus it
is necessary to employ solutions containing           from   20    to 30 per cent. of
                a  'Roy.  Soc. Proc.,' vol. 33 (1883), p. 370.
                t  References are given in tje complete paper.

           and Decapod Crustacea : its Structure and Functions.                              437
 formol.        After from  to 24 hours the preparation is transferred to
                             12
 alcohol of 95 per cent.,  and, when hard enough, to a mixture of alcohol
 and ether, and finally into a solution of celloidin.    When this is set,
 the preparation is cut either in the ordinary way, or by the freezing
 microtome.     Clearing is done by means of oil of sandalwood, or oil of
 origanum. The sections were stained in various ways, but the best
 results are obtained with haemalum, followed by eosin as a plasma
stain. I also used mucicarmine, thionin, "Soudan III," and other
stains for special purposes.    In this way very satisfactory preparations
 can be obtained, and the celloidin keeps all the gland constituents
in situ.
    The glandular epithelium in the crustacea contains, according to
Max Weber, two kinds of cells, hepatic cells and ferment cells.
Frenzel subsequently called them fat-cells, or fat-holding cells, and
ferment-cells.    That of mollusca contains, according to Barfurth,
hepatic cells, and ferment cells also, which Frenzel again re-named
granular cells and club-cells. Now the sharp distinction drawn between
these kinds of cells by these observers is found not really to exist, and
we meet with transition-forms between them. The coloured contents
of these cells, in the case of either ferment-cells or granular-cells, or
fat-cells, are coloured by either enterochlorophyll or by a lipocbrome,
or by both.
    It was, however, mainly my object, after having studied the histology
of the gastric gland, to find out if I was really justified in calling this
colouring matter enterochlorophyll, and if it has properties which class
it among the chlorophylls, to find out how it gets into the gland, and
so on.
   It    is impossible here to refer more fully to the histology of the
 gland,     that
           so     I  shall merely give an account of the observations on
 the pigments found in it.
    The only way in which any pigment giving a banded absorption-
 spectrum can be readily identified          is,
                                        of course, by means of the spectro
 scope, but since spectrum analysis alone     attended by certain fallacies,
                                                    is
 one has to fall back on spectrophotometry.     This being     quantitativea
method gives the most accurate results of all.       Of course elementary
analysis,   ifapplicable,  enables one at  once  to decide  the identity or
non-identity of pigments, but unfortunately the pigments with which
 we are now dealing cannot be prepared in pure, or even in an approxi
                                                      a
mately pure, condition for this purpose with our present knowledge,
owing to their being mixed with fatty matters and other impurities.
   The spectrophotometer which have usedI            modified form of that
                                                          is   a

introduced by the brothers Kriiss       others were suggested by me to

     -When a     solution    of  plant-chlorophyll in alcohol solution is com
  pared with a similar solution of enterochlorophyll by means of curves
  obtained with the spectrophotometer, these curves do not correspond ;
  but when we convert the plant-chlorophyll into the " modified " form,
  or, what is the same thing, the slightly acid form, by means of acetic
  acid, and allowing the solution to stand for a few hours, and then com
  pare the respective solutions, we find the maxima and minima of the
  curves follow each other so closely as to lead one to conclude that the
  pigments are closely related to each other.
     Again, if hydrochloric acid is added to a solution               of plant chloro
  phyll in alcohol, and to a solution of enterochlorophyll in alcohol, and
  these two solutions are examined by means of the spectrophotometer,
  a remarkable     agreement is noticed.
     The numbers taken for these measurements                are the percentages of
  the unabsorbed light, as the latter enable curves to be more easily con
 structed than by taking the co-efficients of extinction.
     I have also examined         Lankester's " chaetoptcrin,"* and I find the
 curve obtained by the spectrophotometer follows closely that of entero
 chlorophyll and that of modified chlorophyll.                  But chsetopterin is
 soluble in glycerin, while enterochlorophyll is not.
    While examining Chcetopterus at the Plymouth Laboratory, I found
 that an alcohol solution of the contents of the intestine, in the neigh
 bourhood of that part of the gut coloured by chaetopterin, gave exactly
 the same spectrum as a similar solution of chaetopterin itself.                 The
 discussion of the inferences to be drawn from this observation may.
however, be left for the present.
    I have seen enterochlorophyll present in a finely granular form in
the intestinal epithelium of Patella, and in the pseudo-villi of the
glandular stomach of the same mollusc one can sne crowds of leuco
cytes, some of which are insinuating themselves between the columnar
epithelial cells. The inference, of course, is that the leucocytes carry
away those substances which have been taken up by the epithelial
cells in a more or less digested condition.              Some have supposed that
these granules are being excreted into the lumen of the gut, but in my
opinion, based upon a study of numerous sections of invertebrate
gastric glands, the excretion of enterochlorophyll by means of the
gland cells — belonging to the various kinds mentioned — takes place into
the lumen   of  the alveoli,  acini, or  tubes of  the gastric gland, and from these
ice can trace the excreted gland-cells into tlie intestine.
    From all these and other observations I have been forced,                 I must
confess against my inclination, to believe that enterochlorophyll is a
pigment which primarily has been taken up from the intestine dissolved
in a fatty     medium,     and    is carried   either by leucocytes, or in some
other   way to be deposited          with this fat, and perhaps other reserve

stability, as compared   with plant chlorophyll, is due to the fact that it
has been altered by the action of the digestive juices.    Such derivatives
of complex mother-substances are, as is well known, much more stable,
and less prone to change than the parent pigments.

                                 (Abstract.)
    The genus Matonia has long been known as an isolated type among
existing ferns. It is represented by two species, M. pectinata K.
 Brown and M. sarmentosa Baker, both confined to the Malayan
region. Matonia has not hitherto been examined anatomically, and
its reference by several writers to an intermediate position between
the Cyathcaceae and Gleicheniaceae, is based on the structure of the
sorus, which, in the small numbers of sporangia and in its circular form,
resembles the latter family, while the presence of an indusium and the
position of the annulus afford connecting links with Cyatheaceous
ferns.
    In Matonia pectinata the frond has a characteristic pedate habit, with
numerous long pinna} having slightly falcate linear segments, practi
cally all of which appear to be fertile. The sori are circular in form
and indusiate, consisting of about eight large sporangia with an oblique
incomplete annulus, containing sixty-four tetrahedral spores.           The
dichotomously branched rhizome, which grows on the surface of the
ground, is thickly covered with a felt of multicellular hairs, and gives
rise to long-stalked fronds from its upper face, and a few wiry roots,
which may arise from any part of the surface of the stem.
    The full paper deals more especially with the anatomical structure
of Matonia pectinata.    The material which rendered the investigation
possible   was  generously supplied by Mr. Shelford, of the Sarawak
Museum, Borneo, to whom the author wishes to express his hearty
thanks.
    The stem is polystelic, and of the gamostelic type      ; there may be
two annular steles, with the centre of the stem occupied by ground-
tissue, or in shorter branches of the rhizome a third vascular strand
may occupy the axial region.      Each stele consists of xylem tracheids
and associated parenchyma, surrounded by phloem composed of large
sieve-tubes, with numerous sieve-plates on the lateral walls, and phloem

parenchyma ; an endodermis and pericycle surround each stele, and in
the case of the annular steles these layers occur both internally and
externally.      At the nodes the outer annular stele bends up into the
leaf-stalk,   and a branch is also given off from the margin of a gap
formed     in the inner annular stele ; the axial vascular    strand may or
may   not   be in continuity with the meristele of the leaf.   The petiole is
traversed by a single stele, similar in shape to that of     certain Cyathe-
aceous ferns ; towards the top of the leaf-stalk the stele   alters its form,
and gradually gives off separate (J -shaped branches          to supply the
pinnae.
    The most interesting feature in the structure of the pinnules is the
marked papillose form of the lower epidermal cells.        The roots have a
triarch stele enclosed by a few layers of thick brown sclerous cells.
   In structure Matonia pectinate presents points of agreement with
several families of ferns, on the whole approximating more closely to
Cyatheaceee than to any other family ; but the peculiarities are such
as to fully confirm the conclusion previously drawn from external
characters that Matonia should be placed in a separate division of the
Filices.
   After comparing the structure of the Malayan species with that of
other fern genera, the paper concludes with an attempt to give an
account of the geological history of the Matonineae.             The genera
Laaopteris and Matonidium        are dealt with at some length, and
reference    is made to other Mesozoic ferns, which may probably be
included in the same group.
    The data furnished by an examination of palseontological evidence
lead to the conclusion that in Matonia we have a survival of a family
of ferns, now confined to a few localities in Borneo and the Malay
peninsula, and represented by two living species, which in the Mesozoic
epoch had a wide geographical range, being especially abundant in the
European area.

  Note on      a new Form of light Plane Mirrors."        By A. Mallock.
      Communicated by Lord Eayleigh, F.R.S. Keceived February
      28,— Eead March 9, 1899.
   Having recently, in the course of some experiments on air waves.
had   occasion to make use of some very thin films as coverings for the
openings of resonators, it occurred to me that such films, if stretched
over rings with edges ground to a true plane, might be used as plane
mirrors, and the following note records the results of the trials made
with this object in view.
   The best films were obtained by letting a few drops of a solution of
pyroxyline in amyl acetate spread on the surface of water and lifting

                 Note on a new           Form of light Plane Mirrors.             441
the film, left after the evaporation           of the solvent, on a ring previously
placed beneath the surface.
    Good films can also be obtained in this way from copal varnishpbut
they are more difficult to handle, and the intrinsic strength of the
material is not nearly as great as that of pyroxyline.
    In order to lift the films off the surface of the water without folds,
and without getting any of the parts doubled, it is desirable that the
ring used for the purpose should be not less than half an inch deep, i.e.,
a length of half an inch cut off a tube of the required diameter, or a
strip half an inch wide bent into a circle and the ends joined. If the
                                             '
depth is less than this the overlapping part of the film is liable to be
carried round the lower edge by the capillary action of the water, and
to spread itself irregularly on the under surface of the stretched part
while being lifted.
    The ring should be rested on a wire tripod with long turned-in feet
so that the pyroxiline solution may spread well beyond its edges before
encountering the tripod legs ; and, in order that the film while being
lifted may not be broken by the drag of the water enclosed by it and
the ring, air should be introduced inside the latter through a pipette
during the process. A little practice makes it quite easy to secure uni
form films with certainty in this way.
    After removal from the water the film should be allowed to drain
for some minutes until the surface is free from drops, and it may then
be stretched over the worked ring whose edge is to form the boundary
of the mirror.       In order to do this the worked ring is placed on a
circular support some inches in height and a little larger in diameter
than the ring itself.     The film, which at this stage of drying is tough
and    extensible, is  then  laid in position over         it,
                                                      and the lifting ring
forced downwards until the film tears away.         will be then found that
                                                         It
 the film    left well stretched
            is                    over the  worked ring and adherent to its
edge and side.
   The lifting rings should be about half an inch larger in diameter
than the worked rings.
   If the film not much more than twenty-thousandth of an inch
                   is                                a

 I   found at first great difficulty in silvering the films in fact as the
                                                                   :

                           is
dried,  afair coating  of silver may be obtained.
   It seems essential that the amyl acetate should be completely evapor
ated,  and this being accomplished, the other requisite                 is   absolute
surface cleanliness both of the film and the silvering bath.

 442           Note on a nciv   lorm   of li'jlit Plane Mirrors.
     To ensure this requires considerable care. The film after being washed
  should be dried as quickly as may be in a warm drying chamber, and
  it iswdvisablo not even to touch the ring with the hand until its sides
 are quite dry.     The dish also in which the silvering solution is placed
  must be carefully washed just before use, first with nitric acid, then
 with water, and finally with distilled water ; but on no account should
 it be wiped or touched with the hand.
     Before taking these precautions, I never succeeded in getting even
 a tolerable silver surface, though I tried many other devices which
 need not now be described.        Even the best results I have hitherto
 obtained are not quite satisfactory, so very ready are the films to lay
 hold of any kind of scum with which they may be brought in contact.
     The best material for the mirror rings I found to be glass, which is
 much more easily ground to a true surface than most of the metals I
tried, and suitable rings of very thin glass may be easily obtained by
cutting up beakers or test-tubes with a glazier's diamond in a lathe.
     The edges may then be quickly ground to a plane on a flat lap with
coarse emery or carborundum (which I prefer), and finished with fine
emery, though as the edges need not be polished it is not necessary
 to use nearly such fine emery as is required for ordinary optical
 surfaces.
     The most important point in getting the edge of the ring to a true
plane, is to use a very light pressure in grinding, and the thinner and
weaker the ring the lighter the pressure required.
     When the grinding is well done, the definition given by reflection
from the stretched film is quite equal to that of a worked glass surface
of the same area, at any rate up to 2 inches or 2A inches diameter,
and up to this diameter also it makes no preceptible              difference
to a reflected pencil of rays whether the plane of the mirror is vertical
 or horizontal, showing that the weight of the film has no appreciable
effect in determining its form.
     The weight of these mirrors is practically the weight of their support
ing rings, and with reasonable care a 2-inch ring may be made
weighing considerably less than 10 grains, and although it will prob
ably be impossible to rival with them the brilliancy of silvered glass,
there are I should think many cases where good definition, and extreme
lightness are requisite (as for instance in the suspended mirrors of
photographic     recording instruments) in which such mirrors as these
might    be useful.

    I  have the honour to report the results of my observations        since my
arrival here (Calcutta) on December 21, 1898.
    2.  Major Ronald Ross, I. M.S., after demonstrating and explaining to
me his method of dissecting the mosquito, showed me in prepared
specimens the pigmented bodies met with in the stomach walls of mos
quitoes fed on birds infected with Proteosoma, and also the changes
which these bodies undergo day by day. Finally he demonstrated to
                              "
me the " germinal threads        in cysts in the stomach wall, in the fluids
of the body, and in the cells of the veneno-salivary glands.
    3. On my arrival there were in the laboratory, in test-tubes, several
series of mosquitoes which had fed on birds infected with Proteo
soma on the nights of November 30, December 10, December 12,
December      15, and December     20.

444              Dr. C. W. Daniels.         On Transmission      of
    Of  each  of these series   Major Ross dissected specimens, and demon
strated    in them the     same   bodies that he had already shown me in
prepared specimens.        He pointed out that in the older mosquitoes it
was possible to predict from an examination of the fluid obtained on
                                                                      "           "
cutting the thorax the nature of the contents both of the coccidia
(the term employed by Ross)* in the stomach, and of the cells of the
veneno-salivary glands.
    These points I readily observed.
    4. Of the mosquitoes referred to I day by day examined those
which died, and others which I killed. In these I was able to repeat
the observations and, in insects belonging to the earlier series, to trace
the changes in the size and in the nature of the contents of the
" coccidia."
    I  also examined     a large   number     of mosquitoes caught about the
laboratory, and others which had been raised from larvae.             In none of
these did I find either " coccidia
                                       "
                                         in the stomach wall, germinal threads
in the body fluids, or germinal threads in the cells in the salivary
                            " black          "
glands ; nor did I find              spores (Ross).
    5. Major Ross informed me that his published results were based on
observations made in the hot season, when the temperature was 80° F.,
or over ; and that now, as it was the cool season, I should find the
changes progress more slowly, although the sequence of events was the
same.     My observations      on  the mosquitoes   fed on December         20 and
December 15 showed that this was the case.           Major Ross also informed
me that, with the lowered temperature, mosquitoes fed less readily,
and that more difficulty was experienced in rearing them to a spore-
bearing age.
    These difficulties the use of the incubator was only partially success-
ful in overcoming.
    6. On the evening of January 1, following exactly in Major Ross's
lines, I commenced a repetition of his main experiment :—
    A large number of grey mosquitoes, reared from larvae, were
released in two mosquito nets.
    In net No. 1 four birds were placed. On December 31 I had
 already found Proteosomata in large numbers in three of these birds,
 and in the fourth in moderate numbers.
    In net No. 2 two birds, in whose blood no Proteosomata had been
 found, were placed.       These two birds died two and three weeks later ;
 on dissection no black pigment was found in their organs.                Repeated
 examinations of their blood had failed to discover Proteosomata.
    On January 2 none of the mosquitoes had fed, and on January 3
 only two in net No. 1 and eight in net No. 2.                   On January 4,
 which was a warm night with a minimum temperature of 59-2" F..
 sixty-three mosquitoes were found in the morning gorged with blood
           * See note by the Malaria Committeo appended   to this Report.

                    Proteosoma      to Birds     by the  Mosquito.                   445
in net No. 1, and were caught in separate test-tubes which were then
plugged with wool and placed in the incubator. Of the control series
in net No. 2, where the non-infected birds had been placed, eighteen
were caught and treated in the same way.
   On the following two evenings, with minimum temperatures of 60-7°
and 63*2°, sixty-three and forty-six mosquitoes were fed on the in
fected birds, net No. 1, and were kept for the preparation of speci
mens; and twelve mosquitoes were fed on the non-infected birds,
net No. 2, bringing the number of the control series up to thirty-eight.
At a later date eighteen mosquitoes were fed on a blue jay with numerous
halteridia.
   On the third day the sixty-three mosquitoes, from net No. 1 (with
exception of those previously killed for examination or which had died)
were released inside a clean net free from other mosquitoes.                       Birds
free from Proteosoma were also placed in this net.*
   In  the morning all mosquitoes found inside were collected.                  Most of
them had fed well. The minimum temperature during the night had
been 63-2° F.
   The mosquitoes were not fed on the following night as they were
full of blood which most of them voided during the night. Many died
next day.
   The remainder were given the opportunity of refceding every night
after this ; but as a spell of cold weather set in with minimum tempera
ture of 44 — 49° F. (only on one night did it exceed 50° F.) few fed
well or at all, and there was a consequent continued heavy mortality.
Only one insect, which subsequently escaped in the night, being alive
on the 10th day.
   This method of feeding was very unsatisfactory in exceptionally
cold weather.      During the day the mosquitoes being kept warm in the
incubator rapidly digested their food, whilst at night the cold rendered
them torpid and they did not feed.
   The control mosquitoes,         of net No. 2, were treated           in exactly the
same manner, being fed on birds free from Proteosoma.                     The last died
on the 13th day.
    7. The results of the two series are         as follows  : —
    Of sixty-three mosquitoes fed on proteosomal               birds, forty-nine were
   * This is the method Boss employs      to re-feed mosquitoes.    If infected birds are
employed to re-feed the insects, a younger generation of coccidia is produced ;         I
therefore used sterile birds for this purpose.
   The method works fairly well in warm weather, but there is always some loss, as
the full number is never collected again in the morning. As the process is repeated
over and over again, this loss becomes serious, the more so the longer the period
required for maturation of the coccidia. Moreover, in a frequently repeated
process of this lind there is always the possibility of an outside mosquito getting
inside the net, and to that extent vitiating the experiment.

446                Dr. C. W. Daniels.         On Transmission of
            examined, three were reserved for sections, one was too much
            decomposed for satisfactory     examination ;         ten    were    not
            accounted for, having been lost in the nets.
   Of the forty-nine examined two were killed on the first day, — that
is, under twenty-four hours, and possibly under twelve hours after they
had fed   no coccidia were found in these. Two more were examined
           ;

                                       is
twenty-four hours after they had fed no coccidia were found in these.
                                              ;
   In two examined about     p.m. of the same day, that

                                                           under forty-
six and possibly not more than thirty-four hours after they had fed on
the infected birds, minute pigmented coccidia were found.
   The remainder were examined on the following days. The largest
numbers (eighteen) were examined on the fourth and (twelve) on the
seventh days, as on these two days the mortality amounted to this.
  In all these mosquitoes, with one exception, coccidia were found —
usually in numbers    in one there was only one coccidium.
                        ;
   The exception occurred on the ninth day but as by that time the
                                                       ;
insects had been re-fed several times, the mosquito in question may
have been an outside one which had effected an entrance.
  Of forty-five mosquitoes fed on the infected birds and examined,
more than thirty-four hours after, forty-four contained coccidia.
  This   may say

                        is   a                                                    I
lave     seen.
   The other two series of mosquitoes were used by all of us for the
preparation of specimens, and no record was kept of the number of
non-infected insects. Judging from my own examination, only about
three-quarters of them developed coccidia.  Their treatment had been
somewhat different, as for several days half of them were not in

and nine are unaccounted      for — lost in the nets.    None of the
twenty-nine were examined on the first day, but one was on the after

examined on what would correspond to the fourth and seventh days,
four were examined on the fifth and four on the sixth days.* In none
of these twenty-nine were coccidia found.
   Of the eighteen fed on the blue jay with                halteridia, twelve were
examined         from two to     six   days    after   feeding;   none    contained
coccidia.

  8.    The    coccidia   (pigmented  bodies) found on the second day
measured       6— 7   n, some  of them a little more.  They were oval
bodies containing scattered         granules      of    black pigment, and      had a
sharp, clear outline.
  I  incised the stomach of infected mosquitoes and by repeated wash
ing and compression with a cover glass was able not only to wash out
the contents, but even to express the loosely attached epithelium, so
as to leave the stomach a transparent clear bag.         The majority of
coccidia remained fixed to the outer wall, though in one of the
mosquitoes I observed a few coccidia escape with the epthelium.         On
subsequent attempts    to detach  the coccidia by this process I failed  to
do so, though some coccidia would be ruptured.
   The next morning the smallest coccidia measured 10 p; some were
12 ft.   On the sixth day they were met with up to 30 /i; by this time
the pigment had absolutely as well as relatively diminished.
   In another three days some of them reached 60           and in the last
                                                                li.

of the     series examined      (tenth day),      there were   coccidia    measuring
70 /*.
  The coccidia could now be seen to project from the outer wall of
the stomach; very few contained pigment, and that only in small
amount.
  Some of the coccidia were clear, and others had   granular appear

ance  but
       ;  in none were either black spores or germinal threads to be
seen.
   9. For the observation of the further development of the coccidium
the early deaths of the mosquitoes, owing to the inclemency of the
weather, rendered this series useless.
   One of the insects infected on the night of January     and another5,
infected on January       did reach this more advanced stage and in
                           7,                                               ;

                                             5,
ruptured cysts, as well as numerous cysts containing mature germinal
threads were found by me in the stomach wall, these threads were also
found in the body fluids and in cells in the salivary glands.        In one
of the mosquitoes infected on January          which died on January
                                                   5,                             1   9,
the coccidia   had  an appearance of striation.
   In consequence of the effects of the unfavourable climatic conditions
on the experimental insects, my observations on the development of
the proteosomal coccidium were mainly made on mosquitoes infected
November 30 and subsequent dates before my arrival, and on some
infected on December 22.
   On adding salt solution (15 grs. to the ounce) to an ordinary slide
containing an infected mosquito stomach, and pressing on the cover
glass,   projecting coccidium was ruptured
           a                                       the contents poured out
                                                           ;
into the  fluid, leaving the cyst wall still attached  to the stomach.
   The contents were seen to consist of         mass of shrivelled threads.
                                                       a

448             Dr. C. W. Daniels.        On Transmission of
This appearance      I frequently observed    in the other series of infected
insects already mentioned.
   These threads, Ross's germinal threads, are sickle-shaped bodies, about
14 or 15 n in length.      They stain with logwood or methyl blue, but
not strongly.     On adding water or Farrant's solution they lose their
shrivelled appearance,'and become more rounded. Nearer one end than
the other   is an unstained portion (? nucleus).      They show no signs of
movement ; but as they are invisible in water, and only become visible
when shrivelled by the salt or stained,     it may  be doubted   if they have
been seen alive.
   If the thorax of the mosquito at a somewhat more advanced stage in
the development of the proteosomal coccidium is incised, similar threads
will be found in the fluid exuded, if salt solution is added. In this case
ruptured cysts can be found in the stomach wall.
   The relation of the infection to the veneno-salivary gland involves
a difficulty not met with in any other part of the examination.
   The dissection of the stomach is easy ; that of the salivary gland in
its entirety is not, and for some reason appears to be more difficult in
the old infected mosquitoes.      Any rough manipulation results in the
detachment of the cells, and little more than the duct is left. In most
cases, however, even in old infected mosquitoes, one entire gland, or
portions of both, can be exposed in fair condition.
   In every case where this was done, and in which germinal threads
were found in the body-fluids, the germinal threads were also found
in some of the cells of the salivary gland. I failed to find similar
threads in the large number of salivary glands obtained from unin
fected mosquitoes bred from larvae, or caught about the laboratory, or
from mosquitoes at the earlier stages of proteosomal infection.
   The affected cells, as they have a granular appearance, can be dis
tinguished with a low power ; the unaffected cells are quite clear.
   With a high power, if not very numerous, the isolated germinal
threads can be clearly distinguished in the cells ; they are recognised
by their peculiar shape and shrivelled appearance (the examination
must be made in salt solution).       If numerous, the individual threads
can be better   made   out in the cells  of the salivary gland than in the
coccidia of the stomach wall ; but, as in the case of the latter, pressure
on the cover glass will rupture the cell, and the germinal threads are
then poured out.
   The threads do not fill the cell. There is a faintly granular cres-
centic portion on the side most remote from the duct which, in many
cases at least, is free from threads.     The part of the cell in which the
threads lie must be nearly fluid, as    it permits oscillation of the threads
to take place.
   The whole of the veneno-salivary gland is never involved.           In one
dissection made by Ross the cells in both middle lobes and in no other

                  Proteosoma    to    Birds    hy the   Mosquito.                  449
part of the gland contained the threads.    In several instances, where
one gland has been exposed entire, the middle lobe alone has been
involved ; but in the majority all that can be stated with certainty is
that the cells in one portion of the gland contain threads, and that
those in other portions do not.
   On these points I have satisfied myself by repeated examination,
though the appearances are by no means difficult to make out.
   I have gone at some length into the description of this matter, as,
so far, we have found no satisfactory method of making permanent
preparations. All the preservatives at our disposal, with the exception
to some extent of weak formalin solution, wrinkle up the delicate cells ;
and I have no confidence in this agent as a means of making perma
nent specimens.
   The following specific observations made by myself on mosquitoes
dissected by Major Ross, Dr. Eivenberg, of the American Mission,
 who is working with Dr. Ross, and myself may be of interest : —
   (<t)
        Coccidial cysts full of apparently mature germinal threads ; no
          ruptured cysts ; no germinal threads in the body-fluids or
          salivary glands.   Two observations.
   ('/) Cysts  full of germinal  threads ; other ruptured empty cysts ;
          germinal threads in body-fluids ; germinal threads in salivary
          glands.    Over twenty observations.
   (/-) Empty cysts in stomach wall ; germinal threads in body-fluids of
          thorax; germinal threads in salivary glands; no cysts still
          containing germinal threads.    Two observations.
   ((/) Empty cysts only in stomach wall ; no germinal threads in body
          cavity ; no germinal threads in well exposed salivary glands.
          One observation ; the mosquito had been infected four weeks
           before death.
  These observations fully confirm Ross's statement in every point.
They indicate that the threads are formed in the coccidia ; and that
the germinal threads escape into the body cavity on the rupture of
the coccidia, to be again collected in the salivary glands.
   I should have liked to extend the series, but the continued cold
weather renders it improbable           that   I   shall be able to do so before         I
leave.
    10. The infection of birds        free from Proteosoma            by the bites of
mosquitoes.
  On December 20, the day before my arrival, twenty-two birds were
examined and found free from Proteosoma.     On that night some of
 these       were used for feeding the mosquitoes which had been
          birds
 infected on November 30     and on the 24th and subsequent days
                                (?)                                                      ;
 the remainder of the birds were used for feeding the mosquitoes first
 infected on November      30   and December            10,   12,   and   15.   In other

    450              Dr. C. W. Daniels.    On Transmission    of
   mosquitoes of this series germinal threads were found in the salivary
   glands ; and those which fed, when examined later, gave the results
   indicated in paragraph 9.
       On December 30 Dr. Eivenberg       and myself examined these birds ;
   three of them had Proteosoma,      two in large numbers.
       On January 4 I examined them all except one which died on January
   2 ; in this bird the heart's blood contained     no Proteosomata, and the
   organs were free from pigment.
       Five more of them had now Proteosoma ; in every instance the para
   sites were very numerous.       On January 6 and 7 I again examined
   them ; three more had Proteosoma, also in large numbers.
      On January 9 no more cases had developed ; but on January 1 8 one
   of the birds had numerous Proteosomata.        It was also ascertained that
   many of these birds      which previously had  been found to lie infected
   had now recovered, whilst others showed but a few Proteosomata.
      Thus twelve out of twenty-two birds (54 per cent.) became infected.
  This compares unfavourably with Eoss's earlier results, as, in his pub
  lished series, twenty-two out of twenty-eight (79 per cent.) were
  infected.    But it is to be remembered that at the time this result was
  obtained the germinal threads were found at the end of a week ; whilst
  in December the development was much slower, and took at least twice
  the time.     It- is much easier to keep mosquitoes alive during the first
  week after feeding them than it is to keep them alive for any subse
  quent period ; moreover, in hot weather, such as Ross had worked in.
  mosquitoes bite more readily.
      These results appear less unfavourable, if they are considered in
  connection with observations on the normal proportion of wild, uncaged
  birds, infected with Proteosoma at this season.    Thus, earlier in the year,
  Ross, out of 111 wild birds, found Proteosoma in fifteen, or 13-5 per
  cent. ; whilst I found at this season only one out of thirty, or 3-3 per
  cent. affected with Proteosoma.
     It is possible that in the cold season the birds have a greater power
 of resistance ; the validity of this conjecture is rendered more probable
 by the short duration of the proteosomal attack in my infected birds.
 Of the twelve, five died within the first week. In three of the survivors,
 in which the Proteosomata had been very numerous, no parasites could
be found ten days after the commencement of the invasion ; in one in
 which they were never numerous none could be found on the fifth day.
In the other three very few are now found, though at first they were
numerous.
     The recovery of these birds and the death of the mosquitoes fed on
them diminishes the chances of much future work on this line during
the time remaining to me here.
     11. Mention has been made of the differentiation of the coccidia
(previous to the formation of the germinal threads), according to the

                  Proteosoma   to Birds by   the Mosquito.               451
 appearance of their contents, into clear and granular; the evolution
 of the latter into the coccidia containing germinal threads can be
traced day by day.    This differentiation was clearly visible in my series.
   In  a  minority of the coccidia, and in most infected mosquitoes,
when    the  germinal threads are mature, certain black tubular bodies
are to be found in cysts with otherwise clear contents.         These black
tubular bodies were frequently met with in the series of mosquitoes
infected in November and December.         Most of these mosquitoes con
tained some coccidia with black tubular spore-like bodies; though
in a few insects all the cysts contained germinal threads only. In
some cysts the black spores were numerous, and occupied the entire
cyst ; in other cysts there were only a few. In most instances germinal
threads were not found in the black spore-bearing cysts ; but there
were a few such cysts in which it was doubtful whether germinal
threads were present or not, or whether the appearance arose from
over-lying threads which had escaped from a neighbouring capsule.
   These black spores are very resistant ; I have seen some which had
been kept in water for months by Ross, and which had undergone no
visible change. They withstand irrigation with liquor potassa;.
   When the cysts are ruptured the black spores are to be found all
over the body of the mosquito, but not included in cells. They do not
seem to accumulate in any particular organ.
   The most plausible view of the nature of these black spores seems to
be that held by Major Eoss, viz., that they are
                                                     "
                                                        resting spores," and
that through them, by another cycle, the Proteosoma can be propagated
in conditions unfavourable for direct propagation by mosquito-insertion
into a warm-blooded animal.
   If this be the case, three courses suggest themselves :—
   (a) From the black spores may arise bodies capable of non-parasitic
          life (and possibly of reproduction), which at certain stages
          of their existence, and in certain conditions, on introduction
          into  a warm-blooded    host   by inhalation, through drinking
          water,  or even by injection by a mosquito or other blood
          sucker  in transferring them from the medium in which they
          live, may resume parasitic habits.
   (b) That they may      be ingested   by mosquito   larvae,  and in them
          undergo   such development as wiL result in the formation of
          germinal threads in the adult mosquito, which, in turn, may be
          injected into the appropriate bird.
   (c) That they may, if swallowed or inhaled by an appropriate warm
          blooded host, so develop as to reach the circulation and pass
          into the sporulating phase.
   Such experiments as have been made on this subject are inconclusive;
and it is obvious that until the nature of these "black spores" is
   V0L. LXIV.                                                    2 M

  452                Dr. C. W. Daniels.      On Transmission of
  determined       we cannot exclude, even for Proteosoma         of sparrows, the
  possibility of any one of the many possible alternative channels of infec
  tion.     Intervention of the mosquito intermediate host may be only
  an occasional requirement.
      Still less are we justified in concluding that malaria in man can only
  be acquired through and directly from the mosquito ; or in devoting our
  attention exclusively to that channel.
      12. I have made myself familiar with the Proteosoma in sparrows,
  and the Halteridium in pigeons and crows.
      In one specimen of a " blue jay," also, I found a very abundant
  Halteridium infection ; the parasites in this instance had some peculiari
  ties which I hope to work out if we can procure more of these birds.
  The bird I had died before I had completed my observation ; I have
  preserved the organs as well as specimens of the blood in the heart.
      13. In the cardiac blood of this jay there were numerous filariae.
  They were sheathless, sharp tailed and fairly active, and had locomo-
  tory movement.          They were of two sizes ; in the shorter the tapering
  of the tail was much more abrupt than in the longer.              Neither showed
. any extension or contraction.
      Adults of one species only, three females and five males, were found
   in the subcuticular connective tissue, and in that round the trachea.
      They were much longer and thicker than Filarias ckiva (Wedl) or
   than the filaria described by Mazzini in the pigeon.
       The females have the usual double ovary terminating in a vagina
   which appears tubular near the vulva situated near the caudal end of
   the body.       The mouth is terminal and unarmed ; the anus is sub-
   terminal.
       The male has two spicules of equal length.           The thickness of these
   worms,     and   the fact that when placed      in weak formalin (2 per cent.)
   the cuticle burst in its entire length, will make them suitable for deter
   mining some of the disputed points in the anatomy of the Filaridae.*
       14. The difficulties in connection with human malaria are increased
   by the present plague scare.            The suspicion of the natives about
   inoculation, makes them averse to any intercourse with European
    medical men.
       By rewards       however    we have been able to get two fair cases of
    tertian fever, and      three cases with crescent plasmodia — two of them
    with crescents in considerable        numbers.    On these    cases we  have fed
    mosquitoes — the common grey, and two varieties of
                                                                    " dapple wings "
       * Judging from the description of the embryos, it is probable that these blood
    worms of the Indian blue jay arc identical with those found by Manson in Amoy,
    China, in the magpie (Pica media) and the gray mina (Qracupica nigricollit), in
    which case the mature form of one will be found to lie in the pockets of the aortic
    and pulmonary semi-lunar valves (vide 'Journ. of the Queckett Micro. Club,'
    vol. 6, p. 130, No. 41, August, 1880).

(large and small) in most points closely resembling those in which
Ross had previously found pigmented cells after feeding on a patient
with crescents. So far our results have been negative ; but, in view of
the peculiar climatic conditions, and of the possibility of the first stage,
that of formation of coccidia, being inhibited by the cold, we are not
prepared to accept these results as conclusive.
    15. With Major Ross, I have examined the organs of some persons
(eight) who died of kala azar. This appears to be an infectious disease,
indistinguishable at first from malaria.        Chronic in character, it
continues for months and becomes associated with enlargement of the
spleen and liver, and progressive anaemia.       The present opinion of
most of those who have been deputed to investigate kala azar, as
well as of those with longest and most intimate experience of the
disease, is strongly in favour of the view that it is malarial in origin.
    The melanin or black pigment was absent in the organs of some of
the cases I examined ; but in all but one yellow pigment was present
 in the liver, and in most in the kidneys and spleen also, indicating
 haemolysis.   The iron reaction with acidified potassium ferrocyanide
 was obtained in the spleen in three instances and, in one, in the liver
also.
  So abundant and chronic a haemolysis in cases of malaria, continued
moreover after the parasite has ceased to be present (at any rate in
sufficient numbers to be found in the peripheral blood or to cause
appreciable deposit of melanin in the organs), raises the important
question as to the possibility of the differentiation of parasites, with
imperceptible morphological differences, by their toxic or haemolytic
properties.
  . 16. Haemoglobinuric fever seems to have been fairly common of late
in some parts of India.        I am collecting information, and have
requested the editor of the ' Indian Medical Gazette,' to insert in
that Journal a series of questions on the subject.       Haemoclobinuria
does not occur in kala azar notwithstanding the great amount of
haemolysis which takes place in that disease.
    I regret the length of this report, but the main subject of       it,
                                                                   Major

454     On Transmission   of Proteosoma    to Birds by tlie Mosquito.
;i development in the mosquito of Proteosoma in birds ; and to judge
from their structure and mode of growth so far as yet observed,             I
take them to be corcidia," he is using the generic term " coccidium," to
describe some phase in the growth of the species of a distinct       genus,
Proteosoma.
   Apparently,   what Major Ross intends to indicate by the term              '
" coccidium " is an
                     ovoid   firmly walled corpuscle which increases in
volume from about 1 /2000th inch in length to four or five times that
size, and then breaks up into a mass of filiform spores radiating from a
central granular mass.
   In this mode of spore formation these bodies have resemblances to
the true coccidia, which present themselves not only as oviform cor
puscles but as cysts with sickle-shaped or filamentous spores.         It is,
however, not legitimate to apply the generic term      "  coccidium
                                                                     "

phase of growth of another      genus. — Lister, Chairman of the    Malaria

  five cents a day; for reserved books there are
  special rates and regulations.   Books must be
  presented at the desk if renewal is desired.
