2         Prof.    J. J.  Thomson.        On  the Effect produced by     [May 2,
p. 270),     I have    shown that  if   Maxwell's theory that electricity moves
like a perfectly incompressible fluid is not true, the rate of propaga
tion of very rapidly alternating currents along a wire placed at an
infinite distance from other conductors cannot be the same as the rate
of propagation of the electrodynamic action through the surrounding
dielectric. As Hertz, in his experiments on the rate of propagation
of electrical waves along a metal wire, found that these rates were not
the same, it might appear that this proved unmistakably that Max
 well's theory is untenable.        I  wish in this note to show that, assuming
Maxwell's theory, we can explain the smaller velocity of propagation
along wires found by Hertz, by taking into account the capacity of
the wire, if the wire is not at a very great distance from other con
ductors ; in fact that the capacity of the wire produces much the same
effect as the "compressibility" of the electricity which is supposed
to exist in all theories other than Maxwell's.           In the case of a " free "
wire in the laboratory, the electrical effects produced by the walls and
floors are indefinite.        I shall, therefore, consider on the most general
theory the case of a wire surrounded by a coaxial metal cylinder, a
case where the electrical conditions are perfectly definite if the elec
trical oscillations are very rapid.
   I shall consider the case of a cylindrical wire surrounded by a
cylindrical sheath of dielectric, which in its turn is surrounded by a
third substance, either a conductor or another dielectric. The axis of

   Thus in this    case, even    if  v  equals v, that is, if Maxwell's theory is
correct, the rate of propagation of the disturbance along the wire will
not be the same as that of electrodynamic action through air ; and
yet the conditions may be such as to allow a disturbance to pass
over several wave-lengths before falling to 1/e of its original value.
It will be noticed that the velocity of propagation does not depend on
the specific resistance of the wire, and that it increases with the
rapidity of the reversal, and that the rate at which the vibrations die
away is independent of the resistance of the wire, and only varies
slowly with the resistance of the outer conductor, since a only enters
in the form log a .
   We can see the reason of this if we consider the amount of heat
 produced in the outer conductor.

 section of the wire, then, assuming in the investigation that v = v,

Thus this case would afford a definite means of testing whether or not
Maxwell's theory is true.   The thickness of the outer tube would be
immaterial, as with these very rapid vibrations the currents are
entirely confined to the inner skin of the tube.
   By comparing the results for this case with those of Case II, wc
see that if the rate at which the electrical disturbances die away

through the wire must be the same as that through the dielectric if
Maxwell's theory is true.

way in which    the resonator was used was different from Hertz's
method.   Two wires of equal length covered with gutta-percha and

 surrounded by tin-foil, connected at both, ends with the earth, were
 fastened close to the balls of the resonator ; the other extremities of
 these wires could more 'along the wires LM, NO respectively.      When
 the coil was working, sparks passed between the balls of the reso
 nator, and it was found that the intensity of these sparks depended
 on the position of the points P and Q, to which the extremities of the
 wires of the resonator were attached.       The experiments    made to
 determine the velocity through the wire were as follows : the end Q
of one of the wires of the resonator was placed at 0, the end of the
 wire NO and the extremity P of the other wire moved along LM
 until the sparks in the resonator were as faint as possible ; the dis
tance PjM, when this was the case, was about 5 metres.          We may
conclude that in this position the points Px and 0 are nearly at the
same potential. The end of the other wire was then moved along NO
until the sparks were again as faint as possible ; the position Qj, when
this was the case, was such that Qt0 was between 10 and 10'25 metres.
Since the sparks are again a minimum, we may conclude that Pj and
Q] are again at nearly the same potential, hence the potentials at Qj
and 0 must be very nearly equal, but when this is the case, QjO
must be very nearly a wave-length ; the wave-length in the wire LM
 was found in a similar way to be also about 10 metres. Hence the wave
length of the electrical vibration in the wire must in this case be
about 10 metres, but Hertz has shown by the interference of the direct
electrical waves, and those reflected from a large metal reflector, that
the wave-length of the action propagated through the air from this
vibrator is also about 10 metres, and the length of the wave must be
approximately the same in our experiments as the resonator which
responded to the vibrations was of the same dimensions.          So that
in this case the velocity of propagation through the wire is the same
as that through the air.
    Since the sparks between the balls of the resonator never actually
 vanish, the determination of the places where they are as faint as
 possible is a matter of judgment, and thus the method is not capable
of any very great accuracy.       I  found, however, on comparing my
 results with those of another observer, Mr. E. Everett, that the two
sets agreed within about 2 feet in 10 metres.
   The rate at which the disturbances die away was determined by
a preliminary experiment. In this only one wire was used, and this
was carried over the laboratory until when the resonator was used in
the way described by Hertz no sparks passed between the balls ; the
length of wire necessary for this was more than twice as great for
copper as for German silver wire of the same diameter. Thus the rate
of decay depends on the material of which the wire is made, and,
therefore, by the above investigation the velocity through the wire is

     [On repeating the experiments after       the Easter Vacation, an effect
was observed        which may explain the difference between the valne of
the wave-length         along the wire fonnd in the above experiments and
those of Hertz.         It happened that the plates after the vacation were
placed     further    from   the wall than they had been before, and it was
fonnd that the wave-length was much less, being now between seven
and eight metres ; on moving the plates nearer the wall the wave
length increased, the increase being evidently dne to the increase
in the capacity of the plate produced by the proximity of the wall.
Thus if the distance of the plates from the walls was different in
the determination of the wave-length along the wire from what it
was in the determination of the wave-length through air, the wave
lengths would not be equal even if the velocity of propagation were
the same.         I  endeavoured to determine the wave-length in air by
measuring the distance between the nodes after reflection from a
large metal screen, but could not succeed in fixing the position of
the nodes with sufficient definiteness to determine the wave-length
 with any accuracy. The fact, however, that          I got a wave-length in
 the wire the name as that obtained by Hertz through air, is sufficient
 to show that it is not necessary to suppose that the velocities through
 the wire and air are different, but that the difference in Hertz's results
 may have been due to a change in the position of the vibrator rela
 tively to the walls of the room. — May 15.]

      Although selenic acid was prepared by Mitscherlioh so far back as
  the year    1827, few chemists appear to have studied its properties.
   This want of interest in selenic acid is rather surprising, seeing that
   it possesses so close a relationship to sulphuric acid, which is so
   important a compound. Finding the chemistry of selenic acid so
   meagre, we resolved to make an investigation of this body, with the
   view of bringing, so far as we could, its chemistry abreast with that
    of sulphuric acid, and also in the hope that its study would yield
    results which might throw additional light on the relations of the
    latter acid.    The following pages contain the results at which we
    have arrived.

  14         Prof. Sir C. A. Cameron and Mr.      J.  Macallan.   [May 2,
               Preparation of Anhydrous Selenic Acid, H2Se04.
     Selenic acid has hitherto been known only in a dilate form. When
  heated to about 260° C. it commences          to decompose into sele
  nium dioxide, oxygen, and water, which prevents any further concen
  tration.    Berzelius describes it as containing, when of greatest
  strength, 4 per cent. of water ; but since his time it has been obtained
  in a more concentrated condition by Fabian, who, by evaporating the
  acid to a temperature of 265°, found it to have a strength of 94-9 per
  cent., and by placing this acid, while still hot, under the receiver of
 an air-pump, increased its strength to 97-4 per cent.      Sulphuric acid,
 as is well known, has not been obtained in a perfectly anhydrous state
  by ebullition — although in its case decomposition does not occur ; for
  when it reaches a strength of about 98-66 per cent. it boils without
 further change.      When, however, an acid of this strength is sur
  rounded with a freezing mixture, the anhydrous acid, HgS04. crystal
 lises out. An attempt was first made to obtain anhydrous selenic acid
  by similar means.     Great care was taken to obtain an acid of pure
 quality. An examination was specially made for nitric, sulphuric,
 hydrochloric, and hydrobromic acids.       Selenious acid, when present,
 was removed by diluting with about 30 parts of water, saturating
 with hydrogen sulphide in the cold, filtering and concentrating on the
 water-bath. The acid thus treated was then examined for sulphuric
 acid and found to contain none.     A portion of the acid, when ignited,
 left a residue equivalent to 0'07 per cent. of the anhydrous acid
 present in the specimen used in the experiments ; this was ascertained
 to consist of neutral sodium selenate, and was, of course, derived from
an acid salt, of which it was necessary to take account in the suc
ceeding experiments.
    Some of this acid was gradually heated until the temperature rose
 to 250°.    It was next poured into an open dish, and allowed to cool
slowly over sulphuric acid, under an exhausted receiver.      The strength
 was then taken with seminormal soda solution, which was specially
 prepared for those experiments, by making a solution in water of pure
caustic hydrate prepared from sodium, and bringing it carefully to
the required strength : 11'81 cubic centimetres of soda solution were
required for neutralisation by 0-4371 gram of acid, equivalent to
97- 75 per cent. of selenic acid, being thus a little stronger than that
obtained by Fabian in a similar way.
    The acid thus concentrated was then poured into a stout wide glass
tube, having one end closed,     and the open end fitted with an indiu-
rubber cork, through which passes a glass rod for the purpose of
keeping the viscous liquid stirred, and a capillary tube for admis
sion of air, in order to expose the acid to the full atmospheric pressure.
The necessity for those precautions in the case of sulphuric acid has

 1889.]     On Selenic  Acid and   other Selenium Compounds.           15
 already been fully pointed ont by Marignac (' Annales de Chimie,'
vol. 39, 1853, p. 184), the discordant results arrived at by various
observers being probably due to the different conditions under which
they worked. The latter precantion is particularly necessary, as we
have observed that sulphuric acid occupies less volume in the solid
than in the liquid state.
    The temperature of the acid was then gradually lowered.           Its
viscosity increased as it became colder, until at a temperature of
 — 51-5° C. it was as thick as soft pitch — the tube might be inverted
without the acid flowing, and a glass rod could be moved in it only
 with great difficulty. Still it did not freeze, until after vigorous
stirring maintained for a couple of minutes, a crystal appeared, and
then the entire mass almost instantaneously crystallised, the tem
perature rapidly rising. When removed to a warm room, the crystals
were rather permanent, and when nearly melted, recrystallisation
could easily be induced by exposure to moderate cold so long as any
crystal remained, showing that previous to freezing the acid had been
in a more or less superfused condition. It was found to be impossible,
 however, to separate the crystals by draining the liquid portion, as
the latter was so viscous that it carried the crystals with it. Under
the microscope they were seen to be long prisms.
    An attempt was next made to examine the conditions under which
selenic acid becomes strengthened in a vacuum, with the object of
obtaining, if possible, a more concentrated acid ; and the following
arrangement was made for the purpose : — The glass receiver of an
air-pump was fitted tightly at its neck with an india-rubber cork,
through which passed a bent tube, connected           horizontally with
another and wider tube containing solid potash.     This was connected
 with a wide (J -tube, filled with pieces of potash about half an inch
long, and kept cool by immersion in a beaker of water.       Connexion
 was then made with a small stout flask containing the selenic acid, and
varying in size from 100 to 250 cubic centimetres as required. The
potash-tube next the receiver was intended for the purpose of pre
venting acid fumes from injuring the air-pump, and for the same reason
a vessel of potash was placed within the receiver.        The air-pump
employed gave a very good vacuum ; when all the connexions were
made, and the pump exhausfed, there was ofteu scarcely any appre
ciable difference in the levels of the columns of mercury in the gauge.
For temperatures up to 100° the flask containing the acid was heated
in a beaker of water ; for higher temperatures oil was used. Sonn after
commencing the experiments it was found necessary to make an
arrangement for the purpose of stirring up the viscous acid and
exposing fresh surfaces to the vacuum, and the following plan was
devised : — A test-tube, which fitted easily the neck of the flask, was
shortened by removiug evenly a portion of the open end. It was

then inverted and pushed down into the flask, so that when the open
end was below the surface of the acid, the closed end extended suffi
ciently far into the neck of the flask to prevent the tube from being
thrown down by the ebullition of the liquid.             The vapour given off
from the acid within       the  tube   became   gradually expanded as the
temperature rose, and passed in a stream of bubbles through the acid,
keeping it well agitated. The tube also served the purpose of pre-
venting splashing from the boiling acid up into the neck of the small
flask.
   Some selenic acid, which had been previously partially concentrated,
was kept in an open dish on the water-bath forfour hours and its strength
then determined     : 0'6364 gram required for neutralisation 14' 72 c.c
of seminormal soda solution, equivalent to 83¦68 per cent. of selenic
acid — a strength intermediate between a monohydrate and a dihydrate.
The acid thus obtained at 100°, under the ordinary pressure of the
atmosphere, was stronger than that obtained by Graham from dilute
sulphuric acid by heating it to the same temperature in a vacuum
until it ceased to lose weight — the dihydrate, H2SO+,2H20, remaining
showing the greater affinity for water possessed by the latter acid.
   Selenic acid, concentrated as above described, was poured into the
flask previously referred to, and gradually heated. Weak selenic acid
commenced to pass over at 56°, evidenced by the potash liquefying
and effervescing, owing to the presence of potassium carbonate which
it contained, being the ordinary commercial potash.              It was then
heated slowly up to 100°, kept at that temperature so long as any acid
distilled over, and the strength of the residue taken : 0'9432 gram re
quired for neutralisation 24'10 c.c. of seminormal soda solution,
equivalent to 92¦44 per cent. of selenic acid.            Subsequent to this
experiment,    acids  heated  on  various  occasions   to  100° were found to
have the following percentages of anhydrous selenic acid : — 92¦03,
92-08, 93-28, and 93-70 ; the different results being found due to the
varying conditions of the experiments, such as the length of time of
heating, the quantity of potash, and its proximity to the acid, the
amount of the latter, and the size of the flask containing it.
   The acid which had been heated to 100°, was next heated to 150°.
At the latter temperature the more or less dilute acid distilling over
appeared in the form of dense white fumes resembling those of sul
phuric acid. 0-6898 gram of the residue left neutralised 18'42 c.c. of
seminormal soda solution, equivalent to 96'58 per cent. of selenic acid.
It was again heated to 150°, and kept at thnt temperature so long as
any acid distilled over : 0'417 gram of the residue left neutralised
11-21 c.c. of seminormal soda, equivalent to 97'25 per cent, of selenic
acid.
   A   fresh portion of acid was heated to 155° and kept for some time
at that temperature : 0-8045 gram of the residue neutralised 21 -72 c.c.

next heated to 162°, and the strength of the residue taken : 0'7201
gram neutralised 19'72 c.c. of seminormal soda, equivalent to 97¦85
per cent. of selenic acid.
    The same acid was then heated to 216°, and the residue obtained
was allowed to remain in the flask during the night. In the morning
it was found to be frozen into a crystalline mass so hard that it was
necessary to use a steel chisel in order to remove portions for examina
tion.    When dissolved in water and tested it was found to contain
some selenium dioxide. Trials were then made to ascertain if a lower
temperature would produce a similar result without decomposition of
the acid; 180° was found to be sufficient for the purpose, and the fol
lowing course was finally adopted : — The acid, which had been con
centrated on the water-bath as far as possible, was heated gradually
in the flask to 100°, and kept at that temperature so long as any acid
distilled over, the greater part of the water being thus removed.        The
 IJ-tube   was     then  disconnected,   emptied,  and   refilled with  stick
potash.     The flask was next heated gradually to 180°, kept at that
temperature until no more acid distilled over, and then immediately
 cooled.   A still better arrangement was to use so little acid that it
 was unnecessary to change the potash.          The acid was heated gradu
 ally and continuously up to 180°, allowing bubbles to pass slowly
 through  it,   as before described.    When 180° was reached the potash
 was watched, and as soon as    it    ceased to be acted upon the flask was
 immediately cooled.       An hour or less was generally found sufficient
 time for a small quantity of acid.
    A specimen obtained in this way was found, when examined, to be
 very free from selenium dioxide, a little of   it  diluted with water and
 saturated with hydrogen sulphide, merely giving     a   faint yellow colora
 tion without any precipitate. Another portion was acidified with
 hydrochloric acid and barium chloride added; on boiling the filtrate
with stannous chloride   it    only became darkened in colour without uny
 precipitation of selenium.       0'6725 gram was taken to estimate the
 strength:    18'54 c.c. of seminormal soda were required for neutralisa
 tion, equivalent to 99'73 per cent. of selenic acid. 0'724 gram of
 another acid, prepared in a similar way, but which contained rather
 more selenium dioxide than the last, required for neutralisation
 19'94 c.c. of seminormal soda, equivalent to 99'64 per cent, of sele-
 uic acid.   A   portion ofa    third acid, weighing 0'329 gram, was dis
 solved in water, barium chloride added, and also hydrochloric acid in
 order to prevent any selenious acid from precipitating. The resulting
 barium selenate weighed 0'6337 gram, equivalent to 99¦75 per cent.
 of selenic acid.     As has been already mentioned, the acid employed
 contained an acid potassium selenate equivalent to 0'07 per cent. of
 neutral sodium selenate found. Taking this into account, and calcu-

lating on the acid with the sodium selenate deducted, the three results
become respectively —

    The difference between the above results and 100 per cent. must be
ascribed partly to the very hygroscopic character of the acid in the
anhydrous condition, and consequent slight absorption of moisture
during the process of weighing.       It is necessary to observe, however,
that in making the above calculations, and all through in this paper,
78'87 has been adopted as the atomic weight of selenium, the number
                                            '
given by Meyer and Seubert in their Recalculations of the Atomic
 Weights.'     If 78-80, the number given in Clarke's ' Recalculations,'
 be taken, the three results become — ¦

    Petersson and Ekman state that the results of a great many
analyses show that the most probable atomic weight of selenium is
 7908 ('Berichte Deutsch. Chem. Gesell.,' vol. 9, p. 1210). If this
nnmber be taken, the above percentages become respectively —
                      I.                II.              III.

     The results arrived at from the foregoing experiments lead to the
conclusion that at 180° in a vacuum,, selenic acid parts with all com
 bined water, and remains as the anhydrous acid, H2Se04.
     It may be well here to summarise the precautions necessary to be
 taken in preparing the anhydrous acid, so far as we have ascertained
 them.     They are briefly as follows : — To use for the purpose an acid
 as pure as possible, to have a thoroughly good vacuum, to avoid too
 high or prolonged heating, and to keep a sufficient quantity of solid
 potash in close proximity to the acid all through — which may be
 arranged by using a small flask, and having the tube leading from it
 short and wide.
                    Properties of Anhydrous Selenic Acid.
     Anhydrous selenic acid is a white crystalline solid melting at 58° to
  a colourless oily-looking liquid.   When thoroughly melted it remains
  in a superfused state, and usually requires to be cooled to about 5°
  with constant stirring before it again freezes.     The temperature then
  rises rapidly to 583, and remains stationary until complete solidifi
  cation of the acid has taken place. When at rest it can be cooled
  lower than 5° without freezing, and it will remain in a stoppered
  bottle for months, and during frosty weather, in a liquid condition.

1889.J       On Selenic   Acid and   other Selenium Compounds.           19
It instantly   solidifies at any temperature below 58° if a crystal of the
solid acid be dropped into it, and it freezes sometimes at ordinary
temperatures when rubbed with a sharp piece of glass or with the
point of a pipette. It thus exhibits the property of superfusion in a
remarkable degree, and to a greater extent than anhydrous sulphuric
acid, which, according to Marignac, possesses eminently the property
of superfusion (' Annales de Chimie,' vol. 39, 1853, p. 184).           ItB
melting point, 58°, is higher      than  that of anhydrous sulphuric  acid,
lO-a", but lower than that of telluric acid, which may be heated
nearly to redness without melting.
    Anhydrous selenic acid crystallises in long interlacing hexagonal
prisms. In an impure condition from the presence of selenium dioxide
and other substances, its melting point is lowered, and under those
circumstances it is sometimes deposited slowly and spontaneously in
the form of double pyramids, many of them intersecting in pairs.
    Although much has been written upon the freezing-point of sul
phuric acid, but little information appears to be published regarding
its crystalline form. It is stated, however, in Graham's ' Chemistry,'
 vol. 1, that the most concentrated        acid, when frozen, often yields
 regular six-sided prisms of a tabular form. Chaptal describes the
crystals as being six-sided prisms terminating in pyramids with six
faces.     Both accounts agree in placing them in the hexagonal system.
 In order to see if the appearance of the crystals agreed with either
of the above descriptions, some sulphuric acid was strengthened by
 boiling for some time, and then cooled down until it froze. The
 crystals obtained were fonnd to be long six-sided prisms ending in
 pyramids, as described by Chaptal, and no prisms of a tabular form
 were observed.       It is thus interesting to find that both anhydrous
 sulphuric and selenic acid crystallise in prisms in the hexagonal
 system, but it remains doubtful whether or not they are strictly iso-
 morphous.
     Selenic acid in the anhydrous condition possesses a powerf nl affinity
 for water, absorbing it quickly from the atmosphere.      Their combina
 tion is attended with contraction and considerable evolution of heat,
 but less so than in the case of water and sulphuric acid. Like the
 latter, it disintegrates and blackens many organic substances, such as
 cork, india-rubber, &c. From others it withdraws the elements of
 water ; thus, alcohol heated with it yields ethylene, and glycerine,
 acrolein.    On cellulose it has an action similar to that of strong
 sulphuric acid, paper being converted by it into a tough parchment
 like substance.      For this reason it should not be filtered through
 filtering paper, except when cold and very dilute. Iodine dissolves
 in the superf nsed acid when heated, forming a brown-coloured solu
 tion. It is acted on violently by pentachloride of phosphorus in the
 cold — a reaction which we are at present examining.       Oxychloride of
                                                                 C 2

  20           Prof. Sir C. A. Cameron and Mr.         J.  Macallan.       [May 2,
  phosphorus      also acts strongly upon it when warmed slightly, the
  reaction being attended with copious evolution of gas and reduction
  apparently to lower compounds.              Selenium dioxide dissolves in it
  when heated, but the greater part crystallises ont again in the cold.
  There is no evidence of formation in this way of an acid analogous to
  hyposulphuric acid, H2S206.           The crystals of the solid acid dissolve
  in strong sulphuric acid, and also in Nordhausen acid.
      The specific gravity of the superfused acid, taken with a Sprengel
  tube at 15°, was found to be 2'6083.          The specific gravity of the solid
  acid was taken in pnre benzene of specific gravity 08851, which is
  not acted upon by it in the cold, and in which it is insoluble. As
  might be expected, it at once blackens commercial benzene.                     Its
  specific gravity,     taken   in this  way,  proved to   be  2,9508   at  15°.  It
  thus resembles anhydrous sulphuric acid in being denser in the solid
  than in the liquid state. The specific gravity of the liquid acid is
  much greater than that of anhydrous sulphuric acid, 1*8384; and on
  the other hand the specific gravity of the solid acid is less than that
  of anhydrous telluric acid, which is stated by F. W. Clark to be 3425
 at 18-8° ('American Journal,' vol. 14, 1877, p. 281; vol. 16, 1878,
  p.  401).
         Monohydrated      Selenic Acid : its Preparation and Properties.
     Some selenic acid, which had been concentrated           on the water-bath,
 was heated for some time in a vacuum at 100°, and its strength de
 termined : 0*7858 gram neutralised 20*00 c.c. of seminormal soda
 solution, equivalent to 92*08 per cent, of selenic acid.             The acid 60
 prepared     was   diluted   with  sufficient water to reduce    its  strength, to
 88*96 per cent., corresponding to a monohydrated acid, H2SeOi,H20.
 It was then poured into a wide tube and its temperature gradually
 lowered, the same precautions being taken as to stirring and admission
 of air as were adopted previously in freezing out the anhydrons acid.
 Its viscosity increased with the fall in temperature, until at — 32° it
 froze into a mass of crystals. These were melted and re-crystallised
 several times, and the resulting product examined.
     A few of the crystals obtained were long needles, but most of them
 were large and broad, having a general aspect to which the term
 "          "
   glacial might be applied appropriately, but differing in appearance
 under the microscope from those of glacial sulphuric acid.
     Its melting point was found to be 25°. Like glacial sulphuric
acid, and also like anhydrous sulphuric and anhydrous selenic acid,
 when once melted it exhibits the property of superfusion, and to as
great an extent as the last- mentioned acid, since it may be cooled to
more than 50° below its melting point, with constant stirring, before
it again freezes. When frozen it remains quite solid at ordinary
temperatures; but if the bottle containing it be removed to a warm

 1889.]     On Selenic   Acid and   other Selenium   Compounds.          21
 room, or much handled,     it commences to melt.      Like the anhydrous
 acid, it at once freezes at any temperature below its melting point
 when a crystal of the same acid is dropped into it. It resembles the
 anhydrous acid also in having a melting point much higher than
 sulphuric acid of the same strength, that of glacial sulphuric acid
 being given by Pierre and Pnchot as 7' 5°, by Jacquelin as 8°, and by
 Marignac as 8'5°. It resembles the latter acid in having a melting
 point lower than its anhydrous acid, but while the difference is about
 2-5° in the case of sulphuric acid, the melting points of the two
 selenic acids differ by 33°.     In the following table their melting
 points are compared   : —

     It may be well to state here that 0° is given erroneously in several
 chemical works as the melting point of anhydrous sulphuric acid.
 Marignac, the most recent investigator who has studied the subject,
 assigns the temperature 105° as its true melting point.
     The superfused monohydrated selenic acid has a specific gravity of
 2'3557 at 15°.    That of the solid acid was taken in pure benzene, in
 which it is insoluble, and on which it is without action at ordinary
 temperatures, even after standing all night. A portion of the liquid
 acid was poured into the specific gravity bottle, a crystal dropped into
 it, and the acid, having become firm and cold, weighed, and the bottle
filled with benzene.     The specific gravity was found to be 2C273 at
 15°.   It thus  resembles   the anhydrous acid in being denser in the
 solid than in the liquid state ; while melting, the crystals sink rapidly
in the liquid portion.
    This acid commences to boil at 205", the acid vapour given off
being at first very weak, but it increases in strength with the rise in
temperature. A more dilute acid gives off water only until the tem
perature reaches 205°.     Dilute sulphuric acid is stated to behave in a
similar manner, giving off nothing but water until the boiling point
reaches 205 — 210°, at which temperature it has the strength of the
monohydrated acid, H2S04,HoO.
    The ease with which an acid of this strength can be obtained and
crystallised, supplies a means of separating impurities from selenic
acid, all that is necessary to do being to boil a dilute acid until the
temperature reaches 205°, cool, and drop in a crystal from an acid
already frozen ; the resulting crystals can then be melted and recrys-
tallised.
    It may be well here to draw attention to the conflicting statements
which are made in various works regarding the crystalline form of
                                      '
glacial sulphnric acid. Watts's Dictionary,' vol. 5, and Richter's

22           Prof. Sir (J. A. Cameron and Mr.        J. Macallan.    [May 2,
    Inorganic Chemistry,' state that it crystallises in six-sided prisms ;
'
but in several chemical works the crystals are described as rhombic
prisms, while Pelouze and Fremy mention that it forms large trans
 parent crystals which are rhomboidal prisms.           The crystalline form
 is   thus referred  to  three  different  systems.   The first description is
 probably copied by mistake from that of the anhydrous acid.              The
 most recent investigators of the point are Jacquelain (' Annales de
  Chimie,' vol. 30, 1850, p. 343), and Pierre and Puchot (' Annales de
  Chimie,' vol. 2, 1874, p. 164).        The latter say that the crystalline
  form appeared to them to be the oblique rhomboidal prism, and that
  they obtained the crystals, some very large, others thin and very
  long. Jacquelain describes them as being oblique prisms very in
  clined and very large ; and states that he obtained them, by a rather
  slow crystallisation, distinctly oblique and very short, and by a quick
  crystallisation, in very long oblique prisms.
                        The Existence of higher Hydrates.
      A portion of dilute   selenic acid was concentrated  on the water-bath
  and its strength taken : 0-8603 gram neutralised 19-48 c.c. of semi-
  normal soda solution, equivalent to 81¦92 per cent, of selenic acid.
  The acid so prepared was diluted with sufficient water to reduce its
  strength to 80'11 per cent., corresponding to a dihydrated acid,
  H2Se04,2H20, and its temperature then gradually lowered. When
  kept at —51° for some time it became as viscons as thick syrup, but
  did not freeze.       The last acid was then diluted to a strength of
  57-32 per cent. of selenic acid, corresponding to a hydrate of the
  composition H2Se04,6H20.           The acid thus prepared did not freeze
  when kept at — 49°, and was quite liquid at that temperature.
      Although no proof of the existence of higher iydrates than the
  monohydrated acid was obtained in the foregoing experiments, it
  appears probable that a dihydrated acid, and perhaps other hydrates,
  are capable of existing.      Sulphuric and telluric acid have both been
  obtained as dihydrates.        Considerable heat is evolved when mono
   hydrated selenic    acid  is  mixed with sufficient water to reduce its
  strength to that of a dihydrated acid.         When the latter is further
  diluted, there is an additional slight evolution of heat. It is probable
   that as the freezing point of monohydrated selenic acid is consider
  ably below that of the anhydrous acid, so the freezing point of a
  dihydrated acid is still lower.       In order to get an approximate idea
  of the amount of water which anhydrous selenic acid absorbs, a
  portion weighing 0'9776 gram was placed on a watch-glass protected
  from dust, but with free access of air.        After twenty-four hours the
   acid weighed 2'0284 grams, showing an absorption in that time of
   between 8 and 9 molecules of water by 1 molecule of anhydrous acid.
   Another portion weighing 0'4416 gram was exposed until it ceased to

1889.]      On Selenic Acid and other Selenium Compounds.                23
absorb water; the acid then weighed 1¦8152 grams, indicating absorp
tion of rather more than 25 molecules of water by 1 molecule of
anhydrous acid. Having arrived at this stage, it commenced to give
off a little of the water which it had previously taken up, but the
weather became warmer just at this period, so that probably the
above amount does not represent the total absorption of which the
acid is capable.    It is less, however, than the amount taken up by
the molecule of sulphuric acid, which is variously stated at from 80 to
100 molecules of water.
   The Conditions which affect the Freezing Points   of Selenic Acid and
                               Sulphuric Acid.
   It has long been recognised that in order to determine the melting
point of a chemical compound with accuracy it is necessary, by crys
tallisation or other means, to obtain it in a pure condition. The
necessity for such a precaution is well shown in the case of the oxides
and acids of sulphur and selenium.          An example taken from the
former class of bodies is furnished by sulphuric anhydride.        Up to a
comparatively recent date great diversity of opinion prevailed
regarding the melting point of this substance until Weber showed
that, as hitherto examined, it had usually contained a minute quantity
of water, which had the effect of altering its melting point, crystal
line form, and other properties.        Sulphuric acid supplies another
instance   of  a similar  effect.   Its melting point in the anhydrous
condition is 10'5°, while that of the monohydrated acid is 8° ; yet
commercial sulphuric acid has usually been found to remain liquid
above a temperature of —30° or —40°, and it is stated in some
chemical works that by addition of a little water to the commercial
acid its freezing point has been lowered to —80° ; but it is not men
tioned whether or not this occurred in closed or open vessels. A still
more striking example of the influence of want of purity upon the
melting point is afforded by selenic scid. In the anhydrous state
it melts at 58°, but a slightly dilute acid, as we have found, was
frozen only when a temperature of —51'5° was reached, showing a
fall of 109'5°, and probably further dilution would be attended by a
still greater reduction of the freezing point. The depression of the
freezing point can be due only partly to superfusion since the super-
fused anhydrous acid freezes at about 5°.      The monohydrate present
in the    dilute  acid  therefore exerts an influence in lowering the
freezing point of the anhydrous acid, and also its melting point. An
analogous action probably occurs in the case of some metallic salts,
which, although without apparent chemical action upon each other,
have a lower fusing point when mixed than when heated separately.
 A consideration of the foregoing facts leads to the conclusion that dilute
selenic acid having a strength greater than 88'96 per cent. contains the

anhydrous and also the monohydrated acid existing in a supervised state,
and exerting a solvent action upon each, other. In the case of sulphuric
acid a similar action evidently occurs.          The effects of agitation and of
alteration of pressure upon the freezing points of the above acids have
already been referred to.
                  The Method used      in Freezing Selenic Acid.
    Liquefied sulphur dioxide was poured into a thick glass tumbler,
holding about half a litre, fitting into a somewhat wider and deeper
cylindrical gas jar, which served to retain any of the dioxide splashed
from the interior vessel, the whole being imbedded deeply in a con
siderable quantity of cotton wadding contained in a wooden box. A
rapid current of air was driven through the sulphur dioxide, the air
being first dried by means of sulphuric acid and then cooled by pass
ing through a leaden worm surrounded by a mixture of salt and
pounded ice, or less effectively, sodium sulphate and hydrochloric
acid. Any desired degree of cold within limits could easily be main
tained by regulating the current.            When the outside air was at 0°,
about half a kilogram of sulphur dioxide was found sufficient for
more than two hours' use, evaporation taking place but slowly at the
low temperature reached, the latter, measured with an alcohol ther
mometer, falling below — 50° C.            In warmer weather nearly as low a
temperature was obtainable, but consumption of the sulphur dioxide
was much more rapid. No arrangement of freezing mixtures produced
nearly so low degrees of cold as were attained in the above manner.
Doubtless when a supply of dry snow is available, and the weather is
very cold, so that the apparatus and materials used can be well
cooled down previous to mixing, a very low temperature is obtainable
by ordinary freezing mixtures, but those conditions are not often to
be met with in these climates.            On the other hand, sulphur dioxide
is cheap and easily procurable, and convenient when used in the
manner described.
       The Specific Gravities     of the Higher Strengths of Selenic Acid.
    The specific gravities of selenic acid for the higher strengths, taken
in the liquid state at        15°, are given in the following table.           The
most concentrated        acid, of 9973* per          cent,   strength, has been
 referred to under the head of the preparation of the anhydrous acid ;
 its specific gravity, 2'6083, was taken while in the superfused con
 dition. The next acids down to 94" 74 per cent, were obtained by
 diluting that of 9973 per cent.              The acid having a strength of
 9370 per cent, was obtained by heating dilute acid in a vacuum at

   The rate of increase of specific gravity is not uniform for equal
increments of strength. It diminishes as the strength increases, as in
the case of sulphuric acid, but not regularly.         The diminution is very
marked at the highest strengths. When sulphuric acid has arrived
at the greatest strength attainable by ebullition — 98p66 per cent. — its
specific gravity is stated to decrease until the anhydrous acid,
H2S04, is reached.        Selenic acid behaves dissimilarly in this respect ;
the increase of its specific gravity, although not uniform, is main
tained throughout.
    Berzelius (' Traite de Chimie,' 1830) mentions that selenic acid of
 95'9 per cent, strength has a specific gravity of 2-6.          Fabian gives
 2'609 as the specific gravity of an acid of 949 per cent, strength, and
 2"627 for an acid of 97-4 per cent.       It will be seen that these results
 do not agree, nor are they consistent with those we have obtained.
 If values for the strengths mentioned be calculated from the foregoing

 1889.]    On Selenic   Acid and   other Selenium Compounds.            27
tables,  an acid of 95"9 per cent, will be fonnd to have a specific
gravity of 2-5366, while the specific gravities of 94'9 per cent, and
97'4 per cent, acids will be respectively 2-5141 and 2-5680, being less
than those assigned above. Furthermore, the difference between the
two specific gravities given by Fabian is much less than we find
between two acids differing by 2-5 per cent.           The most probable
explanation of the discrepancy is that the acids which gave the above
results contained sufficient selenium dioxide to raise their specific
zravities appreciably.      It may be shown that the effect of the
development    of  selenium   dioxide in selenic acid is to increase the
specific gravity relatively to the acidity.     In the acids above-men
tioned, selenium dioxide would exist as such, and not as selenious
acid, owing to dissociation of the latter at a temperature below those
at which the acids were formed, and the weak affinity for water
possessed by the resulting dioxide.      Clausnizer (' Liebig's Annalen,'
vol. 196, 1879, p. 265) gives the specific gravity of selenium dioxide
at 15-3° as 3'9538.    We have also recently taken its specific gravity,
and are in a position to confirm his result.     It is thus more than one
and a half times as dense as the strongest selenic acid.         C. Blarez
                                                —
(' Comptes Rendus,' vol. 103, 1886, pp. 804 806) has examined the
saturating power of selenious acid.       He finds that it is monobasic
with cochineal or methyl-orange. With litmus, it is monobasic to
ammonia, lime, strontia, and baryta, but with soda or potash the
litmus only becomes blue-violet when about 1*5 equivalent of alkali
is added.    We have obtained a like result with soda or potash and
litmus. When one equivalent of acid is saturated, there is a distinct
change in the colour of the litmus, so that in the absence of other
acids it might be used as an indicator for selenious acid.     Taking 1'5
equivalent of alkali as the limit, the molecule of selenium dioxide in
solution will have a less saturating power than that of selenic acid in
the ratio of 2 : 1"5.     This will be partly counterbalanced by the
higher   molecular  weight of the latter, but the final effect of the sub
stitution of selenium dioxide for selenic acid will be to reduce the
acidity.   A gravimetric method, by which selenium dioxide would be
oxidised and estimated as selenic acid, would also show a less acidity
compared with the specific gravity than if the pure acid were used,
but not to the same extent as when a volumetric process is employed
for estimating the strength.
                  The Action of Heat upon Selenic Acid.
   Action of Heat in a Vacuum. — The effect of heating dilute selenic
acid in a vacuum up to 180° has already been described — dilute acid
distils until that temperature is reached, when the anhydrous acid
remains.
   The result of further heating is merely for a time to raise the

28         Prof. Sir C. A. Cameron and Mr.      J. Macallan.    [May 2,
temperature ; the acid does not distil in the anhydrous condition.
At about 200° it begins to decompose slowly, and at higher tempera
tures rapidly, into selenium dioxide, oxygen, and water. The latter
serves to dilute a portion of the remaining acid, which then at once
distils. In order to examine the effect of distilling the anhydrous
acid destructively in a vacuum, a portion was heated in a flask con
nected with a condensing       arrangement until rapid decomposition
took place. The residue always consisted of a mixture of anhydrous
selenic acid with selenium dioxide, the proportion of the latter
increasing with the rise of temperature and length of time of heat
ing. The former was proved to be present by dropping in a crystal
of anhydrous acid, when the liquid froze, and it also gave a coloration
in the cold with the selenium test for the same acid which will be
described hereafter.     A portion which had been distilled for some
time left a residue of which 0'7107 gram neutralised 18'50 c.c. of
seminormal soda solution, using litmus as indicator, equivalent to
94¦27 per cent. of acid calculated as selenic — a result which might be
expected, owing to the influence of the selenium dioxide in diminish
ing the acidity, as has been already pointed out.          The distillate
consisted of selenium dioxide mixed with selenic acid.        The latter
was in a dilute state, since it would not solidify on addition of a
crystal of anhydrous acid, nor would it respond to the selenium test :
0'4703 gram neutralised 11¦11 c.c. of senrinormal         soda solution,
equivalent to 85¦46 per cent. of acid calculated as selenic.     Taking
into account the diminution of acidity caused by the selenium dioxide,
it is evident that a very concentrated, although not anhydrous, acid
distils over.
   Action of Heat under ordinary Pressures. — When dilute selenic acid
is boiled at ordinary pressures nothing but water is evolved until
205° is reached, at which temperature it has the composition of the
monohydrated acid. In these respects it behaves like dilute sulphuric
acid.   After passing 205° the distillate contains at first mere traces
of selenic acid, but its strength gradually increases.      A portion of
acid distilled between 205° and 227° yielded a distillate of which
0'6826 gram neutralised 010 c.c. of seminormal soda solution, equi
valent to 0'53 per cent, of selenic acid. On further heating from
227° to 260° a distillate was obtained, of which 0'3818 gram neutra
lised 0'32 c.c. of seminormal soda solution, equivalent to 3¦03 per
cent. of selenic acid.   At the latter temperature the acid commenced
to  distil over  in  white fumes.    0'6878 gram of the residue left at
260° neutralised 17¦76 c.c. of seminormal soda solution, equivalent to
93¦41 per cent. of selenic acid.    At higher temperatures a portion of
the acid is decomposed, the distillate being kept weak by the water
continuously set free in the decomposition ; and at still higher tem
peratures much selenium dioxide also distils over.     A portion of acid

1889.]      On Selenic  Acid and   other Selenium Compounds.           29
which commenced to boil at 235° was heated until the temperature
rose to 325° : 2¦1542 grams of the distillate neutralised 3 c.c. of semi-
normal soda solution, equivalent to 5-04 per cent. of selenic acid.
The residue was then further heated until the greater part of the
acid was decomposed and the strength of the distillate taken :
 16176 grams neutralised 16'5 c.c. of seminormal soda solution, equiva
lent to 36'90 per cent. of acid calculated as selenic, but much of the
acidity was due to selonious acid, a large amount of which was pre
 sent in the distillate.   It is thus seen that the acid which distils
 under ordinary pressures is always highly dilute.
    When anhydrous selenic acid is strongly heated under ordinary
 pressures a portion of it is decomposed into selenium dioxide, oxygen,
 and water, the latter serving to dilute the remaining acid. It will
 then no longer solidify on addition of a crystal of the anhydrous
 acid.   After further heating it becomes sufficiently dilute to distil
 over in the manner already described.       It is instructive to compare
 with this the action which takes place in the case of anhydrous
 sulphuric acid. Marignac fonnd (' Annales de Chimie,' vol. 30, 1853,
 p. 184), that the latter when heated gives off sulphuric anhydride
 until the remaining acid is reduced to the same strength as that
yielded by a more dilute acid on prolonged ebullition — about 98-66 per
cent.    In the case of selenic acid the anhydride is evidently unable to
 exist free at elevated temperatures, but breaks up into selenium
 dioxide and oxygen.
    It is worthy of note that a remarkable coincidence exists between
 the temperature at which selenic acid is decomposed and that at
which selenium dioxide sublimes.         The latter is not stated very
definitely in any of the chemical text-books ; we have found, however,
that at 280° rapid sublimation takes place, while at 250° volatilisation
proceeds slowly. When selenic acid is kept for some time at the
latter temperature it is always found to contain traces of selenium
dioxide, while at 280° decomposition proceeds with rapidity. It is
probable that a connexion exists to a considerable extent between the
phenomena, and that the explanation of the coincidence may be that
the comparatively weak affinities which bind the molecule of selenic
acid arc unable to prevent its disruption when once a temperature is
reached at which the tendency of its constituents to separate is
aided by the expansion attending a change to the gaseous condition.
We have seen that both phenomena are affected by the temperature ;
they are also dependent to some extent upon the pressure.            An
hydrous selenic acid commences to dissociate in a vacuum at about
200°.    We found that when selenious acid was heated under similar
circumstances water was quickly evolved, and after prolonged heating
of the residue a distinct white ring of selenium dioxide was deposited
on the cold portion of the neck of the flask.

                  The Action of Sulphur upon Selenic Acid.
    When powdered sulphur is mixed with liquid anhydrous selenic
acid there is no action in the cold, but if the mixture is heated to 63°
the sulphur dissolves in the add with production of an exceedingly
deep indigo-blue colour.       There is some action, butslight, at 58°. The
body which is produced is very unstable, since it begins to decompose
at the temperature at which it is formed, with evolution of sulphur
dioxide, and reduction of the selenic acid to selenious acid.        If water
is added when      the  colour has  first developed, sulphur  is deposited in
soft yellow flakes ; but after decomposition has commenced, the
addition of water throws down red selenium chiefly, owing to the re
action between the sulphurous and selenious acids which are formed.
    A similar action has long been known to occur between sulphur and
sulphuric acid.        In 1804 Bucholz (Gehlen's ' Neues Journal der
Chemie,' vol. 3, p. 7) discovered that sulphur dissolved in the latter
acid with the formation of a blue colour, the sulphur being re-precipi
tated on addition of water.          This reaction was subsequently inves
tigated by Vogel,       Sehweigger,    Berzelius, Wach, and Stein, and in
 1875 Weber succeeded in isolating the blue compound (Poggendorff's
'
   Annalen,' vol. 156, p. 531), and discovered it to be a sesqnioxide
of sulphur, S203, but very unstable, decomposing at ordinary tempe
ratures with evolution of sulphur dioxide.
                   The Action of Selenium upon Selenic Acid.
    A  reaction takes place between selenium and anhydrous selenic acid
 in the cold. The selenium dissolves in the acid with production of
an intense     and   beautiful green colour. The presence of a minute
quantity of water prevents the colour from developing fully until the
acid is warmed. The acid is capable of dissolving a considerable
 quantity of selenium.       If kept in a closed vessel the colour thus pro
 duced is very permanent, being unaffected for months during summer
 weather, but if the acid be heated to 75° the colour disappears, and
 the selenic acid is found to be partly reduced to selenious acid.
 Addition of water, when the colour has developed, throws down a
 voluminous red precipitate of selenium ; and exposure to the air in an
 open vessel for a few minutes is sufficient, from the same cause, to
 change the green colour to red.         It will be shown hereafter that this
 green   colour  is  probably   caused    by the formation of a new oxide of
 selenium.     Its production with the anhydrous acid affords a test for
  the latter, which we have already made use of in the examination of
  the effect of heat upon selenic acid.
     In 1827 Magnus found that selenium was dissolved by strong sul
  phuric acid, with development of a green colour, and was re-precipi
  tated on addition of water. Berzelius and Fischer subsequently

1889.~|      0'* Selenie  Acid and    other Selenium Compounds.           31
investigated the reaction, and in 1875 Weber (PoggendorfFs
'
   Annalen,1 vol. 156, p. 545) isolated the green compound, and found
it to be a sulphoxide of selenium, SeS02. The colour given by
selenium with sulphuric acid is a dark green, not so bright as that
which it produces with selenie acid.
                  The Action of Tellurium vpon Selenie Acid.
     Like selenium, tellurium reacts upon anhydrous selenie acid in the
cold, but with production of a purple-red colour. Even when the acid
 is not perfectly anhydrous, it will still give a coloration in the cold.
 The compound thus formed is probably very unstable, since the colour
 disappears at so low a temperature as 19°, the selenie acid being partly
 reduced    to selenious acid.     If water is added when the colour has
 developed,   tellurium   is thrown   down in sooty flakes, and exposure to
 moist   air produces the same effect.
     Tellurium reacts in a similar manner with strong sulphuric acid,
 with development of a red colour, and re-precipitation on addition of
 water. This was first observed by Miiller von Reichenstein. In 1 789 the
 same reaction was investigated by Klaproth, and afterwards by Magnus
 and Fischer.      The red compound was isolated by Weber in 1882
  ('Journal fur Praktische Chemie,' vol. 25, p. 218), and soon afterwards
 independently by Divers and Shimose (' Journal of the Chemical
 Society (Transactions),' vol. 43, p. 319), and was ascertained to be
 tellurium sulphoxide, TeS0g.
                 Comparison of Sulphoxides with Selenoxides.
     The coloured compounds first formed by the action of sulphur,
 selenium, and tellurium upon sulphuric acid were subsequently
 produced by the action of the same bodies upon sulphuric anhydride,
 and were isolated by forming them in the latter manner, and then
 removing the excess of anhydride. As has been already mentioned,
 they were found to be sulphoxides having the composition respec
 tively SS02, SeS02, and TeS02.            Considering the similarity of the
 reactions which produce        them,  and   of the decompositions  to which
 they are liable, it is very probable that the coloured bodies formed
  with selenie acid are selenoxides, analogous to the sulphoxides already
 known, the sulphur in the latter being replaced by selenium.         A com
 parison of the formulae of the two series of bodies as represented in
 the following table, leads to some interesting considerations : —

   The green body formed by the action of seleninm npon selenic acid
is, in all probability, a new oxide of selenium, having the composition
Se203, analogous to the sesquioxide of sulphur formed by the action
of sulphur upon sulphuric acid.
   The colour of the above compounds appears to be almost entirely
due to the element which       added on to the anhydride the sulphur
                                is                                ;
or selenium in the residual portion of the molecule has scarcely any
effect upon the colour.
   The green body SeS03 must be isomeric with the blue compound
SSeOg, and consequently the atoms of sulphur and selenium in each
of these bodies must occupy dissimilar positions in the molecule.
                The Possible Existence     of   Selenic Anhydride.
      A consideration ofthe foregoing facts leads to the conclusion that
selenic anhydride, which has not up to the present time been obtained,
is yet capable of existing in free condition. Just as the sulphoxides
                                 a
are direct addition   compounds of sulphur, selenium, and tellurium
respectively,  with sulphuric anhydride, so the selenoxides must be
regarded as addition compounds of the elements mentioned, with
selenic anhydride. It    difficult to conceive that bodies so constituted
                           is
are capable of existing free, and that the anhydride          unable to do
                                                                  is
so.   On the other hand,        itprobable that

been as yet found to exist.    Selenious anhydride      always obtained,

and not selenic, under similar conditions to those which produce
sulphuric anhydride, and involving a high temperature.
    We have examined the action of heat upon various selenates.
Those selected for the purpose were the selenates of antimony,
bismuth, platinum, lead, and silver, and also ferric and mercuric
selenates.    In no instance was selenic anhydride obtained, bnt
selenious anhydride was evolved in all cases when the above selenates
were strongly heated.

    In order to examine if    selenic anhydride is produced   in the manner
just described, the following experiments were made: —
    Some platinum sponge was introduced into a combustion tube, and
 a quantity of selenious anhydride placed behind it.          The platinum
 sponge was kept at a red heat, and the selenious anhydride was also
 heated until it sublimed.      Oxygen, which was first dried by passing
 through a series of tubes containing calcium chloride and sulphuric
 acid, was led through the platinum sponge, carrying the vapour of
 the selenious anhydride with it.       A white deposit formed in front of
  the platinum sponge, which, on examination, was found to consist
  solely of selenious anhydride.
     The experiment was repeated, substituting selenium for selenious
  anhydride.     The vapour of the selenium, on passing through the
  platinum sponge, was oxidised to selenious anhydride, but no selenic
  anhydride was formed.
     The next experiment was similar to the first, but platinum black
  was substituted for platinum sponge.          As before, only selenious
  anhydride was deposited.
    In the next experiment selenious anhydride was mixed with
 platinum sponge, and placed within a tube arranged in such a way
 that it could be placed in an oil-bath.        The temperature was then
 raised gradually to 250°, oxygen being led through continuously.
 At the temperature mentioned a sublimate formed, and this, as well
 as the platinum sponge, was treated with water and tested, but no
 selenic acid was found.
    The next experiment was similar to the last, except that the sele
 nious anhydride was mixed with platinum black instead of platinum
sponge, but, as before, nothing but selenious anhydride was obtained.
    As may be seen from the above experiments, we have been unable
 to confirm the observation made by von Gerichten.
    We have found that oxygen in the active condition is unable to
oxidise selenious anhydride.       Oxygen, which was first passed through
 a series of drying tubes, was ozonised by means of a Houzeau's
 ozoniser, and then led slowly through a tube containing selenious
 anhydride for three hours and a half. At the end of that time tin-
 tube was disconnected, the ozone displaced by a current of dried air.
and the contents of the tube dissolved in water and tested for selenic-
 acid, but no trace of it was detected.

       Spectrum of Manganese." By J. Norman Lookyer, F.R.S.
       Received April 6, 1889.
    In a paper communicated to           the Royal Society in November,
 1887,  I pointed out that   in  the spectra of certain classes of heavenly
 bodies there are several lines and flutings which occur in the low-tem
 perature spectra of meteorites.
                                I
    In a subsequent paper* gave tables showing further that lines
occupying nearly the same position had also been recorded in the
spectra of aurorae. The coincidences were really surprising, and               I
therefore suggested that the spectrum of the aurora might in part
be due to particles of meteoric dust in the upper parts of our
atmosphere.
    One of the most constant flutings thus apparently common to the
spectra of meteorites, meteor-swarms (nebulae and stars as well as
comets), and aurorae is one near wave-length 558. I, therefore,
suggested that the remnant of this fluting, which is seen in the spec
trum of manganese (whether due to the metal or a compound is
unimportant in the present connexion), was the origin of the chief line
of the aurora spectrum.      I  distinctly stated that only small dispersion
had been employed of set purpose, and that the wave-lengths given
had no claim to great accuracy.
    From a detailed discussion of all the published observations avail
able to me,t the suggestion as to the meteoritic nature of the aurora
seemed fully justified, both as regards the general characteristics of
the spectra and the positions of the lines and flutings observed, but          I
was particularly careful to point out that the object of my paper was
mainly to direct further inquiries.

   The distances of these from the most refrangible edge of Mn (1)
are respectively 00045 and 0006-0.
   If we take the maximum divergence from the Mn fluting, viz.,
0006, it is equal to the distance between the D lines of sodium, which
are also shown in the diagram for purposes       of comparison.    The
divergence of the other extreme, viz., 5571*5, is about two-thirds of
the distance between the D lines.
  Putting Dr. Huggins's      observations aside, as having been made
with considerable dispersion, any observer who is at all acquainted
with the small dispersion generally necessarily employed in observa
tions of the aurora, will quite understand that it is almost impossible
to differentiate to these small amounts with such dispersion.       The
aurora spectrum being usually faint, it is necessary to employ a wide
slit, so that the chances of seeing D double are very small.
   Dr. Huggins states that in his observations " the reading showed
the line to fall about midway between two strong lines in the spec
trum of tin, X 5564 and 5587 respectively."     The wave-lengths given
by Thalen for these lines of tin are 5565 and 5588, so that a line
exactly half-way between them would have a wave-length of very
nearly 5575'5 (whether we take the wave-lengths given by Huggins
or by Thalen), which almost absolutely corresponds to the Mn Anting.
The value deduced, however, was 5571, which would place the line
not half-way between the tin lines, but less than one-third of the
distance between them from tho most refrangible one. If the state
ment that the line fell midway between the tin lines is to be relied on,
it seems probable that there was an accidental shift before the obser
vations of the tin spectrum were made, but the details of the compari
son not having been recorded, it is impossible to say with certainty
whether there was any such shift or not.        Such a shift would also
affect the results of the tellurium comparison referred to by Dr.
Huggins to the same extent as that of the tin comparison, since the
anrora line was not again brought on the cross-wires. The value
determined by Dr. Huggins from a comparison with the iron lines in
the neighbourhood was 5571-5, which is a little higher than that
derived from the tin and tellurium comparisons.
   [Note, May 7th. — I have received a note from Dr. Huggins referring
to the above paragraph, in which I make a quotation from his paper,
and suggest a possible source of error.           I
                                               have his permission to
publish the following extracts from his letter : —
   " I
       thought it would be clear that the statement that the reading
showed the line to fall between the lines of tin (or 'about midway
between  '),was nothing more than a rough indication to me what
metal to take, and that no importance was attached by me to this quite
 rough determination of the metal to be chosen.

 the time are 'map showed reading between lines of tin.' It was in

 expanding this sentence for my paper that the words about midway
 came in.    I noticed when the paper was in proof that the expression
 was not strictly accurate, but I allowed it to pass, as the sentence
 was obviously merely a rough indication of position for the selection
 of the metal for comparison. There is absolutely no ground for the
 suggestion of any shift, as the position of the aurora line from the
 direct comparison with tin agrees with the former one (No. I)."
    From the above, it appears that the statement that the aurora line
 fell " about midway between " the lines of tin was not strictly
accurate, and this consequently led to a misunderstanding] .
    The importance of actually confronting the spectrum of the aurora
with that of manganese, and definitely determining the coincidence or
non-coincidence of the brightest fluting of manganese with the chief
aurora line is therefore obvious, and no opportunity of making the
observations should be lost.
    In support of the suggestion that the chief aurora line occupied the
same place in the spectrum as the brightest fluting of manganese,              I
quoted tho observations of Smyth and Proctor, which placed the line
considerably less refrangible than Angstrom's observation (5567).              I
attached no special weight to these observations beyond the fact that
I  knew the observers to be absolutely trustworthy, and there can now
be no doubt that they were justified in differing from Angstrom.
Gyllenskiold's statement of Proctor's value (5595+25-0) was based
upon a curve constructed from the data contained in a small sketch
                                                            '

p. 346), and is, therefore, not so important as Proctor's own state
ment : " My own measures give me a wave-length very slightly
greater than those of Winlock and Angstrom."*
    Winlock's value being 557, it seems pretty certain that the line is
decidedly less refrangible than 557.             Gyllenskiold estimated the
probable error of Proctor's value as equal to one division of the scale
(the distance between C and F being about 96 divisions) or more
than four times the distance between the D lines.
    With reference to Krafft's observations at Bossekop in Alten, Dr.
Huggins says : " I have already pointed out that Krafft's measures
were not made under circumstances which assured to them a high
degree of accuracy, and Krafft's own words, which               I  have quoted,
disclaim expressly any special attempt on his part to redetermine the
position of the principal line with a higher degree of accuracy than
the observers who preceded him."          Dr. Huggins does not appear to

hare been sufficiently impressed by the modesty of Krafft's statement
with respect to the accuracy of his observations.
   Although his attention was directed mainly to other observations,
and spectroscopic observations were of secondary importance, the
instruments were specially designed for the work, and it is fair to
assume that the measurements were made as carefully as possible.
Krafft's statement — " Leider gestatteten die obligatorischen Beobacht-

 finally conclude that the suggestion that the chief line of the aurora
is  the remnant of the manganese fluting at 558           inadmissible, as
                                                                    is
 Dr. Huggins states    it to be.
    That the spectrum of the aurora may be due to the integration of
 two or more elementary spectra, as first suggested      Vogel in 1871,
                                                                    by          is
 quite  in accordance   with the meteoric dust theory.   As stated in my I
former paper,*     " the aurora spectrum can be built up from the lowest
temperature spectra of manganese, magnesium, lead, and thallium,
and the brightest flutings of carbon."      And not only this, but when a
line of any substance appears alone,             generally the line which
                                                     it   is

first increase of temperature.        Any departure from this may be
ascribed to the incompleteness of the observations.        The differences
between the spectra of aurorae which are apparently at nearly equal
temperatures are in all probability due to slight variations in the
composition of the meteorites concerned.
   A low-temperature aurora will give spectrum generally consisting
                                                    a
of the Mn fluting only, while at gradually increasing temperatures
various other lines will be added according to the volatilities of the
substances which they represent.

   This commonalty furnishes a strong argument in favour of the
suggestion that the aurora line is the remnant of the manganese
fluting, for it is practically certain that the fluting seen in the spectra
of meteor-swarms is due to manganese.
   Further, in the aurora the line which          I  have ascribed to the
manganese fluting is associated with other lines and flutings, and it
is also associated with the same lines and flutings in the spectra of
meteor-swarms.        These again, it is important to note, are exactly
the lines and flutings which are brightest in the spectra of meteorites
in the laboratory at the temperature at which the manganese fluting
is best visible.

    In the year 1882 had the honour to lay before the Royal Society
 a note on the photographic spectrum of this nebula, in which I
 described a new bright line in the ultra-violet, to which        I gave a
 wave-length of about 3730. In addition to this new line, the lines of
 hydrogen, H/3 and H7, which        I had discovered by eye in my early
 observations on the visible spectrum, were to be seen upon the plate.
    On account of the faintness of the object the slit had been made
 rather wide, and for this reason the character of the line and its
 position, as  I  stated in the paper, could not be ascertained with the
 accuracy which I desired.

the Trapezium which fell upon the slit are present.
   Across these continuous spectra at least four groups of bright
lines can be seen, of which the greater number can be traced into the
nebula for some little distance from the stellar spectra.
   It is scarcely necessary to state the importance of this observation
as showing that these stars of the Trapezium are not merely optically
connected with the nebula, but are physically bound up with it, and
are very probably condensed out of the gaseous matter of the nebula.
This observation would seem also to show that the nebula, as a whole,
may not be at a distance from us greater than that which we should
 attribute to such stars, if they occurred alone in the heavens.
    The first group, of six lines, occurs between X 4116 and 4167.
The lines of this group do not extend far from the continuous star
spectra, with the exception of two lines.                   These can be seen
faintly  in another  photograph    taken    in  1889.   Beyond there is a fainter
group, probably of four lines a little beyond h.                I  am pretty sure
 that these lines extend into the nebula.               The third group from
X 3896 to 3825, of which I have endeavoured               to measure ten lines, is
faint, but here there is no doubt that the same lines are present in
 the adjoining nebular matter. There are two lines a little more
refrangible than the strong line seen in 1882, at about X. 3709 and
 X 3699.    I have a suspicion of a faint group about this place, and also
of another group on the less refrangible side of G.
    I shall discuss further on the probable chemical significance of
 these lines.    The lines of this photograph are shown in Spectrum
No. 1 of the folding Plate.
    During the time that Orion was favourably situated for observation
 in the season of 1888 and in that of the present year, the unusual con
 tinuance of bad weather has made it impossible for me to give so
 complete an account of the spectrum of the nebula in the photo
 graphic region as a few really fine nights would have enabled me to
 do.    However, on February 28th of the present year                  I  obtained
 another photograph, the slit being very narrow, which gives some
  more new information of the nature of its spectrum.             I was astonished
 on looking at the photograph not to see the strong line about X 3730,
  which was by far the most conspicuous feature of the photograph
 taken in 1888.     The pair of lines near it on the less refrangible side,

which     I found for the first time in 1888, are present ; and on a further
scrutiny of the plate         I discovered two other pairs of lines, most pro
bably rhythmically connected with them, in the still more refrangible
region, the last pair, accompanied by a third line, being near the
ultra-violet limit of ex-terrestrial light.*
    I was also able to see faintly two of the bright lines which            I  have
described as present across the continuous spectra of the brighter
stars of the Trapezium in my photograph of 1888.                   It is not quite
certain whether these very faint and short lines are really due to the
matter of the nebula proper, or have come upon the plate in con
sequence of the stars of the Trapezium having fallen accidentally upon
the slit for a time too short to impress the continuous part of their
spectra.       No trace of a continuous spectrum can be seen upon the
plate, but these lines in the plate of 1888 do extend beyond the con
tinuous spectra of the stars of the Trapezium.
                                          I
    In the diagram which follows have indicated the positions of the
slit upon the nebula relatively to the Trapezium and the well-known
three stars near it, for the photographs of 1882, 1888, and 1889.
   I  regret extremely that bad weather has made it impossible for me
to work out the circumstances on which depended the disappearance
of the strong line about X 3730. Both the photographs which show
this line include two stars of the Trapezium, and it may possibly be
that this strong line is associated with the groups near it in the
spectra of the stars, and may therefore come out in those parts of the
nebula only which are more condensed.              A few photographs with the
slit differently placed upon the nebula would doubtless have thrown
light upon this point.           The suggestion presents itself strongly that
the mottled and broken-up character of the nebular matter, shown in
Lord Rosse's drawing from eye observations, and much more strik
ingly brought out in the recent photographs of Mr. Common and
Mr. Roberts, may be connected with differences of spectrum in the
photographic region, though in the visible region there is no known
alteration of the spectrum of the four bright lines, except, it may be,
some small differences of relative brilliancy of the lines.
    Until next winter we cannot go beyond the new information which
these photographs give to us.               On the plate of the photograph of
1889 two pairs of spectra for comparison were taken : — two spectra,
one above and one below the nebular spectrum, of burning magne
sium ; and two spectra, similarly placed, of the light of the sky.
    From the photographs of 1888 taken with a narrow slit, the
position which         I gave in 1882 to this line is shown to be, as I
expected from the wide slit then used, approximate only.                     I  find
from    the   later photograph that the wide slit had caused the strong

    a. Brightest    line. — In 1872,*       I  stated   as  the result of numerous
direct comparisons of this line with the brightest line in the spectrum
of nitrogen that the nebular line was " sensibly coincident with the
middle of the less refrangible line of the double line of nitrogen."               To
avoid repetition      I   will call this line NI. Except where it is otherwise
stated, I use this line of nitrogen simply as a fiducial point in the
spectrum, without any reference to its chemical significance.
    In a still more critical examination of the position of the nebular line
for the purpose of determining whether there was any indication of
relative motions of the gaseous nebulae in the line of sight,                 I found
some experimental difficulty from the circumstance that the nebular
line is narrow and defined while Nt is nebulous.                   I was fortunate to
find a more suitable fiducial line of comparison in a narrow line of
lead which falls almost upon the middle of Nrt                    In December, 1872,
 I compared this line directly with NI, and found it sufficiently near
in position to serve as a fiducial line of comparison.
    Six other gaseous nebulaa were also examined, each on several

1889.]        On   the  Spectrum    of the Great ATebula in Orion.              45
nights, with the      result that " in no instance was any change of relative
position of the nehular line and the lead line detected."*
   In the simultaneous observation of the nebular line and the lead
line it was found if the lead line was made rather less bright than
the line of the nebula, the small excess of apparent breadth of this
latter line appeared to overlap the lead line to a very small amount on
its less refrangible side, so that the more refrangible sides of the two
lines appeared to be in a straight line across the spectrum.                   The
closeness of position of the two lines was shown by the observation
that when the line of the nebula passed across the field of the spec
troscope, and the lead line was thrown in, the lead line was not seen, but
only an increase in brightness of the nebular line. By comparing the
end of the nebular line near the Trapezium where it is refined to a
point,   I  estimated that the difference of position of the middle of the
lead line and that of the nebular line might be possibly from X 0000-2
to X 0000'3.t Some recent measures of the position of the lead line
with the middle of NI show that the lead line is about X 0000-12 more
refrangible.
   These direct comparisons of the nebular line with the lead line
confirmed, therefore, my former conclusion, that the brightest line in
the gaseous nebulae is very near Nt, when seen under a dispersion equal
to nearly eight prisms of 60, namely, 36° 25' from A to H.
   This result is based on direct comparisons, on twenty-four different
nights, with N5 or with the line of lead.
   The wave-length of N\ has been determined by Kirchhoff, Thalen,
and by myself.         Watts' reduction of my measure to wave-lengths is
clearly not accordant with my measures of air lines immediately pre
ceding and following this line.         I have therefore reduced my original
measure to wave-lengths and find for N, the value X 5004'5.
                        Kirchhoff                     5004-6
                        Thalen                        5005-1
   Thalen's value is clearly too high, as Thalen gives for the lead line
coincident nearly with NI X 5004-6, and NI is seen on the more refran
gible side of the solar iron line given by Angstrom as X 50049. In
Angstrom's map Nx is laid down on the more refrangible side of the
iron line 5004'9,. at about 5004'5.         The same position is given to N\
in Kirchhoff's map.
   I  have made a new determination of the position of NI, using the
second spectrum of a grating 17,300 to the inch, relatively to the solar
iron line at 5004'9 according to Angstrom.
   The value came out X 5004-6, which agrees with Kirchhoff's value,

 during the very few fine nights when Orion was favourably situated
 to undertake an examination for these very faint lines.
                 Comparisons     with   the Magnesium-flame    Spectrum.
     In   1882,   Dr. Copeland in his paper on Schmidt's Nova Cygni,*
                in                  " that it is
 remarked            a footnote,                   worthy of note that this line
 (X 5006'5 of burning magnesium) almost absolutely coincides with
  the brightest line in the planetary nebulae."
    This line, namely, the bright edge of the first band in the mag
nesium-flame spectrum, is very near in position to the brightest
nebular line. We have seen that the wave-length of this line in the
nebulae (I) is 5004'6 to 5004'8 ; now the wave-length of the end of

                           page 137 (loc. r.it.) Mr. Lockyer says : — In the
nebulae we deal chiefly with lines seen in the spectrum of magnesium
at the lowest temperature."
   In  a later paper in 1888* Mr. Lockyer states : — " In a paper com
municated to the Royal Society on November 15th, 1887, I showed
that the nebulae are composed of sparse meteorites, the collisions of
which bring about a rise of temperature sufficient to render luminous
one of their chief constituents — magnesium.                This conclusion was
arrived at from the facts that the chief nebular lines are coincident in
position with the fluting and lines visible in the bunsen burner when
magnesium is introduced, and that the fluting is far brighter at that
temperature than almost any other spectral line or fluting of any
element whatever."
   Although the number of direct comparisons which                    I had made
of the brightest line in the nebulae with NI and with the lead line, not
to speak of the accordant results of the micrometric measures of
other observers, left great doubt in my mind whether this line could
be coincident with " the remnant of the magnesium fluting at 500,"
                          I
really at 5006'5, yet thought it desirable to undertake the laborious
task of comparing, with the necessary care and precautions, the
nebular line directly, in the spectroscope attached to the telescope,
with the spectrum of burning magnesium.
   Arrangements were made by which the light from burning
magnesium was thrown into the telescope from the side and then
reflected down, under conditions similar with the light from the
nebula, upon the slit of the spectroscope.             By this arrangement any
flexure in the tube connecting the spectroscope with the telescope
would affect both spectra alike. The coincidence in position of
the spectrum from burning magnesium with that of a heavenly
body to which the telescope was so directed that its light fell upon
the slit of the spectroscope, was tested with great care on several
occasions by comparing the three bright lines of magnesium with the
corresponding lines, blt b.2, 64, in the spectrum of the moon. Indeed,
to prevent any possible error in the observation of apparent want of
coincidence of the nebular line, if the light from the burning
magnesium should by an accident so come upon the slit as to bring
its spectrum in a very minute degree on the less refrangible side of
its true position relatively to the nebular line to be observed with it,
the arrangement was purposely made that the lines of magnesium
were seen to fall upon the corresponding dark lines at 6 in the moon,
a very little on the more refrangible side of the middle of those lines.
This state of things would diminish a little the interval which
should be seen between the nebular line and the edge of the

 magnesium-flame   band, and so make the determination more diffi
 cult ; but if under such circumstances, the nebular line was seen
on    the more refrangible side of that of magnesium the observation
  would be much more trustworthy, for in the case of coincidence with
  magnesium the line would have appeared towards the opposite and
  less refrangible side of the magnesium       line, broadening the mag
  nesium line on this side.    I considered that the comparison could be
  made most satisfactorily by the complete superposition of the two
  spectra, that from burning magnesium being gradually reduced in
  brightness by the interposition of coloured glass screens, until the
  ground of the spectrum between the successive bright lines of the
  band of the magnesium-flame        spectrum was sufficiently subdued to
  allow of the nebular line being seen upon it.
     Under these circumstances, if the nebnlar line had the position
  which my direct comparisons and the micrometric observations of
 other observers assign to       it,  would be seen as a bright line at
                                       it                                       a
  very small interval    within   the  line ending the band, and to the
 observer the band would appear to commence with a double line.
     This direct comparison was first successfully made on March                6,
 1889. The observations were made with the 15" refractor belonging
 to the Royal Society.       The spectroscope used has two compound
 Grubb prisms, each with     5  square inches of base, and giving nearly
 twice the dispersion of a single prism of 60°, namely, 9° 20' from             A
 to H and collimator and telescope of 1'25-inch aperture. An eye
     ;
 piece magnifying eighteen times was employed.            The nebular line
 was brought upon the cross-wires, and when carefully focussed and
 clearly seen, the light from burning magnesium was thrown in. This
observation       one of great difficulty, especially as the interval to be
                 is
observed had been purposely reduced by causing the magnesium to
fall, for the sake of the greater trustworthiness of the observations,
on the more refrangible side of its true position. Although            con I

Mrs. Huggins independently, believed fnlly at the time that we saw

the magnesium band, and to form with the band-boundary               doublea
line. The relative positions of the two spectra are represented in
the diagram across the page. The line at the end of the magnesium
band was then brought upon the cross-wires, without any attention
being given to the nebular line; when the burning magnesium
went out, the nebular line was seen to be at a measurable distance to
the left of the intersection of the wires, namely, on the more re
frangible side.

March 9, March 11, and March 16. On March 9, a single successful
comparison was made with a more powerful spectroscope, giving a
dispersion equal to nearly eight prisms of 60°.                 [Comparisons have
been made since with the planetary nebula in Hydra.                      The short
line of the nebula was found to fall within the termination of the
magnesium band at about the small distance which corresponds to the
known position of the two lines. — April 26.]                 On all these nights
the comparisons were repeated independently and fully confirmed by
Mrs. Huggins.
    These comparisons can be successfully imitated in the laboratory
by directing a spectroscope of sufficient power to the line of lead
which the nebular line is sufficiently near, the slit being narrow and
the electrodes of lead near each other; and then causing, with the
necessary precautions, the light of burning magnesium to fall also
upon the slit. The lead line will be seen to fall within the end of
the band, and to form with it a double line.
    It may be mentioned in this place that this line of lead, and the
iron line at 4957 at the position of the second nebular line, can be
conveniently used in the laboratory in any chemical research on the
nature of the nebulae.       No terrestrial line which does not fall almost
exactly at    these  positions in the spectrum can have any claim to
further consideration.
    It might be suggested that the want of coincidence observed
between the nebular line and the magnesium band, amounting to
 ,V 0001 '9 nearly, might     be due to a motion of translation of the
 nebula towards the earth.           The motion required to produce this
shift of position is about sixty-seven miles in a second.
    [The earth's motion at the time of comparison with the magnesium-
name band may be taken at about 17 miles in a second of recession
from the nebula.       This motion would bring the nebular line nearer
the red, and diminish the apparent interval between that line and the
termination of the band.         If the nebula ha3 a motion of approach,
the earth's recession would bring the line back again, to an extent
corresponding to about 17 miles in a second, towards its true place. —

seven nebulae were approaching the earth with velocities such that,
having respect to the earth's motion at the different times of observa
tion, they all gave a sensible shift corresponding to 67 ±15 miles in a
second.         There is little doubt in my mind, therefore, from these com
parisons, which, considering the strong evidence we possessed before
of the relative positions of the nebular line and of the magnesium
line, are strictly speaking supplementary and confirmatory evidence
 only, that this line of the gaseous nebulaa is not produced by the

    In   the diagram on page 134 (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 43), Mr. Lockyer
represents this nebular line followed by fine lines, which gives it the
appearance of a fluting similar to that of the magnesium band placed
above.        I  am unable to find in the paper any authority for this repre
sentation of the line. In another placef Mr. Lockyer says : " On one
occasion, at Greenwich, it was recorded as a fluting in the spectrum

faint fringe mainly on the side nearer the blue."
   Mr. Maunder has recently sent a note to the Royal Astronomical
Society, in which he explains that the observation was made with a
second  half-prism added to the half-prism spectroscope.    He says :
" The three priucipal lines of the nebular spectrum were seen as
                                                                 very
narrow bright lines, bnt none of them were perfectly sharp, each
showed a slight raggedness at both edges ; but in the case of the line
near X 5005 it was clear that this fringe, or raggedness, was more
developed towards the blue than towards the red.        In the case of the
other two lines, they were not bright enough for it to be possible to
ascertain whether the fringes were symmetrical or not.         But'X 5005
was clearly a single line. There was no trace of any bright line, or
series of bright lines, close to it on either side ; no trace of a fluting,
properly so called.      The entire line, fringes and all, was only a
fraction of a tenth metre in total breadth."*
  [It  should be noticed that the instrumental conditions under which
Mr. Maunder observed showed the second and third line " not per
fectly sharp, but with a slight raggedness at both edges." — May 13.]
  My own observations of this line, since my discovery of it in 1864,
with different spectroscopes up to a dispersion equal to eight prisms
of 60°, show the line to become narrow as the slit is made narrow,
and to be sharply and perfectly defined at both edges.
   As some importance attaches to the precise character of this
line,   I
        wrote to Professor H. C. Vogel for permission to quote the
result of his experience, which has been nearly as long as my own, of
the character of this line. He says in his reply, dated 20th March,
1889 : " Beeilo ioh mich Ihner. mitzotbeilen, dass me;ne langjahrigen

    In an early observation of the dumb-bell nebula Professor Vogel,
indeed (' Beobachtungen zu Bothkamp,' p. 59, 1872), describes this
 line as less defined towards the violet side. In a letter (April 3,
1889) Professor Vogel says this appearance of the line was probably
due to a slit not sufficiently narrow.   He says that he re-examined
this line in his observations with the great Vienna refractor, and that
it did not then appear otherwise than defined and narrow.
   The other line in the spectrum of the nebulae upon which
Mr. Lockyer mainly relies for the presence of magnesium is the line
shown in my photographic spectrum of 1882,t and to which I assigned
the wave-length of about 3730. Mr. Lockyer says of this line :J " In
the Bunsen as ordinarily employed the fluting at 500 far eclipses the
other parts of the spectrum in brilliancy, and at this temperature, as
already observed by Messrs. Liveing and Dewar, the ultra-violet line
visible is that at 373." Passing by a minor point, which Liveing and
Dewar have already pointed out,§ namely, that their observation was
made at the higher temperature of burning magnesium, this statement
is insufficiently complete, for what occurs at this part of the
spectrum, and is characteristic of the magnesium-flame spectrum, is a
triplet, of which the line given by Liveing and Dewar at about 3730
is the least refrangible member.

graphic cause.        The line at 3724 impresses me strongly as a single line,
and there s certainly no trace of the first line of the triplet at 3730.
The line appears to me stronger -where it is upon the star- spectra.
    As therefore there seems to be little doubt that the " remnant of

the   fluting at 500                  coincident with the brightest nebular line,
and the next most characteristic group of this spectrum, the triplet
at 3720, 3724, and 3730, according to Liveing and Dewar, does not
appear to be present in the photographs, we may conclude that the
remarkable spectrum of the gaseous nebula? has not been produced by
burning magnesium.*
    I should     mention that Mr. Lockyer attributes one other line occa
sionally seen in the gaseous nebulae to the flame spectrum of
magnesinm, namely, a very faint line at about                      \  4700.       Now, accord
ing    to   my experience,      it  is  only    in    the   spark    and    arc   that a line of
magnesium appears at this place, a condition of the spectrnm when
the lines at b are very conspicuous,                     and the band at X 5006"5 is
usually absent.          When, however, the spark is taken in magnesium
chloride,     the   band  is present under some conditions, but the triplet at
b is always         bright.    I therefore consulted Professor Liveing, who
   * On the narrower basis of the magnesium spectrum only, Professors Liveing

band without any trace of the second band, which is nearly as bright as the first,
and without any trace of the b group, is quite sufficient to croate a suspicion of
mistaken identity when Mr. Lockyer ascribes the sharp green line in the spectrum
of nebuke to this band of magnesia. This suspicion will be strengthened when it is
 noticed that the line in question is usually in nebulse associated with the F line of
 hydrogen,   if it be borne in mind that the spark of magnesium in hydrogen does not
 give  the   bands, and that the oiyhydrogen             flame hardly produces them from
 magnesia when the hydrogen is in excess."               (' Eoy. Soc. Proc.,' toI. 41, p. 245.)

says  :
        "I  have never seen the line at X 4703            in the spectrum of the
magnesium flame.        As it is a conspicuous line in the arc and spark,
we looked for it in the flame, but did not find it."
   With reference to the second nebular line at X 4957, Mr. Lockyer
says:* "The lines at 500 and 495 have been seen in the glow of the
 Dhurmsala meteorite when heated, but the origin of 495 has not yet
been determined."       And further (at p. 135) : " I should add that the'
line at 495 makes its appearance much more rarely than the one at
500 in meteorite glows."         In the diagram on the same page this line
is represented as coincident with the nebular line.
   The circumstance of a line appearing at 495 can scarcely be
regarded, considering the very great number of spectral lines, as
amounting to a presumption that the material to which it is due
in the meteorite is the same as that present in the nebula) which gives
the line at 4957. If it should be shown that the unknown substance
in the meteorite gives rise to a line at the position of the nebular line,
namely, X 4957, in that case the observation would have sufficient
importance to make it desirable to compare the spectrum of the
meteorite directly with that of the nebula.

                    Chemical Significance   of the Lines.
   Until I can obtain more photographs taken on different parts of the
nebula, I  wish to be understood to speak on this point with much
hesitation, and provisionally only. We know certainly that two of
the lines are produced by hydrogen. The fineness of these lines
points to a high temperature and condition of great tenuity of the
hydrogen from which the light was emitted. This condition of the
hydrogen may give us a clue as to the probable interpretation of the
other lines.   These may come from substances of very low vapour-
density, and  under   molecular conditions which are consistent with a
high temperature.      It is in accordance with this view that the recent
measures of Dr. Copeland, since confirmed by Mr. Taylor (loc. cit.),
show with great probability that the line known as D2, which has
been supposed to indicate some substance of low vapour-density,
which shows itself only at the hottest region of the sun, is present in
the nebular spectrum.        The great simplicity of the three pairs of
lines seen in the photograph of 1889 suggests a substance of a similar
chemical nature.
   If hydrogen can exist at half its usual vapour-density, with a mole
cule of one atom only, we might possibly expect to find it in some of
these bodies, but at present we do not know what its spectrum would
be in such a condition.       It may be possibly that it is in molecular
states of our elements other 'than- those we are acquainted with that
we may have to look for an interpretation of some of the lines of
these bodies.
   [With respect to the groups of lines which cross the star spectra,
any statements must also be provisional only.
   These lines are distinct ami fairly strong in the star spectra,
and extend, some farther jiS&n others, into the adjoining nebular

matter. Whether they are peculiar to these particular stars and the
matter close about them, or whether they will be found everywhere
in the nebula, or in certain parts of greater condensation only, can
be known only from future photographs.
   The first group shows some general agreements with a strong iron
group, but there are also formidable discrepancies.
   The position of the third group suggested the well known cyanogen
group, especially as this group, beginning at X.3883, is the first to
appear under the chemical conditions which might have been
conceived to exist under circumstances of condensation.*                     Under
these conditions this group appears alone in a photograph, withont
the less refrangible group, as was probably the case in the photograph
I took of Comet II, 1881.       I therefore took a photograph of an oxy-
coal-gas flame, the coal-gas having passed through ammonia, and a
magnesium-flame spectrum on the same plate for comparison.
   On comparing this photograph with that of the nebula it was seen
by eye, and afterwards confirmed by measurement, that the nebula
group begins sooner by one strong line than the cyanogen group, and
presents besides in the relative strength and grouping of the lines a
distinctly different character.       The evidence appears to me to be
against attributing these lines to cyanogen.
   I took great pains to ascertain if the group of lines which accom
panies the triplet of the magnesium-flame spectrum could be made to
agree with the much longer group of lines in the nebula at this part
of the spectrum. Again, as in the case of the cyanogen group, the
whole aspect of the grouping of lines is quite different. The groups
begin and end differently, and the relative strength of different parts
of the group is not the same. The great increase of strength which
is seen in the middle of the magnesium group is not present at the
corresponding part of the nebula group. I do not think therefore
there should be much weight given to the near positions of several
individual lines of the two groups, which in the case of so close a
grouping might well be accidental, especially as the wave-lengths can
be but approximate only.
   [The strongest lines of the magnesium-flame group are those
forming the triplet which appears also in the spark and the arc
spectrum.      A nebular line is near the middle line of the triplet, but
 there are no lines corresponding to the other two lines of the triplet.
 The other lines of the flame group are too faint to be expected to
 appear, unless the triplet at 3720 — 3730 were strong upon the plate.

doubtless rhythmically connected, appear to me to possess great
interest, especially if it should come to be found from future photo
graphs that these groups are characteristic of the most tenuous part
of the nebula. At present,         I  am not able to make any suggestion as
to their chemical origin, but the suggestion presents itself that we
 may have to do with some molecule of low vapour-density.
   The pair of lines on the more refrangible side of the line at X 3724,
 may possibly be connected with the state of the nebula as it exists in
the neighbourhood of the stars. — April 26.]
                               General Conclusions.
   It seems to me     premature until we can learn more of the signifi
cance of the new groups of lines, and especially of their connexion
with the nebular matter generally, or with certain condensed parts
only, to express more than provisional suggestions as to the nature of
these nebulae.     It may be that they represent an early stage in the
evolutionary changes of the heavenly bodies.
   As some physical importance, in the relation of these nebulae to
each other, has been given to my inability, in consequence of insuffi
cient optical means in my original observations in 1864, to see all
three of the bright lines in some faint nebulae, I may mention that
in the case of one object, the Ring Nebula in Lyra, in which at that
time the light appeared monochromatic, as only the brightest line
could be certainly seen, as soon as larger means were placed at my
disposal by the loan of the Royal Society telescope in 1870,       I had no
difficulty in seeing all three lines on any night of sufficient clearness.
There is little doubt that the same cause prevented me from seeing
more than the brightest line in Nebula 4572 of Herschel's ' General
Catalogue.' Vogel saw two lines.*
   These bodies may stand at or near the beginning of the evolutionary
cycle, so far as we can know it. They consist probably of gas at a
high temperature and very tenuous, where chemical dissociation
exists, and the constituents of the mass, doubtless, are arranged in
the order of vapour-density. As to the conditions which may have
been anterior to this state of things, the spectroscope is silent.      We
are free, so far as the spectroscope can inform us, to adopt the
hypothesis which other considerations may make most probable.
On Dr. Croll'st form of the impact theory of stellar evolution, which
begins by assuming the existence of stellar masses in motion, and
considers all subsequent evolutional stages to follow from the energy
of this motion converted into heat by the collision of two such bodies,

solid bodies had been converted into a gas of a very high temperature.
They would take the same place, if we assume with Sir William
Thomson* the coming together of two or more cool solid masses by the
velocity due to their mutual gravitation alone.
   I   pointed out in 1864f that the gaseous nature of these bodies
would afford an explanation of the appearance of flat disks without
condensation which many of them present.                The light emitted by the
portions of the gas further from us would be in part or wholly
absorbed by the gas through which it would have to pass, in this way
giving to us the appearance of a luminous surface only.
   In some of these bodies there is also a very faint continuous
spectrum, which if we had more light might be found to consist, in
great part at least, of closely adjacent bright lines. Such is probably
the nature, in part, of the apparently continuous spectrum of the
nebula with which this paper deals chiefly, the Great Nebula in
Orion.
   In other gaseous nebulae strong condensations are seen, and a
             " continuous "                      When we come to nebulas of

venience I called in my original observations                  of these bodies a
" continuous " spectrum, though I was careful to point out that it was
             "
probably crossed by bright or dark lines."
   Out of about sixty nebulas and close clusters observed by me
up to 186G, I found a proportion of about one- third, namely, nineteen,
to present the spectrum of bright lines.J
   The stage of evolution which the nebula in Andromeda represents is
no longer a matter of hypothesis.              The splendid photograph recently
taken by Mr. Roberts§ of this nebula shows a planetary system at a
somewhat advanced stage of evolution ; already several planets have
been thrown off, and the central gaseous mass has condensed to a
moderate size as compared with the dimensions it must have possessed
before any planets had been formed.
    [Mr. Maunder permits me to add that he does not consider the
measures and estimations of the motions of the nebula               taken in 1884
and 1887 of any weight, but he attaches great importance to the
direct comparisons of March, 1884, which show that the nebula has
but very little,     if any, sensible motion     in the line of sight. — May 16.]

 L " On the Magnetic Rotation of the Plane of Polarisation of
        Light in doubly refracting Bodies." By A. W. Ward.
        Communicated by Professor                 J. J.  THOMSON,     F.R.S.  Re
        ceived April 13, 1889.
    In repeating Villari's* experiment            on the rotation of the plane of
 polarisation   of light   in a  spinning    disk  of heavy glass, placed with its
axis of rotation perpendicular to the lines of force in a magnetic field,
 it was observed that the incident plane polarised light became ellip-
 tically polarised. The elliptic polarisation was due to the centrifugal
 force which had the effect of stretching the glass along the radii of the
disk and compressing it parallel to the axis of rotation. The strained
glass in the magnetic field has, therefore, the double property of
elliptically polarising plane polarised light, and at the same time
rotating the plane of polarisation. The strained glass therefore acted
 like a crystal placed in a magnetic field, and so before Villari's experi
ment could be properly interpreted, it was necessary to examine how
the elliptic polarisation and magnetic rotation affect each other. The
following investigation is an attempt to solve this question, and its
conclusions show that the apparent magnetic rotation in a doubly
refractive medium is a periodic function of the length of the path of
light in the medium.            This result entirely accounts for the effects
observed by Villari, and those observed by Liidtge in a piece of com
pressed glass.
    Let the axes of the doubly refracting diamagnetic medium be taken
as those of * and y, and let the axis of z be the direction in which the
light travels.
    Let a be the inclination of the plane of vibration of the incident
light to that of xz. The equation of the incident light may be written

       and  /ls are the refractive     indices along the axes of x and y respec
 tively.       We may, therefore, put ft equal to kz where k is a constant
 for the same medium and wave-length. Hence w is a function of z,
 and we can find the increase in              m  due to an increase dz in z.             It is
 given by

       This equation gives us the rotation of the plane of polarisation due
  to the doubly refracting nature of the medium, while the light passes
  through a thickness dz. Let us suppose the effect of the magnetic
  rotation on the light traversing the element dz, may be represented by
  an additional rotation of these axes
                                          da  = m     dz,
   where m is a constant depending on the nature of the medium and
   the strength of the magnetic field. Hence, when both these small
   effects are superposed we get
                             dio = mdz—\k sin          4iu tan kz     dz.
        Let us denote by ul the value of             w  when m is positive, and o)2 its
    value when m is negative.            Then the apparent magnetic rotation is

an equation which gives the true magnetic rotation, as of course                it
should do.
   If a = It/4, so that a becomes infinite, the equation becomes

In this case the  light is circularly polarised
   To examine this equation generally it is advisable to write it some
what differently. Let us put

expressed as an angle.
Hence                           0=/(?M.

70           Magnetic Rotation        of   the   Plane of Polarisation.                   [May 9,
     This value for Q/9 accounts for the fact that doubly refracting
bodies do not exhibit any rotation of the plane of polarisation,* if the
direction of the ray of light is inclined to the optic axis. When light
goes through a crystal in the direction of the optic axis, magnetic
rotation has been observed. E. Becquerel has observed rotation in
tourmalin and rock crystal, while Wertheimt has detected a well-
marked rotation in beryl, a feeble one in quartz, but nothing in
Iceland spar.
     [LudtgeJ determined the magnetic rotation along the optic axis of
quartz   and  at various inclinations. The following table gives his
results and the corresponding values of /3 : —

   Liidtge adds that these figures are not to be taken as giving exact
measurements.     No magnetic rotation has been observed in Iceland
spar  even  along the optic axis, and it is worthy of note that in this
crystal /3 very rapidly increases with the inclination to the optic axis.
If the length of the spar be 1 centimetre, then at an inclination of n°
to the optic axis for D line /3 = 318° x nj, while in quartz /3 = 17° x
n3. — May 14.]
   Wertheim has also shown that if a piece of heavy glass be com
pressed, the magnetic rotation is diminished, even when the retarda
tion due to the doubly refracting nature of the compressed glass is
much less than a wave-length.
   Ludtge's experiments on compressed glass show again how the
magnetic rotation is diminished as the doubly refracting property-
increases.  Liidtge gives the following table, where n represents part
of a wave-length retardation and d the magnetic rotation : —
             M....0          0-01   0-2     0-25        0-3    0-45    05          06

     These  results cannot be directly compared with what we should
expect   from  a crystal, since the ends of the glass are free from strain,
and a rotation is there produced, which is observed.
   Villari's results are very similar to Ludtge's. Villari, by spinning
a disk of glass very rapidly, strained            it,

Villari's strained disk and Liidtge's strained prism. The disk was
free from strain in the middle, the prism free from strain at the ends.
    I have repeated Villari's experiment at the Cavendish Laboratory,
using, at Mr. Glazebrook's suggestion, an elliptic analyser to deter
mine the magnetic rotation. With the disk spinning about 200 times
a second, the magnetic rotation was reduced from 10° to 6°.      This is
not so great a diminution as Villari observed, but his glass may have
been softer and more easily strained.
    Villari thought that the effect he observed was due to the time
required to magnetise the glass. That this supposition was erroneous
has been clearly established       by the experiments of Bichat and
Blond lot, recently repeated by Dr. Lodge.         In these experiments
the oscillating discharge of a Leyden jar was found to rotate the plane
of polarisation in time with the oscillations. Before hearing of these
results   I had myself attacked the problem in a somewhat similar
manner. A coil of wire was wound round a piece of heavy glass, and
a current alternated 250 times a second by a tnning-fork was sent
through the coil.     The current was measured by a dynamometer and
a tangent galvanometer.      The first gave the measure of the current
independently of its sign, the second showed that the integral current
was zero.     When the current was passing it was found impossible to
extinguish the light, owing to the rapid alternations of the plane of
polarisation.

    In conclusion, have to express my thanks to Professor Thomson

    After noticing and giving the results of the earlier determinations
of the atomic weight of gold, and the recent researches of Kriiss and
of Thorpe and Laurie, the author reports upon experiments of his
own in the same direction, which have occupied much of his time and
labour for the last three or four years.
    The difficulties connected with the accurate determination of the
atomic weight of this metal are remarked upon, and the general
 principles are reviewed which ought to be observed in all investiga
 tions of this kind.

cautions are described in detail which were resorted to in purifying
the metallic gold to be employed in the research, with the history of
some samples of "proof" and "trial plate" gold, obtained from the
Mint establishments of the United States and England.         The general
precautions observed in the course of the work are described, particu
larly the use of an arrangement for evaporating some of the gold
solutions with exclusion of the organic matter of atmospheric dust.
    A detailed account is given of the methods adopted in seven series
of experiments, looking to more or less independent determinations of
the atomic weight sought, viz. : —
    First Series. — Division of a uniform neutral solution in water of
auric chloride into two accurately weighed and nearly equal portions ;
precipitation from the one portion by sulphur dioxide of metallic

   If  the general mean be taken of the results of all these series of
experiments, using the average value derived from each, and giving
all an equal weight, the number 196-910 is obtained for the atomic
weight of gold.
   But reasons are given for feeling much less confidence in the
results of the fifth and sixth series of experiments (made by electro
lysis) than in the rest; if these two series be excluded the general
mean becomes 196'882.
   A certain degree of suspicion as to possible constant error having
been shown to perhaps affect the results of the fourth series, if this also
be left out, and only the first three and the seventh series be considered,
the general mean       will be 196'796.
    And finally, if, for the sake of comparison with the results of the
recent researches of other chemists, only the first three series be
included, in which auric chloride and bromide were examined, the
general mean will be 196' 762 — a result rather higher than that of
 Kruss and lower than that of Thorpe and Laurie, but nearer to the
 latter than the former.
    In conclusion, reference is made to the bearing of the results
reached on Mendelejeff's periodic classification of the elements, and
on the hypothesis of Prout, and attention is drawn to the desirability
of a general re-examination of atomic weights, not by a single method
only in each case, or by methods more or less nearly similar or
 dependent on each other, resting satisfied with a close agreement of
 results under these conditions, but by as many distinct and indepen
 dent methods as may be possible for each element examined.

   The sulphate is somewhat            readily decomposed by heat, the
chloride and oxychloride are known to be unstable, and liable to con
siderable variation of composition according to the method of prepa-
tions, and the conditions under which these variations of composition
are brought about were not understood, except in so far as the
researches of Troost and others have indicated the great tendency
which they show to pass into volatile and non-volatile oxychlorides
of complicated character.
   The determination is rendered difficult and unsatisfactory in con
sequence of —
   (a.) The difficulty of obtaining pure zirconia, and its separation
           from iron, titanium, and from silica.
   (6.)  The    tendency to form basic salts, and the hygroscopic cha
           racter of its salts, and their general instability.
   (e.)  The   tenacity with which the hydrated zirconia retains the
           alkalies and smaller quantities of impurities in general.

1889.]               Zirconium and its Atomic Weight.                      75
    Under these circumstances it seemed to me essential that any
determination of the atomic weight of this element should be pre
ceded by an inquiry into the best method of preparing pure zirconia,
and an examination of the salts which might be made use of for the
purpose,    especially with reference to their stability.
                        Preparation of Crude Zirconia.
   The raw material consisted of about 300 grams of zircons from
North Carolina, for which        I  was indebted to the kindness of Sir
Henry Roscoe, and in addition to this a quantity of impure zirconia.
The zircons were powdered by heating them to redness, and then
throwing them quickly into cold water ; they were then roughly
powdered in an iron mortar, and finally in an agate mortar, and
passed through linen.         Part of this was treated with hydrogen
potassium fluoride,      the  product being extracted with water and
recrystallised many times from hot water.             Prepared in this way,
however, the zirconia was still impure, and showed the presence of
iron in small quantities, and in addition to this it was extremely
difficult to get rid of alkali.
   The methods of fusion with sodium carbonate or acid potassium
sulphate are troublesome and even less satisfactory.
   Ultimately caustic soda and sodium fluoride were adopted for break
ing up the zircons as recommended by Linnemann, and a modified
form of the process followed out by him (' Monatsh. f. Chem.,' vol. 6,
p. 337) was adopted as the most convenient.         A mixture of 100 grams
of caustic    soda and  10 grams  of sodium  fluoride  is heated in a covered
silver dish over a large Bunsen burner, 25 grams of finely powdered
zircons are added in portions, the melt being kept stirred, and the
heating continued for about an hour or so long as there is any
effervescence.      The resulting mass is broken up and extracted with
water, the residue consisting principally of sodium zirconate, but
containing also silica and undecomposed zircon, oxide of iron, &c.
This is now digested with dilute hydrochloric acid and filtered,
the residue being subjected repeatedly to the same treatment.
The acid solution containing the zirconium is evaporated to perfect
dryness, and then exhausted with very dilute hydrochloric acid, and
the silica filtered off. The process of solution and evaporation is
repeated until the residue obtained dissolves completely in the acid.
The impurity now present in the largest quantity is iron, and it was
thought desirable to remove the bulk of this first. The hydrochloric
acid solution is, therefore, evaporated to small bulk, and left to cool ;
the oxychloride of zirconium separates out in acicular crystals, leaving
the iron jn solution.      The crystals are thrown into a funnel, and the
liquid   as  far as possible removed at the pump, and the process of
solution and separation of crystals in this way repeated several

times.     On precipitation of the final products with ammonia the
crude zirconia is obtained, which forms the starting point for further
purification.     In farther operations, reagents (such as potassium or
sodium salts) which could not be removed by volatilisation were
avoided, and even at the present stage it was considered advisable to
redissolve the zirconia in hydrochloric acid, and reprecipitate with
ammonia three times in order to get rid of the bulk of the sodium
salts.
                       Purification of     the Crude   Zirconia.
   This crude zirconia, free from the impurities that occur in larger
quantity, was dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and crystallised out as
oxychloride. The aqueous solution of this, slightly acidulated, was
treated with sulphuretted hydrogen for twenty-four hours ; a gela
tinous precipitate was obtained of a purplish-black colour, consisting
principally of sulphides of silver and copper, together with some
hydrated zirconia.          To the filtrate saturated with sulphuretted
hydrogen was now added a little ammonia, which had the effect of
bringing down a little more zirconia, and also the small quantities of
impurities precipitable by ammonium sulphide. The liquid was now
acidulated and boiled down to get rid of the sulphuretted hydrogen,
and excess of oxalic acid added to the concentrated solution to pre
cipitate gadolinite earths, and finally treated with ammonium oxalate.
There still remained some iron which had either not been removed or
had been introduced in the course of treatment.                    To separate this
the oxychloride was crystallised repeatedly from concentrated hydro
chloric acid, and finally washed with a mixture of the acid with
one part of alcohol and ten parts of ether.                     The only impurity
that could now be detected was soda, which the zirconia retained
with the greatest tenacity.
    This was removed by precipitating               the zirconia several times by
means of ammonia, and redissolving it in hydrochloric acid.                       The
zirconia finally precipitated by ammonia was washed* so long as any
ammonium salts could be detected in the wash water.
    The zirconia obtained was tested as to purity in the following
way : —
    (1.) A portion treated with hydrofluoric acid showed no alteration
in weight ;
    (2.) The moist oxide dissolved completely in oxalic acid ;
    (3.) On ignition it was perfectly white (inclined to a bluish cast),
and a quantity exhausted with hydrochloric showed no trace of iron
by the most delicate tests.
   * Some of the earlier results had to    be rejected because of incomplete washing.
20 grams of zirconia required to be washed 1 50 times at the pump before ammonia
salts were got rid of, at least 50 litres of water being used in the process.

   In   order, however, to have a farther guarantee that the product
used   for the determination of atomic weight had a definite composi
tion and character, the experiments described later for the determina
tion of atomic weight were made upon four portions, whose final
treatment was as essentially different as possible.
   Portion A was precipitated from an acid solution of the sulphate
by the addition of hydrogen peroxide containing no other impurity
than sulphuric acid.
   Portion B was transformed into the tetrachloride by heating the
zirconia with charcoal in a current of chlorine and then reprecipitated
by ammonia.
   Portion G was crystallised out from concentrated sulphuric acid by
boiling off part of the excess of acid and then allowing to cool.
   Portion D was further recrystallised from hydrochloric acid and
washed very thoroughly with a mixture of hydrochloric acid, alcohol,
and ether as described.
                       Stability of the Zirconium Salts.
   In  the case of zirconium it was evident that the number of com
pounds of a simple character and of sufficient stability to afford a
good basis for a determination of atomic weight must be very
limited.      The principles, therefore, on which it was decided to
proceed were    —
   (a.) To prepare zirconia by several independent methods.
    (b.) To ascertain the most stable salt (or salts if more than one
           should prove stable), and the most simple transformation of
           this which would lead to an accurate determination.
Indeed it seems to me in general that unless there are two or more
salts of a very stable character, ihat reliance should lean rather
towards the production of the raw material by independent processes,
than towards the confirmation of results obtained from a more stable
salt by means of values derived from observations on one that is less
stable.

    Tn addition to these it seemed possible that the relations —
    (4.) Zr to ZrOg by direct oxidation of the metal,
    (5.) Zr (in Zr02) to Br (in AgBr) on analysis of ZrBr^, might be
worthy of examination.
    The bodies, therefore, to be investigated were the metal, the
oxide, the chloride, the oxychloride, bromide, sulphate, and double
fluoride. With regard to the last mentioned, no further investigation
was considered necessary after the very complete treatment it has
received at the hands of Marignac following upon the work of
Berzelius on the double fluorides.
                 Preparation and Properties of Zirconium.
    Zirconium was first obtained by Berzelius (' Poggendorff, Annalen,'
vol. 4, p. 117) by heating the anhydrous potassium zirconium fluoride
with metallic potassium in an iron tube.        It is described by him as
being an amorphous black powder without lustre and resembling
charcoal in appearance.       Becquerel, by electrolysis of a concentrated
solution of the oxychloride, and Troost (' Journ. Prakt. Chem.,'
vol. 97, p. 171), by fusing together potassium zirconium fluoride and
aluminium, obtained it in a crystalline form, though it does not seem
to have been in either case quite pure.          Phipson (' Journ. Prakt.
 Chem.,'  vol. 96,  p. 447) found  that like carbon,  boron, and silicon it
can be obtained by heating together magnesium and zirconia and
then extracting the excess of magnesium and the magnesia by means
 of dilute hydrochloric acid.
    There was left a black amorphous powder resembling that de
 scribed by Berzelius. No determinations are, however, given to show
 how far this was free from impurity, and whether it contained unre
 duced oxide.      A repetition of Phipson's experiments showed that as
 far as the presence of foreign impurity is concerned it leaves nothing
 to be desired, though I have not succeeded in preparing the metal by
 this or any other of the methods in a state of sufficient purity for a
 determination of atomic weight. Phipson's method is a very con
 venient one for preparing the metal, and the following results will
 show the conditions most favourable to its production in this way.
    Experiments were first tried with intimate mixtures of magnesium
 powder, 3 grams and 5 grams respectively, with 4'4 grams of zirconia,
 the mixture being heated to bright redness in an iron tube, the mouth
 of the tube being filled with finely powdered common salt. There
 remained, after repeated digestion with dilute hydrochloric acid, a
 fine black powder, so fine that it passed through the filter-paper and
 remained in part suspended for weeks in water, showing a reddish-
 purple coloration by transmitted light.

    When dried and heated in air to a point far below redness it glowed
and was transformed into zirconia with a small increase in weight.
It evidently consisted of zirconia containing only a small percentage
of the metal.       When rubbed in an agate mortar, however, it showed
no white particles, and the variability of its composition, as shown in
these and other experiments, lent no support to the assumption that
a lower oxide had been formed. In a second set of experiments,
magnesium foil was used, and in this case the foil retained its form,
although permeated by metallic zirconium exactly as it does in the
 reduction of carbon compounds.          By separating the foil from the
 finer powder it was possible to obtain zirconium almost free from
 oxide. Three specimens were prepared : A resembled those already
 described, a velvety black powder, B had a slight greenish cast, and C
 a decided olive-green colour with a slight lustrous appearance.
     It was thought, therefore, that A would prove to be the purest
 zirconium, judging from the experience of previous experimenters.
      Samples were carefully heated in a stream of air, the moisture and
  carbonic acid (arising from carbon in the magnesium used) directly
  determined, and the proportion of Zr and Zr02 arrived at by calcula
  tion, knowing the original weight of substance taken and. the weight
  of Zr02 left in the boat.
      A simply glowed and passed into a white powder as the previous
  specimens had done, B burnt with a white light much more brightly
  than A had done, and C gave out a dazzling light resembling in its
  brightness that of burning magnesium ; when thrown into the flame
  of a Bunsen burner they gave beautiful white scintillations.
      The results of the analysis gave the following composition : —
                                      A.            B.         c.

      A  careful examination showed that no iron or magnesium was pre
   sent, and, indeed, after precipitation of the zirconia, the residual
   impurity from half a gram weighed less than a milligram, and con
   sisted entirely of silica, introduced doubtless by the ammonia used
   in precipitation. Preparation C was, therefore, almost pure zirconium,
   containing only a slight admixture of oxide ; rubbed up in an agate
   mortar it showed a brassy lustre. It is stated generally that zir
   conium is hardly acted upon at all by mineral acids or aqua regia,
    but dissolves in hydrofluoric acid.     My own observations confirm
    these statements, with the exception that concentrated sulphuric acid
    begins to act in the cold even, and on gently warming the action pro

ceeds rapidly with a copious evolution of sulphur dioxide, and even
with the production of free sulphur.
   Dilute sulphuric acid (1 : 1) acts more slowly with the evolution of
hydrogen.
   Zirconium ia acted upon also by chlorine and bromine, in which,
on gentle heating, it undergoes vivid combustion, forming the tetra-
haloid derivatives, and this is, indeed, a convenient method for ob
taining these bodies.      The iodide could not be obtained.          When the
zirconium    was  filtered,  after   the  digestion  with  dilute  hydrochloric
acid, and dried, it was found to have occluded hydrogen.               This was
removed by exposing it        in  vacuo for some days, and removing the
hydrogen by the mercury pump.
   The Oxides. — The only points for remark in addition to what has
already been published, relate to the reduction (?) of zirconia and to
the peroxide of zirconium.
   With regard to the former it has already been noticed that when
zirconia is heated, surrounded by the reducing flame of coal-gas, it
blackens. This blackening is only superficial, however, and is in all
probability due to a thin deposit of carbon, and it reoxidises readily
to a white powder when heated in air, with a decrease of weight —
small, indeed, but distinct.         Heated at the highest temperature of
the blowpipe flame in hydrogen, it undergoes no reduction.

   Cleve (' Paris Soc. China. Bull.,' vol. 43, p. 53) precipitated an
oxide, to which he assigned the composition ZrOs, by adding ammonia
and hydrogen peroxide to a solution containing a zirconium salt ; my
own experiments (' Chem. Soc. Journ.,' vol. 49, p. 481), in which the
oxide was precipitated from a dilute solution by the addition of
hydrogen peroxide alone, the solution being slightly acid, gave an
oxide agreeing well with the composition Zr206 ; it was found also
that an oxide resembling Cleve's conld be obtained without the
addition of ammonia.        In order to see whether the peroxide, Zr02,
was identical with that obtained by Cleve,             I  precipitated a large
quantity of a moderately concentrated solution of zirconium sulphate,
containing a slight excess of acid —

   Tt is evident, therefore, that with due precaution an oxide agreeing
very definitely with the formula ZrOs, is obtainable by precipitation
with hydrogen peroxide, either in alkaline or acid solution.        The
addition   of ammonia, especially in excess,         is,
                                                   however, not to be
recommended, since     ittends to bring down the ordinary oxide, and to
decompose the hydrogen peroxide added, with the production of
nitrous and nitric acid.     Dried for several weeks over phosphorus
pentoxide, the oxide became constant in weight and showed the com
position ZrOs.3H20, the hydrate of zirconia being Zr02.2H20.        The
salt, however, lost about    2per cent. of oxygen during the process of
drying,   and  if this was  carried out at 100°    had the composition
                                                     it
Zr204.
                          Zirconium Tetrachloride.
   About 30 grams of this salt were prepared in the usual way, by
passing dry chlorine over a mixture of charcoal and zirconia. If              a
determination was to be made from this salt some process of purifica
tion was necessary, and   criterion that
                            a              body of constant composi

                                               it   is
 oxychlorides exist.
    For this purpose a combustion-tnbe, in which the chloride was pre
 pared, was drawn out into a series of bulbs, separated by constrictions.
 The chloride was then sublimed     (alower temperature being used for each
 successive bulb)   in  a current  of  dry chlorine into these bnlbs, which
 were separately sealed off and their contents analysed. It was hoped in
 this way that two or more bulbs would be obtained showing con
cordant results, bat notwithstanding that every precaution was taken
to exclude air and moisture, no such result could be achieved, and
decomposition was clearly indicated to have taken place with the for
mation of traces of a reddish-brown product, the equivalent of
chlorine in relation to zirconium being in some cases higher and in
others lower than four to one. Furthermore, in no case was            it  found
possible  to prepare   such a   product perfectly   free from   silica or  iron.
It seems, indeed, that zirconium tetrachloride              even more liable
                                                           is

  This salt  isprepared, as already stated, by crystallisation from con
centrated hydrochloric acid. The difficulties attending its preparation
in the pure state arise from the presence of free hydrochloric acid
and from, the readiness with which the salt passes into oxychlorides
of a more basic character. Berzelius attempted to remove the excess
of free acid by heating the salt to 60°, but was not able to obtain          a
definite product, his numbers being —

    The salt examined by me was prepared by repeated crystallisa
tion from concentrated hydrochloric acid, washed with hydrochloric
acid till the washings were colourless and showed no trace of iron,
and then the free acid removed —
    (a.) By washing with a mixture of 1 part of alcohol and 10 parts
            of ether.
    (5.)   By  gently heating the salt,
    (c.) By exposing the finely powdered salt at ordinary temperature
            in a vacuous desiccator over potash, until no HC1 appeared
            when air was passed over it.
    The analysis was performed by dissolving the salt in water and
precipitating the zirconia with ammonia, then acidulating with nitric
 acid, and precipitating the chlorine by means of silver nitrate.

 those obtained by using the methods (a) and (c).

 diminution of chlorine occurred during the process.         It will be suffi

weight of zirconium as 92, which is undoubtedly too high, and, more
over, it will be quite evident from these numbers that no trustworthy
determination was to be expected from this salt.
                             The Tefrabromide.
   This salt was prepared by heating zirconia in an atmosphere of
bromine vapour, but proved no more promising in its behaviour than
the corresponding chlorine derivative.
                               The Sulphate.
    Several methods of preparing the sulphate were tried, but ulti
 mately that originally used by Berzelius was adopted.             Finely
 powdered zirconia (air-dried) was heated with concentrated sulphuric
 acid, and most of the excess of acid driven off at as low a temperature
 as possible.   In order to obtain the normal sulphate Berzelius drove
 off the excess of sulphuric acid, and then heated for a quarter of an
 hour, but never to redness ; Mats Weibull heated till constant at 300°,
 a temperature manifestly too low. Cleve, in a private communication,
 advised me to heat in a sulphur bath (442°).        It seemed, however,
 that in this instance, where the atomic weight depended on deter
 minations from the sulphate alone, and especially since this is a
 general method applicable to several other elements, it was desirable
 that the limits of temperature within which the normal sulphate was
 stable ought to be ascertained.       This was done in the case of a
 number of sulphates (Bi, Mg, Zn, Di), and the details of the investi
 gation have already appeared ('Chem. Soc. Journ.,' vol. 51, p. 676).
    The salt containing excess of sulphuric acid was heated in a bath,
 described in that communication, which could be easily kept within
 5°, and at any temperature up to 500°.      The boat containing the salt
 was weighed from time to time until it became nearly constant. The
 salt was then finely powdered, and the heating continued in periods
 of about fonr hours, until no further diminution of weight occurred,
 showing that the free sulphuric acid had been got rid of. The tem
 perature of the bath was now raised by intervals of about 10°, and
 the heating continuod for several hours at each limit, weighings being
 made after each increment until a point was arrived at at which loss
 of weight was again observed.       This indicated that the temperature
 had been attained at which the normal salt began to undergo decom
 position. We have then the limits of temperature within which the
 normal sulphate is stable.      Several series of determinations were
 made, and one of these is given to show the character of the values
 obtained.

    The above numbers have not had applied to them the small correc
 tions fpr variations of barometer and thermometer, and no importance
 need be attached to the differences of one or two tenths of a milli
 gramme between 350° and 400°.
    It appears, therefore, from these experiments that zirconium sul
 phate is stable up to 400°, and that the excess of sulphuric acid is
 driven off completely at 350°. If, therefore, a mixture of (be salt and
 the free acid, prepared as above, be heated at any temperature between,
 o50° and 400° till constant, we shall obtain the normal sulphate.       The
 temperature of the sulphur bath would be too high, and of course at
 dull redness decomposition would set in.
                      The Atomic Weight of Zirconium.
    After what has been said it may appear that the previous determi
nations of atomic weight from the sulphate would be too high rather
than too low, since there can be little doubt that Berzelius heated the
salt above 400°.    It does not follow, however, that by heating it for
a   short  time  at a   moderately high temperature more than a small
fraction of the salt would be brought under conditions favourable to
decomposition, nor even would the temperature of the mass be such
 that the whole of the free sulphuric acid would be got rid of. And
 the fact that on repeating such a treatment no variation in weight
 occurred, would be no guarantee that the salt was normal zirconium
sulphate.     My own experiments show that to get rid of the excess of
acid requires prolonged heating, and at the same time renewal of the
atmosphere in the vessel containing the sulphate.          Apropos of this,
Berzelius's precaution    to  introduce into  the crucible in the last stage
of the ignition of the sulphate a little ammonium carbonate is a very
necessary one, as it displaces often 2 or 3 milligrams of sulphuric acid,
which otherwise seems to remain in the crucible time after time and
fix itself in the zirconia, when the crucible begins to cool. Further
more, whatever previous experience may have been (for no special
precaution is mentioned in any case),      I have found it most difficult to
ignite zirconium sulphate without loss ; the decomposition occurs

 with such violence at first, and the resulting zirconia is               so extremely
 light that, though every care was taken, varying results were got,
 even in igniting very gently over the bunsen burner, some as low as
 43 per cent. of oxide instead of 43'3 at least.               On carefully watching,
 it was seen that minute particles of zirconia were being carried out of
 the   crucible, although the cover fitted well. This loss was only
 avoided by enclosing the crucible within a second larger one, whose
 cover fitted quite closely and only communicated with the external
 atmosphere by a drawn-out neck, so that there were no air-currents.
 Even then, if the crucible was placed over the blowpipe flame at once,
loss occurred and it was necessary in every case to commence the
operation over the flame of a bunsen burner, and then after half an
hour to transfer to the blowpipe.
    Part of the determinations were made by Berzelius in the wet way
— that is, the zirconia was first precipitated by means of ammonia,
and then the sulphuric acid determined in the filtrate by precipitation
with barium chloride.
    Having satisfied myself by careful comparative experiments that
the results of both methods, under favourable conditions, correspond,
I   decided to adopt the dry method, viz., that of conversion of the
sulphate into the oxide by ignition —
    (a.) Because     it involved the least complicated             operations  and the
          fewest assumptions.
    (6.) Because under some circumstances basic zirconium sulphate is
          thrown down when ammonia is added to a solution of the
          sulphate.

   The balance used could be read directly to T\t milligram, and had
been proved to be a most reliable instrument. The weights were an
excellent set by Staudinger of Giessen, and showed an average varia
tion from the normal amounting to only 0'000035 gram.
   Corrections were introduced —
    (a.) For the weights.
    (6.) For displacement            of air and variations          in temperature and
                  pressure.
    (c.) For variations arising by reason of the different hygroscopic
                  conditions of the desiccator and balance case.
    Inany case where condensation of moisture was liable to occur this
was corrected for by noting the increment of weight per minute for
several minutes whilst exposed in the balance case, and then con
structing a curve, with increment of weight and time as ordinate and
abscissa, from which the necessary correction at the time of weighing
could be introduced. In nearly all cases over 2 grams of the sulphate
was used for each determination, and even with 2 grams a difference
of 1 milligram in the weight of the zirconia obtained implies a dif
ference of 0'25 in the atomic weight ; it     therefore, evident that in

     Applications to Chemical Analysis.— Preliminary Notice.¦'
     By W. N. Hartley, F.R.S., Royal College of Science,
     Dublin. Received April 22, 1889.
   Having   recently communicated to the Royal Duhlin Society
                                  " On the Constitution of the Electric
(March 20th) a paper entitled
Spark," I have described a means of obtaining deposits of metals and
of metallic oxides, which serves as a very delicate test for some of the
metals.   It has been considered desirable to devote much further
study to the subject, and a method of working has been devised which,
so far as it has been applied, appears to be especially useful in the
examination of certain metallurgical products, as for instance in the
detection and even estimation of the precious metals in copper, lead,
and tin, and of certain impurities in copper. The method may be stated
to be carried out in the following manner : — Electrodes of the metals
to be tested are put into communication with the wires of an induction
coil used for the production of condensed 9parks, such as serve for
the photographing of the ultra-violet spectra.     When a plate of mica
through which a series of pin-holes has been pricked is placed in the
path of the spark and the current is passed for a period varying from
5 to 10, 15, 20, 30, and 60 seconds, a series of deposits of different
degrees of tenuity are obtained, which are metallic with the noble
metals, such as silver, gbld, palladium, iridium, and platinum, and are
oxides with such metals as are oxidisable, for instance magnesium,
zinc, cadmium, lead, tin, copper, iron, nickel and cobalt, aluminium,
indium, thallium, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.
   Gold gives films of extreme tenuity and beautiful in richness of
colour, partly deep red or rose-tinted, but chiefly of a magnificent
blue, with a shade of green in the thinnest part of the deposit.
   Silver gives yellow films, while palladium, iridium, and platinum
give different shades of brown. The films are different as to the
area which they cover, the difference being due to the volatility and
the colouring power of the metals.       Gold is by far the most remark
able in this respect.   The colours of the oxides, such as various shades
of brown with iron, cobalt, nickel, thallium, cadmium, bismuth, and
yellow with zinc and lead, serve as tests by which they can be recog
nised. The volatility of the oxides is also a distinctive feature ; arsenic
forms a remarkable series of rings round the pin-hole, and other
metals, antimony standing next, are thus distinguishable.
   It is stated in the paper already quoted that beside the metallic
deposit which silver gives, there is a yellow colour and a tinge of rose
colour and violet. The silver employed was originally prepared by

 1889.]           On Films produced by Vaporised Metals.                    89
 the late Dr. W. A. Miller, F.R.S., for spectroscopic purposes, and it is
remarkably pure. The photographed spectra of this metal yield no
lines traceable to gold or any other foreign element. (For its spectrum
      '
see Phil. Trans.,' 1884, pp. 109 and 134.)          Nevertheless I considered
that the rose-red and violet tints on the mica films were dne to minute
traces of gold. Since then, in order to prove or disprove this point,
attempts have been made to prepare specimens of perfectly pure silver
by the processes of M. Stas, but so far no samples have been obtained
which can be relied upon as absolutely free from gold. In one case
the chloride precipitated from a cold solution was digested several
times with hot aqua regia, washed completely free from soluble
matter until the washings had no acid reaction, and subsequently
reduced to metal by boiling with pure caustic alkali and milk sugar.
This specimen was found to give a characteristic yellow film, but there
was a trace of violet-grey surrounding the yellow of the silver, which
resembled the colour obtained from metal to which traces of gold
had been added, and which became deeper and deeper in colour as
the quantity of gold was increased.          An alloy was made by melting
this sample of silver and adding thereto T555T5tn °f its weight of pure
gold. The alloy was heated to boiling point for a minute ; in order
to agitate and completely mix the metals, the fused metal was kept
in rapid rotation, and it was granulated by pouring it into water.
The cooled metal was next treated in a manner intended to render it
homogeneous in composition ; thus, it was hammered out flat, broken
 in pieces, and again melted, the fused metal being granulated, and the
 solidified drops being again hammered into disks. By a precisely
similar treatment alloys were made from this metal containing pro
portions of gold amounting to no more than Tir&Tra*h ant^ louotgth.
respectively.
    The hammered beads, generally about a decigramme in weight, were
submitted to the action of the spark, and deposits of the metal on
mica were obtained by passing the spark for 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, and
60 seconds.
    The difference between the deposits from the alloy containing
 10'()0th of gold was clearly seen with the naked eye in all cases.       The
alloy    containing t fl 1 6?th was as clearly seen to contain less gold than
 the foregoing, and more than that with loa1aft6*¦" ! an<l tnat 'with
  lO6V, 6 6^ gave unmistakeable evidence of gold when examined with a
2-inch power under the microscope.          The gold tints of rose-red and
blue were observed as rings even in cases where the spark had passed
for no longer than 5 seconds.           Indeed these tests with the shorter
duration of the spark gave the best evidence, since too much of the
silver deposit obscured the characteristic colours. On the other hand,
 a much longer exposure of 10 or 20 minutes widely diffused the
 deposit of gold, and rendered it evident outside the silver.         It may

thus far be considered      as  proved that a decigramme of silver con
taining -nnnnsst'h of gold gives a distinctive deposit of this metal,
which is recognised by its colour, and that silver as pure as that
obtained by the process of M. Stas which          I have described gives no
such decisive indication, though it does not yield films which can be
considered as absolutely free from gold.           Furthermore, this test for
gold is more sensitive than that depending upon the employment of
the spectroscope.      Many specimens of copper and silver have been
tested, and in each of them there appears to be a trace of gold.
   Gold of the fineness of 9, 12, 15, 18, and 22 carats has been shown
to yield films each with distinctive characters.
   The various deposits of oxides and of some metals are easily treated
 with such acid and other reagents as are gaseous or capable of being
volatilised, and the colour reactions of the sulphides may be obtained
as definite rings of larger or smaller diameter, corresponding with the
volatility of the metals.
   The application of this method may ultimately be made to lead to
valuable results, but most of the large number of films already pre
pared have yet to be examined, and their properties described ; it is
therefore proposed to deal exhaustively with the subject in a future
communication.

I. "   On a possible Geological Origin of Terrestrial Magnetism."
      By Edward Hull, M.A., LL.D., F.R.S., Director of the
      Geological Survey of Ireland.         Received April 30, 1889.
                                (Abstract.)
   The author commenced by pointing out that the origin and cause
of terrestrial magnetism were still subjects of controversy amongst
physicists, and this paper was intended to show that the earth itself
contains within its crust a source to which these phenomena may be
traced, as hinted at by Gilbert, Biot, and others; though owing to
the want of evidence regarding the physical structure of our globe
in the time of these observers, they were unable to identify the
supposed earth's internal magnet.
   The author then proceeded to show cause for believing that there

                                                              " magma,"
the former less dense and highly silicated, the latter basic and rich
in magnetic iron-ore. This view was in accordance with those of
Durocher, Prestwich, Fisher, and many other geologists.        The com
position of this inner magma, and the condition in which the mag
netic iron-ore exists were then discussed, and it was shown that it
probably exists under the form of numerous small crystals with a
polar arrangement.      Each little crystal being itself a magnet, and
having crystallised out from the magma while this latter was in a
viscous condition, the crystalline grains would necessarily assume a
polar arrangement which would be one of equilibrium.       Basalt might
be taken as   the typical rock of this magma.
   The thickness and depth of the magnetic magma beneath the
surface of the globe were then discussed, and while admitting that it
was impossible to come to any close determination on these points owing
to our ignorance of the relative effects of increasing temperature and
pressure, it was assumed tentatively that the outer surface of the
effective magnetic magma might be at an average depth of about 100
miles, and the thickness about 25 or 30 miles.    The proportion of mag

 netic iron-ore in basaltic rocks was then considered, and it was shown
 that an average of 10 to 15 per cent. would express these proportions ;
 and assuming similar proportions to exist in the earth's magnetic
magma, we should then have an effective terrestrial magnet of from
2J to 3 miles in thickness. The actual magnetic magma or shell
might be very much thicker than that here assumed.
   Instances of polarity in basaltic masses at various localities were
adduced in order to illustrate the possibility of polarity in the internal
mass.     The subject of the polarity of the globe was then discussed,
and it was pointed out how the position of the so-called " magnetic
       " leads to the inference that
poles                                    they are in some way dependent
upon   the  position of the terrestrial poles.
   The author regarded the so-called "double poles " as merely foci
due to protuberances of the magnetic magma into the exterior non
magnetic magma, and considered that there was really only a single
magnetic pole in each hemisphere, embracing the whole region round
the terrestrial pole and theitronger and weaker magnetic foci, and roughly
included within the latitude of 70° within the northern hemisphere.
   It waa pointed out that the poles of a bar-magnet embrace a com
paratively large area of its surface, and hence a natural terrestrial
magnet of the size here indicated may be inferred to embrace a pro-
portionably large tract for its poles.
   In reference to the question why the magnetic poles are situated
near those of the earth itself, this phenomenon seemed to be con
nected with the original consolidation of the crust of the globe, and
the formation of its internal magmas.
   It was pointed out that, owing to the differences of temperature
which must have existed in the polar regions, as compared with
those of the 'equatorial, the process of solidification has been more
rapid in the polar regions than elsewhere, and it was inferred that in
the case of the magnetic magma the process of crystallisation and the
polar arrangement of the particles of magnetic iron-ore would proceed
from the poles towards the equator in a radial direction. The manner
in which the phenomena of magnetic intensity, and of the dip of the
needle at different latitudes could be explained on the hypothesis of
 an earth's internal magnet, such as here described, was then pointed
 out, and the analogy of such a magnet with a magnetic bar passing
through the centre of the earth was illustrated.
    The author then proceeded to account on geo-dynamical principles
for the secular variation of the magnetic needle, and also to show how
the objections that might be raised to the views here advanced, on the
 grounds of the high temperature which must be assumed to exist at
 the depth beneath the surface of the magnetic magma, could be met
 by considerations of pressure, and on this subject read a letter which
 he had received from Sir William Thomson, F.R.S.

 II. " Physiological Action of        the Active Principle of the Seeds
       of Abrus preeatorius (Jequirity)." By SIDNEY MARTIN, M.D.
       London, British Medical Association Research Scholar,
       Assistant Physician to the Victoria Park Chest Hospital,
       and R. Norms Wolfenden, M.D. (Cantab.).                    (From the
       Physiological Laboratory. University College.) Communi
       cated by E. A. Schafer, F.R.S.            Received April 11, 1889.
    The object of the present investigation was to study the physio
logical action of the active principle of the jequirity seed.               A
watery   infusion   of the seeds,  as  is well  known,  produces    severe in
flammation of the conjunctiva when a few drops are placed in the
eye ; and when injected under the skin, or as in the
                                                            " sui " poisoning
of cattle in India, it is fatal to animals.
    Both the local irritant and the poisonous properties of the seed
were formerly ascribed to a specific organism, called the jequirity
bacillus, the nature of which was investigated by Sattler, Cornil, and
Berlioz.    Klein, however, showed that the action could not be due
to a bacillus, since the poison was permanently destroyed by mo-
mentary boiling of the infusion. Warden and Waddell have effectu
ally disposed of the bacillus theory of the action of jequirity, and in
a pamphlet entitled the Non-Bacillar Nature of Abrus Poison ' (Cal
                           '
cutta, 1884), they demonstrated that the poisonous activity of the
seeds was dependent on a proteid body which was called by them
Abrin.    Abrin was considered to be closely allied to egg-albumin
and the vegetable albumins. The reactions given by Warden and
Waddell are, however, by no means conclusive that abrin belongs to
the class of
                " albumins " as understood by physiological chemists.
The fact that it is precipitated from solution by acetic acid shows
that it is not an albumin : this is a reaction common to globulin and
certain other proteid s, such as alkali-albumin.       The reactions, more
over, given by these observers as given by abrin are not distinctive
of it, but are common to all proteids.
   To clear up these discrepancies the proteids of the seed were in
vestigated by one of us (M.), and in a paper published in the Pro
                                                                         '

ceedings of the Royal Society (vol. 42, p. 331) two proteids were
described, a globulin and an albumose.          The globulin was found to
be vegetable paraglobulin, being soluble in 15 per cent, sodium
chloride solution, and coagulating in 10 per cent, magnesium sulphate

solution between 75° and 80° C. The albumose gave the general re
actions of its class, and corresponded to what has been called by
one of as (M.) a-phytalbumose.*
    The physiological action of the globulin has been investigated by
us.     It was isolated by the method detailed in the paper already
quoted. As the method employed is important, it is again mentioned
here.       Both globulin and albumose were extracted from the decorti
cated and crushed seed by a 15 per cent. solution of sodium chloride,
and the clear extract saturated with sodium chloride or ammonium
sulphate after acidulation with acetic acid. The copious saturation
precipitate consists of globulin and albumose : it is dissolved in dis
tilled water, and dialysed in running water until the globulin is in
great part thrown down. The precipitate of globulin so obtained is
separated by filtration and washed on the filter with previously boiled
distilled water until no soluble proteid is present in the washings.
The distilled water removes the salt clinging to the globulin and the
small amount of albumose present. After this thorough washing the
globulin which remains on the filter is a pure proteid. It is removed
from the filter and dried over sulphuric acid. If it has been precipi
tated by ammonium sulphate, the globulin dries in greenish-black
scales, owing to the admixture of colouring matter ; but if sodium
chloride has been used, it is obtained as a whitish-yellow amorphous
 powder.       This was the powder used in our experiments. It consists
 of pure globulin, almost completely soluble in 15 per cent. sodium
 chloride solution. A small portion of the proteid became insoluble
 after dialysing and drying over sulphuric acid.
     The solution used for injection was one made with 15 per cent.
 NaCl solution, which was previously boiled and cooled.
 Physiological Action of       the Globulin. The Globulin of the Seeds of the
       Jequirity has   the  same Physiological Action as the Watery Extract of
       the Seeds and as    the Proteid body "Abrin" described by Warden and
       Waddell.
     Local Action. — A watery infusion of the seeds when placed on the
  conjunctiva causes inflammation of the membrane with purulent dis
  charge. A similar effect is produced by
                                                        " abrin," and
                                                                          precisely a
  similar effect by the pure globulin. This severe local action of abrus
  seeds we therefore ascribe to the globulin of the seeds.
     In one experiment, for example, about 0002 gram of the pure
  globulin was placed on the inner surface of the left eyelid of a large
  rabbit. In 17| hours the conjunctiva was reddened and slightly
  swollen ; there was no chemosis, but there was a clear serous
  discharge from the eye. In twenty-four hours more there was intense

purulent ophthalmia with subconjunctival ecchymosis ; the cornea was
quite clear.    The purulent discharge lasted till the death of the
animal, about eighty-three hours after the inoculation.        The animal
was apparently ill for about four hours before death.         At the post
mortem there was severe subconjunctival haemorrhage, with oedema
 round the eyeball.
    In another experiment, where a very small quantity of the globulin
 in a 15 per cent. NaCl solution was placed on the conjunctiva, there
was inflammation with purulent discharge from the eye in 16£ hours.
 The inflammation rapidly increased (although there were no general
symptoms of poisoning), and began to subside on the sixth day after
inoculation.    In this case there was no subconjunctival haemorrhage,
the amount of globulin used being less than in the first experiment
quoted.
    From both these experiments the local action of the globulin is
evident : it produces intense inflammation, oedema, and local ecchy
mosis, and may produce death if the dose is sufficiently large.
    General Action. — The local irritant effect is also seen when a
solution of the globulin is injected subcutaneously.       The connective
tissue becomes oedematous over a large area, there is congestion, and
if the dose be a large one there are also punctiform ecchymoses. No
suppuration is found, probably because the animal does not live long
enough.
    As regards the general effect on the body produced by abrus-poison,
we have not much to add to the account given by Drs. Warden           and
Waddell     in their pamphlet previously quoted.     Abrus-globulin pro
duces the same effect as the substance called by these observers
 " abrin," and as the watery infusion of the juice.
    If a small quantity of globulin, 0'0022 gram (0-01 gram per
kilo, of body weight), be injected under the skin of a rat weighing
218 grams, symptoms of poisoning begin to appear in about six hours.
The animal then seems a little languid, and in a condition impossible
to distinguish from sleepiness.     It continues in this state, making no
voluntary movement, irresponsive to slight external stimuli, and with
half-shut eyes. It lies huddled up in its cage, the breathing becomes
more rapid, and bloody motions are passed shortly before death,
which occurs in about twenty-four hours after inoculation. If the
animal is with young it aborts.
    Post-mortem there are signs of oedema and ecchymoses. at the seat
of injection, and punctiform ecchymoses also beneath the peritoneum
aud sometimes in the lungs. The intestines are congested, some
times greatly inflamed ; the adenoid patches in the mucous membrane
are swollen, and submucous ecchymoses are often seen.           The blood
sometimes remains fluid for a long time, and is sometimes coagu
lated.

    Fatal  Dose. — The minimal fatal dose of the globulin has not been
determined by ns ; the smallest dose we have found kill is 0-0022 gram
or a dose of 0'Ol gram per kilo, of body weight.
   This   dose took twenty-four hours to kill ; a larger dose        kills more
rapidly, and we have repeatedly demonstrated the fact                 that the
rapidity and intensity of the action of abrus-globulin is proportional
to the quantity used. This is seen in the following table of experi
ments on pigeons      : —

   In analysing the general symptoms produced by abrus-globulin
(abrus-poison) it is seen that there are no convulsions produced and
no definite paralysis, only a general weakening, ending gradually in
death.
   The fact that the poison produces oedema at the seat of injection,
and that death is slow, may point to the idea that the cause of death
is secondary to the local lesion prodnced by the poison, the absorption
of septic material occurring. This is not so, however, and for several
reasons.
   In the first place the local oedema is very slight in amount if the
dose be small, and yet death occurs.        Suppuration, moreover, has not
occurred in any of our experiments. Moreover, if the fatal effect
really occurred from the absorption of septic material, we should
expect a rise of temperature ; the animal would be febrile. This is
not so ; the temperature instead of rising falls in a most remarkable
manner. A few observations were made on cats by Warden and
Waddell on this point. The animals used by us were pigeons, and the
temperature was taken in the rectum every twenty minutes or half
hour after the injection of the globulin. At the same time the number
of respirations per minute was counted, so that in the chart (fig. 1)
the respiration curve can be compared with the temperature curve.
   It will be seen from the chart that the temperature, which was
106'8° F. before inoculation, began to fall in less than half an hour
after the poison had been injected ; that this fall was gradual until
two hours after the inoculation, after which time there is a rapid fall
until death.     The fall of temperature until death was from 106'8° F.
to 83° F. ; i.e., 23-8° F. or 12-6° C.

   The respirations are seen from the curve to diminish more rapidly
than the temperature falls for fifty-five minutes after inoculation;
there is then a stationary period until 115 minutes, after which the
number of respirations per minute rapidly rises until death. The
curves, therefore, show a fall of temperature with an increase in the
number of respirations.
   In other experiments, where the temperature has been regularly
taken, and the respirations counted, the same phenomena have been
observed.
   In  an experiment where a pigeon weighing 397 grams was inocu
lated with 0'15 gram of abrus-globulin (0373 gram per kilo, of body
weight), the fall of temperature was at first very rapid ; from lO?1!0 F.
to 105° F. in less than half an hour, after which the temperature
remained stationary (with slight fluctuations) until near death.
   All the experiments point to the fact that abrus-globulin produces,
when subcutaiieouslr inoculated, a remarkable fall of temperature in
pigeons ; at the same time producing in them great rapidity of
respiration, a phenomenon also observed in mammals.

0'044 gram per      kilo, of body weight was injected into the femoral

    There is, therefore, no marked effect on the blood pressure, nor on
 the inhibitory power of the vagus, such as we noticed on the body
temperature.     The only immediate evident effect of abrus-poisoning is
a fall of the temperature ; symptoms of weakness and of rapid respi
 ration only appear much later, from five to twelve hours after the
subcutaneous inoculation, according to the dose given.

Boiling destroys the activity of a watery extract of abrus seed. We
have performed many experiments with the view of determining at
exactly what temperature the activity of the poison is destroyed. It is
reasonable to suppose that if the chief poisonous principle of abrus
seed is the globulin, that the activity would be destroyed at the tem
perature at which the globulin coagulates ; and this we have found to
be the case.
The    Poisonous Action of Abrus- globulin is completely destroyed by
     momentarily heating a Solution to a Temperature of 75° or 80° C,
     the Temperature at which the Globulin coagulates.
   The heating was done in a test-tube placed in a water-bath ; as
soon as the solution of globulin was at the required temperature, the
tube was removed and rapidly cooled.
    In one experiment, four rats were inoculated     with the same dose of
globulin, which in one case had been heated to 50° C, in another to
60° C, in the third to 70° C, whilst the fourth was unheated ; all the
animals died with symptoms of abrus-poisoning within thirty hours of
the inoculation.    In another  experiment, three rats were inoculated, the
first with a solution   of globulin heated to 75° C, the second with the
same amount heated to 80° C, whilst the third was inoculated with
unheated globulin.      The first two rats, those inoculated with solutions
heated to 75° and 80° C, remained quite well, while the third,
inoculated with unheated globulin, died within twenty-four hours of
abrns-poisoning .
    Experiments performed on the eye with solutions of globulin,
similarly treated, gave the same results ; if heated up to 50°, 60°, or
 70° C, the globulin produces     as intense an ophthalmia as when un
 heated, but if heated to 75° or 80°, the globulin produces no inflamma
tion or oedema.

experiments are —

       Laboratory, University College, London.)                Communicated
       by E. A. Schafer, F.R.S. Received May 8, 1889.
     An account, by Dr. Wolfenden and myself, of the physiological
 action of the globulin           which    I extracted from  the   seeds  of the
jequirity plant, has been presented the Royal Society.           I have  shown-f
 that there are two proteids present in the seeds ; a globulin and an
 albumose.      The present paper deals ' with the physiological action of
 the albumose.
     Dr. Wolfenden and I showed in the paper referred to that the-
globulin possessed the poisonous qualities of the watery extract of
 the seeds and of the body called " abrin," described by Drs. Warden
 and Waddell.         After being obtained in the pure state, it produced
 severe conjunctivitis when applied to the eye, and when subcuta
 neously injected it caused local oedema and ecchymosis, followed by
 death with the signs and symptoms of gastro-intestinal irritation and
 inflammation.        It moreover lowered the body-temperature of the
pigeon in a remarkable manner. From the method used by Drs.
  Warden and Waddell in preparing their " abrin," both proteids
would be obtained, since they used a watery extract and precipitated
 the proteids with alcohol. Abrin would, therefore, be a mixture of
globulin and albumose.            As Dr. Wolfenden and I had found that the

 globulin is a powerful toxic agent, it was desirable to ascertain
 whether the albumose possessed the same power and produced the
same symptoms.
    It is very difficult to obtain the albumose in a pure state separate
from the globulin.        Boiling the solution, of course, readily pre
cipitates the globulin, leaving the albumose in solution, but as heat
destroys the activity of abrus-poison,         it cannot be employed in
separating the two proteids. Both proteids are also thrown down by
saturating their solution with neutral ammonium sulphate.                The
precipitate thus formed can be redissolved and the solution dialysed,
thus removing most of the salt and precipitating the globulin.           But
I   found many objections to this method.          The dialysis has to be
prolonged over a week, and there is thus great liability to decomposi
tion.     Moreover, it is practically impossible to precipitate all the
globulin by dialysis, and the ammonium sulphate, traces of which
still remain, being itself poisonous, would be likely to vitiate the
result in testing the toxic action of the proteid.               I therefore
abandoned this method and tried the following, which answered per
fectly. A concentrated watery extract of the seed was made and
filtered direct into an excess of absolute alcohol. The copious pre
cipitate which fell consisted of globulin and albumose.              After a
few days, the proteids were removed by filtration, washed with
alcohol, redissolved in water, and reprecipitated by absolute alcohol.
They were allowed to remain under absolute alcohol for several
months in order to coagulate the globulin, and were then filtered off,
redissolved, and reprecipitated by alcohol, and allowed to remain
under alcohol for a few months longer.            Altogether some of the
proteids were allowed to remain under alcohol for eight months, or
longer. At the end of this time they were removed, washed with
alcohol, and dried over sulphuric acid.       The residue was ground into
a yellowish-brown powder, and consisted of coagulated globulin and
of unaltered albumose.
     For the purpose of inoculation this powder was mixed in distilled
 water, which had been well boiled to sterilise it and then cooled.
The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was clear. It gave the
following reactions : —
     1. Neutral to test-paper.
     2. No precipitate on boiling.
     3. Acetic acid gave a precipitate, which mostly redissolved on
boiling, coming down again on cooling, and so on. After boiling and
cooling, the precipitate was readily soluble in dilute potash, showing
 that the proteid was not coagulated.
    4. Nitric acid caused a precipitate, mostly soluble on heating, coming
 down again on cooling, &c.       This precipitate, like the acetic acid one,
 is also readily soluble, after being heated, in dilute potash.

    6. Copper sulphate and potash gave a biuret reaction.
    7. Mercuric chloride gave a precipitate, insoluble in excess of the
reagent.
    These reactions are similar to those already described by me in the
paper quoted ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 42) with the exception of the
 behaviour of nitric acid.    I stated in my previous paper that nitric
acid gave a precipitate in a solution of the albumose, only in the pre
sence of sodium chloride.      This still holds true for dilute solutions of
the albumose ; in strong solutions, nitric acid gives a precipitate, even
if the neutral salt be absent or present in very small quantities.
   Fatal Dose of Albumose. — In my earlier experiments I simply
weighed the quantity of dry powder to be injected ; but this is not so
accurate a method as the one      I  adopted later. About 0-5 gram of
the powder was dissolved in sterilised normal saline solution (0'75 per
cent.) and filtered. The amount of proteid dissolved in the filtrate
was estimated by dropping a measured quantity of the liquid (1 c.c.)
into about 30 c.c. of absolute alcohol, which precipitates both the
proteid and the small amount of salt in solution. The precipitate and
liquid were well boiled together, the precipitate removed, dried at
110° C, and weighed. The weight, deducting the amount of salt,
equals the quantity of proteid present in solution.        This I found the
only really accurate method of estimating the dose of proteid used in
inoculation.
   In one experiment, 1¦3 milligram of albumose was injected under
the skin of a rat weighing 197 grams, being a dose of about
6'6 milligrams per kilo, of body weight.            The animal was very
ill 49£ hours after  inoculation,  but completely recovered. Double the
above dose, viz., 2-6 milligrams, was injected under the skin of a
rat weighing 134 grams (19-4 milligrams per kilo, of body weight),
but no poisonous symptoms were noticed.          A fatal result is, however,
noticed if the dose be as large as 60 milligrams per kilo, of body
weight ; thus a dose of 10 milligrams killed a rat weighing 167 grams
within 20 hours.
    Symptoms. — The symptoms produced           by the albumose       closely
resemble those noticed when the globulin is hypodermically injected.
There-is gradually increasing weakness, with rapid breathing, without
the occurrence of convulsions or any paralysis.
   On the temperature of pigeons the albumose has the same effect as
the globulin.    In one experiment death was caused in a pigeon by
the albumose in 11 hours and 20 minutes after inoculation.               The
temperature, which at the time of inoculation was 107-6° F., fell in
4 hours and 5 minutes 4-6°, i.e., to 103° P., after which it began to
rise.

rather longer.        A.a shown in the accompanying chart the tempera
ture began to fall from the first, and with a few rises continued to
fall until the animal 'was nearly dead, when the observations were

very closely the        temperature curve, until just before symptoms of
poisoning appeared, when, as will be seen in the chart, the respiration
curve does not follow the temperature            curve.

action of the watery extract of abrns-seed, containing both globulin
and albumose, is completely destroyed by boiling the solution.
Wolfenden and          I   have shown in our previous paper that if the
solution of the globulin be momentarily raised to 80° C, or between
 75° and 80° C, its activity is once and for ever destroyed.
    I have tested the behaviour of the albumose in a similar way.
    If heated to 50° C. the albumose still retains its power of pro
ducing severe conjunctivitis, and of causing death when subcuta-
neously injected.
    If heated to 70°, or 75° C, the albumose is still poisonous, but not
to nearly so great a degree as if unheated or heated only to 50" C.                     If
heated to 80° C, this diminishing effect of heat on the activity of the
poison is still more seen ; so that a solution of albumose containing a
lethal dose, and so treated, does not produce poisonous symptoms so
soon as an unheated solution, and the animal may recover.
    These points are brought out in the following experiments, selected
out of many similar ones, all of which were confirmative.

    Similar results were obtained in testing the effect of the albumose
in producing conjunctivitis.               Raising the solution to a temperature
of 75° C. and 80° 0. diminishes the effect but does not °prevent con
junctivitis developing; the conjunctivitis is less with albumose

      The conclusions from these experiments may thus be summed up : —
      1 . The poisonous activity of abrus-albumose is weakened by momentarily
  heating its solution to a temperature of 70°, 75°, and 80° C. ; and the
  higher the temperature the greater the diminution.
      2. The activity of the albumose is completely destroyed by heating its
 solution up to 85° G.
      This is abont five degrees higher than the temperature at which the
  activity of abrus-globulin is destroyed.

and the toxic principle of snake- venom. Weir Mitchell and Reichert*
have shown that in the American rattlesnakes, the venom contains two
                                   "            The coagulation tem
poisonous proteids, globulin and a peptone."
perature of the globulin described by them is between 60° and 70° C.
The peptone is not a true peptone, as physiological chemists now
understand       the term    ;   since it is, according to Mitchell and Reichert,
precipitated  by acetic             acid and potassium ferrocyanide.        Their
peptone, indeed, seems more allied to the albumoses.    In the venom
of the mocassin, e.g., the "          " is
                                           precipitated by adding an
                             peptone
excess of NaCl to the solution, besides being thrown down by dilute
acetic acid.   The peptone found by these observers in cobra- venom is
precipitated by acetic acid and potassium ferrocyanide, as well as by
NaCl added to saturation. A true peptone is not precipitated in this
manner, and           I
                 cannot but conclude that the body found by Mitchell
and Reichert is closely allied to the albumose class of proteids.
   The globulin of abrus-seed coagulates between 75° and 80° C. in
10 per cent, magnesium sulphate solution and between 66° and 73° C.
in 10 per cent. NaCl solution.f      The coagulation temperature in tho
last solution therefore nearly corresponds to the coagulation tempera
ture of the venom globnlin of the rattlesnakes. Mitchell and Reichert
do not mention in the presence of which salt the globulin was coagu
lated.   Sodium chloride distinctly lowers the temperature of coagula
tion.
   Abrus-albumose, moreover, closely resembles the " peptones " and
" peptone-like " bodies found by the observers in snake- venom.
Like them it is uncoagulated by heat,J it is precipitated by acetic
acid, and by acetic acid and potassium ferrocyanide, and also by
saturation with sodium chloride in an acid solution.
    Other observers have described in cobra- venom a poisonous albumin
and acid albumin (Wolfenden).
   Nature of Poison. — I do not propose here to discuss fully the nature
of snake-venom.      The results of Mitchell and Reichert's researches
I  wonld wish to refer to are : — (1) That both the globulin and peptone
like body present in the venom of the rattlesnake are poisonous ; (2)
that the severe local ecchymosis produced by viperine venom is due to
the globulin present in            it,
                               since such local effect does not occur after
inoculation     the globulin be removed from venom.

 76-5°  C.  a  few symptoms follow a lethal dose, but recovery takes place ;
while    if   heated up to 795° C, 81°, and 100°, a lethal dose of the
venom does not produce death.               The effect of heat varies with
different suake- venoms.        It takes prolonged boiling to destroy the
activity of cobra- venom ; and in some of the American suakes simple
boiling does not completely destroy the activity of the venom, although
it diminishes it. These results are explicable in the consideration
that by coagulation the activity of the globulin is destroyed, and
by prolonged boiling the peptone or peptone-like body is decom
posed.
    Abrns-poison, both globulin and albumose, produce, like suake-
venom, a local lesion, viz., inflammation and oedema, with ecchymosis ;
but the activity of venom in producing this result is enormously
greater than that of abrus.          It is not the globulin alone of abrus
that produces the local lesion, but also the albumose.            As in many
cases of such poisoning, also, the blood after death is in a fluid or
semi-fluid state.
    The effect of heat on abrus-poison is more marked and definite
 than on suake- venom. The physiological activity of the globulin is,
 e.g., completely destroyed at about its coagulation temperature, 80°C,
 while the activity of the albumose is not destroyed until the solution
 is raised to 85° C.
     Nature of Abrus-poison. — To explain the action and nature of abrns-
 poison, two theories may be stated : —
     1. That the poison is of ferment-nature attached to the proteids.
     2. That the proteids develop by contact with living tissue a body
  or bodies which are poisonous.
     The first idea is only supported by the fact that the activity of
  both poisonous proteids is destroyed at about the temperature at which
  digestion ferments are destroyed.          At the same time, there is no
  evidence to show that such a temperature does not so alter the con
  stitution of the molecule of the proteids that they do not produce by
  contact with living tissue toxic principles. Since there is no accurate
  knowledge of the constitution of the proteid molecule, the question
  as to why one proteid should be poisonous and another harmless
  must remain unsettled.         Although this is so, the results obtained in
  the experiments on the abrus-poison are definite, and may be thus
  summarised : —
     1. The poisonous activity of the seeds of Abrus precatorius, the
 jequirity, resides in the two proteids present in the seeds — a para-
  globulin and an albumose.
     2. Both of these proteids have practically the same action.         They
  produce     severe conjunctivitis when   applied to the eye ; and when  sub-
  cutaneously injected they cause local inflammation, oedema, and
  ecchymosis, and gastro- intestinal irritation, with extrusion of fieces

temperature, and a condition of stupor, ending in death.
  3. The activity of both these proteids is destroyed by moist heat.
In solution the activity of the globulin is destroyed at between
75° and 80° C, and that of the albumose between 80° and 85° C.
  4. That abrus-poison resembles suake-venom in chemical composi
tion, in the local lesions produced, in producing a fall of body tem
perature, in causing semi-fluidity or fluidity of the blood after death,
and, to some extent, in the effect of moist heat on it. Abrus-poison
is, however, much less active than suake-venom.

  acquaintance of fishermen on the St. Lawrence who assured me, and
 I often verified the fact with my own eyes, that each one of them
 catches from 60 to 70 sturgeons per week.                   Many attempts were
 made to fertilise sturgeon eggs, but all were unsuccessful, probably
the season was too early. Lepidosteus material was fairly easily
obtained, and a large collection of embryos and many adult fishes
 were secured.
     I owe my thanks to the Government Grant Committee of the Royal
Society, for the substantial grant which enabled me to defray the cost
of collection, &c., of the material used in the following investigations.
     It is proposed to give an outline of the development of Lepidosteus
during the first three weeks of its life ; by the end of this time
pretty nearly all the organs are developed, and the larva has acquired
many of the adult characteristics. The early development, i.e., that
of the first four days, is very difficult of investigation, far more so
than that of Amphibia and Marsipobranchii.                     The reason of this
lies with the yolk, for that ontside the embryo gives rise to technical
difficulties, while that which fills all the cells renders everything
blurred and indistinct. Fortunately, much can be made out by means
of surface views, and these help very materially in rendering an
interpretation of the sections possible.
     The Egg. — I have little to add to Balfour and Parker's account.
As they state the ripe eggs are spherical bodies of 3 mm. in diameter.
The egg-shell is composed of two parts : (1) externally a layer of
 pyriform bodies, and within it (2) a zona radiata. No micropyle
could be detected.
     The pyriform bodies are certainly modified cells, each with the
 remains of a nucleus at its outer end.                 These modified cells have
 degenerated       into  a sort of  glue, which    causes the excessive stickiness
 of the newly laid eggs.* Such a layer, though less developed than
 here, is characteristic of the eggs of sturgeons and Petromyzon.
     In the ovarian egg these " pyriform bodies " are probably nutritive
 cells to the ovum, for their outer ends near the nuclei contain a
 number of minute yolk particles.
      The inner egg membrane is not composed of two layers either in
 Lepidosteus or in the sturgeon.            It is a simple zona radiata, the strie
 reaching to the innermost portions of the membrane.                   The division
 into two layers, sometimes seen, is the optical effect of thick sections.
     Within lies the egg proper. It consists of an outer protoplasmic
 layer containing small yolk particles, and a central yolk mass, free
from protoplasm, and made up of much larger yolk plates.                    There is
a large germinal vesicle with membrane, the vesicle containing a
 rather large number of chromatin bodies.
     * In alkalies, haryta, and lime-water the egg-shell swells up, and the two latter
  reagents are valuable allies in getting rid of the egg membranes in young stages.

110                           Dr.   J.   Beard.                   [May   1(5,
   When the egg is ripe, the germinal vesicle lies just under the shell
in a protoplasmic mass, which is permeated by very small yolk
particles.     The sturgeon egg has a very similar structure, but the
yolk elements are much finer. The males are on the average only
half the size of the females, and are very much more numerous than
the latter, as others have noted.        The spawning takes place between
May    20th  and   the middle  of June. Some of the inhabitants of the
shores of Black Lake have seen it taking place in July.        This appears
to me very likely.      The fishes only spawn on warm windless days, and
if cold weather comes, they may remain away from the " points " for
weeks, as Garman already noted.
     I
     observed the spawning on three occasions, on May 24th, June 8th
and 9th.     In the interval no eggs were laid, though search was made
for eggs and fishes every day by my assistants or myself.               The
spawning takes place during the heat of the day, between 12 and
3 o'clock.     A full account of it has been already given by Agassiz,
and quoted by Balfour and Parker.           The eggs are thickly sown, and
cling   to the  small  stones  which  lie about in the shallow water of the
" points."
   Certain spots seem to be traditional egg-laying grounds for Lepid-
osteus.    The eggs are pretty easily removed from the stones, and my
own were hatched out in a Californian salmon hatching apparatus.
   Most of the eggs left on the stones fell a prey to fungi, and very
few indeed hatched out. With care and constant attention a much
greater percentage can be hatched out in the apparatus.                 The
difficulties of the investigation prevented the observation of tbe for
mation of polar bodies.       The segmentation is very rapid, and a cap of
small cells is formed in the course of five or six hours.      The segmen
tation is very unequal but in a sense complete.       Eight furrows can be
traced to the centre of the lower pole.         The attempt to segment the
lower hemisphere     is,    however, soon given up, none of the eight
furrows penetrate very deeply into the yolk, and none reach the
centre by long way.
          a                  They are only superficial furrows.
   The coll cap of the upper pole increases rapidly by divisions within
itself, and by the addition of fresh segments from the incomplete
segments below its margin.         It grows over the yolk, and in the course
of 24 hours or less completely encloses the latter. A beautiful circular
blastopore is    formed, from which a yolk-plug projects, as in Amphibia.
   Before the close of the blastopore, the region of the future embryo
is marked out by a blastodermic thickening, extending forwards from
the edge of the blastopore.
   A groove marking the axis of the embryo soon appears in this
thickening.       It must be remarked that this groove appears only
just before the closure of the blastopore, and hence         it   cannot in
Lepidosteus be regarded as part of the latter.

 1889.]    On   the Early   Development  of Lepidosteus osseus.        Ill
   The blastopore closes on the second day, and at no time is a canalit
neurentericus formed.
   The embryo becomes        more  and  more distinctly marked out, and     .
the nervous system is differentiated.
   By-and-bye the embryo gets raised above the level of the blastoderm,
and a solid tail-bud is very early rounded off above what was the
anterior margin of the blastopore.
   The mesoderm or mesoblast arises very early, and before the close of
the blastopore.
    If embryologists have not yet agreed as to its mode of origin in the
chick, how can one hope to settle this question in the difficult material
of Lepidosteus ? It appears to me to arise from the epiblast on each
side of the middle line, and from the epiblastic region at the lip of
the blastopore.
    I make these statements with the utmost diffidence.        Apart from
its medium thickening, the epiblast is very early divided into two
 layers.   The outer or covering layer (Deekschicht of the German
authors) takes no share in organ formation at all. It covers the
embryo everywhere, but no organs are formed from it.               It may,
 perhaps, be compared to the skin of a larval Annelid.          The inner
layer may be spoken of as the formative epiblast.
    The hypoblast has only a dorsal or neural extension, the ventral
side of the embryo being occupied by yolk.
   Epiblastic Organs. Nervous System. — This is formed solely out of
the formative epiblast, though it must be noted that the outer layer
is often grooved in the middle line.      It may be regarded as a folded
plate of epiblast, which sinks below the rest of the formative epiblast,
and it differs solely in its mode of formation from the nervous systems
of Elasmobranchii and Amphioxus in that the folds are closely
applied to each other, and only separate later on in development.
The brain vesicles can soon be distinguished, and in later stages
a similar apparent segmentation        can be traced for some distance
along the spinal cord.     The nervous system becomes hollowed out by
the separation of its walls from each other.     Tho optic vesicles arise
as a pair of hollow evaginations of the fore-brain.        The leus also is
a product of the formative epiblast.
   In the central nervons system two structures are very early dis
tinguishable : —
   (1.) The transient giant ganglion cells in the spinal cord ; these are
described in a separate section (p. 117).
   (2.) The ciliated groove which I have elsewhere described as form
ing the floor of the primitive central canal.     It persists in the adult,
and there also forms only the floor of the central canal as in sharks
and elsewhere.
    The Brain. — The fore-brain roof in embryo and adult is very thin,

112                               Dr.  J.  Beard.                      [May 16,
non-nervons,      and    epithelial in character, as in Marsipobranchs,
Teleostei, and other Ganoids {Acipenser, Polypterus, and Amid).
   The nervous elements of the fore-brain are represented by thick
basal and lateral structures of a solid nature, forming the so-called
" corpora striata."         To what extent they are homologous             with
corpora striata shall be discussed in my full paper.              To my mind
there appears     to be  no  evidence   to  show  that the fore-brain region of
Marsipobranchii, Teleostei, or Ganoidei is a degenerate structure.
The pineal gland and the nervons part of the pituitary body or
hypophysis cerebri have the nsual mode of formation.               In the adult,
the pineal body arises by a hollow stalk from the roof of the
thalamencephalon,       and it proceeds forwards over the epithelial roof
of the fore-brain, ending in a large simple flattened vesicle.             This
vesicle has a striking resemblance in structure to the same organ in
Myxine. It lies in a mass of adenoid tissue, which, however, is -no
part of the pineal body.        Waldschmidt's statements under this head
in Polypterus will require modification.
    The first development of the oral part of the hypophysis cerebri
is difficult of investigation, on account of the distortion produced
by the developing suckers. It arises as a medium solid ingrowth
of the formative epiblast, slightly in front of, or almost within, the
month involution.         Its direction is towards the infundibulum and
the end of the notochord. It does not become hollowed out as in
many other forms.
    In the adult the hypophysis cerebri possesses a more complicated
structure than the same organ in Polypterus, containing as it does
 glandular epithelium, lymphoid tissue, and degenerated nerve-cells.
 Its duct does not persist as in Polypterus.
    Regarding the spinal cord, only one further remark need be made,
 that is, that behind the anus it is for some time solid.
              The Nerves, Ganglia, and Peripheral Sense Organs.
    As Balfour and Parker state, the nose is formed as an invagination
 of a certain portion of the formative epiblast.           This is not remark
 able when we remember          that no organs are formed from the outer
 most layer.
    The ear arises in the same way.            The otoliths of Lepidosteus and
 Salmo are formed similarly to the otoliths of Invertebrates. Certain
 cells   of the lining of the auditory vesicle become freed from the
 epithelium, and lie loosely in the auditory cavity.            They acquire a
 position    in  rows   just   over  the   sensory  hairs.   The   cells become
 calcified, and their nuclei disappear.
    The otoliths are probably formed by the fusion of a number of
 these calcified bodies.

1389.]     On   the Early    Development    of Lepidosteus osseus.            113
   The lateral or branchial sense organs are also products of the
formative epiblast.
   The cranial and spinal ganglia are formed as recently described by
me in sharks and birds.
   In the mouth involution also the formative epiblast is alone con
cerned, the covering layer passes over from the anterior end of the
head to the yolk sac.        The mouth breaks through about the fourth
day.    The anus arises as a solid ingrowth of the formative epiblast in
the place where the blastopore once existed.
   The Larval Suckers. — These organs also are products of the inner
or formative epiblast.       They are developed very early, and commence
to be differentiated about the third day of egg development.                 They
are formed as a number of closed spherical sacs, one part of the wall
being thin, and this part is ruptured when they break through the
skin a day or two before hatching. One of these sacs is median, and
arises almost within the mouth involution.                 It could almost be
 mistaken for the developing hypophysis, were it not for its subse
 quent fate and for the fact that it is directed forwards. When it
 breaks through the skin it forms a flat glandular plate on the roof of
 the mouth. From its position it can hardly be of much use as a sucker.
    The functional suckers are composed of two sorts of cells :
 (1) Long glandular cells with hyaline slightly granular contents
 and nucleus lying near the inner end of the cell.            Between these (2)
 supporting cells with nucleus in the middle of the cell.
    Each glandular sucker has the structure of and is probably serially
 homologous with the suckers of larval Anurous Amphibia.                   During
 the period at which they lie beneath the covering epiblast, and
 for a short time after, the arrangement of the suckers is distinctly
 bilateral. The median one appears to be uupaired at all stages. They
 form a complete circlet on the disk, with additional suckers within
 the circle. On the whole, the organ may be said to be composed
 of two fused circlets of suckers.          Balfour and Parker noticed the
 numerous vascular channels in the mesoblast just inside the sucker.-;.
    The young Lepidostewt I possessed did not make use of the suckers
 for several days after hatching.*         The suckers commence to degene
 rate when the young fishes are about three weeks old.
    The pad at the end of the adult suout occupies the position of, but
 cannot be considered as arising from, the larval suckers.              The latter
 are transient organs.
    Hypoblaslic Organs. — The origin of the notochord is not yet clear
 to me, for it arises during an epoch in which the processes of develop
 ment are difficult of interpretation on account of the yolk.
    There is at first a solid oesophagus, as Balfour and Parker state,
 and the posterior gill clefts arise as solid evaginations from it.            The

spiracular cleft or rather its rudiment is a very early formation,
being developed long before hatching.        The evagination to form it
reaches the formative epiblast and fuses with          it,
                                                    this fusion persisting
for a long time, but at no time can a lumen opening on the exterior
be detected.      As Wright has shown, a part of the spiracular cleft
persists  in the    adult in the form of     canal leading upwards and
                                              a
forwards into the region of the periotic capsule.
   The first branchial cleft  is    formed long before the others and
before hatching.       In newly hatched larvae     has a wide opening on
                                                      it
to the exterior.     This opening soon becomes apparently less by the
growth of the operculum.
   The pueumatocele arises at a very early period and long before
hatching.     It   is
                   a    fold of the neural median hypoblast, and grows
backwards in length apart from connexion with the alimentary
canal.    For some time the ventral part of the alimentary canal is
only filled in by yolk, by-and-bye the gut becomes shut in by in
growths from the sides in the manner suspected by Balfour and
Parker.
   The somites, like the mesoblast from which they are formed, are at
first solid
          :   they are long and narrow.        As     usual, their mode of
                                                        is
formation  is   from before backwards     ;but in front of the first one
formed, two others appear later on just behind the auditory capsule.
These latter are, as their fate shows, the two anterior somites of the
bypoglossus.       Regarding head-somites,    Iprefer at present to say
nothing.
   The inner wall of the somites gives rise to muscle, and most of the
outer wall    is   converted into pigmented connective tissue.        The
somites become much elongated, and their ends are constricted off as
buds to form the musculature of the paired and uupaired limbs.
Each end of each somite constricts off           single bud, which only
                                                  a
divides into two at a later stage than the twenty- first day.         The
posterior paired fins only begin to develop towards the end of the
third week, and the muscle buds of the uupaired fins remain in an
embryonic condition beyond this period.
   Urinogenital System. — To form the pronephros there    a solid evagi
                                                             is
nation of the mesoblast, uniting the somites with the somatopleure and
splanchuopleure. This arises early on the third day, and reaches
from the 4th to 8th or 9th somites inclusive.      This probably fuses
with the epiblast, and at any rate a solid segmental duct     formed —
                                                                  is
probably from the inner epiblast layer.    This grows gradually back
wards, having at first an indistinct form of termination, finally            it
reaches the proctodeum, and becomes fused with it.
   After this stage, two additional mesoblastic somites are formed
behind the auditory vesicle.   Then the first three somites behind the
ear are those  of the bypoglossus, and, as van Wijhe has determined

1889.]      On the   Early  Development   of Lepidosteus osseus.         115
in Elasmobranchii, the pronephros begins at the third definite body-
somite, or, counting the three hypoglossus somites, at the sixth.         Its
extension backwards varies, but the region of three somites is always
concerned in its formation.       It may extend at first over five or six
somites, but the part beyond the anterior three soon aborts.         In some
cases it has a greater extension on one side of the body than on the
other.
    Three funnels seem, as a rule, to be formed on each side of the
body, but the most posterior of these disappear, two pairs being left.
These persist throughout the larval period.            The ciliated openings
into the body-cavity become narrowed. By this narrowing of the
opening, and the widening of the part opposite to the glomerulus, the
pronephric chamber described by Balfour and Parker arises. It need
scarcely be remarked that there are two of these "chambers" on
each side.      Even when the mesonephros is in course of development,
i.e., from the 16th to the 18th day, the two funnels on each side still
persist and are quite distinct.
    As just stated, the mesonephros arises between the 16th and 18th
day. The date of its development seems to be variable. Its tubt s
are formed in the angle of the body-cavity between the region of
the segmental duct and the genital ridge ; the latter is at this period
part of the mesentery of the alimentary canal.         One notices that the
cells of this region of the coelom are filled with yolk. These yolk-
filled cells give rise to the mesonephros and the genital glands.        The
storing-up of yolk reminds one of Dohrn's discovery of yolk-laden
cells in the head-somites of Ammocaetes, i.e., in those structures
which at a much later period form the eye-muscles of the Petromyzon.
At the 16th day the somites have been almost entirely converted
into muscle and connective tissue, and in Lepidosteus the mesonephros
can neither be derived from the part connecting the somites and
body-cavity together, as in Elasmobranchs and birds (Sedgwick ; van
Wijhe), nor from part of the somites (nephrotome of Riickert).
There is here no intermediate cell-mass as in the chick, but the
mesonephric tubules arise as distinct segmental evaginations of the
wall of the body-cavity at the point indicated above. They grow
over the segmental duct in a curved fashion, and open into it by
piercing through its wall.
    Such is the brief account of the early development of Lepidosteus
•which   I feel at present in a position to give, and I close this communi
cation with a notice of—

the whole length of the spinal cord of Lepidosteus and certain                   other
tish embryos.   So little had hitherto been published about                       their
occurrence  in different groups of fishes, that a comparative investiga
tion of the matter seemed desirable ; all the more, as 1 soon arrived at
conclusions as to their meaning and fate very different from those of
Dr. Paul Mayer, the only author who has paid much attention to such
cells (in the Scylliid®).      In all cases these giant ganglion cells
occupy the same typical position in the extreme dorsal or neural
border of the spinal cord. They are found in very young embryos
in nearly every transverse section through the region of the spinal
cord.    Very often a pair, one on each side of the middle line, is met
with in a single section. To obtain a clear insight into their distribu
tion horizontal longitudinal sections are necessary.  When the sections
of such a series are examined, one notices that the first sections which
pass through the dorsal or neural limit of the spinal cord, contain
a large number of rather large ganglion cells, and it can easily be
verified that the roof of the spinal cord along its whole length is com
posed of similar cells, which form a double row reaching from the
termination of the hind-brain to the posterior limit of the central
nervous system.
  Their occurrence     in the brain region proper is very doubtful ; as
tliey appear to extend forwards only as far as the anterior boundary
of the liypoglossus region. That          is,
                                      in early stages they can be traced
as far as those somites which belong to the hypoglossus.
    They are the first cells in the embryo which develop ganglionic
characters, and they are fully developed in young embryos long before
the remaining cells of the nervous system become ganglionic.         The
cells are multipolar and in some cases processes can be seen passing;
                     ;
from them into the developing spinal cord, but cannot say how they
                                                        I
are connected with other nervous elements.   Possibly they are paired                 ;
at any rate, in many cases they are bilaterally arranged, and in the
region of each mesoblastic somite in the different fishes to be preseutly
mentioned from four to eight pairs of such cells occur. The exact
number can only be determined by means of reconstructions of
embryos.     There   probably a defined number of them in eveiy
                     is
embryo of each species, and this number must be several hundred.

cells persist for a long time, lying outside the cord, and on its -dorsal
or nenral surface, just over the posterior fissure.
    Gradually they undergo a series of degenerative changes.                         The
stumpy     processes vanish ; the cells shrink, and                so    get smaller.
Finally,   they become glassy, having lost all traces              of nucleus auil
nucleolus, and disappear.
    In fact, the series of changes undergone by these cells corresponds
exactly to that degeneration and death of nerve-culls, which the pathologists
term simple atrophy (einfache Atrophie, see Ziegler's ' PathologiscHe
Anatomie,' 3te Anflage, 2ter Theil, pp. 603 — 606).                      Though the
presence    of  giant ganglion      cells in   the  embryos   of  certain     Scylliidae
was known,* till now we had no idea of their distribution over the
whole spinal cord as stated above. Like Dr. Mayer, I find them in
Scyllium and Pristiurus, in both of which forms they are exceedingly
large, numerous, and well developed.               Along with Mayer         I  failed to
detect them in Torpedo, but met with them in Raja.                 I  also miss them
in Acanthias, but in Mustclns, where as a normal thing they do not
develop, one may find about a dozen of thera well developed in a
single embryo, but then in abnormal situations, lying free in the
formative tissue of the mesoblast, and outside the central nervous
system.      They are very obvious in 10 millimetre embryos of Salmo,
and may easily be detected in Labrax, Esox, and Rhodeus embryos of
the proper age. They are very numerous in newly hatched Lepidosteus.
Only with difficulty can they be demonstrated in young Petromyzon
embryos, on account of the yolk filling the cells, but they are certainly
present in this form.         At present I do not possess sufficient material
to follow their fate in Petromyzon, but doubtless it is the same as in
the three groups represented by Scyllium, Sulmo,f and Lepidosteus.
    In Raja, Labrax, Esox, and Rhodeus, I have not followed all stages
of their degeneration, but I have studied this sufficiently to be sure
that their fate is that of the ganglion cells in the groups just
mentioned.       They may be found in larvaa of Rana and Triton, and
in the latter form they have the usual fate — that I have determined.
It  is very significant    to  notice that   the  forms in which they normally
occur are, without exception, oviparous.
    The abnormal occurrence of a dozen or so giant ganglion cells in
Mustelus and their presence in Raja, coupled with their absence in
Torpedo, are interesting facts, which point to the conclusion that the
viviparous Elasmobranchii once possessed them as a normal develop
ment.

Petromyzon          appear to Lave no homology with these larval ganglion
cells.*         The proof of this statement is impossible without figures.
I   hope to show, in a            fuller paper on the early development          of the
central nervous system, that in Scyllium giant ganglion                       cells are
developed in deeper portions of the spinal cord, and that these cells
have exactly the situation and characters of the well-known giant
ganglion cells of Amphioxus.*
     In the same sections of Scyllium embryos the two sorts of cells can
be seen ; the one deeply situated in the cord, and with well developed
processes, the other outside the nervous system, and greatly degene
rated.
     I  will here only remark that I cannot support Mayer's conclusions                J
as to the fate of these giant ganglion cells, and defer a discussion of
his views until I have followed the history of these cells in Petromyzon.
     1 may here point out, however, that Kleinenberg§ appears to me to
 have been quite right when he suspected that the cells described by
 Mayer might be analogous to certain sub-nmbrellar ganglion cells in
                                                                "

 the ventral cord : and that, just as in the Annelid, the development
 of the vertebrate central nervous system would appear to have been
 initiated by a larval nervous apparatus outside the same.                 I propose to
 discuss this question in a future paper.

 1889.J         Carbon by Green Plants from Organic Compounds.                       119
    Papers have been published by A. Meyer and E. Laurent* dealing
with this question.
    A. Meyer has shown that the leaves of green plants can form
starch when eupplied with solutions of glucose, saccharon, mannite.
innlin, glycerin.             E. Laurent has confirmed this observation for
glycerin.
    A. Meyer has shown that starch is not formed from solutions of
raffinose.t inosite, erythrite,             dulcite, trioxymethylene, aldehyde
1acetic) ; and Wehmerf that starch is not produced from formic
aldehyde or formose.§
    The method used by these observers|| is placing leaves which have
been deprived of starch by keeping in the dark in solutions of the
substances, and testing for starch after a certain interval of exposure
to daylight.
    I   have used
                      " culture " experiments, and in most cases removed the
starch at first present in tissues, not by keeping in the dark, but by
placing in a receiver, the air of which is completely deprived of C02
by      KOH     and soda-lime.
    Sachs's method of testing for starch was generally used, but in most
cases also supplemented by direct microchemical observations.
    The experiments fall mostly under three headings —
    1.    Experiments       with shoots.
    2.    Experiments       with entire plants, the carbon        compounds       being
            supplied to     the roots.
    3.    Experiments       with shoots of   " water-plants."
    In all    cases the plants or shoots were placed in a " culture liquid "
whilst being completely deprived of starch, and then transferred to
another portion of the same culture solution to which the carbon
compound had been added in known quantity.                    The " culture liquid "
used was composed aa follows : —
    Distilled water           100    grams.       KNOs                   0'lo gram.

complex mixture, but that it contains a small quantity of a true glucose — probably
" acrose."      Loew states that this polymerisation only occurs with dilute solutions of
the aldehyde (' Deutsch. Chem. Ges. Berichte,' vol. 22, 1889, Nos. 3, 4). Compare

The shoots or plants in this liquid were placed under a bell-jar, so
arranged as to exclude all possibility of entry of C0S from surround
ing air during the experiments, but to allow a free circulation
between the air in bell-jar and external atmosphere : this is effected
by tubes introduced through the india-rubber stopper of bell-jar com
municating with the outside through soda-lime U-t^bes.                    Several
capsules   of  soda-lime    and    cylinders   of  strong   KOH    solution  were
placed under the bell-jar to absorb any          C0,   given off by respiration.
    In No. 2, special precautions were taken to prevent any C02
evolved from roots finding its way to the leaves.
    In No. 3, the same result was obtained by the addition of barium
acetate to the solution in which the plants were immersed.                    The
apparatus   was  less  complex    in  this case.

spaces might be in free communication with external atmosphere (to
admit free supply of oxygen), but always by passage through soda-

    That the roots of plants can withdraw all the glucose from a 1 per

    The conclusions 1 should draw from these experiments are : That
green plants cannot normally obtain carbon for assimilation from
organic substances except carbohydrates or closely related bodies, not
from aldehydes or their derivatives, and not even from all carbo
hydrates.
    That a compound may be a source of carbon when supplied to the
leaves but not when supplied to the roots, and vice versa.
    That green plants, owing to the normal process of obtaining carbon
being from C02, have, to a large extent, lost the power of using
organic compounds as a source of carbon.            (Parasitic and saprophytic
plants, especially fungi, undoubtedly do always obtain their carbon
from complex organic compounds.)

the substances enumerated as regards formation or non-formation of
starch. (Contrast in this respect with fungi, which are often charac

    That if a single substance of an aldehydic or ketonic nature is
formed by plants as an intermediate product between C02 and H„0

have resulted from lesions of the external motor cortex alone ; (2) of
the degenerations which have resulted from lesions involving both
this and the gyrus marginalis ; and (3) a comparison between the
respective degenerations resulting from lesions of the external motor
surface and of the gyrus marginalis.         The results tend to show the
existence of a differentiation  in the pyramidal tract, the whole area of
which is involved in degeneration when both external and mesial
motor areas have been removed, whereas after removal of one portion
only of the motor area, a corresponding part only of the pyramidal
tract area degenerates.

structures is the month.       The space included in the cavity of the
tentacular horse-shoe    — the representative   of the pre-oral lobe — is
covered with a peculiar pigmented epithelium, curiously wrinkled.
This epithelium is continuous with the brain, and from it two sensory
pits descend into that organ. The tentacles are short, the outer
surface is grooved and ciliated, the inner surface covered with a
pigmented epithelium, similar in character to that covering the pre-
oral lobe.
    The introvert immediately behind the head is smooth for about
2 mm. At the posterior end of this region a thin but very extensible
collar is attached. The anterior end of the collar is free, and in speci
mens with the introvert inverted, completely covers the head. Behind
the collar the introvert is surrounded by rings of hooks. Each hook
is secreted by a multicellular papilla, and the ring rests upon a
cushion formed by circular muscle fibres.      Behind each ring of hooks
is a parallel ring of sense organs, described below, and underneath
each ring is a circular nerve, continuous with the ventral cord.
    The Ectoderm. — The ectoderm covering the lower lip and the out
ride of the tentacles is ciliated, that covering the pre-oral lobe and the
inside of the tentacle is crowded with brown pigment granules.         The
ectoderm of the rest of the body is one cell thick.        It is curiously
vaulted, leaving irregularly scattered spaces between it and the out
side of the circular muscles, in which a nutritive fluid probably
circulates. On its outer surface the ectoderm secretes a thick cuticle.
 From time to time some of the ectodermal cells are modified to form
 the skin papillae. These are in the form of double cups, the inner lining
 of which consists of very large cells crowded with yellow spherules.
 The cup opens to the exterior by a minute pore. These papillae are
 particularly large and numerous at the extremities of the trunk and
on the dorsal surface.    Those of the introvert differ from those on the
trunk by the possession of a chitinous ring round their orifice.
    General Anatomy. — There is nothing peculiar in the general anatomy
of this Gephyrean as seen by the naked eye.        Of the four retractors,
the two ventral ones are much longer than the two dorsal, and at the
base of the former is the generative organ.     The intestine is supported
by a spindle muscle, as well as by a muscle which passes from the
ventral body wall to the anterior end of the visceral loop.          There
are about twenty-two longitudinal muscles in the middle of the trunk.
The body cavity is lined by a flat epithelium, which is never ciliated.
    The Skeletal Tissue. — I have given this name to a peculiar form of
tissue which is found in the collar and tentacular crown of Phymosoma.
The cells composing this tissue are roundish, with large nuclei. The
protoplasm of the cells is traversed by numerous fine lines, and both
 it and the nuclei readily take up staining fluid. The cells are not so
 closely packed as to lose their shape.

   This tissue forms a ring in the lower lip, external to the vascular
spaces in this region ; it also sends extensions into the tentacles.    It
seems to support and stiffen these structures, and from its position
serves as a firm hold for the insertion of the retractor muscles of the
introvert, which are attached just behind it.
   The Alimentary Canal. — The oesophagus is lined with ciliated
epithelium, continuous with that of the lower lip and the tentacles.
Its cavity is diminished by numerous ridges, the grooves between
which are continuous with the grooves on the tentacles.        The intes
tine forms about fifteen coils ; it is usually full of fine sand, and
appears to be partly ciliated, though there is no ciliated groove as in
 Sipunculus. The rectum is straight, and its cavity is also occluded
by ridges.    The anus is surrounded both by a sphincter muscle and by
a number of radiating fibres.
   The Vascular System. — There are two kinds of blood corpuscles
present in Phymosoma.       The larger kind occurs in the body cavity :
they  are  oval in outline, with a spherical nucleus.    The smaller kind
is found in a closed series of spaces usually termed the vascular
system.     This space may be described as consisting of three parts, all
communicating with one another. The first of these lies in the lower
lip, and consists of a number of channels anastomosing with one
another, the interspaces being occupied by the skeletal tissue described
above.     These channels open at their dorsal ends into the second
series, which forms a space at the base of the lophophore.      This gives
off a number of spaces, which pass into the tentacles and open in the
middle ventral Hue into the dorsal vessel. This is a muscular sac
which is attached to the dorsal surface of the oesophagus between the
retractor muscles of the right and left side. It serves as a reservoir,
into which the corpusculated fluid is driven when the introvert is
retracted and the tentacles are flaccid.    By the contraction of its wall
the blood is forced into the lower lip and lophophore, and these
organs are then dilated.     The whole is lined by a flat epithelium.
   The Nephridia.  —  Each nephridium consists of two parts, the bladder
and the true secreting part.     Both these parts are well supplied with
muscle fibres and are consequently very contractile, so that their
shape varies greatly in different specimens.      The bladder, which is
the anterior half, is attached to the body wall by mesenteries, the
 secreting part is free. The bladder opens to the exterior by a circular
mouth, and to the interior or body cavity by a ciliated opening in
shape like a flattened funnel.      The lumen of the secretory part is
broken up into a number of side chambers, which may be readily
described by comparing them to the air-chambers in the interior of a
frog's lung. The whole is lined by a very peculiar epithelium. The
cells composing this are columnar in shape, with their nuclei at the
base.   They are crowded with minute spherical granules, and many

of them have at their free end a bubble or vesicle in which these
granules have accumulated. From time to time these vesicles break
off and lie   in the lumen both of the secretory part and of the bladder,
and are no doubt extruded from the body. The whole process is very
like the excretion of milk in a mammary gland. The only other
structures, besides these vesicles, found in the lumen of the nephridia
are the generative cells, ova and spermatozoa ; it is remarkable that
the coeloinic corpuscles never enter them.
     The Nervous System. — The brain is a bilobed organ lying imme
diately beneath the pre-oral lobe, with the ectoderm of which it is
continuous.       The ventral and posterior surfaces project into a blood
 sinns which is situated in the neighbourhood of the junction of the
 lophophoral vessels with the dorsal vessel. The ganglia in the brain
 form a cap on the anterior, dorsal, and posterior surfaces, enclosing
 the fibrous tissue which comes to the surface of the brain ventrally.
 The ganglion cells are mostly small and bipolar, but on the posterior
 surface are a certain number of unipolar giant ganglion cells, with a
 diameter at least four times that of the smaller cells.
      The brain gives off three pairs of nerves ; at the side a pair of
 circumoesophageal     commissures which pass round the oesophagus and
  fuse to form the ventral nerve cord.     This has no trace of a double
  origin or of segmentally arranged ganglia, but from time to time it
  gives off a nerve which passes into the body wall and there splits into
  a right and left nerve ; these reunite in the dorsal middle line and so
  form a nerve ring. These nerve rings are especially conspicuous in
  the skin of the introvert. The second pair of nerves given off from
  the brain pass into the base of the lophophore, and give off a branch
  into each tentacle, where it lies immediately beneath the ciliated
  groove. The third pair, which arise nearest the median line, pass to
  rupply the skin of the pre-oral lobe.
      The sense organs are of two kinds : (i) sensory pits in the brain,
   (ii) ectodermal sense organs in the introvert. The former are two
  pits which open on to the pre-oral lobe, and end blindly in an ex
  panded vesicle in the substance of the brain. They are lined with
   columnar epithelium, which at the inner end is crowded with dark-
   brown pigment. Their lumen sometimes contains a clot.         The latter
   are groups of ectodermal cells, which have increased in size and at
   their outer end are provided with short stiff processes which project
   above the general level.     These are gathered together into a small
   brush by a chitinous ring which surrounds their base.     These organs
   occur in rings at the base of the rings of hooks in the introvert.
       The Reproductive Organs. — Phymosoma varians is dioecious. In both
   sexes the reproductive organs form fimbriated ridges which are
   attached to the bases of the ventral retractor muscles, and are con
    tinuous across the interspace between these two muscles, ventral to
                                                                            S

 the nerve cord.       The cells forming these ridges are continuous with
 the    peritoneal lining of the body wall, and in this region the
 elsewhere flattened        epithelium has become modified to form the
 ova in the female and the mother-cells of the spermatozoa                         in
 the male.       The ridge is thickened at its free end, and here the
 more     mature   generative cells are found. When ripe these dehisce
 into the body cavity in which they live for some time and increase in
  size.   The ova found in the coelomic fluid are oval in outline, their
 nucleus is very large, and they are surrounded by a thick zona radiata.
 No ripe spermatozoa are found in the coelom, but their mother-cells
 exist in various stages of division.
     Conclusions. — The more important contributions to the anatomy
of the Gephyrea contained in the foregoing Abstract are the descrip
tions of (i) the head with the extensible collar, (ii) the skelotal
structures, (iii) the minute anatomy of the nephridia, and (iv) the
histology of the nervous system and sense organs.
     The most important conclusions to be drawn from these facts seem,
 in my opinion, to confirm those systematic writers who assign Phoronig
a position in the immediate neighbourhood of the unarmed Gephyrea.
In addition to the points upon which they lay stress in the general
anatomy of these forms, I would point to the close similarity in struc
ture and position of the skeletal tissues in both groups, and the possible
homology between the collar in Phijmosoma and the extensible calyx
which surrounds the head in Phormis.

    At   the meeting of the 9th of February, 1888,* Mr. E. B. Poulton
communicated to this Society the first discovery of the presence of
teeth in Ornithorhynchus,           a discovery which naturally awakened
extreme interest throughout the scientific world.                  This first account
was afterwards elaborated into a long and excellent descriptiont of
the form, structure, and development of the teeth, and their relation
                                      "

termed) which form the functional masticatory organs of the adult

    1. Teeth are present,       and they are typically mammalian in form
and structure.
    2. They are apparently functionless, being mere persistent rudi
ments of teeth functional at an earlier stage of the animal's history,
and, judging from the material examined, are absorbed without ever
cutting the gum.
     3. The cornules are developed from the buccal epithelium covering
the teeth, and take their first shape from the dental cusps and ridges
beneath them.
     The grand fact of the presence of teeth in Monotremes, and their
mammalian nature, are discoveries on which M r. Poulton may well bo
congratulated, but, owing to the extreme youth of his specimens, the
inferences placed under the headings 2 and 3, well founded as they
then appeared to bo, prove to require some modification.
     Thanks to the material before me, I am now enabled to carry
 forward our knowledge of the development of the teeth in their later
 stages with somewhat greater certainty, but the fact that this know
 ledge has not been previously obtained affords a striking instance of
 our ignorance of the most obvious and easily discovered points iu
 mammalian morphology.
     Re-stated according to the present observations, the paragraphs
 above referred to should be
                                   —
     2. The teeth are functional for a considerable part of the animal's
 life, cutting the gum as usual, and, after being worn down by friction
 with food and sand, are shed from the mouth as are the milk teeth of
 other mammals.
     3. The cornules are certainly developed from the buccal epithelium,
 but from that under* and around, instead of over, the teeth, and the
 hollows in the plates are the vestiges of the original alveoli of the
 teeth, from out of which the latter have been shod.
                                                                                            —

 course the tooth is originally formed   under   the  epithelium,    and  cuts   through it on
 being exserted. In this case,    however,  as a  later  stage,  the  epithelium     appears to
  push its way underneath the tooth, and, as   the   roots  are  absorbed,   to  obliterate  the
  holes in which they wete situated, and,  after  the  loss of  the  teeth, to  form   the  even

  could not be made out in the Museum specimens.

as being a female, in rather a later stage of development                    than a.
This skull is just 65 mm. in basal length.
    Skull a was unfortunately cleaned before any suspicion arose that
it was of such special interest, and in the maceration, the teeth,
with the exception of those on the left side of the mandible, fell out
and have had to be replaced, so that there is a slight element of
uncertainty as to their exact positions.*
    In this skull, both above and below, we find on each side twof large
 and completely calcified teeth (B and C of Mr. Poulton's figures and
 descriptions), surrounded and separated from each other by a narrow
 rim of indurated epithelium, which evidently had been (as is proved
 by specimen b) continuous with the ordinary lining epithelium of the
 mouth.      Beneath the teeth are separated from the bone by an incom
 plete layer of the same material.
     The teeth themselves (Plate 2, figs. 1 and 2) are broad, flat, and
 low-crowned. The upper ones have each two high, conical, internal
 cusps, from which minute ridges run downwards and outwards to the
 outer borders of the crowns, where the edge is peculiarly crenulate
 rather than cuspidate, in the ordinary sense of the word. On the
 whole, the anterior and posterior upper teeth are essentially similar to
 one another, except that the former are narrower, and their outer
 edges are less markedly crenulated.
     In the lower jaw there is a greater difference between the two.
 The anterior (fig. 2) is triangular in outline, its longest side is
 placed antero-externally, and its anterior and postero-external angles
 have each a high pointed cusp,J ridged on its internal aspect, while
 the posterior and internal borders are indistinctly crenulated.                 The
 posterior tooth is broadly quadrangular in outline, with a projecting
 antero-internal angle.          As in the corresponding tooth above, there
 are two cusps on one side, and a series of crenulations on the other,
  but they are of course reversed, the cusps being external and the
 crenulations internal.            The cusps are high, and connected with
 transverse ridges running across towards the internal border.                   The
 crenulations on the internal border are more numerous in the present
  specimen than in that figured by Mr. Poulton, there being nine
  instead of five minute projections. §

the presence      of minute roots, which have apparently been already
partly absorbed.*
     The actual dimensions of the teeth are as follows : —

    Turning now to specimen         b, we find that      it presents a most inte
resting state of affairs, although had the animal lived but a day or
two longer, all its interest for our present purpose would have
vanished, for it has all but completed the process of shedding its
teeth. On opening the mouth there was seen the usual set of hollows,
surrounded by hardened epithelium (fig. 3), characteristic of the
first stage in the development of the cornules.               Two large hollows
were to be seen on each side of each jaw, and a minute additional one
in front above, and behind below, these hollows being of course
afterwards the concavities on the surface of the cornules.                   The
hollows were all filled up nearly level with the surface with bits of
earth and sand, and fragments of food.              On cleaning this out bit by
bit, twot of the eight large hollows were found to contain something
in addition, and a close examination proved that this something was
in each case a worn-down tooth, reduced to about the thickness of
paper, and with all the outlines worn off.             These remnants of teeth
were quite unattached, coming away freely, and would evidently very
soon have fallen out of their own accord.               No epithelium was over
them, but all that surrounding and beneath them was commencing to
indurate and thicken, in order to form what would later have been
the cornule.
   These two specimens, therefore, prove the contentions put forward
above ; a shows that the teeth are functional, completely calcified,
and placed as usual close to the bone ; 6 that, after being worn down
by genuine use, they are shed from the hollows in the surface of the
cornules, which grow up beneath and around instead of being formed
above them.        The specimens examined by Mr. Poulton were all from
animals far yonnger than in the case of those now described ; so far
younger, in fact, that instead of being at, or nearly at, their furthest
organs in such a state of decadence as are the teeth of Ornithorht1nchus, a view
that is borne out by the marked differences between the teeth now described and
those of the College of Surgeons specimen. — May 20, 1889.

teeth have well-defined roots. — May 17, 1 889.

point of development,          as was then not unnaturally supposed, they
were merely        commencing to undergo calcification within the tooth-
capsule, just as would have been the case with those of any other
young mammal.
     But in some ways the point that is of most importance in the
discovery of fully-developed Monotrematous teeth is the fact that for
the purpose of comparison with those of other mammals, a comparison
to which of late great attention has been directed, we have now
available perfect calcified teeth, of a size sufficient for inspection with
the naked eye, and very far superior to anything that figures compiled
from microscopic sections can possibly be.
     Such a comparison         I would have willingly now made, hut unfor
tunately the most careful search* among other animals, fossil and
recent, mammalian and reptilian, fails to reveal any teeth quite
corresponding to those of Ornithorhynchus.                 But, nevertheless, their
study inclines one more and more to believe in the correctness of
 Professor Cope'st ingenious suggestion as to the Monotrematous, or,
as     I   should prefer to say, Prototherian, nature of the MesozoicJ
 Multituberculata.        These animals, long looked upon as Diprotodont
 Marsupials, have of late been much studied in America,§ where large
 numbers of them have been found.                Many of them (e.g., Bolodon,
 Allodon, Ptilodus, and, especially, the best known of all, Microlestes
 and Plagiaulax) have molar teeth which are broad and low-crowned,
 and which have a series of cusps running around their edges, so that
 each tooth has two rows of cusps corresponding in a general way to
 the cusps on one side and the crenulations on the other in the teeth
 of Ornithorhynchus.         A figure of one of the molar teeth of Microlestes
 is given (fig- 5) to show how far it resembles those of the living
 form.
     Still it must be insisted that the resemblance between the
 Multituberculate- and the Ornithorhynchus-teeth is of the most
 general character, and that the two are certainly widely separated
  genetically, even if we do admit that they appear to possess a relation-

 and Mr. G-. A. Boulenger.

   In any     case, since the form and structure of the teeth are of neces
sity the chief means of determining the evolutionary history of the
Mammalia, the discovery now made, in giving us genuine modern
Monotrematous teeth to work from, provides one of the most im
portant aids to the elucidation of the systematic position of these
anomalous mammals that has yet been obtained.
    Finally, it may be noted that the absolute continuity of the epithe
lium with the developing cornule, combined with the presence of
such well-developed calcified teeth, proves again, if after Mr. Poulton's
paper further proof is needed, that the view* as to the cornnles being
degenerated true teeth is wholly untenable.

" On the Limit of Solar and Stellar Light in the Ultra-violet
       Part of the Spectrum." By William Huggins, D.C.L.,
       LL.D., F.R.S. Received March 28,—Read April 4, 1889.
    It has been long known that the solar spectrum stops abruptly, but
not quite suddenly, at the ultra-violet end, and much sooner than the
spectra of many terrestrial sources of light. The observations of Cornu,
 of Hartley, and, quite recently, of Liveing and Dewar, appear to show
 that the definite absorption to which the very rapid extinction of the
 solar spectrum is due, has its seat in the earth's atmosphere, and not
 in that of the sun ; and that, consequently, all ex-terrestrial light
should be cut off at the same place in the spectrum.
    During several years I have attempted to obtain the limit in the
 ultra-violet for stellar light here, but as it was necessary to make use
of a bright star at a high altitude, and at a time when the atmosphere
was very clear, it was not until September 20th, 1888, that I was able
to obtain a result which seemed to me to be satisfactory.
   On that uight three successive photographs of Vega, with increas
ing exposures, were taken on the same plate.        The first spectrum was
exposed for 10 minutes, the second for 20 minutes, and the third
spectrum nearly four times as long, namely, for 70 minutes.
   A comparison of the extent of the second spectrum due to an
exposure of 20 minutes with that of the third spectrum, to which an
exposure of 70 minutes was given, leaves no doubt that the latter
spectrum has reached the limit imposed by atmospheric absorption,
and has not stopped in consequence of an insufficient exposure of the
plate.

 134     Dr. W. Huggins.             On   the  Limit of Solar and Stellar
    The original plate has been enlarged abont four times ; and a
spectrum of magnesium and calcium, taken with the same apparatus,
nnd enlarged simultaneously with the plate of stellar spectra, has
been placed above to serve as a scale.
   As the spectra are prismatic it is not possible to indicate the wave
lengths in a scale of equal parts.            A short scale only is placed over
the spectrum where the light of Vega ends.
   The spectroscope with which the spectra were taken is furnished
with a prism of Iceland spar and lenses of rock crystal, and a mirror of
speculum metal was used to condense the light of Vega upon the slit.
   It will be seen that at my observatory* the light of Vega at about
V 3000 is abruptly weakened, and then continues as a very faint line
co the point of apparent extinction at X 2970.
   Numerous solar spectra taken here during the last four years with
the same spectroscope show an average abrupt weakening at about
X 3000, and an apparent total extinction at about X 2985.
   On two occasions only the very faint weakened spectrum could be
traced as far as X 2970.
   The abrupt narrowing of the spectrum at the end towards the red
is produced by the rapid falling off of sensitiveness                   of the silver
bromide for light of increasing wave-length.
   The increase of breadth of the spectra with increase of dnration of
exposure is due to the same causes, optical and photographic, which
produce the increase of diameter of stellar disks on the photographic
plate with longer exposures, when a reflector is used.                       At h the
breadths of the spectra, having 20 minutes and 70 minutes exposure
respectively, are 0'06 inch and 0'105 inch.f
   In 1879 CornuJ made experiments on the limit of the solar spec
trum with reference to the altitude of the place of observation.                      On
the Riffelberg, at an elevation of 8414 feet, the spectrum reached to
\ 2932, while at the lower elevation of Viege, 2163 feet, the Bpectrum
stopped at 2954.         He concludes that the absorption is due to the
gaseous constituents, and not to aqueous vapour in the atmosphere.
    In 1881§ Hartley stated that an amount of ozone proportional to
   • Elevation  of the observatory 177 feet above mean sea level. Barometer about
30'03 inches at the time of observation.
   t The law of increase of size of image with exposure is not as yet accurately defined.
Bond found that the diameter of star-disks varied nearly as the square root of the
time of exposure. Pritchard, using a reflector, found a law near the fourth root ;
and Mr. H. H. Turner has recently found a law very near the cube root for plates
taken with a photoheliograph       object-glass (' Astron. Soc.  Month. Not.,' vol. 49,
                                                                                 *

the   average quantity in a vertical column of the atmosphere, caused
an absorption similar to that observed in the solar spectrum, namely,
terminating about X 2950.
   Quite recently Liveing and Dewar have made some important
experiments on the absorption-spectrum of large masses of oxygen
under pressure.* They state that with a tube 165 cm. long and a
pressure of 85 atmos., oxygen appeared to be quite transparent for
violet and ultra-violet rays up to about X 2745. From that point the
light gradually diminished, and beyond X 2664 appeared to be wholly
absorbed.
   In some later experiments with a steel tube 18 metres long and a
pressure of 90 atmos., oxygen produced complete absorption above P,
i.e.,  \  33592.
   M. Janssen, from his observations on the Alps, concludes that both
the bands which follow the law of the square of the density, and the
 dark lines obeying a different law of formation, which are due to
 oxygen in the solar spectrum, are produced exclusively by the earth's
 atmosphere — L'atmosphere solaire n'intervient pas dans le pheno-

136                 Dr.  J. Monckman.      The Specific
    " The Specific Resistance and other Properties of Sulphur."
       By James Monckman, D.Sc. Communicated by Professor
       J. J. Thomson, F.R.S. Received November 10, — Read
       December     6, 1888.
                                 Resistance.
    It is  well known that sulphur in a solid state insulates electricity of
very high potential, and conducts heat badly ; also that it undergoes
a curious series of changes when heated — melting at about 120° C,
becoming thicker at 200° to 250°, more liquid at 250° to 300°, and
boiling under atmospheric pressure at 440°. During the past three
terms     I have been engaged in the Cavendish Laboratory in trying to
determine whether these changes are accompanied by corresponding
ones in the electrical resistance and other properties of the element.
    I expected that the changes would be within the limits of an insu
lating body, hence my first experiment was designed to test the
insulating power for frictional electricity.
    Two platinum wires were placed in a beaker of melted sulphur at
a distance of about 1 cm. apart, one being connected to an electro
scope, the other going to earth.      -When the sulphur became solid the
leaves of the electroscope remained open on charging for a con
siderable time, but fell at once if any portion of the sulphur
between the wires was liquid.      To avoid all discharging by the flame
used in melting the sulphur, the platinum wires were fixed to an
 ebonite rod at the proper distance apart.      After melting the sulphur
 the flame was removed to a distance and the wires placed in the liquid.
 The discharge was complete and, apparently, as sudden as when con
 tact was made with a wire.
     The same experiment was tried with paraffin, and the discharge
 found to be very slow.
     Seeing then that the resistance was removed by melting the sulphur
 into the region of conductors, it became necessary to find some method
  that could be used for conductors of very high resistance.
                                        I
     At Mr. Glazebrook's suggestion tried placing the wires in melted
  sulphur in circuit with a high resistance reflecting galvanometer and
  a set of accumulators giving a total electromotive force of 60 volts.
  With platinum wires in the sulphur no reliable results could be
  obtained as the current quickly fell away.
     While thus engaged my attention was directed to a paper by
  M. Duter (' Comptes Rendus,' vol. 106, 1888, p. 836), in which he
  describes some experiments on boiling sulphur.        Platinum he found
  to be attacked by the sulphur, but gold gave good results ; no
 measurements were, however, given. Following Duter's plan            I  used

                Resistance and other Properties  of Sulphur.         137
gold electrodes, but failed to get a steady current to pass ; neither did
ordinary carbon plates answer any better.
   Having some graphite rods which had been procured from Hogarth
and Hayes, Keswick, for some experiments on carbon,        I tried two of
them, and obtained a perfectly constant flow of electricity even at the
boiling point. The change in the resistance between melting point
and boiling point was so great that' it was difficult to arrange a
method that would give reliable readings. In the Cavendish Labora
tory, where this work was done, we have a set of 26 accumulator
cells which when charged give a potential of about 60 volts.         This
is conducted to all the rooms, and is so arranged that we can use any
number of cells, so that we can vary the potential from 60 volts to
about 2% volts.
    When the sulphur was melted (125° C.) 60 volts gave a deflection
with a reflecting galvanometer of 11,770 ohms resistance of only half
a millimetre on the scale, while at 440° C. one cell gave a deflection
of 60 mm.
    By changing the number of cells, and measuring the potential by a
 Thomson's graded voltmeter at each change, the results given in the
 following tables were obtained.
    The graphite rods were carefully insulated from each other by hard
 glass tubes, over which shorter pieces of tube of unequal length
 were placed, and fixed with plaster of Paris, the object being to give
 as much insulating surface as possible.      A cell of mica was placed
 around   the projecting part of the graphite rods to render the path of
 the current fairly parallel ; the ends were left open to allow free
 access of sulphur and to prevent vapour taking the place of the
 liquid when ebullition commenced.
    The form of the mica cell was preserved by an outer cell of thin
 glass.

into the tube D. The dimensions are : length, 30 mm. ; width,
3§ mm. ; distance, 7 mm. between the free ends, a, b.
   The change of resistance was so great and fell so quickly at the
higher temperatures that it gave rise to a suspicion that the increase
of conductivity might arise from particles of the rods being torn off
and mixed with the sulphur.       To test this, the rods were placed in a
second tube of boiling sulphur, so that when placed in the tube of
pure sulphur they might not reduce the temperature of the liquid.
After removing and allowing the adhering liquid to flow back, they
were placed in the other vessel, and the current passed at once.            The
deflection was the same as before, and steady, neither did the rods
appear to be acted upon in any way.
   Hence we concluded that the change was in the sulphur itself.

    Roll sulphur     gives the same resistance at 125°, that is, 5 x 10s       ;
while at 440° it    is one-third precipitated sulphur, or l-o X 105.
    The accompanying       curve shows the conductivity of precipitated
sulphur.     At 290° C. there appears a sharp bend in the line. Up to
that point the conductivity rises to 5'5, becoming 51 in the next 45°,
after which it rises rapidly. This bend coincides fairly with the second
fluid state, and probably indicates some molecular change which
appears to produce similar irregularities in its other properties.
                                 Bailing Point.
     The first of these tested was the effect of pressure upon the boiling
 point.
     The apparatus used is given in the next diagram, the sulphur being
  placed in the space B, whilst the larger spaces, C and also D, were
  surrounded with sheet asbestos to prevent rapid radiation.               The
  tube A was connected with an air-pump and mercury gauge.
     When the sulphur in B was heated, on exhausting the air the first
  time there was a violent temporary evolution of gas at 240° C. if the
  pressure was 23 cm. ; but if the air was withdrawn until the gauge
   registered 1 mm., this ebullition took place at 150° C. This escape of

 140              Dr.  J. Monckmau.      The Specific
gas took place even after the sulphur had been boiled at the ordinary-
pressure of the atmosphere, and also after a considerable evolution at
150° when, apparently, all gas was driven away, a second one occurred
on raising the temperature.
   One or two precautions are necessary in order to get good results.
The sulphur is a bad conductor of heat, and therefore one part of it
near the flame   may be many degrees above another in the interior.
The vapour from the hotter bursts through the cooler liquid and
rising into the space C causes a higher temperature to be registered
than the true one. By reducing the flame, and by surrounding the
portion B with a conductor such as mercury for temperatures below
350°, the heat can be regulated and spread until this is avoided.
   The curve is drawn from data furnished by experiments at various
temperatures up to 340° only, one temperature being taken above that,

                Resistance and other Properties     of Sulphur.         141
namely, 440°. There appears the same change at 290° as in the
previous curve -which it closely resembles.
   At one time    I  thought that sulphur might be added to the list of
bodies given by Ramsay and Young in their paper on " Evaporation
                   "
and Dissociation     (' Phil. Trans.,' 1884, p. 461) as a means of obtain
ing a range of temperature above 350° up to 440°. The chief difficulty
arises from the overheating, before mentioned, and the danger of
breaking a vessel of solid sulphur on reheating. The first can be
avoided by carefully heating, and the second is very much reduced
when the sulphur is allowed to solidifyunder much diminished pressure.
   The two curves given above are so nearly identical that one
naturally suspects that the former is produced by the increased
mobility indicated by the latter, and that if the measurements for
resistance were taken at each temperature when the liquid was under
pressure so diminished that ebullition took place, the mechanical
agitation of the particles would produce a decrease of the resistance
in addition to that due to the temperature alone, and carry off the
charge somewhat after the manner of air and a pointed conductor in
electricity of high potential.
   That this was not so was proved by placing the graphite rods in
the vessel used for the last experiments.     After heating and exhausting
 to expel the gas measurements were taken at various temperatures ;
 in one set the sulphur boiled under diminished pressure, and in the
 other set the air was admitted.      No difference could be detected.

bottle from the difficulty of preserving the bottle on remelting the
sulphur, a tube was used shown in the figure at A. The capacity of
the bulb was 13-6 cm. The second vessel contained sufficient mercury
to cover the bulb of A, and the stem to the point to which the sulphur
rose on heating.
   The bnlb was filled with sulphur, and the whole of it kept beneath
the surface of the mercury except when a reading was taken.
   From several series of experiments the curve was prepared.
                              Chemical Affinity.
    If  the changes previously noticed are produced by some change in
 the molecules of the element, it will probably show itself in the action
 of sulphur when strips of metal are exposed to its attack. We know
 that some metals are acted upon at ordinary temperatures in a slight
 degree, and with increased energy as the temperature rises.         Others
 do not appear to be changed     until a high point. It  therefore appeared
 probable that by carefully watching strips of different metals exposed
 to sulphur at various temperatures, it might be discovered whether
 there was any point of sudden increase, and if so what relation it bore
 to the curves already obtained.
    A test tube was used for the sulphur, and a strip or piece of the
 metal having been placed in it, the tube was immersed in heated
 mercury.

    The last column gives the increase of temperature due to the union
 of the copper and the sulphur. It occurred two minutes after the cold
copper was introduced.          At first there was a fall of 4° in tho two first
 experiments, and 5° in the last ; this was followed by a rise. The
 lamp was withdrawn when the temperature rose to that at which the
 experiment commenced.           At the end of two minutes the rise given
 in the fourth line was observed.
     It appears, therefore, that there is a gradually increasing action up
 to 290°, or about that temperature, and above that a considerable
 increase.     The point of change in resistance, 290°, appears to be one of
 considerable importance, carrying also the fluidity, boiling point, and
 chemical affinity, &c.
                            Action of Light   on Sulphur.
     That the metals of the same group in the arrangement according
  to the Periodic Law have properties in common is well known.             Thus
  chlorine, bromine, and iodine belong to the same group, and are in
  many respects very similar bodies.          Sulphur belongs not only to the
  same group as selenium, but is the next element in front of it. Natur
  ally, therefore, we expect that they will have properties in common,
  and possibly the action of light in the case of selenium may be
  shared in an inferior degree by sulphur.             This appears more pro
  bable from the well-known fact that a saturated solution of sulphur
  in bisulphide of carbon is rendered turbid by direct sunlight, part
  of the sulphur being changed and becoming insoluble in that liquid.
  A portion of the sulphur undergoes the same change when exposed to
  a high temperature.        In order that the sulphur used in the experi
  ment might be as sensitive as possible to light, it appeared desirable

 144                 Dr. J. Monckman.     The Specific
 that only pure soluble sulphur should be used, and that great care
 should be taken not to raise the temperature in melting it so high as
to produce any of the insoluble modification.
   Two rectangular graphite rods were placed parallel to each other,
the one projecting about an inch at one end, the other at the other
end.
   The edges were turned towards each other, as shown in the figure,
leaving a space of one millimetre, which was filled with melted
sulphur. This was levelled off with a hot iron to make the portion
between the corners as thin as possible.
   When one of the projecting ends was placed in contact with a
charged electroscope, the other being to earth, the charge fell more
quickly when illuminated, on the average as 5 is to 4.
   As little reliance can be placed on these experiments, a quadrant
electrometer was charged, and the graphite rods, separated by sulphur,
inserted between the binding screws, so that the negative quadrant
was connected with the positive one through the sulphur (1'5 cm. long,
1 mm. thick, and 1 mm. broad).
   The electrometer was charged to the same potential in each experi
ment in a series and allowed to run down for a certain time.      Sun
light was allowed to fall on the sulphur, but shaded from the rest of
the apparatus ; when not required the ordinary window blind was
drawn down.
   Of course the electrometer and sulphur were protected from induc
tion by surrounding bodies by wire screens.
   The following three series of readings were taken on different days,
and in one or two cases clouds interfered with the experiment, espe
cially in No. 8, when the light was considerably shaded by cloud.

   The first and second series were alternated dark and light in the
same set of experiments to see that no permanent change was pro
duced and mistaken for the effect sought. In the first the time varied
and the deflections were allowed to fall the same distance ; in all the
others the time was the same and the fall varied.
   The method of performing the experiments made it possible that the
effect might be produced by the heat of the sun and not by the light.
The variation in temperature observed on a delicate thermometer was
about 1" C.       To eliminate the effect of heat, a long series of observa
tions was made in the dark, whilst the temperature was raised slightly
by placing a Bunsen flame 4 or 5 inches away from the screen pro
tecting the sulphur, and the heat radiated by placing an iron spiral
in it, then one of copper, and lastly a fine clay tile.
   The range of temperatnre was \h'2° C. to 17¦1° C. in the first ten
experiments, in which the heated ones fell rather more slowly than
those at a lower temperature.              In the next seven observations the
range was     14,8"   C. to 18°     C, the fall being exactly the same in each.
   There yet remained the possibility that the light falling on the
wires which held the rods caused the charge to escape more quickly
into the air.       When, however, the sulphur was removed, the effect
produced by the light on the portions of wire exposed to its inflnence
was too small to produce any change in the rate of fall.
   Hence it appears that although selenium is the body u-ost sensitive
to the action of light, it shares its property with its neighbours, and
the three elements (constituting the same group), sulphur, selenium,
and tellurium, are all similarly acted upon, f -nishing another example

  of the importance and beauty of the law which              classified   them
  together.
      During the course of this work I have often consulted Professor
  J.   J. Thomson, F.R.S., and received many valuable suggestions and
  some corrections, for which   I desire to acknowledge my obligation.
                       Addendum.        May 22, 1889.
      It having been suggested that the passage of the current at high
  temperatures through roll and precipitated sulphur was caused by the
 presence of impurities, and not by any change in the properties of the
 sulphur itself, that some of the impurities distil over with the element,
 especially sulphuric acid, compounds of mercury and selenium, whose
 presence would be quite sufficient to account for the effects given by
 *he specimens used in the previous experiments, it was necessary to
   btain the purest possible specimens of sulphur, and with this object
 no pains have been spared.
     As there also arose the question whether a liquid, being neither a
 metal nor an electrolyte, could conduct an electric current, it appeared
 to be preferable to try various methods of purification, and to compare
 the results obtained.
     To make this comparison more valuable, the methods should not
be simply variations of the one system, but proceed upon distinct
 lines, so that any impurities, left after all possible care had been used,
should be different in the different specimens, and in the measure
 ments there would appear the effects due to distinct bodies, and if so,
give some indication of the presence, in one or other of the portions
used, of some foreign body changing the electric properties of the
melted sulphur differently from the cases in which that particular
body could not possibly occur.       Three methods of purification were
              —
 employed: 1st, solution, crystallisation, and distillation; 2nd, distil
 lation, without solution, in an atmosphere intended to remove hydrogen
compounds ; 3rd (pure soluble bodies only were used, easily tested
chemically), precipitation, washing with water, and distillation.
     In numbers 1 and 2, foreign bodies acting upon sulphur were added
and afterwards removed ; they were different bodies, and if not per
fectly removed might be expected to change the conductivity accord
ing to their own individual properties.         In number 3 no such body
was introduced.      Consequently, if 1, 2, and 3 were alike in their
resistances at various temperatures, it must arise from changes in the
one body common to all three, namely, sulphur.
    Before giving further particulars of these three methods,        I wish to
describe experiments undertaken to prevent the electrodes and the
containing vessels from spoiling the liquid after it had been purified.

               Resistance and other Properties   of Sulphur.          147
la the course of the work it was found that the vessels in which sul
phur was boiled for any length of time were attacked.           Ordinary
test-tubes invariably gave way, becoming coated internally with a
thin black film, which remained fixed to the glass.
   Ordinary tubes and glazed porcelain under the same circumstances
showed a number of dark spots, which proved to be sulphide of iron;
even combustion-tubing did the same thing.
   All these experiments had been made with the flame of a bnnseu
lamp acting directly upon the vessel containing the sulphur, and it
appears that no material will resist the attack of that body under
such conditions. It seems to be caused by over-heating a portion of
the vessel from which the liquid has been separated by the vapour,
when bubbles are formed.       When the liquid falls back upon this over
heated surface, chemical action commences.
   Further experiment, however, showed that when combustion-tubing,
or retorts of Bohemian glass, are protected from the direct action of
the flame, sulphur may be boiled or distilled in them without any
action whatever taking place.
   Investigations were also made on the nature of the electrodes, by
means of which a current could be made to pass through sulphur,
and upon the best form to be used to avoid chemical action.        In the
previous work     I used ordinary thin platinum wire, and failed to get a
current to pass.
   In repeating this experiment       I  used a wire of one millimetre
diameter, which had been exposed to great heat for a considerable
length of time, and found that the current passed readily.
   The same thing took place when some thin, very hard, carbon rods
 were substituted for the platinum.      The liquid was, however, dirtied
by particles   of  carbon torn away from the rods, and consequently      I
have not considered the numbers obtained worthy of being recorded,
but simply the fact that with hard carbon rods for electrodes, sulphur
will conduct; probably electric lamp filaments may prove good enough
to resist disintegration, if not too thin for the purpose.
   To test the effect of sulphur upon the electrodes, the containing
vessel was placed in a second one, half filled with mercury, which was
kept boiling several hours ; this produced a steady temperature of
350°.   The platinum electrodes were immersed in the liquid, and after
allowing them to remain undisturbed until the whole mass had
assumed the proper temperature, measurements were taken at stated
intervals.   The method was to use a steady electromotive force, with
the sulphur in circuit, and a high resistance galvanometer.           The
 numbers given below show a conductivity increasing with the time of
 contact between the electrodes and the hot sulphur.           After the
              I
 experiment found that the platinum was considerably discoloured.

   Lastly, the same graphite rods were used as in the previous experi
ments.     These electrodes had been repeatedly exposed to high
temperatures, and also boiled many times in sulphur.               After being
kept at temperatures varying probably not more than from 400° C. to
440° C. during five hours, the conducting power of the liquid was
practically the same as at first.
   Thus, at 12.50 p.m. (boiling) the deflection was 290 scale divisions.
   The flame was then slightly reduced, and at —
                   1.20 p.m               260 scale divisions.

    New graphite electrodes were next tried, and found to discolour the
sulphur considerably ; but the resistance was increased.             In all cases
 the current passed.     The objection to using the same electrodes, even
 after using great care in cleaning them in the different liquids, and in
 that way contaminating them, and the impossibility of getting new
 ones that would do without previous boiling in sulphur, caused me
 to abandon their use altogether, and to depend upon a short exposure
 of platinum instead.         The conclusion, determined by the work
 described, was that using combustion-tubing for boiling and well-
 cooked graphite electrodes, the change produced by chemical action is
 practically nothing, even after boiling several hours, if the containing
 vessel be protected from the direct flame, and that in the case of
 platinum electrodes, it tne observations are taken immediately they
 are inserted into the liquid, the action is slow enough to allow
 measurements to be taken without fear of error.

                           Purification of the Sulphur.
    In  the first method, for which     I am indebted to Dr. Ruhemann, of
the Chemical Laboratory, Cambridge, bisulphide of carbon was
purified by being shaken with a little mercury and allowed to stand.
It was afterwards distilled over dry calcium chloride. These opera
tions were repeated until the liquid was separated from other sul
phides and from water.          It was then saturated with sulphur and half
of the liquid distilled off. On cooling, crystals of sulphur formed.
These were removed and washed with fresh bisulphide to remove any
impurities that might have been left on their surfaces by the evapora
tion of the adhering mother-liquid. They were then carefully broken
up and placed in a vacuum to remove as much of the bisulphide as
possible before distilling. After remaining so for several days, they
 were distilled t« vacuo several times, the first portion coming over,
 and that portion remaining behind being rejected in each case.
     The substance thus produced was of a beautiful light yellow colour,
 and melted into a perfectly clear, transparent liquid, about the colour
 of olive oil ; at higher temperatures it assumed the tint of port wine.
 No traces of sulphuric acid, nor of chlorides, could be found, and the
 absence of selenium was proved in the original substance.
     The only objection to this method of working is the presence of a
 body whose solvent power for sulphur is so great, and the possibility
 that the last traces are not removed even by repeated distillations in
 vacuo.
     The second method consisted in distilling precipitated sulphur in
  an atmosphere of chloride of sulphur, which removes hydrogen com
  pounds.     After repeating this several times, it was distilled in vacuo.
  As before, the middle portion only was retained. This method has
  been found to give good results      in the hands of some experimenters,
  but   I found very great difficulty in removing the chloride, being
 obliged to reduce the body to a fine powder, and wash with water,
 and finding this insufficient, finally distilled over a few small pieces
  of pure zinc in vacuo, after which it was redistilled.
     This specimen was distilled altogether eleven times.
     The third method is the one used by Professor Threlfall, who takes
  hyposulphite of soda, free from selenium, and dissolves it in distilled
  water, then precipitates the sulphur by means of pure hydrochloric
  acid.
     The reaction is shown by the well-known equation —
                 Na2S202 +   2HCl = 2NaCl      + SO» +  H20-rS.
     All the substances produced, being either soluble in water, or gas
  evolved during the reaction, except the sulphur itself, can be washed
  out with pure water.
                                                                  l

 150                Dr. J. Monf.kman.     The Specific
    To avoid the addition of any objectionable body, no attempt was
 made to precipitate the sulphur from the sulphur dioxide, hence half
 the sulphur present was lost.
    Thus it will be seen at once that a considerable quantity of the
 salt was required to produce a very small quantity of pure sulphur.
 14 lbs. of the hyposulphite were dissolved, filtered, and decomposed
by acid, then washed until free from salts and acids, dried, and
distilled several times.    When the residue appeared to be perfectly
free from foreign matter it was repeatedly distilled in vacuo, the
middle portion being removed.
   In this method the only solvent was water, and the other bodies
produced could be tested for by delicate chemical reactions.  I believe
that the three methods described fulfil the requirements mentioned
in an earlier portion of this paper, giving as pure sulphur as can be
prepared, but at the same time, the bodies that may have escaped
removal vjill differ in each specimen.

                Resistance and other Properties   of Sulphur.         151
    An   improvement was introduced into the insulation of the elec
trodes. The platinum wires were fused into glass tubes from 12 to
14 inches in length.       These were fixed into hard dry wood at a dis
tance of several inches from their ends. In this way the only part
that can possibly conduct is removed further from the source of heat.
     The ends of the electrodes were flat plates, formed by bending the
platinum wire upon itself three or four times, and then welding it
together, also for greater security a strip of platinum-foil was welded
to the back of each.
     The length of AB was 3-35 cm., the width 0-45 cm., and the
distance apart 0'2 cm.
     The tube in which the sulphur was boiled was formed by fusing
up the end of a piece of combustion-tubing about 9 inches long, and
wide enough to allow the glass tubes to be inserted in the sulphur
 without danger of touching the sides, and thus forming n circuit
 through hot glass.
     It was surrounded to the height of 3 inches by a copper tube, closed
 at the bottom, the intervening space being filled with sand.
     To avoid the chemical action which has been shown to take place
 when platinum is exposed for any length of time to sulphur at a high
 temperature, the electrodes were kept out of the liquid until every
 thing was ready for taking a reading ; they were then inserted, and
 the readings having been taken as quickly as possible, they were
 removed.
     At   the end of each set of experiments the wires were examined
 and    found in every case to be free from any appearance of the dark
 film observed in the preliminary work.
     Before introducing them into the next specimen of sulphur they
 were ignited in the blowpipe-flame until perfectly clean.
     The method used was to place the sulphur in circuit with a battery
 and a high resistance galvanometer (R 11,700 ohms).           In order to
 avoid chemical action it was considered better to reduce the number
 of observations and to commence with the boiling point.
        At  440° C. pure sulphur gave a deflection  of 545
                                                    to 570 divisions.

     Those previously found, for precipitated sulphur at the same tem
 perature, were 512, 73, and 15. I have therefore concluded that the
 two curves are identical.
     When the sulphur was removed from the circuit and a known
  resistance inserted, the calculated specific resistance was about one-
  fifth larger than that given by precipitated sulphur.                    y-

152                  Dr. J. Monckman.          The Specific
    I have calculated the specific resistance from the experiments, more
as   an indication of the magnitude of the resistance at the boiling-
point, and of the changes that take place as the terfiperature varies,
than as an accurate determination of specific resistance.
   There are several circumstances which prevent the great accuracy
usually expected in such cases. First the extreme difficulty of obtain
ing a steady temperature without exposing the electrodes to chemical
action. Thus if the readings be taken at 350° C., by using a bath of boil
ing mercury it requires a considerable time to get the whole mass of
sulphur to this temperature, the sulphur being a very bad conductor
of heat and there being no agitation to assist.           When the whole is
steady and the electrodes are introduced, they cool the portion in
contact with them, and it is necessary to wait until the temperature
rises again. Hence arises an uncertainty, we may take it before the
temperature is fully recovered, or we may delay too long and allow
chemical action to commence.           The same objection applies, in some
 measure, to boiling sulphur, but as the whole is in motion the recovery
is quick.
    Great care is necessary to prevent bubbles of gas rising up between
the electrodes and so increasing the resistance.
    Some error might also arise from the size of the electrodes,
3¦35 cm. x 0-45 cm., distance 0'2 cm.        They were as large as the quan
tities of pure sulphur obtained by nearly three months' work enabled
 me to use them.
    With these reservations      I   give the specific resistance of melted
sulphur, calculated from experiments with the three specimens men

    An objection   has been raised       to the curve found in the experi
 ment on the    boiling point of sulphur under varying pressures, on
 the ground that the vapour-pressure rises in a straight line, and
 that, therefore, the boiling point would give a straight line also.
    It is usually stated in text-books that when the vaponr-pressure of
 a liquid becomes equal to the pressure on the surface of that liquid
 it immediately begins to boil. If this is a scientific fact, the objec-

                    Resistance   and other Properties of Sulphur.        153
   Hon urged is good, and tho vapour-pressure of any liquid and the
   boiling point of that liquid must always be on the same line.           I
   think, however, that it is never absolutely correct, and sometimes it is
   very far from being true.
      If we suppose a thin film of the liquid to be acted upon with a
  downward pressure produced by the air and an upward force pro
  duced by its vapour-pressure, these two forces, by hypothesis, equal
  and opposite in direction, can produce no motion in the film.      Let the
  force necessary to produce this motion be called (a).
     Besides the mere upward motion of the film in a bubble, there is
  an expanding action which draws out the substance of the bubble,
  and is resisted by it with force depending upon the nature of the
  liquid.      Let this be called (6).
     Finally, there is a certain amount of force required to burst the
  particles of the liquid apart when the bubble begins to form. Let
  this be (c).
      We have, therefore, when bubbles are formed in any liquid,
  a force equal to the pressure on the surface of the liquid together
  with a +       b + c.
     If   the viscosity of the liquid remains the same through the whole
  range of temperature, a 4- b + c will remain the same, and the line
  for vapour-pressure and that for boiling point will be parallel, but
  if instead of this, the liquid changes from being a liquid as mobile
  as water to a thick viscous body, so stiff that the vessel containing
  it may be inverted without one drop of the substance being lost,
  a + b + c will change also, and the two lines will not be parallel.
  TJie forces a + b + c will be a function of the viscosity.
     To test the truth of this reasoning, I carefully repeated the experi
  ments, and found the results to agree with those previously obtained.
  At the same time, besides noting the pressures at which the bubbles
  began to form on the surface of the liquid at various temperatures, I
  observed the pressures at which these bubbles burst, and found that
  there was a considerable difference.        Up to 280° C. it was 4 mm. of
 mercury, while at 296° C. it fell to 1 mm.,
 or                 A+B =      4 mm. of mercury up to 280° C.
                    A+B =      1      „         „       296" C.
     I did   not attempt to measure the force C, but I think it probable
 that    it is  much greater than A + B, and that the variation of these
 (A + B + C) in sulphur explains the form of the line found.
     The sulphur molecule is known to undergo various changes, at one
 temperature containing six atoms, while at another only two enter
 into its formation. What are the molecular modifications that take
 place when it cools to a liquid, or when it assumes a semi-fluid state

and at last turns back again to liquid, we do not know.           But when
one of these changes is accompanied            by a corresponding one in
chemical activity, it appears to mark a point at which the complex
molecules are being broken into others of less complex structure.
    As this is the temperature at which the conductivity changes,      I  am
inclined to suspect that the current is carried by the simpler mole
cules, as they break apart and recombine, acting, to a certain extent,
the part of the different elements in an ordinary electrolyte.         Sup
posing this to be the solution of the question, other elements that
undergo similar molecular changes should give indications of a like
               I
nature, and am at present engaged in work with the object of seeing
if it is so.

Messieurs,
   Au mois d'Aout, 1881, M. Pasteur faisait connaitre aux membres
da Congres Medical International, reuni a Londres, les recents travaux
de son laboratoire sur les inoculations preventives          du cholera des
poults et du charbon.      Huit   aunties sont presqu'ecoulees depuis cette
epoque.      Qu'est devenue   l'oeuvre commencee alors, a-t-elle justifi6
les esperauees qu'elle faisait naitre ?      Quelle place ont pris dans la
 science les principes nouveaux qui venaient d'y etre introduits?
 C'est ce que M. Pasteur devait exposer devant vons aujourd'hui.
 Mais l'etat de sa sante ne lui a pas perm is de repondre a l'honneur
 que lui avaient fait le President et le Conseil de la Societe Royale, en le
 conviant a faire la lecture de cette annee.      II a propose au President
 et au Conseil de votre Societe d'accepter que je pnrle en son nom.
 Je ne sanrais, Messieurs, vous parler, comme l'aurait fait M. Pasteur,
 de ces inoculations preventives qu'il a inventees, et je crains bien
 d'augmenter aujourd'hui, par mon discours, le regret que vous cause
 deja son absence.
    Je n'ai qu'un titre qui     puisse  expliquer que je sois  a cette place,

1889.]                   Les Inoculations Preventives.                     155
c'est   celui de collaborateur de M. Pasteur.          J'ai en, en effet, avec
MM. Chamber-land et Thuillier, l'honnenr d'etre associ6 aux travaux
snr la prevention des maladies contagienses, et mon excuse pour oser
prendre la parole devant vous est que j'ai vu les choses dont je vais
parler. "
    Beancoup de maladies infectieuses ne rendivent. pas. Le plus
souvent on d'a qu'une fois la variole, la rougeole, la fievre typho'ide
etc.    Une premiere atteinte, meme legere, met a l'abri de ces maladies
pour nn temps plus ou moins long. Cette observation de la non-
recidive des maladies infectieuses a conduit a l'inoculation preventive.
An lieu d'attendre d'etre frapp6 a l'improviste par la maladie,
souvent pendant une dpidemie tres meurtiiere, dans des conditions
defavorables a la resistance, on a cherche a prendre cette maladie a
nn moment choisi, avec toutes les precautions capables d'en diminuer
le danger. A la contagion naturelle, imprevue, et sur laquelle on
n'a pas d'action, on a substitue la contagion artificielle, preparee de
facon a douner l'immnnite avec le moins de risques possibles.             C'est
 oontre la variole que l'on a eu recours pour la premiere fois a
 1 inoculation    preventive.   En effet, une experience involontaire et
 trop souvent renonvelee, avait appris que le liquide de la pustule
 variolique est virulent, c'est-a-dire que cette lymphe varioleuse intro-
 duite dans le corps par une blessure de la peau, communique la
 maladie a une personne qui ne l'a pas eue encore.           L'inoculation de
 la variole etait done facile.    II suffisait pour la realiser de la piqure
 d'nne lancette chargee de pus varioleux.             Dans la pratique, on
 recherchait un cas de variole benigne et dans les pustules on puisait
 un virus, suppose pen actif, mais capable de conferer l'immunite a
 ceux qui le recevaient.     Vons savez. Messieurs, qu'elle extension prit
 la variolisation, qui etait loin cependant d'etre inoffensive, puisque
 l'inoculation que l'on croyait devoir donner une maladie legere
 procurait souvent une maladie grave, parfois meme mortelle.
     Aussi, combien grand a etc le progres du a Jenner qui a remplace la
 variolisation par la vaccination. A l'inoculation d'nne maladie grave,
 Jenner substituait celle d'une maladie toujours inoffensive et qui met
 efficacement a l'abri de la variole.
     Depuis le commencement de ce siecle nous jouissons de l'inappre-
 ciable bienfait de la vaccination Jennerienne, et cependant nous n'en
 avons pas encore penetre le secret.        Quelle relation y a-t-il entre la
 vaccine et la variole ?    Pourquoi la vaccine, maladie du cheval et de
 la vache, inoculee a l'homme, le preservc-t-elle de la variole ?           Le
 virus vaccin est-il le virus modifie de la variole, ou bien variole et
 vaccine    sont-elles deux maladies     differentes ?    II semble que ces
 questions soient faciles a r^soudre, puisque l'on pent experimenter sur
  la variole et la vaccine.   Posees depuis Jenner elles sont encore sans
  reponses precises.     La grande decouverte Jennerienne, si bien faite
                                                                   M 2          S

 pour eveiller les esperances, est restee unique en medecino.            Nee
 d'une observation heureuse, merveilleusement developpee par un
 genie aussi patient que penetrant, elle etait, a l'epoque oil elle
 a &t& faite, si en avance sur la medecine, qu'aujourd'hui              apres
 tant de progres, nous ne pouvons qu'en soupconner la veritable
 interpretation. Jenner nous a montr6, par un extraordinaire exemple,
 que l'on pent preserver d'une maladie mortelle par l'inoculation d'une
  maladie b^nigne, mais il ne nous a pas donne de methode pour nous
 eonduire    a la prevention des autres       maladies   infectieuses.     La
  decouverte   de l'attenuation artificielle  des virus   nous   fournit, an
  eontraire, une veritable methode d'inoculation preventive qui a dejii
  donne une suite ininterrompue de resultats heureux, bien qu'elle date
 a   peine   de quelques    annees.   Comme     tons les autres progres
 accomplis recemment dans la connaissance des maladies virulentes
 elle a pour origine les recherches de M. Pasteur sur les fermentations.
    En nous devoilant la nature des ferments, M. Pasteur nous a
 appiis celle    des virus.   Comme    la  levure alcoolique et la levure
 lactique, les virus sont des etres vivants, des microbes comme on dit
 aujourd'hui.     De meme que le developpement de la levure, dans
 un liquide sucre, produit la fermentation alcoolique, de meme celui
 des microbes dans le corps produit la maladie infectieuse.
    Les precedes qui ont reussi pour obtenir la culture des microbes-
 ferments a l'etat de purete sont ceux qui ont permis la culture pure
 des microbes-virus en dehors de l'organisme.       La condition expresse
 pour reussir ces cultures, e'est d'agir aveo purete, e'est-a-dire, d'eviter
l'introduction des germes etrangers qui sont partout autour de nons.
L'ne technique bien etablie maintenant, rigoureuse en meme temps
que tres simple, permet d'obtenir ce resultat.
    Puisque les virus sont des etres vivants que l'on pent entretenir en
cultures artificielles, et qu'ils ne se distinguent des autres plantes
inicroscopiques que par la propriete qu'ils out d'envahir le corps de
1'homme et des animaux, ne serait-il pas possible de les modifier par
la culture comme on modifie les autres plantes?        Ne pourrait-on pas
par exemple les priver des qualites qui les rendent redontables ?
Modifier les virus par des conditions de culture speciales, telle est
l'idee de M. Pasteur, idee feconde d'ou est sortie la suite de decou-
vertes que je vais vous exposer.

poules," que M. Pasteur a obtenu pour la premiere fois un virus
attenue.     Cette maladie est si meurtriere pour les lapins, les poules, les
pigeons et les oiseaux en general, qu'on lui a donne le nom de cholera.
Elle est causec par le developpement, dans le corps des animaux qui en
sont frappes, d'un microbe ties petit, en forme de batonnet, a bouts
arrondis, presque aussi large que long.      La photographie projetee sur

maladie.      C'est en picoraut sur le sol souille que les volailles saines
sont eontaminees.
     Si l'on introduit, sous la peau d'une poule en bonne sante, une trace
da saner d'une poule qui vient de succomber au cholera spontane,
l'animal inocule tombe bientot malade ; il ne mange plus ; il tient ses
 plumes herissees, ses ailes pendantes, et il semble accabl6 par une
 somnolence invincible.        La mort survient souvent en moins de
 douze beures.      Le sang de la poule qui a succombe a l'inoculation
 experimeutale est envahi par le microbe, absolument comme le sang
 des volailles qui meurent a la suite de la contagion naturelle.
     Le cholera des poules nous apparait done comme une maladie con-
 tagieuse, inoculable, dont le virus est contenu dans le sang des
 animaux qui en sont frappes.
     La culture du microbe qui se fait si facilement dans le sang des
 animaux pent aussi etre obtenue en dehors de l'organisme. Au moyen
 d'un fil de platine, d'abord chauffe au rouge puis introduit dans le ccaur
 ou dans un vaisseau d'une poule morte du cholera, portons une trace de
 sang dans un flacon comme celui-ci, qui contient uu peu de bouillon de
 poule legerement alcalin et parfaitement limpide. Placons ensuite ce
 flacon dans une etave a 35°.      Au bont de quelques heures le bouillon
 est trouble, et le trouble est du au developpement du petit microbe du
 cholera des poules. Au microscope chaque gonttelette du bouillon
 nous montre une quantite innombrable de petits batonnets immobiles,
 semblables a ceux qui etaient contenus dans le sang qui a servi de
semence.      Une quantite infiniment petite de cette premiere culture,
deposee dans un nouveau flacon de bouillon, donnera une secoude
culture.     Par des ensemencements successifs, on pourra produire des
generations de notre microbe aussi nombreuses qu'on le voudra.
 Chaque goutte de ces cultures, de la vingtieme aussi bien que de la
 premiere, tuera avec tous les signes du cholera la poule a laquelle on
 l'inoculera.    Cette experience nous donne la preuve decisive que le
virus de la maladie est bien le microbe contenu dans nos cultures, et
puisque nous savons preparer in vitro, dans des conditions bien precises,
 des quantites de virus du cholera aussi grandes que nous le desirons,
 nous sommes vraiment outilles pour l'etude de cette maladie.
    Laissons a 35°, au contact de l'air pur filtre a travers le tampon
 de coton qui ferme le flacon, une de ces cultures, si active qu'elle
 tue toutes les poules auxquelles on l'inocule.            Chaque semaine,
 prelevons   un  peu  du contenu  de ce flacon, et essayons sa virulence sur
 des poules en bonue sante.          Pendant les premieres semaiues de

l'experience,   toutes lea poules inoculees succombent ; mais, apres on
temps plus long, un changement parait survenir dans la virulence ;
tontes les poules ne meurent pins quand on leur injecte sons la peau
cette culture plus ancienne. Qnelques-unes se rtHablissent apres avoir
etc tres malades.     A  mesure que le temps s'ecoule, l'activite dn virng
diminue et le nombre des volailles qui resistent apres l'inoculation
devient de plus en plus grand. En continuant l'experience, il arrivera
un moment, apres deux mois de sejonr a letuve par exemple, ou notro
virus, d'abord si meurtrier, non seulement ne tuera plus aucune des
poules inoculees, mais encore ne leur causera ancun malaise apparent.
Et cependnnt, le virus n'est pas mort, puisqu'il pullule dans le milieu
rutritif ou on le seme. Dans cette culture nouvelle, il ne reprencl
auoune virulence. Les cultures filles ont sur les poules exactement
l'action qu'avait la culture mere an moment ou celle-ci a fourni la
scmence.      Los proprietes nonvelles dn virus, celle d'etre devenu
inoffonsif pour les animaux qu'il tnait tout d'abord, peuvent done se
perpetuer dans des generations successives.          En faisant des ense-
mencements de la culture mere a des dates convenables, on obtiendra
toute une serie de virus d'activite decroissante, capables do donner aux
animaux, soit nne maladie mortelle, soit une maladie grave, soit nne
maladie serieuse, soit une maladie inoffensive.
   A quelle influence est due cette diminution graduelle de la viru
lence ? A l'action continue de l'oxygene de l'air.         En effet, si au
lieu de faire la culture dans nn flacon ou le renouvellement de l'air
est possible, on la fait dans un tube clos ne contenant que peu d'air, le
microbe aura bientot consomme tout l'oxygene de cet espace restreint,
et il cessera de croitre, car l'oxygene est necessaire a son developpe-
ment.     Dans ce tube prive d'air, il ne pullule pas, mais il se conserve
vivant pendant un temps tres long, ainsi que l'on pent s'en assurer en
ensemencant dans du bouillon acre le depot qui se forme dans ces
tubes scelles. Apres un an de conservation dans ces tubes, le microbe
donne des cultures ; celles-ci sont aussi actives qu'une culture recente
preparee avec du sang d'une poule morte dn cholera spontane.          Done,
l'attenuation de la virulence qui se fait dans les cultures au contact
de Tair, ne se produit plus ii l'abri de l'air.
   Messieurs,     que de resultats conquis, que de notions nouvelles
acquiscs dans cette seule experience sur la culture du microbe du
cholera des poules ! Par elle, M. Pasteur nous montre que les virus ne
sont pas les entites immuables auxquelles on croyait antrefois.            II
nousapprend quo les virus, comme tous les etres vivants, peuvent subir
des modifications que l'lieredite perpetue, que la qualite virulente se
modifie, et que cette modification peut ctre obtenue artificiellement et

sepuise l'activite des virus ; il nous montre comment une memo
maladie peut etre tantot benigne, tant6t maligne.
    Nous avons vu que les poules inoculees avec nn microbe attenue
du cholera convenablement choisi, prenaient la maladie benigne et
se guerissaient bientot. Inoculons ces poules rtHablies avec du sang
d'une poule morte du cholera spontane en meme temps qu'un nombre
egal de poules neuves. Toutes les poules neuves monrront ; celles qui
out recu d'abord le virus attenu6 resisteront. Elles ont une maladie
passagere qui se dissipe rapidement.           L'inoculation du virus attenue a
ete pour elles preventive de la maladie mortelle ; elle leur a donne
l'immunite.        Et si nous faisons aux memes animaux plusieurs inocu
lations successives de virus attennes d'activitc croissante, nous les
rendrons refractaires au cholera a ce point, qu'on pourra leur injecter
le sang le plus virulent, les placer dans les conditions ou elles seront
 exposees a la contagion naturelle la plus intense, sans qu'elles eprou-
 vent aucun malaise ; il sera devenu impossible de les faire perir de
 cette maladie naguere si redoutable pour elles.
    Le virus attenue decouvert par M. Pasteur est done aussi effieace
 contre le cholera des poules que le vaccin Jennerien contre la variole.
 Mais tandis que nous ignorons les rapports qui existent eutre la variole
 et le vaccin, rien ne nous est inconnu des relations qui rattachent le
 virns vaccin du cholera au virus virulent.            Ce precede d'attenuation
 ne reussit pas seulement dans le cas particulier du cholera des poules,
 mais il constitue une veritable methode d'attenuation des virus,
 methode qui a affirme sa puissance en nous donnant le vaccin d'unc
 autre maladie plus interessante que le cholera des poules, parce qu'elle
 est un fleau pour le betail et qu'elle peut se transmettre a l'homme.
 Je veux parler du charbon.
    Mais dans le cas du charbon, il s'est presente une difficulte qui
 n'existait pas pour le cholera des poules.
    Le virus charbonneux se trouve dans le sang des animaux qui
 viennent de succomber             a cette maladie.         Ensemence      dans du
 bonillon de veau legerement             alcalin, il donne a la temperature
 de  30°   une  culture         a
                           qui l'aspect de flocons cotonneux nageant dans
  un liquide clair.       CeB flocons sont formes de longs filaments enclie-
  vetres,   ainsi que  le  represente la photographie projetee sous vos yeux.
  Dans l'interieur de ces filaments, apres quelques heures dejii, on
  voit apparaitre des grains refringents dont le contour devient de plus
  en plus net. Ces grairs brillants sont les germes ou spores du charbon
  deconverts par M. Koch.*           Ces spores sont les veritables graines du
  microbe, et de meme que les grains du ble, par exemple, resistent
  mieux h la chaleur et a la secheresse que le ble en herbe, de meme la
    • Le premier exemple de la formation des spores dans les bacilles a eta fourni pur
  M. Pasteur dans srs etudes sur la flachcrie des vers a soie. Plus tard M. Coliu a
  decrit la formation des spores du Bacilliu sublilis.

spore da charbon       supporte sans perir une temperature de 90°, et
l'action d'une foule d'agents qui tueiaient la bacteridie en filaments.
La spore est done la forme de resistance du microbe charbonneux, et
chaque fois qu'elle trouvera des conditions favorables a sa germination,
soit dans le corps d'un animal, soit dans un milieu nutritif artificiel,
elle donnera des filaments, et ceux-ci fourniront a leur tour de
nouveaux germes.        Aussi, si nous abandonnons a la temperature de
35° et au contact de 1'air, comme noas l'avons fait avec le cholera des
poales, une culture de charbon, la virulence de cette culture ne diminue
pas. Meme au bout d'un temps tres long elle tue tons les animaux
au.xquels on l'inocule.     L'oxygene de l'air nous parait ici ne pas
exereer d'influence attenuante, parce que les germes, qui sont formes
des les premieres heures de la culture, resistent a son action.          II
faut done, pour nous placer dans des conditions analogues a celles qui
ont reussi pour le cholera des poules, empeuher la bacteridie de pro-
duire des spores.      Le moyen pour y arriver consiste a faire la culture
du charbon non plus a 35° mais a 42 — 43°.           Dans ces conditions
la bacteridie se developpe mais ne donne plus de graines, elle reste
done exposee, a l'etat de filaments, a l'action continue de l'air et de la
chaleur.
    Essayons, tons les trois jours par exemple, en l'inoculant a des
moutons et a des lapins, la virulence d'une culture faite ainsi a haute
 temperature et dans laquelle les spores ne se forment pas.       Dans les
premiers jours de l'experience tons les animaux inocules succombent ;
 mais bientot le virus parait devenir moins actif et les moutons re
 sistent a. son action, tandis que les lapins perissent encore, mais apres
 une maladie de plus en plus prolonged.       Apres un temps plus long, la
 culture faite a 42° n'est plus dangereuse pour le lapin, elle tue encore
 le cochon-d'Inde et les souris, mais il arrive un moment ou elle devient
 inoffensive meme pour ces petits rongeurs si sensibles a l'action du
 virus charbonneux.       Dans cette experience comme dans celle du
 cholera  des  poules, nous voyons le virus du charbon prendre tous les
 degres de virulence decroissante        jusqu'a devenir inoffensif.    La
 bacteridie cultivee a haute temperature et qui ne donne pas de
 germes dans ces conditions, en forme rapidement si on la cultive a
 30° ou 35°.    Les spores qui se produisent alors conservent la virulence
 du filament bacteridieu qui les a produites, de sorte qu'il suffit de
 puiser chaque jour un peu de semence dans le flacon a 42° et de la
 porter dans du bouillon a la temperature de 35°, pour avoir une serie
 de cultures de virulences graduees, cultures pourvues de germes qui
fixeront chacune de ces virulences speciales.
    Les moutons et les boeufs qui recoiveut ces bacteridies attenuees
eprouvent une fievre passagere, et si plus tard on les inocule avec du
virus virulent ils n'ont aucun mal. II n'y a done qu'a choisir dans
cette echelle de virulence celle qui donne a l'animal que l'on veut

preserver du charbon ane maladie legere mais suffisante pour lui
eonferer l'immunite.          Dans la pratique, la vaccination des moutons et
des bcenfs se fait en deux fois.         Le virus qui sert a la premiere inocu
lation est tres attenue, il a pour effet de preparer les animaux a
Taction du second vaccin plus energique qui est inocule douze jours
apnea le premier.        Toute la difficulty de la vaccination charbonneuse
consiste dans le choix de ces deux virus et dans le maintien de leur
virnlence dans un rapport invariable.
   Tout le monde a encore presente          a Pespritla demonstration eclatante
de l'efficacite de ces inoculations preventives qui fut faite a Pouilly-le-
Fort en 1881. Vingt-cinq moutons, pris au hasard dans un lot de
cinquante animaux, recurent les virus attennes du charbon, puis ils
furent inocules avec le virus virulent en meme temps que les vingt-
cinq moutons neufs restants qui servaient de temoins.             Les vingt-cinq
moutons vaccines demeurerent bien portants, les vingt-cinq moutons
neufs perirent du charbon.              Quelque demonstrative que fut cette
experience,      elle ne prevint pas les attaques.          Ce fnt d'abord le
principe meme de la methode qui fut conteste.              On nia l'attenuation
 du virus charbonneux dans les conditions precisees par M. Pasteur.
 H n'y a pas a s'arreter aujourd'hui a cette objection, elle est aban
 donee par ceux qui 1'ont soulevee, et l'attenuation de la bacteridie
 cultivee a 42° est devenue nne verite classique.            Ce qui fut ensuite
 mis en doute, c'est l'efficacite pratique des inoculations antichar-
 bonnenses.     La reponse a cette critique est ecrite ici, sur ces tableaux

faire une opinion en connaissance de cause. La mortalite des moutons
s'est abaissee, dans les pays a charbon, de 10 pour cent a 1 pour cent ;
dans ces contrees, les compagnies d'assurances inscrivent dans leurs
contrats une clause qui oblige a inoculer proven tivement le betail
assure.    En Autriche, en Italie, en Espagne la vaccination char-
bonneuse    commence    a etre  pratiquee   dans de grandes   proportions.
Quels arguments pourrait-on ajouter qui etablissent mieux les services
qu'elle rend a l'agriculture ?
    Mais ce n'est pas sur ces resultats pratiques que je venx insister ;
apres avoir parle de l'attennation des virus, je voudrais vous entre-
tenir du retour a la virulence de ces virus atteWes.               Si nous
rencontrions dans la nature une de ces bacteridies attenuees, que nous
avons appris a preparer et qui sont si depourvues            de virulence
qu'elles ne peuvent plus tner meme une souris, il nous serait evidem-
inent impossible de reconnaitre dans cet etre microscopique inoffensif
le descendant de la redoutable bacteridie charbonnense.       II faut avoir
assiste aux phases graduelles de son attenuation pour savoir que ce
bacille anodin vient du bacille mortel. II est cependant possible (si
l'attenuation n'a pas ete poussee trop loin) de faire remonter a cette
bacteridie l'echelle de virulence qu'elle a descendu, et de la rendre de
nouveau nocive pour les animaux.            Nous avons dit qu'elle etait
incapable de tuer une souris adulte, inoculons-la a nne souris tres-
jeune, agee de un jour seulement.      Cette jeune souris est plus sensible
ii Taction du virus qu'une souris adulte, elle peVira apres quelques
jours.    En se cultivant dans cette jeune souris la bacteridie aura
repris   un  pen de son aptitude ancienne a vivre dans les milieux
vivants, et le sang de la premiere souris inocule a une seconde un peu
 plus agee amenera la mort. Si bien, qu'en allant ainsi prudemment
de souris plus jeiines a des souris plus vieilles, on arrivera a tuer les
souris adultes, puis les cobayes, puis les lapins, puis les moutons,
enfin les bceufs qui sont parmi les pins vesistants des animaux qui
 prennent le charbon.
    Voici done que la virulence a ete augmentee comme elle a ete.
 diminuee, et qu'elle se manifeste a nous comme l'aptitude des microbes
 a pulluler dans le corps des animaux vivants, aptitude qui peut
 s'acquerir et se perdre dans des conditions donnees.      Nous concevons
 fort bien que cet accroissement de la virulence, que nous venons de
 realiser experimentalement,     puisse se faire a notre insu dans la
 nature, et qu'un microbe, d'abord inoffensif pour une espece aniraale,
 devienne nuisible pour elle.      II suffira, qu'introduit par une cir-
 constance fortuite dans un etre moins resistant, il s'y cultive.
 Cette premiere culture commence son adaptation a la vie parasitaire,
 il en sort pret a pulluler dans un organisme qn'il n'aurait pn
 envahir auparavant, et apres plusieurs passages successifs il sera
 devenu redoutable.

1889.]                  Les Inoculations Preventives.                     103
    II n'est pas temeraire de penser que, par ce procecle, se sont creees
dans le cours des ages des virulences nouvelles, et que ces experiences
gnr les variations de la virulence jettent une vive lumiere sur cette
question si obscure : Comment naissent les maladies virulentes ? Elles
noas expliquent aussi comment un meme microbe pent causer des
manifestations morbides diverses, comment, tres actif, il donne une
maladie generale rapidement mortelle, et comment, attenue, il ne fait
plus qu'une lesion qui reste locale.
    D'autres virus ont ete attenues par cette methode de l'action de
1'air sur les cultures. Au Congres tenu a Geneve en 1882, M. Pasteur
citait toute une serie d'exemples nouveaux.         Je ne vous parlerai que
du virus      attenue  d'une    maladie des   pores, tres redoutee par Irs
eleveurs, et connue en France sous le nom de rouget, parce que les
animaux qui en sont atteints ont avant leur mort des taches rouges
sur la peau.
    Le microbe du rouget est un bacille qui se rencontre dans la rate
et dans les ganglions lympbatiques des pores qui succombent a la
maladie. Dans les cultures il ne donne pas de germes, il sera done
particulierement accessible a l'itifluence de l'air.       II perd en effet sa
virulence quand on laisse les cultures assez longtemps exposecs a l'air.
Mais, il est une autre methode d'attenuation du rouget decouverte par
MM. Pasteur et Thuillier, et qui a pour nous un grand interet parce
qu'elle nous donne un exemple des changements que peut subir un
 virus dans son passage a travers des espeees animales differentes.
 Le rouget du pore injecte dans le sang d'un lapin le tue en quelques
 jours ; si avec un peu de la pulpe de la rate de ce premier lapin on
 inocule un second, celui-ci succombera plus rapidement encore.            On
 peut   ainsi  faire passer  le  rouget par  une  serie  de  lapins, et chose
 surprenante, dans les experiences de MM. Pasteur et Thuillier, a
 mesure que la virulence s'exalte pour le lapin elle diminue pour le
 pore.    Si bien, qu'apres un nombre suffisant de ces passages, le virus
 du roueret est attenue pour le pore.      II est devenu, pour cet animal,
 un vaccin veritable capable de le mettre a. l'abri de la maladie
 mortelle.
    Apres cet exemple, ne peut-on pas se demander ce qui adviendrait
 de certaines maladies humaines si on les faisait ainsi passer a travers
 un grand nombre d'animaux d'especes differentes ?              Ces passages
 n'ont-ils pas en lien dans la nature a notre insu, et l'idee que la
  vaccine est la variole modifiee par le passage sur le cheval et la
 vache ne trouve-t-elle pas dans ces faits comme un nouvel appui ?
     Apres tons ces travaux sur le cholera des poules, le charbon et le
 rouget, e'est a prevenir la rage que M. Pasteur a consacre ses efforts
  dans ces dernieres annees.
     Que savions-nous sur la rage, lorsqu'en 1880 l'etude de cette maladie
  fut commencee au laboratoire de M. Pastenr ?          Nous savions que la

164                            Dr. E. Roux.                      [May 23,
rage est contagieuse, que le virus rabique est contenn dans la salive
des animaux enrages et que c'est par leurs morsures que ceux-ci trans-
mettent la maladie.       Nous savions encore que la duree de l'incuba-
tion varie de quelques jours a plnsieura mois. A ces notions se
bornaient nos connaissances precises sur la rage. Cependant beaucoup
d'experiences avaient ete faites sur cette maladie, mais deux circon-
stances rendaient l'exp^rimentation difficile et les reaultats incertains.
    L'inoculation de la salive d'un animal rabique a un animal sain, ne
donne pas toujours la rage ; beaucoup de ces inoculations restent
sans effet.    Parmi les animaux qui prennent la maladie, quelques-uns
deviennent enrages apres un temps si long que cette attente pro
longed met la patience de l'experimentateur a une dure epreuve.         La
salive de l'animal enrage est un virus infidele, parce qu'elle renferme
une quantite de microbes varies, qui, introduits sous la peau en meme
temps que le virus rabique, empechent le developpement          de celui-ci
et   le  font  disparaitre dans  une  sorte   de  concurrence vitale.   Le
premier progres a accomplir etait de trouver une source de virus
rabique non souillee de germes etrangers.        Tous les symptomes de la
rage relevent du systeme nerveux et l'idee que le virus rabique doit
exister dans les centres nerveux s'impose a l'esprit. Les tentatives
faites pour montrer que la substance nerveuse d'un chien rabique
est virnlente n'avaient cependant pas reussi, parce que dans les
manipulations que l'on faisait subir a cette matiere nerveuse pour
l'inoculer on y introduisait les germes etrangers qu'il fallait precise-
ment cviter. En inoculant, avec purete, de la moelle 6piniere, du.
cerveau, des nerfs d'un animal mort de rage, M. Pasteur montra
 que le veritable siege dn virus rabique est dans la substance nerveuse.
 Une parcelle des centres nerveux d'un chien rabique, inseree sons la
 peau d'un cbien en bonne sante\ lui communique la rage, et cela plus
 surement que la salive la plus active. Cette demonstration permettait
 de faire un pas decisif dans l'etude de la maladie.
    Puisque le virus rabique se trouve dans les centres nerveux et que
 tous les symptomes de la rage relevent du systeme nerveux, n'etait-il
 pas naturel de penser que la rage ne se manifeste que lorsque les
 centres nerveux sont envahis par le virus, et que la periode d'incubation
 est le temps employ^ par le virus pour alter du lieu d'inoculation a
 l'axe cerebro-spinal et y faire sa culture ?    Si done on porte ce virus
 tout d'abord dans le tissu nerveux, la ou il doit se cultiver, l'incuba-
 tion devra etro abregee et la rage devra apparaitre a coup sur, parce-
 que le virus ne pourra plus s'egarer ou etre detruit dans un long
 trajet.
    L'exp6rience, Messieurs, a confirme ces vnes de l'esprit, et je vois
 encore ce premier chien inocule a la surface du cerveau, par trepana
 tion, et qui prit la rage apres une incubation reduite a quatorze jours.
 Tout chien, en effet, qui recoit sous la dure-mere un pea de la moelle

on du cervean d'un animal enrage prend surement la rage et dans nn
delai qui, en general, ne depasse pas dix-huit jours. Nous voici done
desormais a l'abri des incertitudes de l'inoculation sous la peau et des
ennuis des longues incubations. Aussi, apres cette experience, les
progres se mnltiplient dans l'etude de la rage, on prouve que le
virus existe dans les nerfs et que par cette voie il va de la plaie an
 cervean et a la moell.e, qu'il pent aussi dans quelques cas etre trans
 port*; par la voie sanguine.           On comprend que les manifestations
 rabiques sont    aussi  variees  qu'il y a de foyers fonctionnels divers dans
 les centres nerveux, que les symptomes de la rage an debut dependent
 de la region tout d'abord abordee par le virus, enfin l'on recommit
 qu'il existe des formes de rage jusqu'alors passees inapereues et
 differentes des types classiques.
    L'operation de la trepanation est par elle-meme inoffensive, quand
 elle est faite avec des precautious antiseptiques.          Elle reussit sur le
 lapin  avec  la meme     surete  que  sur  le chien.  Si on pratique l'inocula
 tion de la rage, par trepanation, sur une serie de lapins, en se servant
 dn bulbe de l'animal qui vient de mourir pour inoculer le lapin suivant,
 on voit que la duree de l'incubation qui etait de quatorze a dix-huit
 jours an debut de l'experience va en diminuant. Elle devient de plus
 en plus courte a mesure que le nombre des passages est plus grand ;
 apres une centaine de ces inoculations successives, elle n'est plus que
 de sept jours, puis elle arrive a n'etre plus que de six jours.           Alors
 elle ne diminue plus ; le virus rabique, par cette culture repetee sur le
 lapin, semble avoir atteint sa virulence maximum pour cette espece ;
 on dit qu'il est fixe.       C'est de ce virus-fixe que M. Pasteur a tire le
 virus- vaccin   de  la rage, par un precede qui surplus d'un point rappelle
 celni deja employe pour attenuer le cholera des poules, le rouget et
 le charbon.
    Dans un flacon a tubulure inferieure, contenant dans le fond des
 fragments de potasse caustique et ferine par des tampons de coton,
 suspendons une moelle rabique de lapin de passage. Cette moelle qui
 renferme en abondance le virus-fixe va se dessecher a l'abri des
 ponssieres, et an contact del'air a 23°, car nous avons soin de la main-
 tenir a cette temperature.         Si chaque jour nous prelevons uu fragment.
 de cette  moelle   pour   l'inoculer  a la surface du cerveau d'un lapin, nous
 constaterons qu'a mesure que la moelle se desseche dansl'air, elle perd
 sa virulence.      Au bout de cinq jours de dessication elle ne tue de |A
 plus que quelques-uns des lapins qui l'ont recue. Au bout de quatorze
 jours environ elle se montre tout-afait inoffensive, apres avoir passe
 les jours precedents par des virulences graducllement decroissantes.
    Maintenant que nous avons des virus rabiques attenues, injectons
 chaque jour sous la peau d'un chien un fragment de moelle attenuee

zero jour,   c'est-a-dire de la moelle non attenuee, de la moelle dont la
virulence   est mortelle.    Ce chien ne succombe pas a la rage, bien plus,
nous    pouvons     l'eprouver en lui inoculant dans le cerveau le virus
rabique le plus actif,     il ne devient pas malade.      Et  cependant   nous
savons que l'inoculation intra-cranienne est un precede certain pour
donner la rage. Les injections de moelles dessechees qu'il a subies
lui ont done confere Fimmunit^.             L'experience peut etre recom-
mencee autant de fois qu'on le desire, le resultat sera toujours le
meme.       Les chiens qui ont recu sous la peau la serie des moelles de
 quatorze a zero jours ne prennent plus la rage, ni a la suite des mor-
 sures de chien enrage, ni autrement.          L'etat refractaire a ete ainsi
 obtenu en une quinzaine de jours.
     D'ordinaire, la rage ne se declare      chez un chien mordu par un
 animal enrage, qu'apres un dtSlai        qui le plus souvent depasse un
 mois.    Ne serait-il pas possible de profiter de cette longue incubation
 et de donner l'immunite contre la rage avant l'apparition de la
 maladie ? Des chiens f urent mordus par des chiens enrages, on furent
 inocules sous la peau avec du virus rabique ; les uns furent conserves
 comme temoins, les autres furent soumis aux injections preventives
 des moelles dessechees de virulence croissante ; aucun de ces derniers
 ne prit la lage, tandis que les premiers moururent en grand nombre de
 la maladie caracterisee.       II etait done possible de prevenir la rage
 apres morsure.
     Malgre tons les resultats favorables obtenns sur les animaux, appli-
 quer a l'homme mordu la methode eprouvee sur le chien etait a-ssurement
 faire un pas audacieux.       On sait par quelles solicitation?, par quels
 conseils autorises M. Pasteur fut decide a le franchir.         Le 6 Juillet,
 1&85, l'enfant Meister mordu cruellement par un chien enrage, subis-
 sait la premiere inoculation antirabique.            C'est la une date qui
 merite d'etre rappelee ; elle marque non seulement dans l'histoire du
 Inboratoire de M. Pasteur, mais aussi dans celle de la science. Je ne
 dirai pas longuement comment a la suite de ce premier essai heureux,
 les mordus affluerent de toute part au laboratoire, comment depuis
 cette epoque, chaque mois 150 personnes environ viennent reclamer
 l'inoculation antirabique. Quelques-uns d'entre vous, Messieurs, ont
 assiste a ces inoculations, ils ont vu avec quel soin sont preparees les
 emulsions des moelles attenu^es, pour 6viter l'introduction de tout
 germe etranger. Les injections se font dans la region du flano, a droite
 et a gauche alternativement ; elles sont repetees pendant quinze jours.
 Pour les morsures ordinaires on commence par l'injection de la moelle
 de quatorze jours et on s'arrete a celle de trots jours.            Pour les
 morsures graves qui fiegent a tete, on fait un plus grand nombre d'in-
 oculations et on arrive plus rapidement aux moelles reeentos, parce qu'on

n'a pas 6te longtemps a apprendre que, contre ces morsares,                 il fallait un
traitement pins actif.
    Depuis le debut des inoculations antirabiques 6870* personnes ont
ete traitees dans le seul Institut de Paris.t Parmi elles, beancoup
avaient des morsures graves.             La preuve que l'animal mordenr etait
enrage a ete fournie soit par l'experimentation soit par l'examen veteri-
naire dans plus de 80 pour cent des cas. La mortalite par la rage, sur
ces personnes traitees, est de 1 pour cent environ ; elle est trfes faiblo
si on la compare a celle de 14 pour cent qui suit d'ordinaire les
morsures de chicus enrages.               Qui aurait pu croire que ce nombre si
petit d'insucces serait l'occasion d'attaques violentes contre la pratique
des inoculations antirabiques ? Ces inoculations ont subi les reproches
les plus divers : on les a accusees d'etre inefficaces, et des contradicteurs
avancaient que les bons resultats publies etaient dus a cette circon-
stance que le traitement dans presque tous les cas etait applique a des
personnes mordues par des chiens non-enrages.                          La statistique,
disaient-ils, montre qu'en France il y a autant de morts par rage
 depuis l'invention du traitement antirabique qu'il y en avait avant.
 Cette assertion etait celle d'hommes mal informes, qui preuaient pour
 des statistiques completes des documents roconnus insuffisants par
 ceux memes qui les publiaient.              Quant a la preuve de l'efficacite du
 traitement, elle se degageait de l'examen des cas pour lesquels la rage
 de l'animal mordeur etait proavee experimentalement,                   et surtont des
 resultats obtenus sur les personnes mordues a la figure. On sait en effet,
 qu'a la suite des morsures a la tete et a la face, la mortalite est de
 80 pour cent an moins ; chez les mordus de cette categorie, traites a
 Flnstitut Pasteur, elle n'atteint pas 4 poor cent.
     D'autres adversaires soutenaient que le traitement etait dangereux
 et angmentait les chances de mort.                  De sorte que l'on etait en
 presence      du   fait singulier d'an traitement dangereux abaissant la
 mortalite dans des proportions inesperees.                 Ces premiers contradic
 teurs n'avaient ponr soutenir leur cause que la force de leurs
 raisonnements, car ils n'avaient fait aucune experience.                           Mais
 d'autres survinrent qui, par des experiences, voulurent prouver que le
  fondement meme de la methode etait mal 6tabli, et que les inocula
  tions antirabiques ne donnaient pas l'immnnite aux chiens.                        Vous
  savez ce qu'il est advenu de ces pretendues preuves experimentales ;
 elles ont ete montrees inexactes, avec une autorite a laquelle on ne

suffit pouv repondre definitivement a toutes les attaques de rappeler
la conclusion de lear rapport, a savoir : que "M. Pasteur avait trouve
une methode preventive de la rage comparable a celle de la vaccina
tion contre la variole."*
    Peut-on esperer que la mortalite chez les personnes mordnes ft
traitees deviendra nulle ? Je ne le crois pas. Le plus grand nombrc
(les personnes traitees, et qui ont succombe, ont pris la rage dans la
qninzaine qui a suivi les inoculations.          Cela tient a ce que chez
files, le virus a ete apporte aux centres nerveux presqu'aussitot
apres la morsure. L 'experience nous montre, en effet, que la rage
 eclate du douzieme au dix-huitieme jour apres l'inoculation             sous-
menirigee ; elle nous apprend aussi qu'il est tres difficile de prevenir la
rage chez les animaux ainsi inocules, parce que la periode d'incuba-
tion est si courte que les virus attenues injectes sous la peau, loin de
l'axe nerveux, n'ont pas le temps d'agir. Dans les cas ou l'incubalion est
tres courte, le traitement pent done Mre inefficace ; heureusement ces
cas sont rares, meme apres les morsures a la figure.           Quant aux in-
succes exceptionnels, qui surviennent apres que le traitement a ete com-
plet, et que son effet a eu le temps de se manifester, il est difficile de
se rendre compte de leur cause, ils tiennent peut-etre a une receptivity
particuliere.
    Messieurs, ce qu'il y a de plus etonnant dans cette deoouverte de
l'inoculation preventive de la rage e'est qu'elle a 6te faite sans que
Ton connaisse le virus rabique.          Non seulement nous ne savons pas
culliver ce virus hors de l'orgaiiisme, mais, si nous admettons qu'il est
un microbe e'est par analogie, car personne n'a encore pu montrer ce
microbe d'une facon certaine.          Et cependant ce virus inconnu a ete
attenue, chaque jour on le prepare a des 6tats varies de virulence.
A defaut de cultures artificielles in vitro, M. Pasteur a fait la culture
du virus rabique sur le lapin. Ces cultures sur l'animal vivant s'obtien-
nent avec une regularity si parfaite, une securite si grande, que chaque
jour, pour le service des inoculations, elles sont preparees a l'heure
dite, a l'etat de veritables cultures pures. II n'y a pas d'exemple plus
saisissant de la puissance de la methode experimentale appliquee aux
choses de la medecine que cette prophylaxie d'une maladie dont on ne
connait pas la veritable cause.
    Cette serie de decouvertes sur la prevention des maladies con-
tagieuses est l'oeuvre d'un seul laboratoire, et a ete accomplie en
moins de dix annees ; mais, quelque soit l'interet pratique de sem-
blables travaux, il est de beaucoup depasse par l'importance du mouve-

finissant vous dire quelques mots      des plus recentes acquisitions faitea
sur ce sujet.     C'est  la conclusion naturelle de cette lecture sur les
inoculations preventives.       Avant de rechercber comment l'etat re-
fractaire est produit, demandons-nous comment on meurt dans les
maladies infectieuses    ?
   Certains microbes, celui dn charbon, par exemple, pullulent telle-
ment dans le corps des animaux, qu'il y a d ms le sang, au moment
de  la mort, plus   de cellules parasites que de globules sanguins.         Les
bacteridies   forment parfois des obstructions capillaires et agissent
ainsi mecaniquement.         Mais, comme toutes les cellules vivantes, les
microbes out leurs exigences vitales et on concoit, qu'avec leur nombre
immense, ils doivent sinerulierement modifier les milieux ou ils se
developpent.     La bacteridie du charbon, qui est tres avide d'oxygene,
prend ce gaz aux globules sanguins et amene ainsi l'asphyxie des
tissns. Mais les microbes sont surtout dangereux par les produits
toxiques qu'ils fabriquent. Une preuve frappnnte qu'il en est ainsi, nous
 est fournie par le bacille de la diphterie. Ce bacille ne penetre point
 dans l'int^rieur des tissus, mais se cultivea la surface d'une muqueuse,
 pour ainsi dire en dehors du corps; cependant il amene la mort, parfois
 avec une effrayante rapidite. Dans ce cas il n'y a ni invasion du corps
 ni conflit de cellules ; il y a empoisonnement au moyen d'un produit
 tres actif elabor6 au niveau de la fausse membrane.        II est difficile de
 tronver ces produits toxiques dans le corps d'un animal qui succombe1
 a une maladie infectieuse. Le milieu si complique des tissus se prete
 mal a une semblable recherche ; d'ailleurs, ces poisons y sont en Ire's
 petite quantite, car pendant que l'animal reste vivant il les ^limine en
 partie. C'est dans les cultures, in vitro, qu'il faut s'exercer a decouvrir
 ces prodnits de l'activite des microbes pathogenies.
    La premiere experience faite sur le sujet est due a M. Pasteur.
 Pour savoir quelle etait l'action sur les poules des produits elabores
 par le microbe du cholera des poules dans les cultures, M. Pasteur
 injectait a ces animaux une grande quantite d'une culture absolument
 privee de microbes par filtration sur porcelaine.      La poule qui avait
 recu ce liquide, depourvu de tout virus vivant, devenait somnolente,
 laissait pendre ses ailes, herissait ses plumes et pendant plusieurg
 heures pr^sentait tons les syiuptomes du cholera, puis elle recouvrait
 la sante. Cette experience nous montre que les produits chimiques
 contenus dans la culture sont capables h eux seuls de provoquer les
 gymptomes de la maladie, il est done tres probable que les memes
 produits sont prepares par le microbe dans le corps meme des poules
 atteintes du cholera.     Depuis, on a montre que beancoup de microbes
 pathogenes faisaient de ces produits toxiques.      Le microbe de la fievre!
 typho'ide, celui dn cholera, celui du pus     bleu, celui de la septicemie
 experimentale aigiie, celui de la diphterie, sont grands producteurs de»
 poisons.   Les cultures du bacille de la diphterie notamment sont, att

bout d'un certain temps, si chargees          du principe toxique, que privees
de inierobes, elles     causent a des doses innniment petites, la inort des
animaux aver, tous les signes que Ton observe apres l'inoculation du
 microbe    lui-meme.     Rien ne manque an tableau de la maladie,            pas
 meme les paralysies consecutives, si la dose injected est trop faible ponr
 amener une mort rapide.            Dans les maladies infectienses la mort
 survient done par intoxication, le microbe est non settlement agent de la
 contagion, mais aussi preparateur de poisons.
    Lorsqu'on introduit peu a pen, dans le corps des animaux, de ces sub
 stances chimiques pr^parees par nn microbe pathogene, celui de la
 septicemic aigiie, par exemple, de facon a ne pas produire nn empoisonne-
 ment brusque, mais une sorte d'accoutumance, ils deviennent refrac-
 taires non seulement a Taction de doses toxiques qui les auraient tues
 tout d'abord, mais aussi a celle du microbe lui-meme. L'immunite que
 nous ne savions donner jnsqu'ici, qn'au prix de l'introduction d'un
virus vivatit dans le corps, peut done etre conferee par l'introduction
d'un corps chimique dans les tissus.           Ces substances vaccinates sont
justement celles que nous avons vu causer la mort dans la maladie
infectieuse ; a forte dose elles tuent, a doses menagees elles donnent
                                                         "
l'immunite. Ces experiences de " vaccination an moyen de matieres
solubles, sans microbes, ont deja renssi pour diverges maladies infec
tienses, et il est permis de croire qu'elles seront etendues bientdt a pins
grand nombre encore.*           Elles nous font comprendre la possibility de
la preservation d'une maladie par une autre ; il suffit pour qu'il en
soit ainsi, que les microbes de ces deux maladies elaborent des sub
stances chimiques      semblables.
    Un animal, qui a recu une dose suffisante de             ces produits, est-il
 devenu refractaire parce que ceux-ci restent presents dans les tissus et
empechent le developpement dn virus ?             On sait, en effet, que la crois-
sance de certains microbes est arretee, dans les cultures, par l'accumu-
lation des produits qu'ils y forment. Mais ilfantse garder de conclure
ce  qui se passe dans les &tres vivants de ce qui se fait dans nos flacons.
Retirons du corps d'un animal refractaire au charbon, par exemple,
un peu de son sang et ensemencons-le avec de la bacteridie charbon-
neuse.       La culture sera abondante et rapide.            II n'y a done pas
dans le sang de ce mouton refractaire de matiere capable d'empecher
 la vie de la bacteridie.       Cette experience est, il est vrai, tout-a-fsit
grossiere, car il y a, au point de vue chimique, une difference enorme

un resultat, c'est que l'etat refractaire serait du a nn changement
chimique v6ritablement enorme dans la composition des tissus.            Pour
la faire d'une maniere plus delicate, injectons dans la chambre ante-
rieure de l'oeil du meme mouton refractaire an charbon, un pen de
bacteridie virulente.       La culture se fait tres-bien dans l'humeur
aqueuse, mais elle y reste localisee.*            11  n'y a done, dans cette
humeur aqueuse, qui fait cependant partie du corps de l'animal, et qui
participe aux modifications chimiques qui ont pu survenir en lui, il
n'y a done pas de substance capable de s'opposer a la vie du bacillus
anthracis. Outre la question chimique il existe la question physio-
logique, aiusi que le prouve l'experience suivante. Si on injecte du
virus du charbon symptomatique dans la cuisse d'un lapin, animal
naturellement refractaire a cette maladie, aucune tumeur ne se de-
veloppera, l'immunite parait done complete.            Produisons maintenant
par un choc, ou par l'injection d'une substance caustique, une lesion
 des tissue et faisons en ce point l'inoculation du virus, une tumeur
 charbonneuse apparait bientot, et quoique le lapiu ne prenne pas
 d'ordinaire le charbon symptomatique, il peut arriver qu'il succombe.
 C'est que dans ce cas les tissus detruits ont forme comme un milieu
 inerte oil le microbe a pu comuiencer sa culture sans obstacle.         L'im-
 tn unite des lapins contre le charbon symptomatique ne tient done pas
 a ce que leur corps constitue un milieu impropre a la culture du
 virus, puisque celui-ci, grace a un artitice d'inoculation, a pu l'envahir.
 Par des procedes semblables on peut aussi vaincre l'immunite acquise.
    Que se passe-t-il done quand on injecte du virus actif dans les
 tissus d'un animal refractaire ? Que deviennent les microbes ?
 M. .Metchnikoff nous a appris qu'ils sont bientot detruits et que les
 agents de cette destruction sont surtout les globules blancs qui
 englobent les microbes et les digerent. Dans le corps des animaux
 non refractaires les cellules blanches n'englobent pas les microbes, ou
 si files essayent de le faire ceux-ci se deVeloppent quand meme.
    Une explication satisfaisante de l'immunite doit tenir cornpte de
 tons ces faits et faire la part de l'action des produits chimiques et de
 la resistance des cellules.     Nous pensons qu'actnellemeut l'interpreta-
 tion La meilleure est celle qui considere l'immunite comme l'accoutu-
 mance des cellules aux poisons secretes par les microbes.
    Lorsqu'un virus commence a Be developper dans le corps d'un
 animal capable de prendre la maladie, il forme son poison et quand
 les cellules blanches viennent entreprendre la lutte, leur activite est
 entravee    par cette production toxique, le microbe poursuit sa
 culture et la maladie progresse.       Dans le corps d'un animal devenu
 refractaire par injection prealable de substances solubles ou par
  inoculation anterieure de virus attenu6, les cellules out deja ete

les cellules qui l'environnent soient reduites a l'impuissance.  On com-
prend, en effet, qu'il ne puisse y avoir d 'accoutumance pour les doses
massives. C'est done dans le temps qui suit immediatement l'inocula-
tion que se passe la lutte decisive.    On concoit alors l'importance du
siege de l'inoculation etde la quantite de matiere virulente introduite.
   Lorsque nous connaitrons bien les substances toxiques que forment
les microbes pathogenes, nous pourrons peut-etre leur trouver des
contrepoisons qui paralyseront leur action au sein meme des tissus.
Mais je m'apercois que, depuis un instant deja, j'ai quitte le domaine
des faits pour entrer dans celui de l'hypothese et qu'il est temps que
je m'arrete.
   Cette facon de comprendre l'immunite concilie, je crois, les travaux
multiplies dans ces dernieres annees. II est probable que le temps la
modifiera, mais ce qu'il ne changera pas c'est la reconnaissance de
de tons pour celui qui par ses etudes sur les virus attenu^s et les
vaccinations preventives, a permis d'aborder avec succes ce probleme
de l'immunite reste jusqu'ici impenetrable.

I. " Electro-chemical Effects          on Magnetising Iron.              Part III."*

      ceived May 3, 1889.
                Experiments with Magnetic Polar Terminals.
   In  course    of an earlier part of this research           I   made many pre
liminary experiments to investigate the possible electro-chemical
effect between the polished end disks or alternate polar terminals of
straight round steel magnets when immersed as elements in some
electrolytes, only the north and south terminal planes of each steel
magnet being simultaneously exposed to the action of the electrolyte.
   Indications were afforded, under certain conditions, of a tendency
on the part of the N. terminal of the magnet to become from some
cause electro-positive to the S. terminal plane.            The apparatus, fig. 6,
was used in the first series of observations.
                                       Fig.  6.
   The magnets were placed parallel at some distance apart in an up
right position, the lower end of each magnet, exposed in the solution,
         * Parte I and II are printed at Tol. 42, p. 459, and vol. 44, p. 152.

1889. J     Electro- chemical Effects on Magnetising Iron.         177
was covered with black india-rubber tubing, so that the flat polished
terminal disks only were exposed to the action of the electrolyte. The
bars used for the magnets were of polished steel, 4J inches long,
¦fa inch diameter, cut adjacently, previous to magnetisation, from a
longer bar. A pair of magnets were securely placed in the wooden
frame W, and the N. and S. terminals of each bar immersed in the
solution placed below. A number of experiments were made with
the arrangement, fig. 6, and with a galvanometer in circuit, using a
pair of new steel magnets each time. In these observations the
current appeared to flow from the N. to the S. polar terminal ; care
was exercised to ensure that the magnets were as near as practicable
equally magnetised.
   The results of these preliminary     observations are recorded   in
Table E.

 180                         Mr. T. Andrews.                     [June  6,
    The preceding indications of the apparent tendency of the N. pole
 to   become electro-positive in an electrolyte appeared somewhat
 singular, and after communicating these preliminary results to Professor
 G. G . Stokes, and conferring with him thereon, it was decided to make
 farther experiments, and in course of these I have endeavoured to
 utilise some valuable experimental suggestions         which Professor
 Stokes kindly made.
    Professor Stokes suggested that the results noticed in the first set
 of experiments with apparatus fig. 6 (see Table E) might probably be
 accounted for in the following manner, thus : supposing the bars to
 be equally magnetised permanently, then when the magnet bars were
 placed in the upright position the magnetism induced in the bars by
 the earth's magnetic force would in one magnet strengthen, and in
 the other oppose the permanent magnetism, so that the stronger pole
 would be the N. one at the bottom.        To investigate this possible
 aspect of the matter, the apparatus, fig. 7, was constructed with which
                                  Fig. 7.
to conduct the further investigations.     The arrangement consisted of
a wooden stand, W, the thick upper cross-bar of which was hollow
and formed a tank sufficiently capacious to hold a suitable quantity of
the electrolyte. The ends of two magnetised steel bars were securely
inserted from below through the two holes in the bottom, so that the

1889.]         Electro-chemical Effects on Magnetising Iron.           181
upper terminal disks only of the magnets were exposed to the solution.
These holes were very accurately and carefully drilled, and when the
bars were forced in, the arrangement was quite fluid-tight, and the
greatest care was exercised to ensure that the terminal planes only of
the magnets were exposed to the action of the solution. The steel rods
were connected with a galvanometer which was introduced into the
circuit, and the electrolyte was then poured into the upper receptacle
 and the readings of the galvanometer noted.              A new wooden
stand was prepared for each experiment, and a new pair of steel
magnets was also employed for each observation.           In many experi
 ments the electrolyte was first introduced to the lower ends of the
 bars, and observations first taken of the relative electro-chemical
positions of the N. and S. terminals at the lower end of the magnets.
 The solution was afterwards removed, the lower bar ends cleaned, and
 the electrolyte subsequently placed in the upper receptacle.      By this
 means an indication of the relative electro-chemical position of both
 the upper and lower polar disks of the same pair of steel magnets was
 afforded.    This series of experiments are recorded in Table F, Sets
 I to IV, and in Table H, sets V and VI.
    In other instances either the upper or lower polar terminals only of
each pair of magnets were immersed in the electrolyte.         The typical
results of a considerable number of observations made in various ways
in the above manner are recorded in Tables F, G, H, I, and J.
            Explanation of Results  on Tables F,  O, H, I, and J.
    The results on Table F, Sets     I to IV, with cupric chloride as elec
trolyte, are the averages of numerous experiments on steel magnets
which were tested in pairs with the electrolyte below, in apparatus
fig. 7, the same pairs being afterwards tested at their opposite ter
minals with the electrolyte above.
    The results on Table G, Experiments Nos. 62, 57, 56, 55, 46, 43, 42,
and 47, with cuprie chloride as electrolyte, are typical experiments
selected from a large number of observations too numerous to record
in detail. In these experiments the electrolyte was placed in the
position described on the table, either above or below only, with each
pair of magnets under observation.
    The results on Table H, Sets V and VI, with cupric sulphate as
electrolyte, are some typical observations selected from numerous
experiments, in which the steel magnets were tested in pairs with the
electrolyte below in apparatus fig. 7. The same pairs of magnets
were    subsequently tested at the opposite ends with the electrolyte
above the magnets.       The Experiments Nos. 71, 73, 75, and 79, on this
table, with cupric bromide as electrolyte, were made with the solution
below, experiments     were also made with pairs of magnets placed in
apparatus,   fig. 7, and the results observed with the electrolyte above.

    Experiments were also made, using cupric bromide as an electrolyte, in which
 pairs of magnets 6 inches long were placed in apparatus, fig. 7, and the results
 observed when the electrolyte was thuB above the magnets. The N. polar terminal
  was in the electro-positive position, with an E.M.F. somewhat similar in extent as
  when using cupric chloride.

Nos. 81, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 90 and 91, each pair of magnets was only
tested with electrolyte below.
    On Table     in Experiments Nos. 92, 94, 95, and 96, with a solution
                J,
of potassium bichromate and nitric acid as electrolyte, each pair of
magnets was only tested with the electrolyte below.         The Experi
 ment No. 100, with a solution containing nitric acid, potassium bi
 chromate, and ferric chloride as electrolyte, was made in apparatus
 fig. 7,  with the electrolyte below.    In the experiments, Set VII,
 with sulphate of iron and nitric acid, the magnets were tested first
 in apparatus fig.     with the electrolyte below, and subsequently the
                      7,
opposite ends were tested with the electrolyte above.
   The diameter of the magnets in these experiments was about
0-300 inch.
   In course of the investigations    was frequently noticed that an
                                       it
instantaneous   fling of the galvanometer occurred on first immersing the
bars in the electrolyte, the fling showing the S. polar terminal to be
positive at the moment of commencing the experiment this instan
                                                             ;
taneous fling of the galvanometer very rapidly subsided, and the sub
sequent readings showed a continuously steady positive position for
the N. pole.     (See results on the Tables.)      It will also be generally
noticed that the E.M.F. steadily increased from the commencement of
an experiment, when the electrolyte was placed either above or below
the magnets, the polar influence appearing gradually and increasingly
to affect the action taking place.        An examination of the results of
the total observations, on the steel magnets, in Table     F,  in which the
electrolyte  (cupric    chloride  solution) was placed  below   the magnets,
gave an average E.M.F. of 0-014 volt; whereas the observations
 made with the electrolyte above the magnets yielded an average
 E.M.F. of 0011 volt.        The further experiments in Tables    G   and H
 are also confirmatory of this difference in the extent of E.M.F.
    These general results seem, therefore, to indicate that the positivity
 of the upper N. polar terminal was reduced relatively to some extent
 when the electrolyte was placed above the magnets as in fig.         7, and
 this circumstance may possibly be owing to the action of the upper
 N. pole having been comparatively weakened by the influence of the
 earth's magnetism, as suggested by Professor Stokes. This difference,
 ascertained from the results of such a considerable number of obser
 vations, in the extent of the E.M.F., may perhaps thus be accounted
 for. It will be seen that the united results obtained with both the
 arrangements of fig.      7  lead to the tentative conclusion that thera
 was a general tendency, under the conditions of experimentation, on
 the part of the N. magnetic terminal of the steel magnets, to assume
 electro-chemically the positive position compared with the S. terminal,
  when these constituted elements in certain electrolytes.         The result

was seemingly due to the magnetic poles diversely influencing the
action of the solution on the metal            ; and in the case of the copper
salts, the ratio of the electro-deposition of the copper was apparently
affected by these magnetic influences.           It may be remarked that this
research has been replete with difficulties of various kinds, and about
386 magnets have been experimented upon in Part                      III   with the
various solutions to endeavour to ensure accuracy in the observations

 p. 79) is a paper by Sir John Hall, in which he says that he read
 to that Society, in the year 1790, an account of his observations on
 the granitic mass of Loch Ken.              In this he stated that in all the
  " extent where the junction of the granite with the schistus was
 visible, veins of the former, from 50 yards to the tenth of an inch in
 width, were to be seen running into the latter in all directions, so
 as to put it beyond all doubt that the granite of those veins, and
 consequently of the great body itself, which I observed forming with
 the veins one continuous and uninterrupted mass, must have flowed
 in a liquid state into its present position."
     Of the accuracy of these observations no competent observer can
 entertain a doubt, and microscopic examination of the rocks invaded
 reveals the great structural and mineralogical changes which have
 been produced by the intrusive granite.             The portion of the altered
 Silurian strata examined by Mr. Allport forms a narrow band
between the margin of Loch Ken and the granite massif of Cairn
Muir and Cairn Fleet on the other. Starting from Lochside Point
 (about 2 miles south of New Galloway), and following a line drawn
along the west side of the loch in a northerly direction, the altered

In   1880 a grant was made by the Royal Society to Mr. S. Allport to enable him to
study the phenomena of contact metamorphism in southern Scotland.              Shortly
before going theie, he received an appointment at Mason's College, Birmingham,
which for a while took up his whole time ; and then a severe illness obliged him
to lay aside for many months all scientific work. Last autumn, being still far from
strong, he consulted me as to the best way of indicating that the above-named grant
had not been without fruit, and, after some consideration, it was arranged that I
should work over his specimens, and embody his notes with my own impressions in
 a report to the Royal Society. — T. Q-. B.

strata   are seen always to strike towards the granite, and, in many
cases, to be cut off sharply by it.       The line of junction is far from
being even or straight, for short dykes or masses of granite have been
intruded between the beds.
    The greater part of Mr. Allport's collection was obtained by follow
ing the line of junction, and represents the altered condition of the
various beds through which the granite has broken. Hence it is
reasonable to suppose that the differences in mineral character which
they now exhibit are due to original differences in their constituents.
 Another group of specimens represents the rocks at a greater distance
from any visible mass of granite. Of the former, Mr. Allport writes
that the specimens indicate' the nature of the rock, from its actual
junction to a distance of about 12 yards from the granite, except in
two instances, where the nearest mass of the latter was visible about
40 yards away.      Here, however, the actual distance very probably is
less, as the granitic mass slopes down beneath an intervening layer of
turf.
    Mr. Allport's collection contains some specimens from the granite
massif, but it has not been thought necessary to have them sliced for
microscopic examination.         They show that, as might be expected,
the rock varies considerably in texture and somewhat in mineral com
position. Some are granophyres more or less porphyritic, others true
granites.    None are rich in quartz ; one, in which biotite is abundant
and a fragment of altered rock is included, is poor in this mineral.
 One contains small wine-red garnets.            The dominant tint is some
 shade of grey.
    Among clastic    rocks, confining ourselves to the practically non-
 calcareous varieties, and putting aside the coarser breccias and con
 glomerates (none of which were seen by Mr. Allport in the district),
 we find every gradation from the finest clays either to pure quartz
 sandstones or to those miscellaneous           grits which are often called
 greywack^s.      This old-fashioned    and   rather  vague term may be con
 veniently used for a group of rocks especially common among the
 older Palaeozoic strata of Britain.* These grey wackes consist largely
 of quartz grains (often from 001" to 0'02" in diameter), with a fair
 proportion of fragments of about the same size or occasionally rather
 larger, among which the following may often be recognised : —
  (a) Composite quartz grains, including fragments of vein quartz and
 quartzite ; (6) fragments of felspar of various species ; (c) fragments
 of granitoid rock ; (d) fragments of argillite and slate ; (e) fragments
 of phyllite and fine-grained schists (generally mica-schist) ;          (/) frag
 ments of volcanic       rock,  glassy, cryptocrystalline, or scoriaceous.
 If one may generalise from a rather limited number of observations,
 the more acid lavas predominate over the basic, and among these

andesites or dacites        seem   more common.          Mr. Allport's collection,       as

rocks generally not rich in lime, and varying from silty clays to

    The minerals which have been produced by contact metamor
phism, in the rocks now studied, do not require a lengthy descrip
tion.      In addition to what has been written in England, we are
indebted to Professor Rosenbnsch, Professor Barrois, and other foreign
observers for some admirable studies.*                Of these results, a very clear
and full summary, up to a recent dnte, has been given by Mr. Teall,t
so that it is needless to enter into details which may now be regarded
 as matters of common knowledge.                The minerals in these specimens
 From Scotland are :       —
     11) Quartz,       which is very abundant, occurring both in small
               granules and in fair-sized grains, generally rather con
               spicuously free from inclusions.
     (2)   Mica,     (a) brown, sometimes becoming greenish coloured,
               apparently from subsequent alteration, (b) white.J
     (3)   Hornblende.       Occurs in grains of rather irregular outline, and
               not seldom interrupted by enclosures of quartz ; sometimes
               rather acicular in habit and grouped.                The length varies
               from about 0'Ol" to 0'025". Colour in thin sections a rather
               pale olive-green ; pleochroism not very strongly marked ;
               a, pale yellowish-green, b, olive-green or a rather deeper
               green.     Some might certainly be called actinolite; the rest
               is nearer to one of the secondary                 hornblendes      seen    in
               epidiorites. Hornblende does not appear to be very common
               as a product of contact metamorphism             in sedimentary rocks.
     (4) Augite.        Occurs in two or three slides with hornblende ; in one
               case rather abundantly.        In roundish or elongated grains of
               granular texture, almost colourless, or with the faintest
               possible tinge of grejish-green.          Cleavage not very distinct,
               but sometimes grains show pretty clearly a cleavage parallel
               with ooP, and then extinguish at angles often greater than
               30°.    Tints with crossed Nicols often brilliant. This mineral
               in general appearance resembles sahlite or malacolite, which
               are   frequent contact products in limestone,                 so   we   may
               venture to regard it as a variety of augite.

     (6) Epidote (?) not common.
     (7) Black opaque minerals : — Iron oxide and perhaps graphite.
     Tourmaline is extremely rare, three grains occurring in one slide
  only, from close to a junction, and, what is more remarkable, no anda-
  lusite is distinctly recognisable.           One or two other minerals, which
                            "
  may be regarded as          accidental," will be noticed in connexion with
  the specimens.
     As the effect of contact metamorphism has been described                   in some
  detail by one or other of the present authors from the Lake                  District,
  Cornwall and Brittany, and by Dr. C. Barrois from the last-named
 country,* it will suffice to recapitulate very briefly the phenomena,
  (a) in the case of a shale, (6) in that of a sandstone.
     (a.) Very commonly chiastolite is formed in comparatively large
 crystals, and this even before the matrix of the rock is very obviously
 affected.      As the junction with the intrusive mass is approached, the
 chiastolite crystals frequently disappear, and rounded spots of anda-
 lusite, often very full of mineral enclosures, begin to occur.                   These
 after a time become clearer and more crystalliform in outliue.t
 Simultaneously, the colouring matter of the rock collects in specks,
 rods, and ill-formed crystals, the size of the last increasing on getting
 near the junction.         Mica, usually of a peculiarly rich brown colour,
 forms in distinct flakes, which are sometimes interrupted by granules of
 quartz, &c., sometimes locally darkened by black spots, with an inde
 finite outline, like an ink blot on porous paper.              The basal cleavage
 is distinct, but the external angles are usually not well defined.
 These flakes sometimes exhibit a certain parallelism, and thus impart
 a foliation to the rock, but this commonly is not well marked.                 Quartz,
 generally in clear granules, is also developed ; sometimes it is wholly
 of secondary origin, but in other cases, probably, original fragments
 are enlarged, till the rock has become a crystalline aggregate, chiefly
 consisting of quartz and mica.               As a rule, white mica, at any rate
 in crystals of fair size, only makes its appearance very near to a
 junction.!
     This brown mica is evidently not a normal biotite. There are in
 its microscopic aspect certain peculiarities by which it may generally
 be distinguished ; for instance, the dichroism and absorption are less
 strongly marked, the colour-change being from pale-yellow to reddish-
    * Allport, '                                                         '

    t On this line of change, as it does not occur in the specimens before us, it is
needless to dwell.
    t It is interesting to observe in connexion with this that MM. Fouqu6 and Le>y
failed to produce a-ificially, by fusion, white mica, but met with some success in
the attempt to obtain biotite (' Synthase des Mineraux el des Roches,' p. 126).

brown, indeed often it becomes deep brownish- black and opaque.                        So
far as   we know this mica has not been isolated,               and made the subject
of quantitative analysis, but an inference may be legitimately drawn
from the published analyses of clays and of rocks affected by con
tact metamorphism, in which the presence of this mineral has been
determined by microscopic examination.
   The researches of Carius, Fuchs, and Dnger* may be held to have
demonstrated that, as a rule, no change of any importance occurs in
the chemical composition of a mass of rock affected by contact
metamorpliism.          If, then, we examine a series of analyses of ordinary
argillaceous sediments, and of the rocks resulting from contact
metamorphism of the same,t we are struck with their comparative
 poverty in magnesia and richness in iron oxides.                       For instance, in
 a group of nine analyses, we find the following ranges of consti
 tuents : —
    MgO, from 0-06 to 2596           ; the average being 1-185.
    FeO, from 0'495 to 6'010 1 the two together commonly forming
    Fe,02, from 3-380 to 8-165 J              from 9 to 10 per cent. of the whole.
    KgO,    from   a trace  to   3'765,   but  generally more than 1¦2 per cent.
    Na^O, usually in much smaller quantity, but once rising to 2'170
          per cent.
    Every analysis, except one, gives more than 2 per cent, of alkalies,
 but this records only traces both of soda and of potash. The author
 estimates that in one of these rocks — the richest in magnesia — there
 is 32-4 per cent, of mica, but even in this example the percentage of
 Fe to Mg is 11 : 9. Most of the analyses indicate less than half this
 quantity of magnesia, so that the amount of the iron would be three
 or four times that of the other constituent ; indeed, we may say that
 in eight of these rocks the iron must largely exceed the magnesia, and
 in one of them almost wholly replace it.
     The inferences thus suggested are confirmed by other examples
 from the Pyrenees, from the Lako District, and elsewhere.                           It is
 then evident that very many             — probably    most  —   argillaceous    rocks  do
 not contain a sufficient amount of MgO to form an ordinary biotite
 in any quantity, so that we must suppose either that the constituent
 is subsequently introduced — which is highly improbable —or that the
 mica is an iron mica, not a ferro-magnesian mica. Such micas are
 known to exist. We do not indeed remember to have seen a separate
 analysis of the mica from a case of contact metamorphism, but in the
 table of analyses of black mica given by Mr. Teall.J we find one with
 MgO as low as 1-50 (FeO, 18'06 ; Fe2Os, 719), and similar micas are

analysed by Mr. F. W. Clarke,* from American localities.                        In fact,
these contact-micas are either lepidomelanes or haughtonitea, varietal
names which are applied to iron micas, according as there is a pre
dominance        of Fe2Os or FeO.f
    The same analyses indicate that if a normal clay were converted
into a quartz-mica rock, supposing all the alkalies present to be
taken np in forming mica, a considerable proportion of alumina, and
the larger part of the silica (something like 50 per cent.) wonld be
left unused.        If the alumina amounted to 11 per cent, of the whole,
about G-6 of the silica would be required for andalusite ; this would
 leave not less than 43 per cent, of the silica free to form quartz.
Thus from a normal clay, as the result of contact metamorphism,
a rock is produced containing not less than 50 per cent, of free
quartz.
     (6.) After what has been said above, the history of a sandstone
may be dismissed in few words.                     Almost all sandstones contain a
certain amount of mud and silt. From these, both mica *>nd sub-
silicates of alumina would form as before ; but in this case the free
silica would very commonly be deposited on the pre-existing granules
or grains of quartz, probably in crystalline continuity with them, so
that in many cases the fragmental aspect of the rock would be
obliterated and its structure would resemble that of the quartz layers
in the true crystalline schists.
     In the above cases, if the original rock contained a lower proportion
of alkalies and a fair one of lime, as well as some magnesia, we might
expect minerals of the pyroxene group to be formed.                       If, however,
felspar was present in fragments, and its constituents entered into new
combinations, a white mica might be produced.                  A fragment of normal
orthoclase, in forming muscovite, would liberate at least four-tenths
( f its silica,| and if it had lost some of its alkaline constituents by
decomposition, it would be converted into a roughly equal mixture of
quartz and muscovite.
    Somewhat similar changes would occur in the case of fragments of
an acid glass, which might be expected to produce, as the result of
contact metamorphism, a microcrystalline mixture of quartz and
white mica, while the alteration of a basaltic rock§ would give rise to
pyroxenic minerals, epidote, probably some biotite or chlorite, with a
smaller proportion of quartz.

Scotland, we are at once struck, notwithstanding the present crystal
line condition of the rocks, with their resemblance to those cut from
greywackes, which contain distinct fragments of quartz, felspar, and
an argillaceous rock.          We do not, indeed, observe an indubitable
fragmental structure, but what we might term the ghost of one.                   For
instance, the eye is at once arrested by subangular grains of quartz,
¦which are much larger than those helping to form the mosaic of
quartz and mica which constitutes the major part of the rock.                  Their
edges    are sometimes    sharply    limited   by  flakes   of  brown   mica and ave
rectilinear, at others they join irregularly to the quartzes of the
matrix, as if they had grown together.                    Sometimes these larger
grains show a compound structure, but more often they are simple,
part of a single crystal, just as may be seen in the fragments common
in a greywack6.       Usually they are fairly free from enclosures, though
occasionally     microliths   and small fluid cavities with bubbles may be
 obseived. Other patches, yet more shadowy in outline, consist of
 chalce^onic or microcrystalliue quartz find fiakelets of mica, generally
 white. 'Still, it is generally not difficult to distinguish them from
 the matrix, owing to their difference in composition and structure.
 Careful examination of these detects occasionally less altered portions
 in which the lamellar twinning of a plagioclase felspar is still dis
 tinctly recognisable.       These, then, represent the felspar fragments of
 the original grey wacke. Again we note other subangular fragments,
 which consist sometimes of fair-sized quartz-granules together with a
 little dark-coloured mica, or perhaps an iron oxide, sometimes of
 smaller quartz-granules and of brown mica.                  Comparing these with
 specimens of fine-grained earthy sandstones, silts, and shales, affected
 by contact metamorphism,             which we have obtained from other
 localities,* we find a perfect correspondence in composition and struc
 ture, and have no hesitation in regarding them as representatives of
 bits of arenaceous and argillaceous rock, once present in the original
 greywack6.       Fragments of granitoid or of volcanic rock have not
  been positively identified in the present set of slides, though very
 probably the former, at any rate, would be found, if a larger series
 was prepared.      The matrix of the original rock, once a silt of variable
 composition, is now replaced by quartz and mica (generally brown),
  with sometimes a considerable proportion of a pyroxenic mineral,
 which appears to substitute itself for the brown mica.
     In conclusion, a few remarks may be made upon the specimens.
  The first group (see above, p. 194) was taken from near the granite
  mass.   All the specimens have a hard, strong appearance ; some show
  a slight mineral banding, but there is no well-marked foliation ; thus
  the texture of the rock at the first glance reminds one more of a
  rather micaceous band in those granulitic rocks which are generally
               •          '

found to be of Archaean age, and of which the origin is still donbtfnl,
than of a normal mica-schist.          They exhibit that peculiar purplish-
brown or purplish-grey tint which is so common in the quartz-mica
rocks resulting from contact metamorphism, and is doubtless due to
the peculiar tint of the micaceous constituent.
    Of the first three specimens, 406, 407, 408,* taken from the same
locality, about 12 yards from the granite, we need only remark that
one exhibits, macroscopically and microscopically, a slight mineral
banding, indicated by variations in the proportions of the qnartz,
mica, and a brownish earthy-looking dust, which are the chief con
stituents of the rock. To this banding the flakes of mica tend to lie
roughly at right angles.       In the other two specimens, fragments of
quartz and of altered felspar can be detected.            In one the latter is
abundant, and the frequency of an earthy dust, and of a mixtnre of
microcrystalline quartz with tiny (lakelets of mica or a kaolinitic
mineral, renders it probable that the original rock was a rather
felspathic grit. A vein of calcite is present in the slide.         The other
specimen possibly     contains  a little andalusite.
    The next specimen (409) exhibits fragments rather distinctly, some
being about 0'05" in diameter.         In those of felspar traces of twinning
can be detected, showing the mineral to be either a plagioclaBe
twinned on the pericline type or a microcline. The matrix is more
free from " dust
                    " than in the former
                                            specimens, so that the rock has
a more distinctly holocrystalline aspect.        A few grains of epidote are
probably present.
    The next two specimens (410, 411) were collected about 40 yards
from the nearest visible granite. Both assume a tinge of green in
weathering. One differs little from some of those already described ;
the other is macroscopically rather distinctly
                                                     " spotted ; " both exhibit
 light specks such as might indicate a felspar, and elongated darkish
spots or streaks lying roughly parallel.        Hornblende is rather abun
dant, associated with or replacing the brown mica ; also a few grains
of pyrite.    There are fragments as above described, one or two
reaching 0'04" in diameter; the presence also of rock fragments is
suggested, but the evidence is inconclusive.           From the condition of
the matrix one would infer a rather earthy condition for the original
grit.
    The next specimen (414) is from a junction, and a vein of light
coloured, finely granular, non-micaceous         granite, about 1^" thick, is
present in the hand specimen.             The altered rock is rather more
coarsely crystalline in aspect than the others, white mica is present
in fair-sized flakes, and there are many irregular blackish spots, like
stains, about 0°14" diameter.        Microscopic examination shows that a
fragmental structure is still marked, and that bits of rock are present.
                 .• These numbers arc pointed on the specimens.

Much of this       must    once have been a more or less sandy argillite.
One or two, however, suggest the former presence of                  a fine-grained
quartz-felspar     rock, probably a micro-granite, the felspar of which
has been replaced by a minute fibrous mineral, the fibrillae of which
exhibit bright tints when rotated between crossed Nicols, and give
straight extinction ; probably it is sillimanite. White mica is present
in rather considerable quantity, in thickish flakes up to about 0'04"
in longer diameter. Sillimanite is also present in the matrix, and in
parts of the slide a clear mineral, varying in colour from orange to
rich burnt-sienna brown, forms a kind of base to the small round
grains of quartz and flakes of brown mica.               This material has but a
weak depolarising power.            It exhibits an aggregate structure, and
appears to be in rather close relation with the above-named fibrous
mineral.      It may be only a stained variety of the same, or possibly an
alumina-subsilicate nearly related to staurolite.*
     Proceeding onwards, the next specimen                  (415), taken about
 10 yards from the junction, is macroscopically very distinctly speckled,
and under the microscope indicates very clearly the presence of frag
ments.      These are quartz and felspar as usual, an altered argillite,
and in one case an impure fine-grained sandstone or quartzose silt.
 In the matrix is a considerable amount of hornblende.
     The next specimen (416), collected about 200 yards north of the
last, contains no hornblende, and is less definitely fragmental. The
 flakes of brown mica are not seldom about 0'Ol" long, and occasionally
 rather more.       They indicate a slight foliation, and are frequently
crowded round the quartz grains, the latter being unusually clear
and free from enclosures.
     The next two specimens (417, 418) illustrate a rock with bands
of brownish and greenish-grey. Fragments are present, as above
described, some evidently have been fine-grained sandstones, a few
probably an argillite. The amount of these and the changes in the
 matrix from the ordinary quartz-mica rock to layers where a
pyroxenic mineral replaces more or less the mica, indicate that the
original rock was composed of stratulae of different nature, and a
slight foliation may be noted parallel with the original bedding.
 Some of the pyroxenic mineral is hornblende, but in parts of the
 slide an augite is abundant, as described above.
     The last specimen (419) from this locality gives less distinct indica
tions of original fragments, and differs only from the ordinary quartz-
mica rocks in being rather more definitely foliated.
     The next two specimens (420, 421) were collected at Newton
Stewart Road, about ^ mile from the granite, from beds which struck
    • A rather similar mineral occurs in a
                                                junction specimen from Sinen Gill,
Skiddaw, but here its structure is more uniform and its influence on polarised light
more marked.    This very probably is staurolite.

(especially at the ends of the grains, that is, in the direction of the

The grains are occasionally composite, but generally homogeneous                          ;

of us in the      case of the Obermittweida             conglomerate,* the mica
appears to be partly original, partly secondary ; indeed, repetition
may be saved by referring to the published description of the grit
from the inner part of the fold at that place, merely stating that
in it secondary changes appear to be rather more pronounced than
in the present specimen.
    The other specimeu is a homogeneous, compact, very fissile rock,
like a schistose slate or phyllite. Microscopic examination shows that
it consists of a micaceous mineral and quartz, with occasional granules
of epidote (rare), of an impure kaolinitic mineral, and flakes or perhaps
rods of iron oxide. In most parts of the slide these are the chief
constituents. The flakes of the first-named mineral occasionallj-, in the
more quartzose parts, are about 0-0025'' long, but generally less. It
varies from almost colourless to a pale olive tint, but sometimes is
 slightly brown. It often resembles a mineral common in some of the
 oldest green slates, and some of it is probably a chlorite. The associated
 quartz is generally very minute, but rather larger grains of distinctly
 fragmental aspects, up to about 0004" in diameter, occur, especially
 in certain layers, and there are others consisting mainly of quartz.
 It is, however, possible that some of these may be veins, indeed, one
 of the most quartzose certainly is, but others are hardly less certainly
 true stratulae, indicative of former bedding. The sharp flexures in
 these, the "rucking" of the layers of mica, and the development in
 parts of the slide of an incipient strain-slip cleavage (ausweichungs-
 rlivage) indicate that the rock, subsequent to partial mineralisation,
 underwent great pressure.          In short, macroscopically and microsco
                                                                      "
 pically, it bears considerable resemblance to those " satiny slates or
 phyllites, the alteration of which is, to a very large extent, due to
 pressure.    At the same time, when we examine the individual plates
 of mica and the structure of the folds with a high power, we are led
 to think that some subsequent modifications have taken place. As
 lias been described in the paper already mentioned, each individual
 flake of mica appears as if the process of formation had been
 completed in situ, or that in some way or other it had been enabled to
 " right itself " after the distortion which is usually produced by these
 srreat earth-movements.       So also the layers of mica, as it were, slightly
 bristle with the projecting ends of mica flakes ; at the sharpest part
 of a fold they have lost the " strained " look, like a rope beginning to
 part, and the incipient plane of strain-slip cleavage is often "soldered
 up." The changes have taken place (though to a much less extent),
 which are described in the paper by one of us on the effect of con
 tact metamorphism on phyllites at Morlaix.t                Probably we shall not
 be wrong in ascribing them to the elevation of temperature, connected

with the granite intrusion above described, though in the present
case the greater distance from the granite would make this elevation
a less important agent of change.
   The specimens which have been described indicate that from
ordinary muds and sandy silts, quartz-mica (and in some cases quartz-
pyroxene) rocks may bo developed by contact metamorphism, and
that the differences now to be observed in the mineral composition
are due to differences in the original sediments of which the mass was
composed.     In some cases the rock has become thoroughly crystalline,
in others the process is less complete, and a fair quantity of the
original dust, possibly in the form of kaolin, still remains. If frag
ments of larger size have been present, these, though modified like the
matrix, can still be recognised.      Some of these rocks are no less
crystalline than certain of the less coarsely crystalline mica-schists,
and occasionally exhibit a foliation.    From the latter, however, they
can be distinguished by a practised eye.      They are fair imitations of
some of the indubitably Archaean quartzose mica-schists, but only
imitations.    Heat has been the main agent of metamorphism in the
case of the rocks just described, though probably water was present,
and considerable pressure may also have been exercised, which in one
case seems to have produced an earlier alteration. Where the original
constituents have differed considerably in size, a record of this
structure is still retained.      Had the elevated temperature been
maintained for a longer time, molecular movements among the con
stituents might have rendered this structure more indistinct, but
there is nothing to warrant the supposition that they could have
obliterated the distinction between stratulfe of moderate thickness.
These specimens then appear to justify us in asserting a sedimentary
origin for certain crystalline schists (micaceous, quartzose, &c), in
referring their mineral bands to a stratification of the materials, and
in supposing their alteration due to their having been kept at a com
paratively high temperature for a considerable period.

   In 1886 and 1887 made a journey to some of the lakes of Western
Central Asia for the purpose of making observations on their fauna.
As the waters of these lakes are of very various composition, being
salt, alkaline, bitter or fresh, in different degrees, I looked forward

1889T]             On  some  Variations  of Cardium edule.                  205
to an opportunity of investigating the question whether these diverse
environmental conditions produce any correlated changes in the
structure of the animals exposed to them. The collections made
with this object consist chiefly of Crustacea, of which an account
will appear hereafter. The shells forming the subject of the present
paper were collected in the district of the Aral Sea and in Egypt.
    As is well known, the Aral Sea formerly covered a larger area
than it does at the present time. The limits of this area have not
been determined, but it has been vaguely suggested that the Aral
and Caspian Seas together covered a large part of the steppes of
Western Central Asia, probably connecting with the Arctic Ocean,
and that the sea thus formed gradually receded until the Aral and
Caspian Seas alone remained in their present form. In the course
of my journey I visited the valley of the Irghiz and Tm-gai Rivers
and Lake Tschalkar into which they lead; the north and north-west
 shores of the Aral Sea ; the valley of the Shu and Tele Kul Tata into
 which it leads; also Lake Balkhash, and I nowhere found any direct
 evidence which conld at all support the view that the Aral Sea had
 gradually receded from a very greatly extended area.                  On the
 contrary, all trace of the previous presence of the sea disappeared
 everywhere abruptly at a level about 15 feet higher than the present
 level of the Aral Sea. In all places which would be covered if the
 sea were to rise about 15 feet, shells of the cockle of the Aral Sea
  (Cardium edule, var. rusticum) were found deponited in great quan
 tities, but they always ceased at a definite horizon on ascending.           In
 some places the shore of the Aral Sea is formed of vertical cliffs com
  posed of horizontal beds conlaining fossils of the nge of the London
  clay of England,* while elsewhere the beach consists of sandy flats
  extending inland for many miles.        Both in the steep places and on
  the sands the deposits of cockles cease suddenly as described.            This
  seems to be conclusive evidence that the Aral Sea has at all events
  not continuously receded from a very much larger area than that
  which it at present occupies.
     On the north shore of the gulf, Sary Chegannk, a considerable
  strip of low-lying country has been uncovered.          The average width
  of this shell-covered region is about 3 miles.     The post road to Kaza-
  linsk and Tashkend crosses it from north to south. At the post
  station, Ak Jalpas, is a narrow, dry channel, like the bed of a river.
  This channel passes up from the Aral Sea, and leads to two large
  basins which were formerly connected with the sea itself, but which
   are now dry.      The southern basin is called Shumish Kul, and the
   northern is known as Jaksi Klich. In the course of the channel by
   which Jaksi Klich was joined to the Aral Sea is a smaller basin,
     • These fossils were kindly examined for me by Mr. T. Roberts, of St. John's
   College, Cambridge, and Mr. Keeping.

206                             Mr. W. Bateson.                      [June 6,
Jnman l£lich.       Wlien the level of the Aral Sea fell, each of these
three basins     became isolated as a separate salt lake containing a
sample of the fauna of the Aral Sea.            All three lakes subsequently
dried up, and during this process        the  water must have become salter
and Salter   until only   a bed  of salt remained.
    Shumish Kul is about 8 miles long.           The western shore is bounded
by high limestone hills, on the foot of which definite terraces are
marked by the action of the water as the level of the lake gradually
sank during the process of drying up. On these terraces are great
numbers of shells of the cockle of the Aral Sea (Cardium edule,var.
rusticum), being for the most part paired shells with their ligaments
preserved, fixed on the oral faces in the crust of oxide of iron and
 mud, which was formed when the waters of the lake covered them.
 A series of specimens, therefore, taken from these terraces gives
examples of the shells as they were at each stage in the progressive
desiccation of the lake, and shows the changes which they underwent
as the lake became Salter and Salter.              The principal terraces are
^even in number, and the total difference in level between the top
and the bottom is about 60 feet.
    On comparing the shells found on successive terraces from above
 downwards, the chief variations noticeable in them are as follows : —
                                                       —
    (1.) Diminution in the Thickness of the Shells. This is first apparent
 in the shells of the third terrace.       It proceeds to such an extent that
 the shells of the lowest terrace are almost horny and semi-transparent.
 The change in the thickness of the shells is most clearly brought out
 by the table giving the comparative weights of the shells from
 different terraces.
     (2.) The Size of the Beak is greatly reduced.
     (3.) The Shells become highly coloured. —This change and (1) occur
 almost uniformly.       The shells of each terrace vary very little among
 themselves in texture, thickness, and colour.
    (4.) The Grooves between the Ribs appear on the inside of the Shell as
 Ridges with rectangular Faces. — This change first affects only the ribs
behind the 8th and 10th, but on the lowest terraces all the ribs are so
affected.
    (5.) On  the  lowest   Terrace the Shells diminished greatly   in absolute
Size.
    (6.) The Length of Shells in Proportion to their Breadth increases. —
 I use the term " length to mean the greatest antero-posterior dimen
                             "
sion, and the term " breadth
                                   "
                                     to mean the dorso-ventral measurement
at right angles to the length, passing in right valves across the point
of the posterior tooth, and in left valves across the depression into
which the posterior tooth of the right valve fits. I have found by-
careful testing that these measurements can be relied on to 0'5 mm.
    In the course of these measurements it appeared that —

1889.]               On   some   Variations   of Cardium edule.               207
    («.) The change in proportion does not occur in all shells, nor to an
equal degree in those in which it is found.
    (6.) This variation is far more marked in shells of greater absolute
size, making it necessary that samples of shells of nearly the same
size must be taken for comparison.
    (c.) This variation occurred slightly in the shells of the 2nd
terrace, increasingly in those of the 3rd and 4th, reaching a point in
the 5th terrace which is practically not afterwards exceeded, even in
shells found as much as 30 feet lower, though the changes in texture,
Ac., had greatly progressed in these latter. (See tables.)
    In   this lake shells of Dreissena pnlymorpha were found        on the level
of   the    3rd terrace, and shells of Hydrobia ulvat on most of    the terraces,
which did not differ from        those of the Aral   Sea.
    Jaksi Klich is      the largest superficially of the three dry lakes con
taining cockles.          Its length is about 10 miles and its breadth o
miles. It differs from Shumish Kul in being comparatively shallow,
the former having been about 60 feet deep before the separation from
 the Aral Sea, while the latter cannot have been more than 15 — 20
 feet deep. There is no distinct series of terraces on its banks, but
 the shells occur in two chief deposits, an upper and a lower deposit.
 The outer deposit marks the original high level of the water, and the
 other forms a baud of shells round the salt which now fills the bottom
 of the lake.
     Generally speaking, the shells of the lower deposit show the same
 variations in texture, colour, shape, &c, when compared with those
 of the upper deposit, as           were  found in the case of the shells of
  Shumish Kul. But while           the shells of the highest terrace at Shumish
  Kul    were practically     the same as those now living in the Aral Sea,
  those of the upper deposit at Jaksi Klich differ in some particulars,
  probably in connexion with the fact that Jaksi Klich was always only
  a shallow lagoon, while Shumish Kul was a deep lake.
      The variation in the proportion of length to breadth reaches a
  greater development in the shells of the inner deposit at Jaksi
  Klich than in any other shells examined (see tables), excepting those
  of the fresh water lake, Bamloh, No. 2.
      .Tallinn Klich is a small, independent lake-bed, about half a mile in
  diameter and about 15 — 20 feet deep. Its shells show the same
  variations as those of Jaksi Klich.          ( See tables.)
      On the flats between Shumish Kul and the other two lakes are a
  considerable number of very large shells of Cardium edule.               These
  shells have special characters, and perhaps form a distinct variety.
  Some of them were found at the bottom of Jaksi Klich and Jaman
  Klich, also in a small dry lagoon, lately separated from the Aral Sea,
  near Alta Kuduk.           As will be hereafter mentioned, similar shells
   were found deposited in great numbers beneath the surface-soil at
     vol. xr,vi.                                                        Q

Abu Kir, in Egypt.     Shells of this type would appear to he in some
manner associated with life in lagoons opening to a sea, as all the
localities in which they occurred were of this type. None were found
at Shumish Kul or in the Aral Sea itself.
                  Cardium edule from Lagoons in Egypt.
  I collected   shells of C. edule from the district of Mareotis and   Abu
Kir   in order to compare them with those of the Aral Sea.
    Abu Kir has now been pnmped dry. In 1888 it was a shallow salt
lake, having an area of about 20 square miles.          In April, 1888, the
specific gravity of the water was l-05.         No living shells were found
in it, but its shores were covered with vast quantities of thin, elon
gated, highly-coloured   shells, closely resembling those of Jaman Klich.
These shells were plainly those which had last lived in the lagoon,
and it may be supposed that they lived in it under conditions not
greatly different from those now prevailing.
    Mareotis. — This is a closed lake lying about 8 feet below the
surface of the Mediterranean.          At the time of my visit, in April,
1888, the density of the water was about the same as that of the
Mediterranean.      It is stated to be brackish at high Nile owing to the
infiltration of fresh water, though in summer it probably becomes
 Salter than the sea.     On its shores I found quantities of shells of
 Cardium edule. There are, apparently, none now living in Mareotis.
The absence of living animals may be due to the annual changes
which the quality of the water of the lake undergoes, but it is more
 likely that they have all been exterminated by some of the engineer
 ing operations which have at various times been made by different
 Governments. The shells found on the shore had definite characters.
 They were elongated shells, moderately thin in texture, having the
 anterior 6 — 10 ribs yellowish-white         in colour, and the portion
 7 — 12 bluish or chocolate-coloured.      The inside of the shells is much
 ribbed ; the posterior part is generally chocolate-coloured, and some
 times this colour extends to the whole interior of the shell.         (For
 particulars of texture and shape, see tables.) The peculiarities in
 colour and shape of these shells are so great that they could not be
 mistaken for those of any other locality.
    Bamleh Lake No. 1. — By the formation of the Mahmudiyeh Canal
  (1819) a small piece of water was cut off from Mareotis near Sidi
  Gaber Station.    This lake is about a mile in diameter. Its water is
 now fresh, and is kept so by the waste water from the irrigations
 which flows into it. It is about 10 — 12 feet deep in the middle.
 Many dead cockle-shells were found in       it,  but no live ones. These
 shells have quite definite characters, being very thick and coarse in
 texture, with 14 — 16 anterior ribs white, and — posterior ribs
                                                     3   6

chocolate colonr. The shells           are very long     in proportion to their
breadth. (See tables.)
     Ramleh Lakes No. 2 and No.        3. — By the  construction of the railway
from Alexandria to Cairo another portion of Mareotis has been cut
off by an embankment, and the lake thus formed was again divided
into two by the second embankment lately made to connect the Cairo
Railway with the Ramleh line. In this way two lakes have been
formed — an eastern (No. 2) and a western (No. 3). Both these lakes
are fresh owing to irrigation- waters.          In No. 3 there are no shells of
Cardium at all, but in No. 2 I found quantities of living specimens.
These fresh-water cockles were in texture like the shells found in
 Ramleh Lake No. 1, but the colour and other features were different.
 The colonr of the outside of the shells is almost uniformly yellowish-
 white, but on the inside the region of the posterior 3 — 6 ribs is
 chocolate colour. The rest of the inside of the shell has the same
 bright white colour which characterises those of Ramleh Lake No. 1.
 The proportion of length to breadth in these shells is very great.
 Another character of these fresh-water shells is the frequent occur
 rence of specimens with the free ventral margins of the valves bent
 inwards.
      Sub-fossil Shells. At Mandara and elsewhere I found considerable
                         —
 deposits of very large, thick shells, like those found occasionally at
 Jaksi Klich in the Aral Sea district. Probably those shells were
  deposited at the time when Abu Kir and Mareotis formed one or more
  large lagoons in communication with the open sea.
                                   Recapitulation.
      The most important feature        of these observations lies in the fact
  that the shells of each sample, whether it be from a separate lake or
  only from a particular level, have special characters, and are mora
  like to each other than to the shells of one of the other lakes or of
  another level.     The next feature of importance is the fact that in the
  four independent cases, Shumish Kul, Jaksi Klich, Jaman Klich, and
   the Egyptian lagoon Abu Kir, the shells which have lived under
   similar conditions, i.e., in very salt water, resemble each other, having
   the characters of thinness, light colour, small beaks, ribbing on the
   inside of the shell, and great relative length. Similarly the shells
  from    the  two isolated   and  independent fresh-water lakes at Hamleh
   also present   similar   characters, viz., thickness,   similar texture, and
   shape.    It may be remarked that the resemblance between the cockle
   shells from an Asiatic lagoon and those from Abu Kir becomes still
   more striking when it is remembered that their immediate ancestry
   is very different.     For the Asiatic shells had been living for many
    generations in the brackish waters of 'the Aral Sea, and had already
                                                                      Q 2

become a       well-marked variety before being subjected to the new
 conditions ; while those which are found in Abn Kir must clearly be
 the immediate descendants of animals of the type found in the
Med iterranean .
    Though the subject cannot be adequately discussed in an abstract,
it may be suggested that in so far as any variation (as, for example,
 that of texture) occurs universally among the shells of a given
 sample, it may be legitimately supposed that they are correlated to
the conditions under which they lived.
    Instances in which it is possible to actually trace the history of
variation under natural conditions are so rare that these observations
of phenomena otherwise unimportant have an increased value.                    The
opportunity given by the terraces of Shumish Kul for the comparison
of several distinct stages in the origin of a natural variation appears
to be almost unique.

Nencki (' Journ. fur Prakt. Chem.' [2], vol. 17, p. 98) soon afterwards

of the putrefaction of albumen.   Later, Salkowski ('Deutsch. Chem.

    by a series of analyses of skatole and its picrate, showed that the
    composition of the substance is expressed by the formula CgH2N, and
    that it might be regarded as the methyl-derivative of indole (CsH7N),
    a compound which is associated with skatole in the faeces, and which
    is also produced during the putrefaction of albumen.        In 1880 von
    Baeyer (' Deutsch. Chem. Gesell. Ber.,' vol. 13, p. 2340) described a
    method of preparing skatole, together with indole, from indigo, which
    was reduced with tin and hydrochloric acid, and the resulting reduc
    tion product distilled with powdered zinc.        Three years later, in
    1883, Otto Fischer and German achieved a synthesis of skatole
    ('Deutsch. Chem. Gesell. Ber.,' vol. 16, p. 710) by heating glycerol
    with a compound of zinc chloride and aniline, C6H7N C;iHs0g =  ¦+¦

    indole, an inference which has since been fully substantiated.

        Neither skatole nor indole has hitherto been observed to occur in
     plants. They have appeared to be characteristic products of the
     bacterial resolution of animal proteid.
        Among the many plants collected by 'the late Daniel Hanbury,
     F.R.S., and now deposited in the Museum of the Pharmaceutical
     Society, there was   a  small specimen of wood to which the Curator,
    Mr. E. M. Holmes, drew my attention on account of       it  intense odour,
    which recalled that of a-naphthylamine.        Since a-naphthylamine has
     not been noticed   asa   plant constituent
                                            I     determined to examine the
    specimen, which was labelled Celtis reticulosa, Java.          It was evi
    dently the wood    of  a large tropical tree.
       In order to be well assured of the identity of the specimen applied
                                                                       I

    greatly indebted to him for the trouble he has taken in ascertaining
    what  is   known on the subject.       Mr. Dyer informs me that " Celtis
    reticulosa was the name given by Miquel to a tree growing in Java.
    Planchon subsequently identified the species with Celtis cinnamomea
    of Lindley (De Candolle's Prodromus,' vol. 17,

(' Euum. of Ceylon Plants,' p. 267). But botanists generally sink it
with the Java species in Celtis cinnamomea.           Thwaites says : ' The
freshly cut timber of the tree possesses a powerful and very disgusting
odour.' I have not come across any other notices of this singular
property.      But the evidence, though indirect, goes to show that your
wood is correctly named and what it professes to be.            Celtis belongs
to the Urticacece."
    The total quantity of the wood        I was able to obtain amounted to
rather less than 200 grams.
    A small quantity of the finely powdered wood was moistened with
 water and distilled with steam. The first fractions of the distillate
contained white particles which dissolved in the larger quantity of
wajber that was subsequently condensed.          The distillate was examined
 for naphthylamine, but none could be detected.
     On submitting to steam distillation a larger quantity of the
 powdered wood, and extracting the aqueous distillate with light
 petroleum, a substance possessing an intolerable odour of faece3 was
 obtained.     It crystallised from water in colourless scaly crystals,
 which were dissolved by ether, alcohol, and benzene.            The aqueous
 solution was not precipitated by a saturated solution of picric acid
 until the liquid had been strongly acidified with hydrochloric acid,
 when a dark red precipitate appeared.          The dilute aqueous solution
 was not colonred or otherwise affected by the addition of fuming
 nitric acid or by a mixture of sodium nitrite and sulphuric acid, neither
 did it colour a pine shaving moistened with hydrochloric acid.              By
 warming     with  hydrochloric    acid the  aqueous  solution   was  coloured
 cherry -red. By these reactions the absence of indole was conclusively
 proved, but it seemed probable that the substance might be an indole-
  derivative.
     The picrate was obtained by precipitating the aqueous solution
  (prepared from the ethereal extract of the distillate) strongly acidified
  with hydrochloric acid, with a saturated solution of picric acid. The
  dark-red precipitate was collected and distilled with dilute ammonia.
  The recovered substance was again converted into the picrate by a
  repetition of the process described above, and this was collected,
  washed with cold water, and dried over sulphuric acid.             The dark-
  red needles of the picrate melted with some decomposition            between
  159 —  161° C.     In a portion of this salt the nitrogen was deter
  mined by Dumas' method, the gas being collected through the limb of
  a Sprengel pump.       [Weight of picrate taken 0'0258 gram ; corrected

     It was thus proved that the substance possesses the composition of

methyl indole. It remained to determine whether it corresponded
with any of the known isomeric methyl indoles. These are Pr-1
methyl indole, which is liquid above —20° C. ; Pr-2 methyl indole
(methyl ketole), which melts at 59° C. ; Pr-3 methyl indole (skatole),
which melts at 93—94° C. (Nencki), 95° C. (E. Fischer), and Bz-3
methyl indole, which melts at 58° C*
    A crystalline specimen of the methyl indole was prepared from the
picrate by distilling it with dilute ammonia.                  The distillate was
extracted with ether, and the residue           left by the evaporation of the
ethereal solution was crystallised from water. These crystals were
observed to melt at 935° C, and were, therefore, identical with Pr-3
methyl indole, the skatole of Brieger. To completely confirm this
conclusion a synthesis of skatole was made from propylidene-phenyl-
hydrazide, and the properties of the synthetical skatole were found
to be identical with those of the skatole from Celtis reticulosa.                  It
was not possible with so small a qnantity of material to estimate
the amount of skatole contained in the wood, but it is extremely
small, and is certainly considerably less than 1 per cent.
    Conflicting statements exist with reference to the odour of skatole.
The skatole from Celtis reticulosa undoubtedly possesses a strong faecal
smell.     Von Baeyer has stated that when pure, skatole has no feecal
odour,    while     Brieger, Emil Fischer, and others assert that it has.
Some curious facts were observed during the course of this investiga
tion which may throw some light on the cause of this divergence of
opinion. It was noticed that the ffecal smell is most marked when
the substance is present in minute quantities. When larger quantities
of the substance are smelt the odour appears to be penetrating, but
more aromatic than fiscal.             It also seems that after repeatedly
smelling the substance the nose becomes insensitive to the effect of
minute quantities and fails to recoguizo the frecal odour.
    It may be useful to refer here to the delicacy of the various
reactions for skatole and indole, since it is often important to
recognise the presence of very small quantities of these substances in
pathological fluids. The formation of the white insoluble nitroso-
derivative from skatole by the action of nitrous acid cannot be

recognised in very dilute solutions, but the production, under the
same conditions, of a reddish colour or precipitate is a sensitive     test
for the presence of indole.
    By far the most delicate reaction for skatole consists    in the deve
lopment of a cherry-red colour when an aqueous solution is warmed
 with a few drops of strong hydrochloric acid. This reaction has been
obtained with very dilute solutions. In moderately dilute solutions,
strongly acidified with hydrochloric acid, a saturated solution of
 picric acid produces a red precipitate of skatole picrate.
    The occurrence of skatole in the vegetable kingdom is of especial
interest, and it is remarkable that the substance should make its
nppearance, or, at any rate, that it should accumulate, at a late period
in the growth of the tree. The absence of indole is also significant.
Sometimes skatole, without indole, is observed to result from the
putrefaction of animal proteid, but usually both indole and skatole
are formed. The occasional absence of indole, as well as the incon
stancy of the relation between the quantities of indole and skatole
formed during proteid putrefaction, has led Salkowski ('Zeits. fur
 Physiol. Chem.,' vol. 8, p. 417) to regard the formation of each of these
substances as due to the intervention of a special ferment, which he
has called the indole ferment and the skatole ferment respectively.
It must be remembered, however, that indole is less stable than
t-katole, and would be less likely to survive the effect of the various
chemical changes which are proceeding during the later stages of putre
faction. Hoppe-Seyler (' Zeits. fur Physiol. Chem.,' vol. 8, p. 214) has
shown that if oxygen is freely supplied to a liquid in which proteid
putrefaction is taking place, neither indole nor skatole is formed.
The superior stability of skatole may possibly explain its survival in
the plant.    It would be interesting .to determine whether indole is
present   in Celtis reticulosa at an earlier stage of its growth, as, for
example, at the period when the skatole first makes its appearance.
   It would also be of the highest biological and chemical interest to
discover if possible the exact source of the skatole in this plant, to
determine whether the vegetable proteid of Celtis reticulosa can be
made to yield skatole by the methods which are known to lead to its
production from animal proteid, or whether the skatole has been
formed from some intermediate substance,           as, for example,     an
amidatcd organic acid.       The synthetical production of skatole from
nitrocumic acid furnishes us with a clue to one possible mode of
formation in the plant.
   This investigation has been conducted in the Research Laboratory
of the Pharmaceutical Society, and my thanks are due to Mr. W. A.
Salter for the assistance he has given me with some of the experi
ments which are recorded in this paper.

                                   Introduction.
   About fifty years ago De La Rive* observed that pure metallic zinc
but slowly enters into reaction with dilute sulphuric acid ; shortly
afterwards Faradayf confirmed this observation in the case of amal
gamated zinc.         In the course of some investigations on the equivalent
of this metal, Ramsay and Reynolds^ failed to obtain any hydrogen
from sulphuric acid and samples of zinc which they had purified by
every possible precaution.            Thus the evolution of hydrogen from
zinc and sulphuric acid depends initially upon the presence of some
third substance, be it an impurity of the acid or of the metal.
    Similarly Russell§ has also observed that metallic silver is slowly
attacked by nitric acid freed from any considerable quantity of
nitrous acid, and that the rate with which the change proceeds de
pends upon the proportion of nitrous acid present.
                     Reactions between Copper and      Nitric Acid.
    The changes which take place when metallic copper is dissolved in
 nitric acid have attracted the attention of a number of investigators ;
 the complexity of these changes and their almost infinite variety pro
 duced by slight variations of the conditions, are evidenced by the
 elaborate researches of Deville,|| Armstrong^ with Acworth and
 Divers.** In the present communication I have the honour of laying
 beforo the Royal Society a short and preliminary account of some
 experiments on the conditions necessary for a reaction to take place
 between metallic copper and nitric acid.

carbonic acid was also passed through the liquid to ensure its perfect
agitation, and thus to remove the products of the reaction from the
immediate vicinity of the metal.
    The nitric acid was made up in considerable quantity at a time by
diluting acid of sp. gr. 1-41 with a suitable proportion of water ; the
specific gravity of the diluted acid was taken by means of a very
delicate pyknometer of the form devised by Sprengel, and the amount
of free acid determined in the same portion by the ordinary process
of acidimetry. The weight of the copper sphere, as also its diameter,
was determined before and after each experiment, which lasted for one
hour; from the diameters the mean area of metallic surface exposed
was calculated ; thus the amount dissolved off per unit area could be
directly determined.
    In some earlier experiments made with a view of ascertaining this
 amount, it was noticed that when the sphere of copper was introduced
 into the acid the evolution of gas did not commence at once, but                        if,
 other conditions remaining the same, the sphere was introduced into
 the acid containing in small quantities the products of the reaction
 of a former experiment, the evolution of gas commenced immediately.
 Further, the amount of copper dissolved per unit area was less in the
 first than in the succeeding experiments, after the products of the
change had been allowed to accumulate in the acid.           This will be
 rendered more evident by the figures given in the table below, the
 first two columns of which contain the weights of two copper spheres
 A and   B (placed alternately in the acid) before and after each experi
 ment, the third the differences between these two numbers, the fourth
 the mean area in square millimetres, and the fifth the amounts
 dissolved off per unit area expressed as decimilligrams per square
 millimetre surface, written for the sake of brevity M/A. In this and
all succeeding experiments        a   long-range thermometer         was used.

    It will be manifest from the above table that the values for the
amount dissolved off per unit area on the first two experiments are
concordant among themselves, as also are those of the succeeding
experiments, but that those of the former are lower than those of the
latter.
    When copper is dissolved in nitric acid, the substance more imme
diately evident to the senses is cupric or cuprous nitrate or nitrite, or
possibly a mixture of some of them ; at first               I  was inclined to the
 belief that the copper salt was the third substance which induced the
 reaction between the metal and the nitric acid to start at ouce.
 Indeed, at a meeting of the Chemical Society I expressed this opinion
 in the course of a debate.
    It was found subsequently that the dilute nitric acid used in the
above experiments contained a small trace of nitrous acid.                   Accord
ingly a sample of nitric acid of sp. gr. 1-41 was freed from nitrous
acid by passing a rapid stream of air through it at a temperature not
exceeding 35° C. ; during the process the acid was protected from
direct sunlight.         If the temperature rose to 40" C., or the acid was

  not properly sheltered, nitrons acid was formed by the decomposition
  of the nitric acid at a rate faster than that at which it was oxidised
 by the air current.           The acid was subsequently diluted with the
  reqnired quantity of water and preserved in a dark cupboard.                 When
 3 —  4  c.c. of this diluted acid were mixed       with   about   100 c.c. of water!
 no blue colour was produced on addition of starch and potassium
 iodide solutions, and the faintest possible orange tinge imparted to an
 aqueous solution of meta-phenylene diamine hydrochloride.                  The arid
  was thus free from any considerable trace of nitrous acid.                  Experi
  ments similar to the above were repeated, but the current of carbonic
  acid omitted,    in order to more precisely fix the conditions.
     After introduction of a copper sphere there was no evolution of
  gas   for three minutes, and five minutes after the reaction had set in
  a considerable    quantity of nitrous acid was shown to be present.             As
 regards the production of nitrous from nitric acid under these con
  ditions, Professor Armstrong writes, in a note appended to a paper by
  Dr. Divers :* " With reference to the formation of N204 during the dis
                             ....

 that it is produced

                                          and there is, I believe, no doubt that,
                                  the reducing agent, be it hydrogen or metal,
              .  the primary product of the reduction of nitric acid is
 nitrous acid."         This observation, made some time ago, is amply
 confirmed by the above and succeeding experiments.                         I  would,
 therefore, merely wish to call attention to the short interval of time
 which elapses between the commencement of the reaction and the
 formation in considerable quantities of nitrous acid. Again, when
 the copper sphere was introduced into the acid containing the copper
 salt and the nitrous acid, the evolution of gas commenced at ouce.
     In another experiment, in which the copper sphere was previously
 heated and then allowed to cool in a current of hydrogen to remove
any superficial coating of cupric or cuprous oxide, no gas was evolved
 for 1' 50" after the introduction of the sphere into the acid, and
4' 30" after the reaction had set in an abundance of nitrous acid was
 shown to be present.
     At this point, Mr. Harcourt, from a recollection of some experi
ments by the late Sir Benjamin Brodie, suggested to me to place into
the acid a substance which should remove the nitrous acid as fast as
it might be formed ; urea fulfils this requirement, in that it reacts
immediately with nitrous acid to form nitrogen and carbonic acid,
according to the equation
                 CO(NH2)3        +  2HN03 = C03 + 2N3 + 311,0.
    Accordingly, 1 gram of urea, dissolved in 1 c.c. of water, was
added to a litre of nitric acid (sp. gr. \% = T1662, percentage of
                      *  '

copper   nitrate (prepared   by dissolving     a few  of   the  discarded    copper
spheres in dilute nitric acid, evaporating the solution over the water-
bath, and twice recrystallising from water). At a temperature of
25° C. no gas was evolved for 2' after insertion of the copper sphere;
it was then taken out, the liquid agitated mechanically, and the sphere
again introduced ; no gas was evolved for 2' 50".              A further quantity
of 2 grams urea, dissolved       in 2  c.c.  water,  was     introduced and the
experiment    repeated ; no  gas  was  evolved     for  7'  30".     These experi
ments show that even in the presence of a small quantity of copper
nitrate the addition of comparatively small proportions of urea will
temporarily prevent the solution of the copper.            It also appeared that
when once the reaction had set in it could not be stopped, even though
there was present in the acid more than sufficient urea to destroy the
nitrous acid which might have been formed.               For after agitation of
the liquid the copper was again unattacked by the acid.               If, then, the
apparently purely    local formation   of   nitrous  acid     could  be prevented,
it might bo possible to prevent also any reaction between the copper
and nitric acid from taking place.
    To test this point, 1 gram of urea dissolved in I c.c. of water was
added to a litre of nitric acid taken from the same sample as that used
in the preceding experiments.       The little glass dish was more quickly
rotated by means of    the  machine,  and a very rapid current of carbonic
acid passed in, so that the whole liquid was kept in violent agitation.
The copper sphere was introduced, the acid being heated to 25° C.
During an interval of one hour no gas was evolved, no blue colour
imparted to the acid, no alteration of the metallic surface apparent,
and the loss in weight experienced was only 0'002o gram.                  Whereas,
if all other conditions had remained the same, except that the nitrous
acid had been initially present and had been allowed to accumulate,
the loss of weight from a sphere exposing a surface of 256'85 mm.
would have been about 0'3 gram (calculated from the results given in
Table I, the conditions of the experiments in. the two cases being
practically identical).     This experiment might doubtless have been
allowed to proceed for a longer time with the same result.
    It shows, I believe, that pure copper will not dissolve in pure dilute
nitric acid, for though the proportion of nitric acid to that of urea
present was, under these conditions, 272-5 : 1, yet the small quantity
of the latter was sufficient to completely stop the reaction.                It also
appears that the dissolution of copper in nitric acid is dependent
 solely upon the local production of nitrous acid, effected probably
by local electric circuits due to traces of impurities in the copper ;
 the proportion of nitrous acid initially produced is possibly also
 increased by a local rise of temperature.             As regards this point
 Dr. Russell writes (loc. cit.) : "The nitrous acid attacks the silver,

1889.]            Reaction  between  Copper and  Nitric Acid.            221
forming silver nitrite,       nitric oxide,  and  water, the  nitric   oxide
thus formed reducing hydric nitrate, and forming more                nitrons
acid.       Thus the action gets quicker and quicker.      The point still
remaining to he explained is, then, how the first trace of nitrous
acid is formed."          My experiments, mutatis mutandis, are quite
in accord with these observations. To test the matter further, the
temperature of the same sample of acid was raised to 30c C, other
experiments having shown that the amount of copper dissolved off
per unit area is doubled for every 4° C. No gas was evolved for 4'
 after the introduction of the copper sphere, it was then taken out,
 and again introduced, and again no gas was evolved for 4'.        The loss
 in weight after the 8' insertion was only 00025 gram, whereas it
 was calculated that the amount dissolved off during the interval of
 time, supposing the urea to have been absent, would have been
 0'll    gram.
     Into the same liquid a further quantity of 2 grams urea dissolved in
 2 c.c. of water was added ; the acid was heated to 28 — 28'2° C, no gas
 was evolved for 18' ; then as the supply of carbonic acid accidentally
  failed, the evolution of gas from the copper started ; the loss of
 weight observed was 0-0015 gram, a quantity which might well have
 been dissolved off during the interval of time which elapsed between
 the commencement of the reaction and the removal of the sphere
 from the acid.       During the experiment it was interesting to observe
 from time to time the formation of a bubble of gas on the metallic
 surface, which was brushed off by the rotation of the glass dish
 or the stream of carbonic acid, and consequently any further reaction
 stopped.
     As   a  further confirmation another sample of acid was made up,
 containing a slightly greater proportion of free acid, viz., 282 per
 cent., sp. gr. -fl = 1'1723 ; a larger sphere was taken presenting an
 area of 322-38 sq. mm.
     The acid was heated to 27° C. ; and 2 grams urea dissolved in
 2 c.c. water were added.       No gas was evolved for 50', and the loss of
 weight observed was only 0-0015 gram.
     Several other similar experiments have been made with similar
 results, which, however, it is not considered necessary to quote.
     The conclusions which I venture to think may fairly be drawn
 from the observations herein described are : —
     (1.) The view of Professor Armstrong is corroborated that the
 primary product of the reduction of nitric acid by copper is nitrous
acid ; the latter is formed immediately after any chemical change
has taken place.
     (ii.) If this initial formation of nitrous acid be prevented by suit
able means copper by itself will not dissolve in dilute nitric acid by
itself.

      It would follow that the production of nitric and nitrons oxides
   with nitrogen, in proportions varying according to the conditions, is
  due to subsequent changes occurring between nitrous acid and cupric
  or cuprous nitrate or nitrite in presence of nitric acid.
     I propose to continue these researches, substituting other metals
  for copper, especially those which are supposed to yield primarily
  nitrous acid.
     In conclusion, I would express my thanks to Mr. Vernon Harcourt
  for the suggestion which proved of so much value, and to the
  authorities of the University for affording me facilities for this
  investigation.

 VI. " Notes      on the Absorption-Spectra of Oxygen and some of
        its Compounds." By G. D. Liteixg, M.A., F.R.S., Professor
        of Chemistry, and J. Dewar, M.A., F.R.S., Jacksouian
        Professor, University of Cambridge.            Received May 23,
        1889.
     The absorption-spectrum of oxygen has engaged attention not only
 on account of the important part which that element plays in the
 world, but because of the remarkable character of that absorption, so
 strongly marked, exhibiting bands of two essentially different classes,
 and extremely variable under varying circumstances of condensation
 and combination.
    It may be expected that the study of it will reveal something new
 as to the nature of the molecular changes brought about by different
 circumstances, physical and chemical.
    We have already published notes of some of our experiments on
this subject ('Phil. Mag.,' September,          1888), and these confirm
generally    the  observations of Egoroff, Janssen,  and Olszewski.
    The accompanying diagram represents the absorption of 18 metres
of ordinary oxygen gas at a pressure of about 97 atmospheres,
that is, of a mass of oxygen rather greater than is contained
in a vertical column of equal section of the earth's atmosphere.
Under the circumstances of the experiment the absorptions A and B
are very black, and the lines of which they are composed appear much
broader than in the ordinary solar spectrnm.          The other bands are
all diffuse at their edges, and,   so far  as we  have  observed, unresolv-
able into lines. It will be noted that the complete absorption of the

ultra-violet rajs does not extend quite so far down as the limit of the
solar spectrum, though it approaches that limit. There is a diffuse
edge of gradually diminishing absorption succeeding the complete
absorption, and this fact, together with the rapid diminution of the
extent of the complete absorption with decrease of pressure, lead us
to class this absorption of the extreme rajs with the diffuse bands,
which, according to Janssen, increase in intensity as the square of the
density of the gas. If that be so, it is unlikely that the limit of the
solar spectrum is due to the absorption of ordinary oxygen.           For
though    we   may suppose interplanetary space     to  be  pervaded by
materials similar to our atmosphere, yet they must be in such a state
of tenuity that, although they may to some extent reinforce A and B,
they will not add sensibly to the strength of the diffuse bands.
Moreover, these bands, though identical in position, so far as the blue
and less refrangible part of the spectrum is concerned, with bands
observed by Brewster and others in the solar spectrum, are seen much
more strongly through our tnbes of compressed oxygen than they
appear in the solar spectrum with a low sun.      The ultra-violet bands,
of which the one near N appears in our photographs nearly as strong
as the band just above F, and that in the indigo, have not, so far as
we are aware, been noticed in the solar spectrum.          Probably they
would appear if photographs were taken with small dispersion when
the sun was low.
   As the pressure in the tube diminished, the bands rapidly faded ;
that in the indigo, with an oscillation- frequency or wave- number
about 2240, was the first to disappear, then those near L and O and
that near E. At the same time the limit of the transmitted ultra
violet light advanced from an oscillation-frequency of about 3575 at
97 atmospheres, to 3710 at 50 atmospheres and 3848 at 23 atmo
spheres.    At 20 atmospheres the three bands above C, D, and F,
respectively, were still visible, though faint. B remained visible until
the pressure was reduced to 2 atmospheres, and A could still be seen,
but with difficulty, when the pressure of the 18 metres of oxygen was
reduced to   1 atmosphere.
   When atmospheric air was substituted for oxygen we found that
7 atmospheres    was the limit of pressure at which we could certainly
distinguish A, and 18 atmospheres the limit at which we could see B.
It is a difficult matter to say exactly when an absorption becomes
invisible, but the observations on air were made under the same cir
cumstances as those on oxygen, and the two sets of observations were
fairly comparable. With air at 75 atmospheres the three bands above
C, D, and F, respectively, could all be seen, but that near C only
with difficulty. The mass of oxygen and its partial pressure in the
tube was in this case less by about one quarter thaw that which was
required to bring out the bands when oxygen alone was used. The

1889.]     Absorption- Spectra of Oxygen and its Compounds.           225
cause of this may be that the development of the diffuse bands
depends in some degree on the total pressure of the air, and not only
on the partial pressure of the oxygen in it.
   The mass of oxygen which when unmixed with nitrogen made
A visible would correspond to that in the tube filled with air nt
5 atmospheres, and that which made B visible would correspond to air
at 10 atmospheres.      The differences between these pressures and those
which are actually needed to render A and B visible seem too great
to be ascribed to errors of observation, and seem to indicate that the
addition of the nitrogen has some effect on the absorptive action of
the oxygen.      On the other hand, Egoroff found that he could still
distinguish   A   when the thickness of air at ordinary pressure was
reduced to 80 metres ('Compt. Rend.,' vol. 101, p. 1144).            This
amount of air corresponds to rather less oxygen than our tube would
hold at a pressure of 1 atmosphere.         Differences in the sources of
light,  in the  spectroscope, and the observers, would, however, count
for a good deal in observations of this kind.
   In order to try the influence of temperature on the absorption, the
shorter of our experimental tubes, 165 cm. long, was surrounded
by a jacket filled with a mixture of solid carbonic anhydride and
ether, which was rapidly evaporated by means of a large air-pump.
By this means the temperature would be reduced to —100°. The
absorption of oxygen at several different pressures up to 104 atmo
spheres was observed through the cooled tube. We were not, however,
able to detect any increase of intensity, or other change, in the
absorptions which could be ascribed to the cooling. To try the effect
of an increase of temperature, the 18-metre tube was surrounded by a
jacket and heated up to 100° by steam.       Heating appeared to render
the diffuse bands rather more diffuse and less distinct.    On the whole
the influence of a change of temperature of 100° either way is
slight.
   We have observed repeatedly the absorption of liquid oxygen in
thicknesses    of 8 and 12 mm. Our observations confirm those of
Olszewski.     8 mm.    of liquid oxygen gives plainly the three diffuse
bands above C,     D,  and F, respectively.  With a thickness of 12 mm.
we were not able to detect any more.
   We observed the absorption produced by liquid oxygen on the one
hand when it was cooled by its own evaporation until the tension of
its vapour was only equal to that of the atmosphere, that is, to a
temperature of —181°, according to Olszewski, and also when the
temperature of the liquid was allowed to rise under pressure up to
nearly the critical temperature.     There appeared to be no appreciable
difference in the absorption under these different circumstances when
the oxygen was completely liquid, when it was near its critical
temperature, and when it was completely gaseous ; so far at least as
                                                                e 2

concerns    the three principal  bands, which were all that could be
seen in the light transmitted by the liquid in a thickness of 12 mm.
   It will ba observed that taking the density of oxygen at — 181-4°
to be 1-124, as given by Olszewski, 12 mm. of the liquid would be
equivalent to 9-37 metres of the gas at atmospheric pressure — hardly
more than half the thickness required to make A visible.       The expe
riments, therefore, point to the conclusion that gaseous and liquid
oxygen have the same absorption -spectrum.        This is a very note
worthy conclusion.     For, considering that no compound of oxygen,
so far as is known, gives the absorptions of oxygen, the persistency
of the absorptions of oxygen through the stages of condensation to
the state of complete liquidity implies a persistency of molecular
constitution which we should hardly have expected.
   In order to compare the absorption.of ozone with that of oxygen
we employed a tube 12 feet long, made of tiuplate fitted with glass
ends and coated with paraffin on the inside. We could not use the
18 m. steel tube on account of the action of the ozone on the metal
which rapidly reduced the proportion of ozone, and also because we
could not conveniently cool it. Ozonised oxygen was passed into the
tin tube for some time, while the ozoniser and the tube itself were
cooled with ice and salt.     The lime-light, viewed through the tube,
looked very blue, and also the spot of light thrown from the tube on
to a sheet of white paper was equally blue, indicating a considerable
absorption of the less refrangible part of the spectrum.     The absorp
tion, so far as the visible rays are concerned, appeared to be of a
general character, for the [spectroscope revealed only four extremely
faint absorption-bands. The centres of these bands were at about
the wave-numbers 1662, 1752, 1880, and 1990, and their positions
with reference to the bands of oxygen are indicated in the diagram.
 They were so faint as to be seen only with difficulty. When the
hot carbon of an arc lamp was substituted for the lime-light they
were rather more distinct, but the positions of the edges were un-
 definable.   The light of a gas-lamp was insufficient to show them,
 and they were no better seen with a single-prism spectroscope of
 low dispersive power than with the spectroscope we employed for
observing the oxygen.      Only one of these bands, it will be seen from
 the diagram, is nearly coincident with an oxygen-band, namely, that
near E, the faintest of the oxygen-bands.        That at wave-number
 1752 overlaps the strongest oxygen-band, but not at its strongest
part, and has none of the peculiar character of its shading, abruptly
increasing on the less refrangible side and slowly decreasing on the
other side.     Photographs of the spectrum (taken through a tube
with quartz ends) showed that the ozone absorbed all the rays above
the wave-number 3086 — a point between Q and R — while partial
absorption extended below Q. We may say, therefore, that we Can

1889.]      Absorption-Spectra   of Oxygen and its Compounds.          227
trace no identity     between   the absorptions of ozone and those of
ordinary oxygen.       There is no mere displacement of the bands, such
as we sometimes get when a coloured substance is dissolved in
different menstrua, nor any such a resemblance as we have between
the absorption-bands of the different cobaltous salts derived from
different acids.
     Xhe four bands which we see to be produoed by ozonised oxygen
correspond fairly with the 2nd, 3rd, oth, and 6th of the bands
 described by Chappuis as due to ozone (' Annales de l'ficole Normale,'
 2nd ser., vol. 11, May, 1882).    These four bands, lie says, are the tirst
 to be seen. We have failed to perceive any others with the 3-66 m.
 tube, though the oxygen was highly ozonised and maintained at a low
 temperature.     None of the bands were of sufficient intensity to make
 themselves visible on our photographic plates.
     It will be noted that the absorption by ozone extends far below the
 limit of the solar spectrum.     We found, however, that by diminish
  ing the proportion of ozone to oxygen in the tube the limit of the
 transmitted light was continually advanced, as already described by
 Hartley.     The limit of the solar spectrum may, therefore, very well
 be determined by the average amount of ozone in the atmosphere, as
  Hartley supposes.     The known variations in the limit of the solar
 spectrum may be taken as confirmatory of this hypothesis, although
 the comparatively small amount of those variations is certainly less
  than we should have expected if they measure the changes in the
  proportion of ozone in the atmosphere.
     The absorptions of the class to which A and B belong must be
  those which are most easily assumed by the diatomic molecules (O2)
  of ordinary oxygen.     Whether oxygen in more complex molecules, as
  in ozone (08), may be capable of taking up the corresponding vibra
  tions cannot easily be determined because we cannot isolate ozone ;
  but since none of the compounds     of oxygen with nitrogen, hydrogen
  or carbon, or, so far as known, with any other element, exhibit these
  absorptions, it is very probable that they are peculiar to the molecule
   O2.  From this point of view it will be interesting to determine — as
   we hope to do shortly — whether liquefied oxygen, which we suppose
  to have more complex molecules, produces these absorptions.           The
  corresponding spectrum of emission has not as yet been          observed,
  probably because the agency employed to render the gas luminous
  breaks up the molecules into single atoms of oxygen.
     As for the other class of absorption, the diffuse bands, since they
  appear to have intensities proportional to the square of the density of
  the gas, they must depend on a change produced by compression.
  This may eith<?T be the formation of more complex molecules, as for

molecules    are  subject during their encounters with one another.
Increase of temperature would affect the former, tending to diminish
the number of complex molecules formed at a given pressure, but
would have no effect on the latter, for though the number of
encounters of the molecules in a given interval of time would be
greater the higher the temperature, yet so long as the volume was
unaltered the ratio of the duration of an encounter to that of free
motion would be sensibly unaltered. So far as any change due to
temperature has been observed, it is that a rise of temperature slightly
weakens the diffuse absorptions.
   Reverting to the compounds of oxygen, none of them show the ab
sorptions of oxygen, not even the general absorption of the ultra-violet
rays. Some of them, such as water and carbon dioxide, appear quite
transparent to ultra-violet rays, while in others, such as nitrous oxide,
which show a general absorption of the ultra-violet rays, the limit of
transparency is different from that of oxygen.     In other respects we
may say that there is no resemblance between the absorptions of the
compounds of oxygen and those due to oxygen itself. Some of the
former have very definite and characteristic absorptions, such as the
well-known spectra of the peroxides of nitrogen and chlorine, and
we must regard these as indicating the rates of vibration which the
molecules NO2 and CIO2 respectively are capable of easily taking up.
The absence of the absorptions due to oxygen from all compounds of
oxygen seems to indicate either that chemical combination is not, as
has been supposed by some chemists, a temporary relation in which
the molecular groupings are continually breaking up, to be formed
anew with ever-changing elementary atoms ; or, that the periods of
dissociation are very small compared with the periods of association.
For otherwise we should expect that such componnds of oxygen as
 CO2 and NO2 must always have amongst their molecules some mole
cules identical with those of oxygen and capable of taking up vibra
tions of the same period.       At least we must conclude that little, if
any,  of the   oxygen of  these  and other compounds is ever out of the
influence of the other components.
   We have re-examined the absorption-spectrum of N204 at various
temperatures, and agree to the conclusion of Bell ('Amer. Chem.
Journ.,' vol. 7, p. 32) that N20, whether liquid or gaseous, effects
only a general absorption at either end of the spectrum, and that the
selective absorptions observed with it are due to the presence of
NO2.
   In order   to obtain pure N20*, the tube in which the liquid was
sealed was placed in a freezing mixture, and a large part of the
liquid frozen ; the remaining liquid was then drained as completely
as possible into the other end of the tube, and sealed off.
   It should be observed that the crystals of N20* appear      colourless,

and that when they are melted the liquid and superincumbent vapour
are of a very pale yellow colour. As the temperature rises both liquid
and vapour become, as is well known, of a deep orange, and finally of
a  dark, reddish-brown colour.     We examined the spectra produced by
two thicknesses   of liquid and vapour — (1) by that contained in a narrow
tnbe about 1 mm. in diameter, and (2) by that in a tube about 1 cm. in
diameter. At 15° to 20° the vapour in the narrow as well as in the wider
tube showed the well-known absorption-spectrum of fine, dark lines ;
no absorption by the liquid in the narrow tube could be detected,
and the liquid in the wide tube showed no fine lines, but several
faint, very diffuse bands, unresolvable into lines with a spectroscope
of three prisms. These bands had their maxima in places where the fine
lines of the vapour were most intense and most closely set, so that it
might be inferred that they were due to similar molecules in both
cases, but that in the liquid the vibrations of these molecules were no
longer sharply defined but modified by the constraint arising from the
liquid state. Some parts, however, of the spectrum of the vapour,
 where the lines were closely set, did not appear to be represented by
 any definite bands in the liquid.     The liquid absorbed a good deal of
blue light in a continuous manner, while the vapour only absorbed
 it selectively.  At the red end the limit of the visible spectrum was
 lower for the liquid than for the gas, that   is,
                                                 there was more absorption
 of red light by the vapour than by the liquid, so much so that below
a   certain point the absorption by the vapour appeared continuous.
    The narrow tube was next immersed in wider tube full of glycerine,
                                             a
 which was gradually heated.      As the temperature rose, the colour of
  both liquid and vapour deepened, the absorptions of the vapour were
 stronger, and the liquid gave the same bands as had been before ob
 served with the greater thickness.      At still higher temperature the
 absorption of blue light, both by liquid and vapour, diminished sensibly,
 until at 85° the groups of lines in the blue had pretty well disappeared
 from the spectrum of the vapour. In fact, at 85° there was no sensi
 ble difference between the actions of liquid and vapour on blue light,
it   seemed only some continuous absorption.          At the red end the
difference between the liquid and vapour remained quite as strongly
marked as at lower temperatures,    anything, more so and the ab
                                       if                   ;
sorptions in the orange, yellow, and green were unaltered. At 90° the
lines of the vapour in the green began to fade, and at 100° they were
very faint   but those in the orange, as well as the corresponding
               ;
diffuse bands in the liquid, were as strong as before. There was still
considerably        more absorption of red light by the vapour than by the
liquid,   as   if   there were a strong absorption-band in the red of the
vapour which was absent in the liquid.
  As the temperature rose to 110° all the lines        in the vapour had
become faint, and at 115° they were no longer discernible, and there

was no difference between the spectra of   liquid and vapour except in the
red, and even here the difference was less marked than at lower tem
peratures.    At 130° no distinction was observable between the spectra
of liquid and vaponr, there were no lines or bands in either, but a good
deal of general absorption. Liquid and vapour were dark, and ap
peared much of a colour, but the meniscus at the junction was quite
evident.   The tube was further heated to 155°, but no further change
was noticed in the spectrum.      On gradually cooling the tube, at 112°
the least refrangible band in the orange was seen coming in both in
vapour and liquid, diffuse in both. At 100° the usual lines were well
seen in the orange, yellow, and citron of the vapour, faint lines in the
green, and none in the bine ; and subsequently the appearances pre
sented on heating followed in the reverse order.
   A solution of N204 in carbon bisulphide gave, in a thickness of
7 or 8 cm., diffuse absorption-bands in the green and citron, ill-defined
as in liquid N204 and in corresponding positions.         In a thickness of
1 cm. these bands were no longer visible.
   These observations bear out the supposition that puro N204 is
without selective absorption of the visible rays, and that the absorp
tion observed is due to NO2, both in the vapour and liquid, this
absorption being modified in the liquid by the state of solution in
which the molecules have much less freedom. As the temperature
rises the proportion of NO2 increases, and at the same time the density
of the vapour increases and the freedom of motion of the molecules is
diminished, they are less able to assume the more rapid vibrations,
and those which they do assume become less sharply defined, so that
the lines fade into bands and ultimately into a general absorption.

      Uranus.  — In  1871    I had    the honour to communicate to the Royal
 Society an account of the examination of the visible spectrum of
 Uranus.* The visible spectrum of this planet is remarkable, as it is
 seen to be crossed by several strong lines of absorption.              Six of these
 dark bands are shown in a diagram which accompanies the paper, and
 their approximate positions in the spectrum are given. The spaces
 between the dark bands appear bright by contrast, and might suggest at
 first sight bright bands.          I was unable to use a slit sufficiently narrow
 to enable me to determine whether the bright parts of the spectrum
 contain the Fraunhofer lines, which would be the case if Uranus,
 like the other planets, shines by reflected solar light.
     The spectrum of this planet was carefully examined in 1872 by
 Vogel,f whose results are in accordance with my earlier ones. He
 observed some fainter lines or bands, in addition to those given in my
 paper.      Vogel was unable to obtain evidence of the Fraunhofer lines.
His observations agree with mine in placing a dark band at the
position of F in the solar spectrum.             J
     In consequence of the Fraunhofer lines not having been seen, a
presumption has arisen that Uranus may shine, in part at least, by
emitted light.
     It appeared to me that this question might be answered by
photography. With an exposure of two hours, I obtained on June 8
a photograph of the spectrum of the planet from a little above F to
beyond N in the ultra-violet.              A pair of sky spectra, one on each side
of the planet's spectrum, were taken on the same plate.
    The spectrnm of Uranus, though fainter, shows all the chief
Fraunhofer lines seen in the comparison spectra, and is clearly solar.
I  have not been able to detect any indications of bright lines, nor of
any strong bands or groups of absorption, such as those in its spectrum
from F to C.
    There can be no doubt that the spectrum of Uranus, at least,
from a little above F to. beyond N in the ultra-violet, is due to
reflected solar light.          I  have not yet been able to re-examine the
visible spectrum of the planet.

visible spectrum of this planet and its rings. In my paper on the
" Photographic Spectra of Stars,"*                 I
                                             described the photographic
spectra  of Venus,   Jupiter, and  Mars.     About a year later I took a
photograph of the spectrum of Saturn and his rings, but as it did not
present any new features, but was purely solar,                  I
                                                      have not given any
description of it.
   The favourable position of Saturn this year for obtaining a photo
graph in which the spectra of the ansee of the rings could be seen
distinct from the spectrum of the ball and of the part of the ring
crossing it, determined me to take some photographs of the planet
and its rings.
I    have adopted the plan described in 1880, in which the planet                     is
photographed while the sky        sufficiently bright to give a faint day
                                    is
light spectrum on the plate. Any additional lines or other modifica
tions of solar light due to the planet's atmosphere can in this way
be  easily detected.
   In the photographs taken this year the slit was so placed upon
Saturn that the spectrum consists of three distinct parts, the middle
part being formed by the light from the ball, and the part of the
ring across it,and on both sides of this spectrum the spectra of the ansa?.
The planet was kept upon the same part of the slit with sufficient
exactness to keep these three spectra distinct, and from encroaching
upon each other, and therefore       any difference existed between them
                                        if
it could be detected.
   The exact correspondence of the Fraunhofer lines in the spectrum
of the planet and its rings with those of the sky spectrum           clearly is
shown, but I    am unable now, as       was in 1881, to detect any lines,

dark or bright, other than those which are also present in the sky
spectra.    The spectrum on the plate extends from        little above

I    am trying to obtain enlargements of the spectra of Saturn and
Uranus to serve as illustrations to this note.     If they can be done so
as to admit of reproduction,      will do myself the honour to present

them to the Royal Society.

unfavourable conditions, the planet being low and the sky not dark.
These observations confirm me strongly in the opinion       formed in    I
1871 that the brighter parts of the spectrum appear so as an effect of
contrast, and do not represent emitted light.     In the moments of
best vision the spectrum on both sides of the brighter parts appeared
to be darkened by groups of lines which give a heightened effect by
contrast to the less obscured parts between them.

                            Properties of Vulcanised India-rubber."
      By A. Mallock. Communicated by Lord Rayleigh, Sec.
      R.S. Received May 9, 1889.
   Considering the wide use now made of india-rubber, it seems curious
that the elastic constants which define its properties should not be as
well known as the corresponding quantities for iron or brass.
   The only published quantitative measure, however, with which
I  am acquainted, relating to the subject, is contained in a paragraph
of Thomson and Tait's ' Natural Philosophy ' (p. 230, Part II, New
Edition), where the resilience of vulcanised india-rubber, i.e., the
amount of work restored by the substance when allowed to return to
its equilibrium form, after having been stretched to a maximum short
of rupture, is stated to be equivalent to its own weight raised through
1200 metres.
   In 1885 I made some measures of the value of Young's modulus
for india-rubber, and also examined the effect of continued strain on
the material, but at that time I was not aware how much different
kinds of india-rubber differed from one another in these respects, and
the experiments were made on one kind of vulcanised rubber only,
namely, a soft grey sort, which when cut, shows small spots of a
yellowish-grey scattered throughout its substance.          This year   I
resumed the experiments, using specimens of three different kinds of
vulcanised india-rubber made at Silvertown.         The specimens were
cut from a sheet half an inch thick, and were square in section, and
one foot long.
   One was a soft grey kind, apparently identical in properties with
that experimented on in 1885. The next was the well-known red sort,
and the third a dark grey, much harder and stiffer than the two
former.
   On these specimens experiments were made to determine the three
elastic constants, viz., Young's modulus, the simple rigidity, and
volume elasticity.    The apparent viscosity was also measured, and
the behaviour of the materials under great strains, and strains con
tinued for long periods, observed.
   Young's modulus and the simple rigidity were each measured in
two ways, statically and dynamically.         The statical measurements
being made by observing the extension and angle of torsion produced
by a known force and moment ; while for the dynamical measures the

234                      Mr. A. Mallock.               The Physical         [June   6,
frequencies were noted of the vibrations which the respective elas
ticities produced when acting on a known mass and moment of
inertia.
   As might be expected, the values obtained in these two ways do
not agree, those given by the dynamical method being in all cases
greater than the statical values.
   The volume of elasticity can be deduced from the values of Young's
modulus and the simple rigidity by the equation
                                                '6q   — 9n
where k    is   the volume elasticity,      q   Young's modulus, and n the simple
rigidity.
   But since  k for india-rubber      very large,
                                           is          very nearly equal
                                                              q   is
to 3n, and the measures of      and n must be very accurate to make this
                                       q
formula of any use. The volume elasticity, therefore, was determined
by direct measurement.
   The mean values deduced from all the experiments are given in the
table at the end of the paper.     The values in this table refer to small
strains.
   When the extensions and distortions are large the values of the
constants alter enormously, and the results are exhibited better by
diagrams than numerically.
   One property possessed by india-rubber, and to which part of the
difference between the dynamic and static values of the elasticities                is
due,  is that when strained by a given force, the extension due to the
force increases gradually, rapidly at first, and then more and more
slowly for many days. The difference between the extension at the
first moment after the application of the force and the limit to which
the extension tends        proportional to the extension, and the rate
                              is
at which the extension takes place an exponential function of the
time elapsed since the application of the force.
   When the force        removed, the contraction takes place gradually
                          is
in the same way, bnt not at the same rate, the constant multiplying
the time in the exponent being different in the two cases.          On the
other hand,        the extension, not the force,
                  if                                    given,   the
                                                                  is  force
diminishes according to an exponential law as the time elapsed since
the extension increases      and   ;  the extension be quickly reduced,
                                           if
until the force     nothing, and then maintained constaut, a contractile

amount due to difference between the length the moment after reduc
tion and the natural length.
   The material appears, in fact, to take a subpermanent set, which
ultimately becomes      definite fraction of the extension to which
                          a                                                    it   is

   Diagrams   I  and II  illustrate these properties, which are probably
 possessed to  a  very  miirato   degree by many substances usually con
sidered perfectly elastic.
   From these diagrams it will be seen that the two elastic constants,
viz., Young's modulus and the rigidity, are not completely defined
unless the time is given for which the force calling them into play
acts.
   Another property of india-rubber, especially conspicuous in the soft
grey kind, is that when stretched to a certain point the resistance to

suggest that the     structure   of the material brings some sort of
mechanical stop into action.      See Diagram III.

    Several mechanical mixtures such as putty (chalk and oil), damp
 clay, and sand and water exhibit similar properties. If a lump of
 putty be well rolled or beaten it will be found to be slightly elastic,
 but beyond the elastic limit to be easily stretched for a certain distance
 and then to become almost hard, at the same time the appearance of
 the surface changes from a smooth, oily character to a dull granular
one.
    The explanation in this case is that the hard particles of the mix
 ture are, in its undisturbed state, separated each from its neighbours
 by a wall of fluid of finite thickness. When the material is distorted

the particles separate from one another in one direction and approach
one another in a direction at right angles to this.     As long as this
approach merely involves the flow of the intervening fluid, the dis
tortion takes place with comparative ease ; but when the approach of
the particles brings them into actual contact with one another, the
conditions change.     There is no longer a store of fluid between, say,
the vertical layers of particles which can be drawn on to supply the
 increased distance between the horizontal layers, and if the strain is
augmented it must imply either a distortion of the hard particles
themselves or an increase of volume of the whole mass.
    The latter is what happens in the cases just mentioned, the dull
surface being the result of the fluid being sucked or rather pushed
inwards by atmospheric pressure to supply the extra volume required
in the interior, thus leaving the surface comparatively dry.
    The dry patch which is seen for a short time to surround fresh
footsteps on some kinds of wet sand, is an example of the same kind
of action.

given in the table were obtained.
                (1.) Statical Measure of Young's Modulus.

    Two very fine pins P, P' (fig. 2), were fixed in the india-rubber at a

from the hole, was then placed against the india-rubber with the pin
P' passing through the hole ; thus, when unstrained, the pin P was
exactly on the same level as M ; when the india-rubber was strained

   The lowest values for q are those given by experiments in which
the stretching force acted for the longest time.
   There is evidence also, which appears more strongly in the results
represented by Diagram III, that q diminishes with the extension
until the stretched length is about 3/2 times the natural length.

rigidly    at  D, and   attached at  C  to  the arm AB bracketed out from the
pendulum.
   The experiments were made by observing the period of the
pendulum with the india-rubber attached, and noting the difference
between this and the natural period of the pendulum.
   The india-rubber was, of course, initially strained a little, and the
amplitude of the vibrations used was never great enough to make the
strain vanish.

   It will  be  noticed that the values of q thus obtained are much
greater for the soft grey and red varieties than those obtained
statically, and the chief part of this difference is due to their not
having time to take the subpermanent set which they would acquire if
the period was very long, but in part also it must be due to a thermo
dynamic cause.

   The arrangement shown in fig. 4 was used for both the statical
and dynamical measures of the rigidity.
    The india-rubber was held at each end by clamps of sheet brass C, C
 shown in section in fig. 5.
   Through the lower part of C the rod P passes, which fixes its
 position rigidly. The upper clamp C is attached to the bar AB, this
 bar being suspended in a horizontal plane by two silk threads from
 the point D. A small plumb-bob is also hang from D to facilitate the
 centering of the upper clamp and the divided circle F. When the

tinuation of the line DB.
   In the statical measures two silk threads were attached to A, one
carrying the plumb-bob K, and the other the small weight W. W
was drawn to one side as shown, care being taken that the horizontal
projection of AH was at right angles to A6, and that HL was
horizontal.    The distance HK was then measured with a scale, and
the an^le through which the moment due to the horizontal com
ponent of force acting along AH turned the bar AB was read on the
divided circle F.
   The section of the specimens of india-rubber used in these experi
ments being approximately square, and the reaction against torsion of
a square prism being 0'883 that of a circular cylinder of the same
area,* it follows that, since the torsional rigidity of similar prisms
varies as the fourth power of the linear dimensions of their section,
therefore the circular cylinder which has the same torsional rigidity
as a square prism whose side is a, has a radius equal to (a/"-) .J/0'883.

     Both torsional measures give n greater for the soft grey than for
 the red, whereas by the measures of Young's modulus, which should
 be very nearly equal to 3m, m is considerably greater for the red.
     It is possible that there may be a kind of " grain " in the sheets of
 the soft grey india-rubber, and that as the distortion produced by the
 extension in Experiments (1) and (2) is not in the same direction as
 that due to the torsion in Experiments (3), (4), the origin of the
 difference is to be looked for in this quarter.
                   (5.) Young's Modulus for Large Extensions.
    Diagram     III   gives the results of these experiments.    They were
 made with the apparatus shown in fig. 1. The actual measures were
made on strips of (£)3 inch section, which were cut from the larger
pieces in a planing machine by a sharp thin knife, wetted with dilute
caustic soda. . The sectional area of the strips so cut was exceedingly
uniform, and its smallness was convenient, as it allowed of moderate
forces being used to produce the required strains, which were increased
until the breaking strain was reached.
    In the diagram the results are reduced to what they would have
been had the piece of india-rubber operated upon been a cube of one
inch when unstrained.
    The ordinates of the curves A, B, B', C, C, are the lengths which
such cubes of soft grey, red, and hard grey india-rubber would respec
tively assume when stretched by forces represented by the abscissae.
In the curves B, C, the readings were taken as rapidly as possible,
while in B', C, an interval of two minutes was allowed between each
successive addition to the strain.
    There were from thirty to fifty observations made for each curve.
In the case of the soft grey, it did not seem to make much difference
whether the readings were taken quickly or otherwise.
    Let x and I be the strained and natural lengths of the india-rubber,
and y the stretching force, then q = Idi/js'dx, and if the material is
incompressible, q = Vdyjsdx.
    By this equation the curves E, F, G were deduced from A, B, C,
to show the variation of q with the extension.         It is worth while to
observe that since if q remain constant for all extensions,
                                        I'—l

                                       gA-F'
so  that with q constant, if a stretching force be applied equal per unit
area to Young's modulus, the extension will be infinite.

The section is that at the moment of rapture.
    These numbers, therefore, are not the forces required to break a
length of india-rubber of one square inch section when unstrained.
To obtain the force requisite for this [purpose, the numbers given
above must be divided by the extensions of the unit length at the
moment of rupture.      They are given directly by the termination of
the curves A, B, C, and are about 820 lbs. for all three kinds.
   The tensile strength, however, is dependent in some measure on
the time for which the force is applied, a long-continued application
of force causing rupture when the force itself is not sufficient to pro-
dnce the maximum extension.        This is particularly noticeable in the
case of the hard grey india-rubber.
                         (6.) Volume Elasticity.
   There was some difficulty in obtaining a direct measure of this co
efficient, owing to the very large pressures which have to be employed
to produce any measurable compression.

   After the india-rubber was enclosed and the plate B cemented on,
A  was filled with water, great care being taken that no air bubbles
were enclosed.     The neck was then closed by a ball of soft wax and
turpentine mixture, D, and the whole immersed in water in a cast-

  As a test of the accuracy of the method, the volume elasticity of
water was measured.       The value found for k' was 296,000 lbs. per
square  inch, a resnlt which is not far from the truth.
  The values for india-rubber were
                       Soft grey           198,000
                       Red                 115,000
                       Hard grey           940,000
  These values are the means of all the experiments after the first.
The first application of pressure, however, always produced a much
more considerable compression, and if the volume of elasticity had
been deduced from the first experiment only, its value would have
been about half that given above in the case of the soft grey and red ;
and for the hard grey, about one-eighth.
                              (7.) Viscosity.
  The rate at which the vibration in Experiment (4) died away was
used to determine the coefficient of viscosity.

The coefficient p represents the tangential force required to distort a
cube of one inch of the material at the rate of one inch per second,
independently of that necessary to overcome the elastic reaction, on
the assumption that the viscous resistance to distortion varies as the
rate of distortion.   Part of the apparent viscosity however must be
due to the difference of the rates at which the sub-permanent set is
produced and removed.

devised    by the Rev. John Mitchell, P.R.S., was first carried out by
Cavendish,* and has been since performed by Reich, t Baily,J and
Cornu and Baillej? who have all followed very closely the arrangement
of Cavendish.
   Owing to the very small value of the constant of gravitation, all
these experimentalists have aimed                 at  increasing the sensibility as
much as possible.        With this object, a long beam carrying at its ends
considerable masses has been suspended by a very long and very fine
wire. The attracting masses have been made as large as possible, and
they have been brought almost into contact with the sides of the long
box in which the beam is suspended.                  Cornu, it is true, has reduced
the dimensions of all the parts to about one-quavter of the original
amount. His beam, an aluminium tube, is only half a metre long, and it
carries at its ends masses of          \ lb. each, instead of about 2 lb. as used
by  Cavendish.      This   reduction     of  the dimensions to about one-quarter
of those used previously is considered by Cornu to be one of the
advantages of his apparatus, because, as he says, if the period of
oscillation is unchanged, then the sensibility is independent of the
mass of the suspended balls, and is inversely as the linear dimensions.
I do not quite follow this, because, as I shall show, if all the dimensions
are increased or diminished together the sensibility will be unchanged.
If only the length of the beam is altered and the positions of the
large attracting masses, so that they remain opposite to and the same
distance from the ends of the beam, then the sensibility is inversely
as the length.
   The other improvements introduced by Cornu are the use of
mercury for the attracting masses which can be drawn from one pair
of vessels to the other without coming near the apparatus, the use of
a metal case connected with the earth to prevent electrical disturb
ances, and the electrical registration of the movements of the index
on the scale which was placed 5f¦0 cm. from the mirror.                       The period
of oscillation which has been used has varied between 398 seconds
(Cornu) and 840 seconds (Cavendish).                    Cavendish found that with
the very inconvenient period of 1800 seconds the balls knocked
against the side of the case.
   The difficulty that has been met with has been the perpetual
shifting of the position of rest, due partly to the imperfect elasticity
or fatigue of the torsion wires, and partly, as Cavendish proved
experimentally, to the enormous effects of air currents set up by
temperature differences in the box, which with large apparatus it is
impossible to prevent.         In every case the power of observing was in

excess of the constancy of the effect actually produced. The observa
tions of Cornu are the only ones which are comparable in accuracy
with other physical measurements, and these, as far as the few figures
given enable one to judge, show a very remarkable agreement between
values obtained for the same thing from time to time.
   Soon after         I
                  had made and fonnd the value of quartz fibres for
producing   a very small and constant torsion, I thought that it might
be possible to apply them to the Cavendish apparatus with advantage.
Professor Tyndall, in a letter to a neighbour written some months
ago, expressed the conviction that it would be possible to make a
much smaller apparatus in which the torsion should be produced by
a quartz fibre.                          I
                   Last summer began to prepare an instrument with
a working beam five millimetres long, but other experimental work
obliged me to put this on one side for a time. I have lately examined
the theory of this instrument in some detail, and as I find that in many
particulars there is an advantage in departing from the arrangement
that has always been employed,                I
                                       have lately prepared two pieces of
apparatus,   which  on  trial fully bear  out the results of this inquiry.
  I  shall, therefore, first give a short account of the principles that
should be followed in the design of the Cavendish apparatus, and
then describe the results which                   I
                                         have obtained up to the present
time.
  As    I have  already stated, the sensibility of the apparatus       is,the
                                                                         if
period  of  oscillation      always
                               is     the  same, independent   of the  linear
dimensions of the apparatus.        Thus,     there are two instruments in
                                                       if
which all the dimensions of one are n times the corresponding
dimensions of the other, then the moment of inertia of the beam and
its appendages will be as ra6       :and, therefore, the torsion also must
                                         1,

                                                  is
in the large instrument as in the small, therefore the moment will be
as n5   :  that is, in the same proportion as the torsion, and so the

the beam in the opposite direction, that the balance of effect begins to
fall short of that which would be dne to the reduced dimensions if
the opposite ball did not interfere.       Fig. 1 will make the meaning

occupies a symmetrical position on the opposite side of the centre O,
but as the relations of each with the moving system are identical, it
will be sufficient to consider only one.
    As the beam is supposed to become shorter, the small balls will
occupy successively the places ab' and a"b", while the large mass M
will take the corresponding places shown by the dotted circles at M'
and M".        When it has reached the position M", at which the line
joining its centre with 0 makes an angle of 45° with ab, the sensi
 bility of the combination is still increasing, but not quite so fast as it
 would do if the attraction on the ball 6 did not partly counteract the
 attraction on the ball a. Should this position be chosen for the mass
 M, then the beam of the length a"b" is not the best that can be used,
 if it is further shortened the sensibility will be still further increased,
 and will become a maximum when the beam has a length equal to
 half a"b" , that is, when the distance between the large balls is 2v/2
 times the distance between the small ones.       If the length of the beam
 is made successively equal to 1, 2, 3            10 tenths of the distance
 a"b", then the corresponding deflections will be represented by the

opposite the attracting masses.
   It might be urged against this argument that a difficulty wonld
arise in finding a torsion fibre that would give to very short beama
loaded with balls that      will safely carry a period as great as five or
                           it
ten minutes, and until quartz fibres existed there would have been                         a
difficulty in using a beam much less than a foot long, but             now  it   is
possible to hang a thing only half an inch long and weighing from
20 to 30 grains by a fibre not more than a foot in length, so as to
have a period of five minutes.         If the moment of inertia of the
heaviest beam of a certain length that a fibre will safely carry          so          is
small that the period      too rapid, then the defect can be remedied by
                           is
reducing the weight, for then a finer fibre can be used, and since the
torsion varies approximately as the square of the strength (not
exactly because fine fibres carry heavier weights in proportion), the
torsion will be reduced in a higher ratio, and so by making the
suspended parts light enough, any slowness that may be required may
be provided.
   Practically,it   is not convenient to use fibres much less than one

    By far the greatest advantage    that is met with in small appa
ratus   is the   perfect nniformity of temperature which is easily
obtained ; whereas, with apparatus of large size, this alone makes
really accurate work next to impossible.      The construction to which
this inquiry has led me, and which will be described later, is espe
cially suitable for maintaining a uniform temperature in that part of
the instrument in which the beam and mirror are suspended.
                                 I
    With such small beams as am now using it is much more con
venient to replace the long thin box generally employed to protect
the beam from disturbance by a vertical tube of circular section, in
which the beam with its mirror can revolve freely.          This has the
further advantage that if the beam is hung centrally, the attraction
of the tube produces no effect, and the troublesome and approximate
calculations which have been necessary to find the effect of the box
are no longer required.       The attracting weights, which must be
outside the tube, must be made to take alternately positions on the
two sides of the beam, so as to deflect it first in one direction and
then in the other.      For this purpose they are most conveniently
fastened to the inside of a larger metal tube which can be made to
revolve on an axis coincident with the axis of the smaller tube. There
are obviously two planes, one containing and one at right angles to
the beam, in which the centres of the attracting balls will lie when they
produce no deflection.     At some intermediate position the deflection
will be a maximum. Now it is a matter of some importance to choose
this maximum position for the attracting masses, because, in showing
the experiment to an audience, the largest effect should be obtained
that the instrument is capable of producing ; while in exact measures
of the constant of gravitation this position has the further advantage
that the only measurement which there is any difficulty in making,
viz., the angle between the line joining the large masses and the line
joining the small, which may be called the azimuth of the instrument,
becomes of little consequence under these circumstances.           In the
ordinary arrangement the slightest uncertainty in this angle will
produce a relatively large uncertainty in the result.     I  have already
 stated that if an angle of 45° is chosen, the distance between the
 centres of the large balls should be 2 v 2 times the length of the beam,
 and the converse of course is true. As it would not be possible at this
 distance to employ attracting balls with a diameter much more than
 one and a half times the length of the beam, and as balls much
 larger than this are just as easily made and used, it will be well to
 find out what will be the position for maximum deflection when the
 centres of the attracting balls are any distance apart.
    In the case already considered the problem gives rise to equations
 of too high an order to be readily solved, and so in the particular case
 referred to the result was obtained   by arithmetical means.       If the

best position for any distance of the attracting mass from the axis of
motion.    Let P   (fig. 2) be the centre of the attracting ball,   N that of

     These figures are represented by the curve in fig. 3, which shows
  the best position for an attracting mass at any distance from the

 axis O.    The inclination of this with the line ON at the point N is
 35° 16', or an angle of which the tangent is equal to l/v/2.        This
 curve also shows the best position from which a source of light at
 any distance from 0 would most brightly illuminate a small surface
 at N lying along ON.
    If now an attracting ball is placed in a position of maximum effect
 with its centre on this line it will act on the further suspended ball,
 tending to deflect the beam in the opposite direction, and this will
 become more marked as the distance between the centres of the
 attracting balls increases, and so the increased effect which would
 be due to a greater attracting ball may be largely compensated by
the increased action on the remote end of the beam.          The azimuth
at which the maximum effect is produced is also changed.
    I have practically overcome this difficulty by arranging the two
sides of the apparatus at different levels.     Each large ball is at or
near   the  same  level as the neighbouring   small  ball, but one pair is
removed from the level of the other by about the diameter of the
large balls which in the apparatus which     I have now the honour to

  1889.]               On   the Cavendish    Experiment.                261
  submit to the Society is nearly five times       as great as the distance
 in plan between the two small balls.
     In order to realise more fully the effect of a variety of arrange
 ments, I have, for my own satisfaction, calculated the values of the
 deflecting forces in an instrument in which the distance between
 the centres of the attracting balls is five times the length of the beam,
 for every azimuth and for differences of levels of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and
  5 times the length of the beam.
     This calculation is very much facilitated by the property of the
 circle illustrated in fig. 4. If the diameter is divided into any number
 of equal parts, and perpendiculars drawn to cut the circle, then the
 squares of lines drawn from any one of the points on the diameter to all
 the intersections (including the two ends of the diameter) are in arith-
 metrical progression, and the common difference is equal to twice
                                    Via.  4.
 the number of parts included between that point and the centre.          If
the diameter is divided into ten parts, a and b are the positions of the
ends of the beam, and the semicircle is the path of the centre of the
large mass.      When this is at any position P the resolved force at a
is equal to PM/Pa2.       Now all the quantities PH2 and Pa2 are small
whole numbers, and the squares of the true distances of P from a when
a is at different levels are small whole numbers also, so that all the
logarithms can be found on the first four pages of Chambers's tables.
It is for this reason that it is most convenient to represent the result
of the calculation on a diagram in which the abscissae are the projec
tions of the centre of the attracting mass on a plane passing through
the centres of the small balls.
    In fig. 5 the dotted circle represents the possible positions of the
centre of the attracting mass, and a, b the small balls. The heavy
Curve 1 shows the value of the moment due to the ball a alone. The
reversed Curve 2 in the same way shows the moment of the ball b in
the opposite direction when that ball is at the same level as a.        The
Curve 3 is the difference between these two, and from this actual
resultant moments may be found. The maximum of this curve is in

a slightly different position from that of the Curve 1, and its greatest
value is only just over half that of the first curve, which shows that
the sensibility can be nearly doubled by lowering the ball 6 until it
is too far down to be appreciably attracted by the ball which is on a
level with a. The five curves below 2 show the effect of lowering 6
 until it is 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5  times the length of ab below the general
 level, and the five curves between 1 and 3 in the same way represent
 the values of the balance in favour of a when b is at these different
 levels.    The curves when drawn are instructive in that they show
 both the relative advantages of the various differences of levels, and
 from the curvature at the maximum positions the practical importance
 of correctly determining the azimuth. By reference to the number
 on the vertical scale it is also easy to directly compare the sensibility
 of the apparatns with any of the arrangements which have been in
 use.    For instance, calling in every case the half length of the beam
 unity and the dimensions of the other parts by numbers in proportion,
 we have in the apparatus of Cavendish-
         Equivalent distance between centres of large and

     In my  apparatus  it is simply necessary to multiply the cube of the
  diameter   of the large balls by the ordinate of the curve, to find on
  the same scale the value of the deflection.      This requires that the
  large balls should be made of material of the same density in the two
  cases, and that the periods should be the same. Now the diameter of
  the large ball in the new apparatus is 6'4 times the length of the
  beam, and so the comparative value of the deflecting force is 0'0425 X
  6-4? = ll-l, a figure which is 18'7 times as great as the figure found
  for the apparatus of Cavendish. If then the large balls have the
 same density as those used by Cavendish and the period of oscillation
 is the same, the angular deflection will be 18' 7 times as great.
     Having now found that with apparatus no bigger than an ordinary
 galvanometer it should be possible to make an instrument far more
 sensitive than the large apparatus in use heretofore, it is necessary to
 show that in practice such a piece of apparatus will practically work,
 and that it is not liable to be disturbed by the causes which in large
 apparatus have been found to give so much trouble.
     I have made two instruments of which       I shall only describe the
 second, as that is better than the first both in design and in its
 behaviour.
    The construction of this is made clear by fig. 6. To a brass base
 provided with levelling screws is fixed the vertical brass tube, t,
 which forms the chamber in which the small masses a, b are sus
 pended by a quartz fibre from the pin at the upper end.        These little
 masses are cylinders of pure lead 11'3 mm. long and 3 mm. in
 diameter, and the vertical distance between their centres is 50-8 mm.
 They are held by light brass arms to a very light taper tube of glass,
 so that their axes are 6'5 mm. from the axis of motion.        The mirror
 m, which is 12' 7 mm. in diameter, plane and of unusual accuracy, is
 fastened to the upper end of the glass tube by the smallest quantity
 of shellac varnish. Both the mirror and the plate-glass window
 which covers an opening in the tube were examined and afterwards
 fixed with the refracting edge of each horizontal, so that the slight
 but very evident want of parallelism between their faces should not
 interfere with the definition of the divisions of the scale. The large
 masses M, M are two cylinders of lead 50'8 mm. in diameter, and of
 the same length.      They are fastened by screws to the inside of a
 brass tube, the outline of which is dotted in the figure, which rests on
the turned shoulder of the base so that it may be twisted without shake
through any angle.       Stops (not shown in the figure) are screwed to
the base, so that the actual angle turned through shall be that which
produces the maximum deflection.        A brass lid made in two halves
covers in the outer tube and serves to maintain a very perfect uni
formity of temperature in the inner tube. Neither the masses M, M, nor
the lid touch the inner tube.      The period of oscillation is 80 seconds.

  With this apparatus placed in an ordinary room with draughts of
air of different temperatures and with a lamp and scale such as are
used with a galvanometer, the effect of the attraction can easily be
shown to a few, or, with a lime-light, to an audience. To obtain this

 result with apparatus of the ordinary construction and usual size is
 next to impossible, on account chiefly of the great disturbing effect of
 air currents set up by difference of temperature in the case. The
 extreme portability of the new instrument is a further advantage, as
 is evident when the enormous weight and size of the attracting
 masses in the ordinary apparatus are considered.
    However, this result is only one of the objects of the inquiry which
 I have now the honour to submit to the Royal Society. The other
 object which    I had in view was to find whether the small apparatus,
 besides being more sensitive than that hitherto employed, would also
 be more free from disturbances and so give more consistent results.
                     I
 With this object have placed the apparatus in a long narrow vault
 under the private road between the Museum and the Science Schools.
 This is not a good place for experiments of this kind, for when
 a cab passes overhead the trembling is so great that loose things
 visibly move ; however, it is the only place at my disposal that is in
 any degree suitable. A large drain pipe filled with gravel and
 cement and covered by a slab of stone forms a fairly good table.
 The scale is made by etching millimetre divisions on a strip of clear
 plate glass 80 cm. long.      This is secured at the other end of the
 vault at a distance of 1053*8 cm. from the mirror of the instrument.
 A telescope 132 cm. long and with an object-glass 5-08 cm. in
 diameter rests on V's clamped to the wall, with its object-glass
 360 cm. from the mirror.       Thus any disturbance that the observer
 might produce if nearer is avoided and at the same time the field of
 view comprises 100 divisions. "While the observer is sitting at the
telescope he can by pulling a string move an albo-carbon light
mounted on a carriage so as to illuminate any part of the scale that
may happen to be in the field of the telescope.          The white and
 steady flame forms a brilliant background on which the divisions
appear in black.       The accuracy of the mirror is such that the
millimetre divisions are clearly defined, and the position of the cross-
wire (a quartz fibre) can be read accurately to one-tenth of a division.
This corresponds to a movement of the mirror of almost exactly one
second   of arc.
    The mode of observation is as follows : When all is quiet with the
large masses in one extreme position, the position of rest is observed
and a mark placed on the scale.       The masses are moved to one side
for a time and then replaced which sets up an oscillation.          The
reading of every elongation and the time of every transit of the mark
are observed until the amplitude is reduced to three or four centi
metres. The masses are then moved to the other extreme position and
the elongations and transits observed again, and this is repeated as
often as necessary.
   On the evening of Saturday, May 18th, six sets of readings were

taken, but during the observations there was an almost continuous
tramp of art students above, producing a perceptible tremor, besides
which two vehicles passed, and coals were twice shovelled in the coal
cellar, which is separated from the vault in which the observations
were made by only a four and a half inch brick wall. The result of all
this was a nearly perpetual tremor, which produced a rapid oscilla
tion of the scale on the cross-wire, extending over a little more than
1 mm.      This increased the difficulty of taking the readings, but to
what extent it introduced error I shall not be able to tell until can        I
make observations in a proper place.
   In spite of these disturbances, the agreement between the deflec
tions deduced from the several sets of observations and between the
periods is far greater than I had hoped to obtain, even under the
most favourable conditions. In order to show how well the instru
ment behaved,      I  have copied from my note-book the whole series of
figures of one set, which sufficiently explain themselves.

   It will  be noticed   that the true position of rest is slightly rising in
value, and this rise was found to continue at the rate of 0'36 cm. an
hour during the whole course of the experiment, and to be the same
when the large masses were in the positive or negative position.
The motion was perfectly uniform, and in no way interfered with the
accuracy of the experiments. It was due, I believe, to the shellac
fastening of the fibre, for      I find that immediately after a fibre has
been attached this movement is very noticeable, but after a few days
it almost entirely ceases ; it is, moreover, chiefly evident when the

fibre is loaded very heavily. At the time that the experiment was
made the instrument had only been set up a few hours.
   The mean decrement of three positive sets was 0-8011, and of three
negative sets, 0'8035.     The observed mean period of three positive
sets was 79'98, and of three negative sets, 80-03 seconds, from both
of which 0'20 mnst be deducted as the time correction for damping.
   The deflections obtained from the six sets of observations taken in
groups of three, so as to take into account the effect of the slow
change of the position of rest, were as follows : —
             From sets   1, 2, and 3             17-66 ± 001

                   „     4, 5, and 6             1765 ± 002
   An examination of these figures shows that the deflection is known
with an accuracy of about one part in two thousand, while the period
is known to the four thousandth part of the whole. As a matter of
fact the discrepancies are not more than may be due to an uncertainty
in some of the observations of half a millimetre or less, a quantity
which, nnder the circumstances, is hardly to be avoided.
   The result of these experiments is complete and satisfactory.      As a
lecture experiment the attraction between small masses can be easily
and certainly shown, even though the resolved force causing motion
is, as in the present instance, no more than the one two hundred-
thousandth of a dyne (less than one ten- millionth of the weight of a
grain), and this is possible with the comparatively short half period
of eighty seconds. Had it been necessary to make use of such half
periods as three to fifteen minutes which have been employed hitherto,
then, even though a considerable deflection were produced, this could
hardly be considered a lecture experiment.
   The very remarkable agreement between successive deflections and
periods shows that an absolute measure made with apparatus designed
for the purpose, but on the lines laid down above, is likely to lead to
results of far greater accuracy than any that have been obtained.
 For instance, in the original experiment of Cavendish there seems to
 have been an irregularity in the position of rest of one-tenth of the
deflection obtained, while the period showed discrepancies of five to
fifteen seconds in seven minutes.     The experiments of Baily made in
the most elaborate manner were more consistent, but Cornu was the
first to obtain from the Cavendish apparatus results having a precision
in any way comparable to that of other physical measurements.          The
                               him        '
three papers, published by         in the Comptes Rendus,' of 1878, re
 ferred to above, contain a very complete solution of some of the problems
 to which the investigation has given rise. The agreement between the
 successive values, decrement, and period is much the same that I have

 obtained,  nevertheless     the means of the summer and of the winter
 observations  differ  by about 1 per cent.
    I  have not referred to the various methods of determining the
 constant of gravitation in which a balance, whether with the usual
 horizontal beam, or with a vertical beam on the metronome principle,
 is employed.    They are essentially the same as the Cavendish method,
except that there is introduced the friction of the knife-edges and the
 unknown disturbances due to particles of dust at these points, and
to buoyancy, without, in my opinion, any compensating advantage.
 However, it would appear that if the experiment is to be made with a
 balance, the considerations which         I  have advanced in this paper
 would point to the advantage of making the apparatus small, so that
attracting masses of greater proportionate size may be employed, and
 the disturbance due to convection reduced.
                              I
    It is my intention, if can obtain a proper place in which to make
the observations, to prepare an apparatus specially suitable for abso
lute determinations. The scale will have to be increased, so that the
dimensions may be determined to a ten-thousandth part at least.
Both pairs of masses should,        I  think, be suspended by fibres or by
wires, so that the distance of their centres from the axis may be
accurately measured, and so that in the case of the little masses the
moment of inertia of the beam, mirror, <fec., may be found by alter
nately measuring the period with and without the masses attached.
The unbalanced attractions between the beam, &c., and the large
masses, and between the little masses and anything unsymmetrical
about the support of the large masses, will probably be more accu
rately determined experimentally by observing the deflections when
the large and the small masses are in turn removed, than by calcula
tion.
    If anything is to be gained by swinging the small masses in a good
Sprengel vacuum, the difficulty will not be so great with apparatus
made on the scale    I  have in view, i.e., with a beam about 5 cm. long,
as it would with large apparatus. With a view to reduce the con
siderable decrement,      I   did try to maintain such a vacuum in the
first instrument, in which a beam 1¦2 cm. long was suspended by a
fibre so fine as to give a complete period of five minutes, but though
the pump would click violently for a day perhaps, leakage always took
place before long, and so no satisfactory results were obtained.
                                     I
   With an apparatus such as have described, but arranged to have
a complete period of six minutes, it will be possible to read the scale
with an accuracy of one ten-thousandth of the deflection, and to
determine the time of vibration with an accuracy about twice as
great.

II.   " On Time-lag in the Magnetisation of Iron." By J. A.
       EwiNG, B.Sc, F.R.S., Professor of Engineering in Univer
       sity College, Dundee.           Received June 18, 1889.
    When any change is made to take place in the magnetic force
acting on a piece of soft (annealed) iron, a considerable time elapses
before the resulting change in the magnetism of the piece is complete.
The sluggishness which soft iron exhibits in assuming its full mag
netism when a magnetic force is imposed upon it was referred to as
follows in the account which I wrote, some years ago, of experiments
on the magnetic qualities of iron : — *
    " Some evidence was given that, in addition to much static
hysteresis, there is a small amount of viscous lagging in the changes
of magnetism which follow changes of magnetising force.                        I  re
peatedly observed that when the magnetising current was applied to
long wires of soft iron, either gradually or with more or less sudden
 ness, there was a distinct creeping up of the magnetometer deflection
 after the current had attained a steady value, as measured by the de
 flection of the galvanometer through which it passed.                 This action
 was sometimes so considerable as to oblige me to wait for some
 minutes before taking the magnetometer reading."
     In his paper " On the Behaviour of Iron and Steel under the Opera
 tion of Feeble Magnetic Forces, "t Lord Rayleigh has remarked on
 the same phenomenon in soft iron. In his experiments the relation
 of the magnetic force to the resulting magnetisation of the specimen
 was studied by means of a magnetometer furnished with a " compen
 sating coil," through which the magnetising current passed, and
  which was so placed that its action on the needle of the magnetometer
 balanced the action of the iron, giving no deflection.                 When very
 feeble magnetic forces were applied to hard iron or to steel, he found
 that a perfect balance might be obtained by adjusting the position of
 the compensating coil, and so established the fact that the suscepti
 bility to small magnetic forces, or to small changes of force, is a defi
  nite quantity, which is independent of the amount of the small change
 of force. He observes that with hard iron and steel the compensat
 ing coil might be set so that neither at the moment of closing the
 circuit of the magnetising current nor afterwards was there any deflec
 tion of the magnetometer, which means that (so far as the magneto
 meter can decide) the metal assumes its magnetic state instanta
 neously. He goes on to say that soft iron shows much moro
 complicated effects :
                             " When the coil was so
                                                        placed as to reduce as
 much    as   possible the instantaneous effect, there ensued a drift of the

  magnetometer needle     ....   in Bach a direction as to indicate a con
  tinued increase of magnetisation. Precisely opposite effects followed
  the withdrawal of the magnetising force.            The settling down of the
  iron into a new magnetic state is thus shown to be far from instanta
  neous.    On account of the complication caused by the free swings of
  the needle, good observations on the drift could not be obtained with
  this apparatus, but it was evident that whilst most of the anomalous
  action was over in 3 or 4 seconds, the final magnetic state was not
  attained until after about 15 or 20 seconds."             Lord Rayleigh then
  cites my observation, quoted above.
     In the following experiments Lord Rayleigh's method of the com
  pensating coil has been made use of for the purpose of examining
 in some detail this "drift," or " creeping," or quasi-viscous change of
 magnetism which follows any change in the magnetic force acting on
 soft iron.
     The magnetometer was a light Thomson mirror directed by the
 horizontal component of the earth's field, and having a free period of
 double swing amounting to nearly 1£ seconds.             The specimen of iron
 used in the greater number of the experiments was a straight piece of
 thick wire O404 cm. in diameter and 39'6 cm. long, over which was
 slipped a tube with a magnetising solenoid wound upon it. The wire
 was set in a vertical position, magnetically west of the magnetometer,
 with its top end on a level with the mirror, and generally 6 cm.
 distant from it. The compensating coil was wound on a wooden
 frame, which could be moved along a
                                              " geometric slide " towards or
 from the magnetometer in the east-west line through the mirror,
 for the purpose of balancing the magnetic effect of the iron. In
 some of the experiments       another compensating coil was used to
 balance the effect on the magnetometer of the magnetising solenoid,
 but generally the simpler plan was followed of including the effect
 of the solenoid in the determination of the compensating coil's action
 on the magnetometer.
     To prevent the vertical component of the earth's field from actii-0
 on the iron, a second magnetising solenoid was wound over the first,
and a constant current of the proper strength to neutralise the
earth's field was maintained in it without interruption.               The main
magnetising current was regulated by having             in its circuit  a box of
resistance coils, and also the liquid slide described in my former
paper.*     This allowed the magnetic force to be changed either
suddenly or gradually, and the slide also allowed the method of de
magnetising by numerous reversals of a continuously diminishing
magnetic force to be resorted to whenever it was desired to reduce
the iron to a magnetically neutral state.
    To soften the wire it was heated to redness by being slowly drawn

through a Bunsen flame. After it was put in place the method of
reversals was applied to extract a small amount of magnetism which
it had acquired in being handled. In the experiments which          I shall
first describe the effects of very feeble magnetic force were examined
by making and breaking the circuit of the magnetising solenoid while
the current was adjusted to produce a force of less than O'l c.g.s.      It
was found that the immediate effect of each make and break could be
balanced very exactly by adjusting the position of the compensating
coil, and so long as the magnetising force was considerably less than
O'l c.g.s. the distance at which the coil had to be set to give this
balance was as nearly as possible independent of the value of the force,
and was the same for " break as for " make." The position of the coil
                                  "
was adjusted so that at the instant when the magnetising current was
set up by pressing down a contact key, there was no sudden deflection
of the magnetometer mirror to either side. When the compensation
was right the spot of light simply began to drift slowly towards the
side corresponding to increase of magnetism ; when there was over
compensation,      the spot of light gave a quiver to the opposite side
before beginning to drift, and the position of the coil was adjusted
by drawing it back little by little until the quiver on pressing down
the key disappeared.        The amount of magnetism that was balanced
was afterwards measured by removing the iron, but leaving the mag
netising solenoid and the compensating coil in place, and observing
the deflection of the magnetometer when the same current was passed
through the empty solenoid and the compensating coil. This deter
mined the immediate magnetic effect of the magnetising current on
the iron, and the subsequent creeping up of the magnetism was of
course determined by observing the drifting of the magnetometer
needle which had ensued after applying the current while the iron
was in its place.
    In the following experiment a current of 21 on the arbitrary gal
vanometer scale (equivalent in this case to a magnetising force of
l  j44 c.g.s.) was made, after the wire had been completely demagne
tised, and after the compensating coil had been adjusted to balance
the immediate effect. Magnetometer readings were taken 5 seconds
and 60 seconds after "make;" and at 60 seconds the current was
broken, and magnetometer readings were taken 5 seconds and
60 seconds after " break."         The immediate effect (balanced by the
compensating coil) was equivalent to twenty-five divisions of the
magnetometer      scale.

   Adding to these the equivalent of the compensating coil, we see
that just after the immediate magnetising force was suddenly applied,
the value of the magnetism was 25, which increased after 5 seconds
to 33, and after 1 minute to 38 ; and that when the magnetising force
was suddenly withdrawn, there was at first a residual magnetism
of 13, which fell to 5 in 5 seconds, and disappeared altogether in less
than 1 minute.

magnetism). The magnetic force due to the solenoid may be taken
as approximately equal to the whole magnetic force (although the
rod was barely 100 diameters long, this length should be sufficient to
approximate to endlessness when one is dealing with very low values
of magnetic susceptibility).             On this assumption, one scale division
of the galvanometer is equivalent to 0"0021 of || ; the initial instan
taneous suscep^bility, that is, the gradient d|/d|j, is 9"9, and the
initial instantaneous permeability (^D/dJi) is 125. This value has
been confirmed by a number of independent observations made with
the same piece of annealed wire, and with another piece cut from the
same hank and also annealed.              Taking the magnetism acquired after
 1 minute, the initial susceptibility as regards that is about 15.
     Precisely similar results have been obtained by reversing feeble
magnetic forces.           So long as the forces are very small, the compensa
tion for " reverse " is the same as for " make " and for " break," and
the creeping of the magnetism in any given time after make, break,
or reverse is nearly proportional to the amount of the preceding
¦change of magnetising force.
     In the following experiments the magnetising force was raised to
 higher values, at which this proportionality no longer held good.                   As
before, the compensating coil was adjusted for each current to balance
the effect of " make," the iron being demagnetised by reversals
 immediately before the "make."                  When a stronger current was
applied, the coil had to be pushed nearer the magnetometer : but up
to forces of 0-3 c.g.s. or so, it was practicable to secure an instan
 taneous balance by doing so.             Observations of the drift were taken
at 5 and 10 second intervals during 1 minute.* These are given

   Similar differences between the immediate and ultimate increments
of magnetism present themselves when the magnetising force is
increased step by step.   In the following experiment the compensat
ing coil was set so as to balance the immediate effect of a feeble
magnetising current.      Then such a current was applied, and the
creeping up of the magnetism during 1 minute was observed.            At
the end of the minute the current was increased by a small step, and
it was found that the compensation was still correct or very nearly
so : in other words that the immediate effect of this small increase of
magnetising force bore the same or very nearly the same proportion

to the    increment of force as at the beginning of the process of
magnetisation.       The creep up of magnetism was again observed
during     a minute   :   then another small Btep up of the current was-
made, and so on.          The compensation remained nearly correct for
a number of steps, but as the process was continued up the curve of
magnetisation, it became apparent that the immediate effect was
increasing, in other words that there was under-compensation, and
that the compensating coil would have to be moved a little forward if
an exact balance was to be maintained. The results of this experi
ment are given below (Table II), and are exhibited in fig. 4. The
magnetising current was increased from one to another of the succes
sive values shown in the table at intervals of 1 minute in each case,
by moderately quick movements of the sliding block in the liquid
rheostat.    The changes of magnetic force were therefore not quite
sudden ; each of them took perhaps a quarter of a second to
complete.

   The step of 23 was too large to have its immediate effect balanced
by the compensating coil in the position in which the coil was set.
The magnetic effect of such a large step is conjecturally shown by
the broken line marked (?) in fig. 4.               It will be noticed that the
points  reached    after    1  minute   at   each  step lie well on a continuous
cnrve, which is shown by a dotted line in the figure.
   In Table   II  and fig. 4 one scale division of magnetising current is
equivalent to 0'00362 c.g.s. units of magnetising force, and one scale
division of the magnetometer is equivalent to 0-0177 c.g.s. units of
J. The immediate value of d^ld^ is about 10, as before, and this
applies approximately throughout the range of magnetism dealt
with here, with a slight increase towards the upper end of the
range.
   Higher up in the cnrve of magnetisation, however, the immediate
effect of a small quick increment of magnetic force is greater, though
 then (owing to the greater steepuess of the curve $ and ^) it bears

whole change which the magnetisation has suffered by the time
1 minute has elapsed.

   To show clearly the region in the curve of magnetisation at which
the experiment of Table    III and fig. 5 was made, a curve is drawn in
fig. 6, showing, as the result of a separate experiment, the relation in
absolute measure of the intensity of magnetism to the magnetising
force produced by the solenoid.      The region dealt with in Table  III
is at the place marked Q (§ = about 40 c.g.s.), and the dotted line
drawn there shows the immediate value of d^/d^ after a 1-minute
pause. The dotted line P shows the corresponding initial gradient, or
 immediate value of dQ|d$, when there is no previous magnetisation.
   Another step-by-step experiment of the same kind, made at a place
 higher up, where the magnetising force of the solenoid was about
4 c.g.s. and $ about 320, gave again about 18 for the immediate effect
(cZ^/dp) ; and this was followed by a creeping to the extent of six or
seven times the immediate    effect.
    The immediate magnetic effect of a small step is substantially the
same whether the step is made quite suddenly by short-circuiting a
resistance coil in the circuit of the magnetising solenoid, or compara
tively gradually by means of the liquid slide,     so  that the process
occupies a sensible fraction of a second, or even   as  much as a whole
second.

   However small the step is it appears to be followed by a creeping
up of magnetism.       I  have been able to discover nothing which would
correspond with the limit of perfect elasticity in straining a solid (if
there be any true limit of elasticity), either in the initial part of the
process of magnetisation, or after the prolonged application of a
                                   '
constant magnetising force.
   But the prolonged application of a constant magnetising force
produces an effect which is a most interesting anologue of one effect
of prolonged loading in a stretched wire. It is well known that when
a load (sufficiently great to produce permanent set) is applied to a
stretched iron wire, there ensues, with the lapse of time, not only a
certain amount of supplementary viscous extension (the analogue of
the magnetic creep) but also a quasi-hardening of the metal which
becomes manifest when an addition is made to the load.*                 One effect

of this is that the wire responds with great sluggishness to the
additional load, and this sluggishness is greater the longer has been
the preceding interval during which the load has been maintained
constant.    To test whether, in like manner, the prolonged application
of a constant magnetising force would produce what may be called
magnetic hardening,       I  have made comparative observations of the
time- rate of change of magnetism when a definite small increment of
force is applied, the preceding force having been kept constant (a) for
a short time and (6) for a long time.     The result is to show that the
process of magnetic creeping after a small step is much slower when
the preceding force has been in action for a long time than when it
has been in action for only a short time.
    The following experiment illustrates this well.     After raising the
magnetising force to between 2 and 3 c.g.s. units, the compensating
coil was adjusted to balance the immediate effect of a small increase
of force, this increase being brought about by short-circuiting
1 ohm (out of many
                          ohms) in the magnetising circuit. When the
compensation       had been adjusted, the iron was demagnetised by
reversals, and the magnetising force was again gradually applied.
 When it reached the value of 2'54 c.g.s., a pause was made for
3 minutes, during which time this magnetising force of 2'54 remained
constant.     The resistance in the circuit of the magnetising current
was then suddenly reduced by 1 ohm, which had the effect of raising
the force to 2-60.      The compensating coil prevented this step-up of
 magnetising force from having any instantaneous           effect on the
 magnetometer ; but creeping, of course, began at once, and the time-
 rate of creeping was observed during 10 minutes.               Then the
 magnetising    current  was  kept constant for 50 minutes more,  making
 1 hour in all, and a second step-up of maguetising force was effected
 by removing another ohm of resistance : the second step was very
 nearly equal to the first, and raised the force to 266 c.g.s.        The
 time-rate   of  creeping which followed it was also observed during
 10 minutes.       The results are shown in fig. 7, where the curve A
 shows the growth of magnetism during 10 minutes when the step
 had been preceded by a 3-minute interval of constant force, and the
 curve B shows the growth of magnetism when a sensibly equal step
 was made, which had been preceded by a 1-hour interval of constant
 force.   The times are in each case reckoned from the instant at which
 the step was made, and the increment of magnetism is in each case
 reckoned from the value reached just before the step was made.
 The immediate effect of each step (balanced by the coil) was equiva
 lent to 51 scale divisions of the magnetometer.       The creeping-up in
  10 minutes was equal to no less than 531 scale divisions in the case
 of curve A, as against 320 in curve B. At the place marked with an
  asterisk in curve A, it happened that the laboratory door was slammed,

which shook the wire very perceptibly and caused a comparatively
sudden increase of magnetism (indicated by the dotted part of the
curve), after which the time-rate of creeping became specially slow
for 1 or 2 minutes : finally, however, the rate appeared to recover
from this disturbance. The curves a and b of fig. 7 are the first parts
of A and B drawn to a ten-fold coarser scale of times.
    In confirmation of the above, another experiment was made in
which the magnetic force was increased by three successive small and
very nearly equal steps.     The first step was made after 5 minutes of
constant force, the second after 1 hour of constant force, and the
third again after 5 minutes of constant force.       Time-curves of the
growth of magnetism were drawn in all three cases.            The first and
third curves were not far from coincident; but the second curve lay
very much below them, as B lies below A.
    In the experiments to which figs. 4, 5, and 7 relate, the increment
of magnetic force whose effects were measured was preceded by
increasing magnetic forces : in other words, it was a step-up from a
point on the up curve of magnetisation.      I have also examined the
 effect of a small step-down from  a  point on the  up curve — that is to
say, a small decrement of previously increasing force — and find, as

282                             Prof.   J.   A. Ewing.                     [June         20,
 might perhaps be anticipated from what we knew about static
 hysteresis, that the immediate effect (d^|d^) of a step-down is
 decidedly less than the immediate effect of a step-up.               When the
 compensating coil had been adjusted         to  balance the    first effect of a
 step-up, it was found to give over-compensation for a step-down.
    Another process has been examined, namely, the alternation of a
 step-up with step-down, many times repeated.            After the magnetis
 ing current had been raised to a certain value, it was periodically
 altered through a definite narrow range by alternately putting in and
 pulling out the short-circuit plug of a small resistance coil in the
 main circuit, or by making and breaking a feeble circuit in a second
 solenoid wound over the first.         It was only when this process had
 been repeated many times that the magnetic effects of the small
 changes of ^ became approximately cyclic ; the early cycles were
 associated with a progressive rise in the intensity of magnetism.           But
 when a nearly cyclic state was reached, the compensating coil could
 be adjusted to balance the immediate effects of +&$ or — £||j, and
 the same adjustment of course served to balance either.
    Tested in this way the gradient d^|d^ (for the immediate effect
 of e*j after many small + and — steps) has of course a lower value
 than the gradient which is found when ^ is first raised to                    j|)

that the proportion of creeping to immediate effect is much the same
with high as with low magnetisation.
   One may refer, in this connexion, to the energy which is dissipated
through hysteresis, in performing a small cycle by alternately
applying   and removing a very small force S$.        The action is the
same    in kind whether there is     or is not additional magnetisation.
The energy dissipated in each cycle is — I $d||,    and vanishes    when
the increment and decrement       of $ go on pari passu with the incre
ment and decrement of *i.
   Consider now fig. 1. When the repeated cyclic changes of lj are
indefinitely rapid and go on without pause, so that creeping has
not time to occur, a single straight (or sensibly straight) line such
as OA represents the relation of the change of magnetism to the
(very small) change of magnetising force, during both increment
and decrement.     The rapidity of the action prevents any loop from
being formed, and there is consequently no sensible dissipation of
energy through hysteresis.     This state of things is perhaps nearly
realised in the case of a vibrating telephone diaphragm, or, in regard
to circumferential magnetisation, by an iron conducting wire in a
telephone circuit.   Again, let the cycle be performed indefinitely
slowly. In that case the magnetism, at every stage of the cycle, creeps
up or down to a steady value.      A sensibly straight line, such as OB,
represents the relation of |l to |) during both increment and decre
ment; and there is again no dissipation of enorg}'.        But with any
frequency of alternation lying between these extremes of infinitely
fast and infinitely slow, a loop will be formed, since the creeping will
take effect most considerably at and near the ends of the range (the
time-rate of change of ^ being least there), and there will be dis
 sipation of energy.   When the limits and mode of variation of p are
specified,  there must  be some particular frequency which will make
the energy dissipated per cycle a maximum.
    The phenomena described in the paper have been reproduced in
several specimens of annealed iron wire, of course with quantitative
differences. As to the amount of magnetic creeping much depends
on the annealing of the specimen.        Another piece of iron wire cut
from the Fame bundle as the piece with which these experiments were
made, and annealed at another time, showed almost exactly the same
susceptibility to magnetism as the first piece, so far as immediate
effect went ; but in it the subsequent creeping up was decidedly less
 (in the proportion of about 4 to 5).
    When the iron is hardened by mechanical strain the phenomena of
creeping vanish almost completely.          A specimen from the same
bundle was annealed, and showed much creeping.           It was then put
in the testing machine and pulled until it took a sat of 1 or 2 mm.

in   alength of 40 cm. or so. It was then examined magnetically as
before, and scarcely a trace of creeping could be observed when a feeble
magnetising force was applied. When the compensating coil was
properly adjusted the making or breaking of the magnetising current
caused no more than a slight momentary quiver of the magnetometer
needle, followed by no measurable drifting,        although the whole
magnetic   effect  (compensated     by the  coil) was   equivalent to a
hundred or more scale divisions. When a magnetising force of as
much as 0'6 c.g.s. unit was suddenly applied, the amount of creeping,
if there was any, was certainly less than 1 per cent. of the immediate
effect.  With values of p higher than this it became possible to detect
creep with certainty.     The following notes relate to this wire : —

These forces were       in each case applied to this wire in  a neutral state.
Another trial of the same, with feebler forces, gave 5-3 as the value
of <Z$/d|S for the immediate effect of a very small force, applied when
the iron was demagnetised.           The same quantity in the annealed
specimen was, as has been said, about 10.         In fig. 6 the relation of |J
 (immediate)   to P  as  stated  above,  is represented   by the curve OR ;
the creeping up at the last point is RS.
   In speaking of soft iron it has been shown that the effects of
creeping are most marked when a small addition £jp is made to a pre
viously increasing force       jp.In instances quoted above, the creeping
up in    1 min. has under those conditions been many times greater
than the immediate effect of o|j.
   By way of putting the specimen of hardened iron to the same test,           I
have applied a magnetic force of 1-46 and raised         itby small step to
                                                                 a
l-49. The immediate effect of this step (which was balanced by the
compensating coil) was equivalent to twenty-two scale divisions of the
magnetometer, and this was followed during              1minute by a creep
ing equal to six scale divisions. In itself this creeping           consider
                                                                     is
able, but compared with the corresponding creeping in soft iron            it   is
extremely small.

                                     a

sequent creeping was 3.                In steel and in hard iron the creeping
seemed to be completed in a few seconds after the institution of the
magnetising current. The steel specimen, like the iron, had a
diameter     of rather more than 4 mm. Its susceptibility (annealed)
was considerably less than that of the iron in the hard state.
   It is scarcely necessary to observe that the protracted and exten
sive creeping or magnetic
                                     " nachwirkung " in soft iron which these
experiments illustrate cannot be ascribed to the subsidence of
the circumferential currents which are generated by the imposition of
longitudinal magnetic force. The creeping is equally conspicuous
whether the magnetic force is suddenly or gradually imposed.                      Lord
Rayleigh has shown that circumferential currents started and left to
themselves will subside to e-1 of their initial magnitude in the
time

annealed iron rod, a = 0-202, fi = 125, p = 9827 (Everett), and t is
less than l6>66 of a second.               The subsidence would be practically
complete     in  a  small   fraction     of  a second : but the creeping persists
during many seconds and even minutes with no excessive change of
 rate.   Again, comparing soft iron with hard iron, iu which fi is less
and p is greater, the values of t will differ, but not by any means so
 much as to correspond with the very wide difference in magnetic lag.
    In view of this it is puzzling to find that the diameter of the rod
 experimented upon has a most important influence on the magnetic lag.
    In testing various samples of soft iron wire, most of which were of
less diameter than the piece used in the above experiments,                            I
noticed that the phenomena of creeping were less marked in the
 smaller rods.       I then tried a bundle of nine very soft annealed iron
wires, which were bound together with fine copper wire, and formed
a core of about the same length and aggregate diameter as that of the
 solid rod formerly used. With this bundle there was some creeping,
 but very little in comparison with what was observed in the solid rod,
 as the following notes show : —

   Finally, another bundle was built up, consisting of a much larger
number of fine annealed iron wires. With this the creeping was
almost insensible.
   It may be that the comparative absence of magnetic creeping, or
" nachwirkung," in these last experiments is to be ascribed to the
quickness with which the process of creeping completes itself in a finely
divided mass of iron : in other words, that the process is practically
complete in a time much shorter than the period of the magneto
meter needle.      The'marked difference in effect between a solid core
(a single thick wire) of soft iron and a laminated core (a bundle of
fine wires) of the same material, suggests that in the former much
more than in the latter the process of creeping is retarded by the
eddy currents which are set up by those molecular movements in
which the process itself consists.
   [July  11th. — In seeking an explanation of the difference in beha
viour it  may be worth while to bear in mind that there is probably a
considerable   difference    in molecular structure between a solid core
and a laminated core of iron. If we accept the view that the mag
netically neutral state is due to the molecular magnets forming closed
lings, these rings will for the most part be closed within the limits of
the separate constituent pieces of the laminated core, whereas in the
solid core they may be much larger, their dimensions being limited
only by those of the core itself.]

   In carrying out a series of experiments on radiation of heat by
solid bodies, an investigation to which one of the present writers has
for some time past devoted considerable attention, it became neces
sary, for a purpose which need not here be detailed, to select a
thermo-electric pair of metals, of which one metal is essentially
platinum, as it passes through glass.          Various pairs were considered,
and some trials were made ; and it was finally determined to make
use of platinum and platinoid.           The latter metal is an alloy whose
electrical and mechanical properties were investigated some years
ago by one of the present writers ;* and since that time it has

1889.]    Note on the Thermo-electric Position        of Platinoid.     287
assumed    considerable importance in the construction of electrical
instruments and resistance coils. Partly on this account, and partly
from present requirements, it became both interesting and necessajy
 to determine the thermo-electric constants for a specimen of this
alloy.
   Platinoid is in composition very similar to German silver. In the
manufacture of the alloy, however, phosphide of tungsten is em
ployed ; and althongh an exceedingly minute quantity of metallic
tungsten remains in the alloy, yet the properties of the substance are
in many respects remarkable. The metal is capable of being polished
so as to be almost as beautiful as silver in appearance, having only a
slightly darker and more steel-like colour ; and when it has been
polished it remains absolutely untarnished, even in the atmosphere of
a large town, for years at any rate.       It has very remarkable proper
ties as to electric resistance.    It possesses a very high resistance,
while at the same time it has a much lower temperature variation of
electric resistance than any other known metal or alloy. It has also,
as Sir William Thomson has found, very excellent elastic qualities.
   Although it is not proposed to use the platinoid with any metal
other than platinum in the investigation on thermal radiation above
referred to, it nevertheless seemed advisable, when these experiments
were being undertaken, to determine its position with respect to some
other metals.    It was accordingly tried as a pair with platinum, iron,
aluminium, and with two specimens of copper.
   A low-resistance Thomson's reflecting galvanometer was specially
prepared for the purpose of these experiments. The mirror was a plane
parallel mirror of very excellent quality by Steinheil of Munich.
Its deflections were observed by means of a telescope with cross- wires
and scale, instead of by a lamp and scale.        To avoid any influence of
the suspending fibre (which even though of single cocoon silk fibre
does with short fibres give an appreciable torsional resistance) the
mirror was suspended by spider line. The suspending of a mirror,
weighing with its magnet 0'2 gram, by a single spider line is a matter
of some nicety and difficulty ; but when it has been accomplished the
result is so thoroughly satisfactory that it is easily admitted to be
well worth a morning's labour.
   To make the suspension two small pieces of very thin bristle or
of hard-spun silk fibre or split horsehair are attached to the ends of a
suitable length of spider line recently spun by a good large* spider.
By means of these attachments, which are easily seen, the spider line
can be handled. It is then brought over the galvanometer mirror ;
and great assistance is experienced in these operations, and in opera
tions with single silk fibres, by performing them on the top of a piece
of looking-glass laid on the table. The illumination from beneath of

the fibres makes it easy to do with these fine filaments that which is
otherwise scarcely possible.        The fibre is attached to the galvano
meter mirror with the smallest possible speck of shellac varnish, the
greatest care being taken not to varnish any part of the spider line.
When the varnish has dried, the mirror can be lifted up by the spider
line ; caution being nsed at the moment of raising the one mirror off the
surface of the other on account of the vacuum which is liable to be
formed at the moment of separation.           The mirror should be allowed
to hang on the fibre inside a glass beaker for twenty-four hours at
least, as the spider line stretches considerably for some time after the
weight comes on it. A spider line which will carry a galvanometer
mirror and magnet weighing 0-2 gram may have, according to an
estimate made by one of the present writers, about y^ of the torsional
rigidity of a single cocoon silk fibre.
   For the heating of the junctions, a number of glass vessels were
blown, resembling the flasks, with neck and condensing tube, used
for fractional distillation, but with the condensing tube projecting
upwards into the air, so that the steam of a liquid boiling in the
flask runs back into the flask on being condensed.             Into the shorter
neck of the flask was introduced a cork, which carried the thermo-
j unction and a mercurial thermometer; the thermo-junction being
loosely bound to the bulb of the thermometer, or, at any rate, kept in
close contact with the middle part of the thermometer-bulb.                The
cool junction was bound to the bulb of a second thermometer, which
dipped into a vessel containing water at the temperature of the
laboratory. The water was kept thoroughly stirred from top to
bottom by a properly arranged stirrer.
   In the heating flasks the vapours of the following liquids were used :
alcohol, water, chlorobenaol, aniline, methyl salicylate, and bromo-
benzol.* The liquids were boiled vigorously, and the temperatures of
the vapours were determined by means of the mercurial thermometer.
Both the mercurial thermometers were compared directly with the
air thermometer.t The obtaining of a set of points of temperature
by this means was very satisfactory in every case except that of the
liquid of highest boiling point, bromobenzol.           In this case a curious
phenomenon was observed.];           In spite of the fact that the vapour of
the substance was rushing strongly into the condensing tube and,
indeed, out into the open air, at an elevation of 2 feet above the surface
of the liquid it was found exceedingly difficult to keep the temperature
of the various parts of the boiling flask anything like uniform. The
vapour formed itself into layers of different temperatures, the parts
of the flask nearest the surface of the liquid being the hottest.            At

was often found to be as much as 8° or 10° C. cooler than it was just
above the surface. The difficulty could, to a certain extent, be over
come by putting a cloak of fine flexible wire gauze all round the
upper part of the flask ; but the greatest watchfulness was needed to
avoid mistakes.
   In order to reduce the results obtained from the readings of the
galvanometer to absolute electromagnetic measure, a carefully pre
pared standard Daniell's cell was kept with its current always flowing
through a known high resistance ; and from time to time the galvano
meter which was being used was thrown into the circuit, and the
value of the galvanometer deflection determined. The electromotive
force of the Daniell's cell was valued at 1'072 volts.

algebraic sign corresponds with that used by Tait, and now adopted

Everett, we obtain the thermo-electric distance of platinoid from lead,
taken as zero, at various temperatures centigrade. If any one of the
wires platinum, aluminium, iron, or copper used by us, were identical
with the wire of the same name used by Professor Tait, we should be
able to deduce with exactness the distance of our platinoid wire from
his lead wire. That, however, was not the case ; and each of the
secondary wires used by us gives us, as it were, a different result.
Thus we have : —

                   Appendix.     By A. Tanakadate.
    The following experiment on the torsional rigidity of spider line
was carried out   in the Physical Laboratory of the Imperial University
of Japan, in 1884, and a notice of it was published in vol. 2 of
RigakukyoJcwai Tassi ('Proceedings of the Science Society') of that year
in Japanese. It has not hitherto been described in English ; and the
absolute determination as referred to below by Mr. T. Gray of the
rigidity of silk fibre makes an estimate of the rigidity of spider line
possible.
    The determination of the torsional rigidity was a relative one, and
the experiment     essentially consisted in finding the deflection of a
small magnet due to a given twist of the suspending fibre : the
magnet being placed in the earth's magnetic field (03 C.G.S.).      The
deflection was observed by the usual method of the reflected image of
a fine wire stretched before a lamp.
    The mirror magnet was first hung by a silk fibre of 31 cm. length,
and placed in the usual way.      The distance of scale from the mirror
was 95 cm. When the torsion head of the magnetometer was turned
through one complete revolution (27r) in either direction from zero,
the image of the reflected wire was displaced through 8 mm. either
way, or 8/2 X 95=0-0042 radians, or 864".
    The silk fibre was now detached from the magnet, and a spider's
line (newly spun) was attached in its stead. The length was 28 cm ,
the magnetometer was put into its place, and the torsion head was
turned as before, but no appreciable deflection could be observed,
even when the torsion head was turned through ten complete turns
(20?r). It was suspected then that the mirror might have been caught
against the sides of its case ; a close inspection, however, showed
that it was quite free. The fibre was then shortened to 23 cm.
(about one-twelfth its previous length), and the experiment was re
peated.    Ten complete turns of the torsion head gave a deflection of
1'5 mm.; or -15/2 X 95 = 0-00079 radians = 16-3" per turn.
    In order to compare these deflections with each other, each deflec
tion was reduced to that which would be given by a fibre of 1 cm. in
length, by multiplying the deflections by the length of the fibre used.
Thus, corresponding to the twist of one turn of the torsion head in
a fibre of 1 cm. long, we have : —
         For silk fibre                     864-0" x 31   = 26800"
         For spider line                      16-3" X 23 = 37-5"

    From this we get the ratio of the torsional rigidity of the spider line
 to that of the silk fibre to be 1 : 710.
    The diameters of the fibres were microscopically measured, and
 gave the following values : —
                Silk fibre                             0-00091 cm.
                Spider line                            0-00028  „
    If the elastic qualities of these fibres were the same, the ratio of
the torsional rigidity would have come out (28)' : 1.91)*, or 1 : 112 ;
and hence the torsional       rigidity of spider line is less than one-sixth
of that of silk fibre of the same thickness.
    The above result gives us only a relative value of the rigidities
between the two fibres.        If we take the mean value of the torsional
rigidity   of  silk fibre  to be 0-0012 C.G.S. on a length of 1 centimetre
 (not per square centimetre), as found by Mr. T. Gray,* the tor
sional rigidity of the spider fibre of the above experiment will be
 ¦       = 0-000002 C.G.S., the mode of reckoning being the same.
   Mr. Gray's silk fibre may have had a slightly higher rigidity, as he
states that it was boiled in water, while the fibre of the experiment
just described was taken from those boiled in dilute potash water, as
is the usual practice of preparing " mawata," which is a very soft kind
of silk.
  IV. "   Specific Inductive Capacity of Dielectrics when acted on
       by very rapidly alternating Electric Forces."               By J. J.
       Thomson, M.A., F.R.S., Cavendish Professor of Physics,
       Cambridge. Received June 17, 1889.
    The researches of Dr. John Hopkinson have shown that in some
dielectrics,    of which the most conspicuous example is glass, the
refractive index is not, as it ought to be on Maxwell's theory, equal to
the square root of the specific inductive capacity, when the latter is
measured for steady forces, or such as are reversed only a few
thousand times a second.           It is therefore desirable to measure the
inductive capacity under circumstances which approach as nearly as
possible to those which, according to Maxwell's theory, occur when
light passes through a dielectric. This will be when the forces are
reversed     as  rapidly   as possible.    In the following experiments tho
forces were reversed about 25,000,000 times per second.
   The method consists in measuring the wave-length of the electrical
vibrations given out by a condenser whose plates are in electrical
connexion.       If C is the capacity in electrostatic measure of the con-

 denser,   L the coefficient of self-induction in electromagnetic measure
 of the circuit connecting the plates of the condenser, the wave-length,
 if it is long compared with the length of this circuit, equals 2tt\/(LC).
 Thus, if we can measure the wave-length of the vibrations executed
 by such a system, we can find the specific inductive capacity of a
 dielectric. For, if we determine the wave-length of the svstem first
 when the plates of the condenser are separated by air, and then
 when they are separated by a slab of the dielectric whose specific
 inductive capacity we wish to measure, the ratio of the squares of the
 wave-lengths will be the ratio of the capacities of the condenser in
 the two cases, and if we know this ratio we can deduce the specific
 inductive capacity of the dielectric interposed between the plates.
                                      Fig. 1.
    The arrangement of the experiment was as follows : —
    The condenser consisted of two circular zinc plates, AB, CD,
30 cm. in diameter ; these were supported on an insulating stand, and
the distance between them could be altered at pleasure.           To thesj
plates wires,   EF, GH, each about 25 cm. in length, terminating in the
highly polished balls, F, H, were attached.          The plates were also
connected with the poles P, Q, of an induction coil, and when this
was in action a succession of sparks passed between the balls F and H.
The periodic distributions of electricity thus produced over the plates
sent electrical waves down two insulated wires, each about 20 metres
in length, attached to the small zinc plates, L and M, placed close to
the plates of the condenser.
    The wave-length of the vibrations transmitted along the wire was
determined by the method        I described in a former paper (" Note on
the Effect produced by Conductors in the Neighbourhood of a       Wire on

Soc. Proc.,' vol. 46, p. 1).  Two wires RS, V W, of equal length, had
the ends S and W fastened to the poles of a spark micrometer, while
the other ends, R, V, could slide along the wires LT, MU respectively.
At first R was placed at T, and V was moved until the sparks in the
micrometer were as small as possible ; suppose that a was the position
of V when this was the case.       T and a. will be at the same potential.
The end V was now kept fixed at a, and R moved until the sparks
again became as faint as possible ; suppose that p was the position of
 R when this was the case, then /3 and a, and therefore /3 and T, are at
 the same potential; so that, since T is a place of maximum potential,
 /3T equals a wave-length.
    By starting from fi and proceeding further up the wire we can get
 another determination of the wave-length.
    Since from the nature of the case other conductors besides the two
 disks were in the field, the capacity of the condenser was in excess of
 the value given by the formula S/4nrf, where S is the area of one of
 the plates and t the distance between them ; but this is the only part
 of the capacity which is increased when the slab of dielectric is inter
 posed between the plates.      The capacity when the disks were 2 cm.
 apart was determined by the tuning-fork method given in Maxwell's
  " Electricity and Magnetism," vol. 2, p. 385, and was found to be

40    in    electrostatic units ;     the formula      S/in-t would, where
S =   a- X 152 and t  =  2, give 28, so that of the 40 units of capacity, 28
are due to the two disks and 12 to the presence of the other con
ductors. This was verified by determining by the tuning-fork method
the capacity of the condenser when the distance between the disks had
a series of values.
    When the distance between the disks was 2 cm., the mean of several
determinations of the wave-length along the wire was 8'25 metres.

When the plates were separated by pieces of plate glass 2 cm. thick,
the wave-length was 11"75 metres. Thus, if K is the specific inductive
capacity of the glass,

    The determination of the specific inductive capacity of the glass by
the tuning- fork method was difficult, owing to electric absorption;
the values for K obtained in this way varied between 9 and 11. We
see, therefore, that for vibrations whose frequency is 3 X 1010/11'75 X 103,
or 25,000,000 per second, the specific inductive capacity is very nearly
equal to the square of the refractive index, and is very much less
than the value for slow rates of reversals.          The discrepancy is pro
bably due to the cause which produces the phenomenon of anomalous
dispersion in some substances, and indicates the existence of molecular
vibrations having a period slower than 25.000,000 per second.            The
behaviour of the glass under electrical oscillations of the critical
 period would form a very interesting subject of investigation.
    The specific inductive capacity of ebonite was determined in a
 similar way ; the wave-lengths, when the plates were separated by
 air and ebonite respectively, were 8'5 metres and 10'75 metres, giving
 as the specific inductive capacity of ebonite l-9.    The value determined
 by the   tuning-fork method was 21.
    The specific inductive capacity of a plate made of melted stick
 .sulphur was also tried : the wave-length without the sulphur was 8'25,
 with it 11 "5, giving as the specific inductive capacity of sulphur 2'4.
 The value determined by the tuning-fork method was 2-27. Thus,
 for ebonite and sulphur the values determined by the two methods
 agree as well as could be expected, while for glass the results are
 altogether different.

    In January,                 1839, now over fifty years ago, Mr. (now Lord Justice)
Grove published the first notice* of his startling discovery — the gas
battery.           This he followed up in 1842, 1843, and 1845 by three
important paperst, two of which were read before this Society.
     Since that time very little attention has been given by investigators
to the subject.                    Papers by Schonbein.J De la Rive,§ Matteucci,||
Beetz,^ Gaugain,** Morley.ft Peirce,JJ Lord Rayleigh, §§ Figuier,||||
and Kendall,1f^T and a few patents describing ingenious but imprac
ticable suggestions for improved gas batteries, comprise the principal
contributions to the subject.
     This is the more surprising as Grove had published a large number
of experiments leading, amongst other important results, to a complete
list of the voltaic relations of gases to each other and to other
substances, and had pointed out in his lucid manner the great
scientific interest attaching to the gas battery, which forms the
simplest instrument for generating electricity, possesses remarkable

correlation of natural forces."
     Grove states that he never thought of the gas battery as a practical
means of generating voltaic power, but, nevertheless,                              he indicates
clearly in what directions improvements with this object should be
attempted, viz., by extending as much as possible the surface of
contact between the gases, the absorbent and the electrolyte.

batteries, which fully corroborate Grove's view, but show that he, as

  1889.]               A  new Form of Gas Battery.                   297
 well   as later investigators, overlook one important point, viz., the
 necessity of maintaining the condensing power of the absorbent
 unimpaired.      We found that platinum black, the most suitable
 absorbent for gas batteries, loses its condensing power almost com
 pletely as soon as it gets wet, and that it is therefore necessary for
 our purpose to keep it comparatively dry. All attempts to attain this
 with various constructions of the gas battery involving the use of a
 liquid electrolyte failed. We have only succeeded by using an elec
 trolyte in a quasi-solid form, viz., soaked up by a porous non-conduct
 ing material, in a similar way as has been done in the so-called dry
 piles and batteries.
    In order to procure as large a contact as possible between the gases,
 the electrolyte and the absorbent, and at the same time to obtain the
greatest possible duty out of a given quantity of the latter, we have
adopted the following construction : —
    A diaphragm of a porous non-conducting substance, such as plaster
 of Paris, earthenware, asbestos, pasteboard, &c., is impregnated by
 dilute sulphuric acid or another electrolyte, and is covered on both
sides with thin perforated leaf of platinum or gold and with a thin
 film of platinum black. The platinum or gold leaf, which serves as
conductor for the generated electricity (the platinum black being a
 very bad conductor), is placed in contact at small intervals with
strips of lead or other good conductor in order to reduce the internal
resistance of the battery to a minimum. In place of the platinum or
gold leaf, fine wire gauze of the same metal or of carbon may be used.
    The diaphragms so prepared are placed side by side or one above
the other, with non-conducting frames of pasteboard, wood, india-
rubber, &c., intervening, so as to form chambers through which the
gases to be employed (generally hydrogen and air) are passed, so that
one side of the diaphragm is exposed to the one gas and the other to
the other gas, and the spaces between the diaphragms are so con
nected that these gases pass in contact with a number of diaphragms.
    Of the numerous ways in which dry gas batteries can be con
structed we will describe two.      One of these constructions, suitable
for laboratory work, shown in fig. 1, consists of an earthenware
plate M, impregnated with sulphuric acid and cemented into an
ebonite frame R.
    At a short distance from and all around the plate a copper wire A
is let into the ebonite frame. The earthenware plate is covered with
platinum leaf which has been perforated with a very large number
(1500 per square cm.) of small holes, and which extends over and is
in metallic contact with the copper wire. To protect the latter from
corrosion, and to avoid local action, molten paraffin is put over the
platinum leaf where it is in contact with the copper wire. Where the
platinum leaf is in contact with the earthenware plate it is coated by

means of a brush     with a very thin film of platinum black, which
penetrates through the    pores and holes of tho platinum leaf, and
thus comes into contact  with the electrolyte. The frame R is fixed
by means of screws    between  the two ebonite  plates  B, E', with two
india-rubber frames K, K' intervening, thus forming two gastight
chambers G, G', through which the gases to be used are let by the
tubes  0, 0' and H, H'.
                                 Fio.  2.
   The second construction consists of a number of elements each of
which is composed of two frames of lead and antimony consisting of
a broad edge R, conducting strips A, and flaps F with holes and
channels 0, H, which form the inlets and outlets for the gases. These
frames aro coated with an insulating layer a of a mixture of gutta
percha, beeswax, resin, and paraffin.     Between the two frames we
insert a thin sheet S, prepared by coating a piece of cloth with
plaster of Paris, and made impervious round the edges by the same
insulating mixture, and theh the open spaces formed by the conduct
ing strips A are filled up with plaster of Paris mixed up with dilute
sulphuric acid, so as to obtain an even plate.  This is now coated with
platinum leaf and platinum black in the same way as before described.
A number of these elements are put side by side or one above the other,
 with non-conducting frames K of pasteboard intervening, so as to

set of plates is now coated on the four sides not covered by the zinc
plates with a mixture of beeswax and resin, so as to obtain a block
which is perfectly gastight all round, and the space V left between
the two zinc plates is then filled up with plaster of Paris, so as to
obtain one solid compact block with no openings except the entrances
and exits for the gases.          This is closed by four more zinc plates, Z2,
Z4, Z5, Z„, which are soldered together so as to form a box.
   The E.M.F. of this battery we found to vary considerably, accord
ing to the way in which the platinum black is prepared.                      The best
and most regular results we have obtained from platinum black made
by neutralising a boiling solution of PtCl4 with Na2C02, and adding
this slowly to a boiling solution of sodium formiate. With this we
obtain an electromotive force of 0'97 volt with the open circuit. The
internal resistance varies considerably with the thickness of the
porous plates, the amount of the electrolyte contained in these, and the
surface of these plates.           Plates of gypsum of 8 mm. thickness and
350 cm. surface gave an internal resistance of 0'02 ohm.
   The current obtainable from these batteries varies necessarily with
the external resistance.          It is possible to obtain 8 amperes from one
such element, but the E.M.F. of the battery sinks at a very much
more rapid rate than^with constant batteries if a strong current is
taken out, and the work done by the battery is not, as in constant
batteries, at its maximum when the internal and external resistance
are equal.       Thus we found with a small battery of 42 sq. cm. surface
and 0-36 ohm internal resistance the following results : —

      Thesefigures show that in tho case of the battery experimented
 with the maximum of work was obtained with an external resistance
of about double the internal resistance.
   This result is probably due, as pointed out by Dr. C. A. Wright,*
to the fact established by Favret and Berthelot,J that the gases
occluded or condensed by platinum black evolve less and less heat
per unit weight of gas the more gas the platinum black had pre
viously condensed.
   The heat evolved by the condensation of the gases by the platinum
black, or a certain portion of this heat, is in all probability lost for
the production of the current; it follows that the more the platinum
black is saturated the less energy will be lost by the condensation of
the gases, and vice versd.    Now, probably the rate of absorption of
gas by   the  platinum  black  will rapidly diminish as it is more and
more saturated with gas, so that in order to maintain it saturated or
nearly saturated only a moderate amount of current can be obtained
from a given surface, while if it is kept far below the saturating
point it will condense the gases very rapidly, and a very large current
can consequently be obtained.
   As a practical limit we prefer to work the battery with an E.M.F.
with closed circuit of about 073 volt. This allows us to take from
2 to 2^ amperes (1¦45 — 1'82 watt) out of an element with an active
surface of 700 sq. cm., covered with 0'35 gr. of Pt leaf and 1 gr. of
Pt black, which gives a useful effect of very nearly 50 per cent. of
the total energy contained in the hydrogen absorbed in the battery.
   We have found practically no difference in these results, whether we
were using O and H or air and gases containing 30 per cent. to
40 per cent. of H, such as can be obtained by the action of steam or
air and steam on anthracite, coke, or coal.
   With a useful effect of 50 per cent., one-half of the heat produced
by the combination of the H with the O is set free in the battery,
and raises its temperature.        By passing through the battery a
sufficient excess of air, we can keep the temperature of the battery
constant at about 40° C, and at the same time carry off the whole of
the water formed in the battery by means of the gases issuing from
it, so that the platinum      black      kept sufficiently dry, and the
                                             is
porous plate in nearly the same state of humidity.
   The E.M.F. of the open battery       very considerably below what
                                             is                             it
should be according to Thomson's theorem. The combustion of H and
O  should produce an E.M.F. of lp47 volts, while we only obtain 0-97.
It does not seem to us probable that this difference can be explained
in the same way as the deviations from this theorem in        number ofa

abnormal voltaic batteries have lately been explained by Chroustchoff
and Sitnikoff,* viz., by the Peltier effect, which would probably not
be different for the combinations HPt,S04H2 and S04H2,PtO ; nor
do the causes by which Herrount explains this deviation appear to
us to be applicable to the gas battery. It seems more probable — and
what we have stated above respecting the rapid loss of the E.M.P. when
taking out larger currents favours this view — that this loss of energy
is to some extent due to the heat given out in the condensation of the
gases by the platinum black.
    FavreJ found the heat given out by the condensation of 1 gram of
H by platinum to vary from 23,000 to 13,000 calories, and concluded
that this condensation was analogous to the condensation of carbonic
acid by carbon, a purely capillary action.             He did not determine the
 heat of condensation of oxygen.
    Berthelot§ found the heat of condensation of H by platinum to vary
per gram of H condensed from 17,000 to 8700 cal., and concluded
that the H formed two distinct combinations with the platinum, the
first taking place with a disengagement of 17,000 cal., and then com
bining with another equivalent of H with a disengagement of 8700 cal.
    Berthelot also attempted to determine the heat given out by the
absorption of O by platinum, which gas he found to be absorbed only
in very small quantities, so that he could not determine the caloric
effect with any amount of certainty ; but he calculates it from the
figures he obtained at at least 17,000 cal. for 8 grams of O.          But these
figures would lead to a much larger loss of energy than we find actually
to take place. According to Berthelot, the condensation by platinum
of 1 gram of H and 8 grams of O produces 25,700 to 34,000 cal. We
obtain in the battery out of 34,187 cal. (resulting from the combina
tion of 1 gram of H with 8 grams of O) 23,512 cal. as electricity, thus
losing 11,666 cal. We are engaged upon an investigation of this rather
 difficult subject, with a view to further elucidating its effect upon
the gas battery.
    The fact that PdH, which, according to Favre,|| is formed with an
evolution of only 4150 cal. per 1 gram of H (a figure which agrees
fairly well with that obtained by calculation from the tension of PdH),
 produces, if opposed to PtO, a smaller E.M.P. than PtH, has also to
 be considered in studying this question.'
    Using Pd black on gold foil opposed to Pt black on Pt foil in our
 battery, we found the E.M.F. PdH,H2S04,PtO = 0'91 volt, as com
 pared to 0'97 volt for PtH,H2SOI,PtO.

        In the hope of throwing some light upon the question of the
    disappearance of energy in the gas battery, we have determined the
    E.M.F. of the following combinations by means of a block of plaster
    of Paris impregnated with sulphuric acid, one end of which was
    covered with platinum foil and platinum black and arranged so that
    it could be exposed to H or 0, while the other end was plunged into
    a   beaker    which contained the liquid electrolyte and the electrode
   which we wished to examine.

   PtO,H5804,HNcf„C         = 0-22   volt.
       These figures show that the loss of energy is very nearly the same
   per equivalent of 0 consumed, when PtO is used as the negative
   electrode, whether PtH, zinc, cadmium, or copper is used as positive
   electrode, and also that PtH with copper in copper .sulphate, or
   carbon in nitric acid, as negative electrodes, gives nearly the theo
  retical E.M.F.         It would thus seem as if the loss of energy in tho
  gas battery occurred on the PtO electrode ; but the question is
  undoubtedly a complicated one, and requires further study before an
  explanation of it can be attempted.
       This battery differs from all other gas batteries in showing all the
  characteristics of polarisation after it has been at work for some
  length of time.        It loses within an hour from 4 to 10 per cent. of its
  E.M.F. As the chemical processes taking place at the electrodes
 could not explain this, we had to look out for its cause in another
 direction, and found it to be the transport of the sulphuric acid from
 the O to the H electrode, resulting in the acid becoming gradually
 more concentrated on the positive side and weaker on the other,
 which we have established by analysing the gypsum scraped off below
 the platinum leaf at both sides. Probably this difference of concen
tration of the acid sets up a counter-current. In order to counteract
this disturbing influence and to keep the current constant, we inter
change the gases in the battery from time to time, say once an hour,
so that the current goes in an opposite way through the porous
diaphragm, and transports the sulphnric acid back. This necessitates,

sodium hydrate^ on one side and HC1 on the other side of the battery,

equal to 0'54 volt, which very nearly accounts for the difference
between the E.M.F. of the open battery and the E.M.F. calculated
according to Thomson's theorem.           The E.M.F. of PtH,NaClAq,PtO
we found equal 0'86 volt, which, added to the polarisation of
054 volt just mentioned, gives a total of 1"40 against the theoretical
figure for H, 0 = 1"47. By changing the gases after the polarisation
was fully established, the battery showed an E.M.F. of 1'39 volts.
    This observation, as well as the determinations of Peirce,* of the
 E.M.F. of gas batteries with the same gases and different electrolytes,

      No.   2."     By E. Frankland, D.C.L., F.R.S. Received
      June   18, 1889.
    Under this title  I communicated to the Royal Society, in February,
 1883,| the results   of  some experiments on the reactions occurring
 during the charging and discharging of a storage cell. I showed that
no appreciable part of the storage effect was due to occluded gases,
as had been previously suggested by some chemists and physicists ;
but that the act of charging consisted essentially in the decomposi
tion of lead sulphate whilst the discharge was produced by the re-
composition of this salt.
    The establishment of these, as practically the only reactions going
on in a storage cell, enabled me to prescribe a very simple method by
which the charge in any cell could be ascertained ; for as sulphuric
acid i3 liberated during the charging and absorbed by the active
material of the plates during discharge, the amount of charge could

at any time be measured by ascertaining the amount of free sulphuric
acid in the cell ; in other words, by simply determining the specific
gravity of the electrolyte ; and this method has since been very
generally adopted by the users of storage batteries.
    In continuing these experiments, it soon became evident that the
lead sulphate formed and decomposed in the cell could not be the
ordinary white sulphate hitherto known to chemists, because, in the
first place, the active material of the plates always remains coloured
even after discharge, and secondly, because whenever white sulphate
is produced through abnormal reactions in the cell, it is afterwards
decomposed only with extreme difficulty by the electric current.
    In order to obtain some light upon the composition of the sulphate
formed and decomposed in the cell,         I  have studied the action of
dilute sulphuric acid upon litharge and minium, the two oxides of
lead chiefly used in the construction of the plates of storage cells.
                Action of Dilute Sulphuric Acid on Litharge.
    Finely powdered litharge was treated with successive portions of
dilute sulphuric acid until the liquid remained strongly acid aftir
prolonged trituration.      The resulting insoluble buff-coloured powder
was washed     with water till free from acid, and dried, first at 100° C.
and afterwards at 150 — 160°.       The loss at this higher temperature
was less than 0"2 per cent., and        was therefore  due to hygroscopic
moisture.
    PbO and S03 were then determined in the dried compound as
follows: — The salt was dissolved in a small quantity of pure con
centrated solution of caustic potash, and the solution, after dilution,
was saturated with C03.        (According to H. Rose, COPbo" is soluble
in COKoo, but not       in COHoKo.) Any excess of C03, which might
have caused the COPbo" to dissolve, was avoided by warming the
liquid with the precipitate on the water-bath to a temperature at
which the COHoKo begins to dissociate.              The liquid was then
allowed to cool and to stand twelve hours before filtering.           The
COPbo" was filtered off, converted into nitrate, and precipitated and
weighed as sulphate.        The sulphuric acid was determined in the
filtrate from the COPbo".

    Minium was treated with dilute sulphuric acid in exactly the same
 way as litharge, and the resulting brownish red compound dried, first
 at 100° C, and afterwards at 150—160°.                       The loss at this higher
 temperature   was   again   less   than   0-2   per  cent.
    PbO, SO.,, and excess of oxygen were then determined in this salt
 in the following manner : — The salt was first treated with concen
 trated hydrochloric acid in order to reduce all the lead to the mon
 oxide stage.     The resulting mixture was then dissolved in caustic
 potash aud treated as already described.                    The excess of oxygen W8s
 determined by finding the loss of weight which resulted from the
 evolution of C02 when the salt was treated with oxalic acid and
 dilute nitric acid.
    2'1136 grams of the salt gave 11978 grams baric sulphate and

   These then are the salts which constitute the original active material
of storage cells when that material is formed by the admixture of
sulphuric acid with litharge or minium respectively, and it is highly
probable that one or the other of these salts takes part in the elec
trolytic processes of the storage battery.                It is fortunate that these
hitlierto unknown salts (atid not the ordinary known sulphate; are

   An inspection of these equations discloses, in the case of the red
lead salt, a fact which has already been roughly observed in practice,
viz., that only half as much active material is electrolytically decom
posed on the negative as on the positive plates ; whence it follows
that the weight of active material on the negative plates need not
exceed one-half of that upon the positive plates; for, in the decom
position    of  the   electrolyte, equivalent quantities of oxygen and
hydrogen are evolved ; that is to say, two atoms of hydrogen for each
atom of oxygen.       But, in the decomposition of the red lead salt, four
times as many atoms of hydrogen are required to reduce the salt to
metallic lead as atoms of oxygen which are necessary to transform
the lead of the salt into peroxide.             When, however, the active
material of the positive plate has once been converted into peroxide
of lead, it seems probable that the red salt only is formed ; at all
events until the discharge at high potential is nearly completed, when
there are indications of the production of the buff-coloured salt. But
this is a point requiring further investigation.
   I have to thank Dr. F. R. Japp, F.R.S., for his assistance in the
analytical work of this investigation.

         June   12, 1889.
     Weber, in his classical memoir entitled ' De Aure et Anditu
  Hominis et Animalium.          Pars. 1. — De Anre Animalimn aquatilium,'
  published in 1820, was the first to show that in certain families of
  Physostomous Teleostei, which were subsequently grouped together
  under the name of Ostariophyseae by the late Dr. Sagemehl, there
  exists a peculiar connexion between the membranous             labyrinth of
  the internal ear and the air-bladder by means of a chain of movably
  interconnected "auditory" ossicles. Of the four families (Gymnotida?,
  Characinids, Gymnarchidae, and Siluridae) in which this singular
 mechanism is present, the Siluridae           have received but compara
 tively scanty attention since the publication of Weber's paper.
 Weber himself only described the air-bladder and auditory ossicles
 of one species (Silurtis glanis). Johannes Miiller, in his various com
 munications to the Berlin Academy during the years 1843-45, added
 somewhat to our knowledge of these structures, and notably by his
 discovery of the springfederapparat ; but Muller's attention was
 mainly directed to the grosser features in the anatomy of the air-
 bladder to the entire exclusion of all but the slightest reference to
 the important skeletal modifications which are associated with the
peculiar structure of that organ in the Siluridae.        Reissuer has given
a fairly complete account of the bone-encapsuled              air-bladder of
Bhinelepis, but by far the most valuable of the more recent contribu
tions to this branch of vertebrate morphology are the papers by
Professor Ramsay Wright, relating to the aberrant Siluroid
Hijpothalmus,       and to the more normal North American species,
Amiurus catus.        In his papers on Amiurus, Professor Wright was not
only    the  first to describe the fusion of the second, third, and fourth
vertebrae in the formation of what we have termed the "complex
vertebra" — a fact which could hardly have been discovered except
through embryological evidence — but was also the first to give an
accurate account of the skeletal relations and attachments of the air-
bladder in any one Siluroid.
    In this preliminary communication we propose to state briefly the
results of our investigations into the various modifications which
the air-bladder and the "auditory ossicles" undergo in ninety-two

  shall only give a brief resume of the morphological variations in
  the structures concerned, leaving their physiological bearing and
  the more general conclusions which the facts elucidated suggest,
 to a future and more detailed communication to this Society ;
 but before doing so we venture to suggest the need of a revision of
 the customary nomenclature of the so-called "auditory ossicles."
 From a mistaken idea of their homology with the Mammalian au
 ditory ossicles, "Weber gave to three of them the suggeslive but
                                        " incus," " malleus," and " stapes."

 Since Weber's time, however, it has become obvious that the
 " auditory " ossicles of the Ostariophyseoe are in no sense homologous
 with the similarly named bones of the Mammalian tympanum, and it
 is almost equally clear that the two series of ossicles have nothing
 in common with regard to their respective functions. With a view
 of avoiding all possibility of the confusion which may result from
 applying identical terms to structures widely different in origin and
 probably equally remote in function, we venture to suggest a different
                                                  " of Weber. Instead of
 nomenclature for the " auditory ossicles
                                  "
stapes we propose the name          scaphium," in allusion to the invariably

 For " malleus " we would substitute " tripus — a name suggested by

 forms one of the series of auditory ossicles in the Cyprinoid fishes,
but has no such physiological significance in the Siluridse, although
it is very generally present. As the name " claustrum " is open to
 none of the objections which can reasonably be urged against the reten
 tion of Weber's nomenclature of the three preceding ossicles, it may
with advantage be retained.         For the ossicles collectively, including
 the claustrum, and for obvious reasons, we would suggest the name
 " Weberian ossicles " as an
                                 appropriate designation, instead of '" audi
tory ossicles."
    In summarising the more noteworthy of the results of our investi
 gations into the morphology of the air-bladder and Weberian ossicles,
and the correlated modifications which the anterior vertebrae and their
processes undergo, we may indicate, in the first instance, such
features as appear to be common to nearly all Siluroids, and secondly,
those that are characteristic of particular genera or species.
    Although only demonstrated in one particular instance (the young
of Amiurus Cains') by Ramsay Wright, our researches lead us to

believe that the great majority of Siluroids agree with Amiurus in
having the centrum of the second vertebra, and the centra, neural
arches, and spinous processes of the third and fourth vertebrae indistin-
guishably combined to form an apparently single vertebra, for which
we venture to suggest the name of " complex vertebra."             The dis
covery by   Baudelot   that the " complex vertebra
                                                    "
                                                      of the Cyprinidae was
formed by the fusion of the second vertebral centrum with the third
vertebra, was due to the distinctness of these elements in one particular
species, but no evidence of a similar nature is available in any but
embryonic Siluridae.      In no adult Siluroid is there the slightest trace
of intervertebral spaces or sutures between the three confluent centra,
in fast, the only features which in any way suggest the composite
nature of the complex vertebra in that family are the perforation of
its neural arch by two pairs of spinal nerves and the occasional pre
sence of two pairs of nutrient foramina on the ventral surface of its
centrum.     This fusion of vertebrae in the formation of the " complex"
is almost invariably attended by the partial anchylosis of the latter to
the fifth vertebra, partly as the result of the firm sutural union of
their correlated elements, and in part due to the investment of the
lateral surfaces of their centra by a continuous deposit of superficial
bone.     Moreover, the conjoined vertebra, with the addition of the
centrum of the first, are so articulated to the skull that little, if any,
motion is possible, either between the individual vertebrae or between
the latter and the skull.      The centrum of the first vertebra is nearly
always    more or less  rudimentary.
   With the possible exception of the claustra no distinct or ossified
intercalary elements are ever present.
   The first vertebra very rarely has transverse processes, and even
when present (e.g., some species of Arias) they are extremely rudi
mentary. The transverse processes of the fourth vertebra, on the
contrary, are always greatly expanded, not infrequently divided into
anterior and posterior division by a cleft, and with or without the
aid of those belonging to the fifth vertebra form a more or less com
plete investment to the dorsal and anterior walls of the air-bladder.
The sixth is, as a rule, the first rib-bearing vertebra ; exceptionally,
however, it may be the fifth (Uallichrous), or even the seventh
 (Clarias).
   In   almost all cases, except where they are modified to form an
"elastic-spring-apparatus,"      the transverse processes of the fourth
vertebra, in addition to their characteristic relations to the air-bladder,
form a more or less rigid support to the proximal elements of the
pectoral girdle.
   Over a Bomewhat triangular area, on each side, between the ex-
occipital in front and the anterior margin of the arch of the complex
vertebra behind, the wall of the neural canal is formed only by fibrous

 or dLtcoidal nodule imbedded in the stout ligament (~ interossicular
 ligament"^ connecting the scaphium with the tripos, and even if
 horizontal and ascending processes are present, the ossicle never
 articu'ates with the centrum of the second Tertebra to which, as a
 modified neural arch, it belongs.          The tripos is always a tripartite
 ossicle with its posterior or crescentic process imbedded in the dorsal
 wall of the air-bladder;         the anterior process is directed forwards
parallel to the long axes of the complex and first centra, and opposite
 the external atrial aperture of its side is connected by the trans
versely-disposed interossicular ligament with the convex outer surface
of the spatulate process of the scaphium. The articular process
 ut-ually articulates with the lateral surface of the vertebral centrum
 Cthe third), of which it is a modified transverse process: very rarely
 (e.g., Auchetiipterue)      is the process directly continuous with the
neural arch.
    The Weberian ossicles, or at all events the free portion of the
tripes and the intercalarium, are enclosed within a membranous
saccus paravertebralis, the anterior wall of which is perforated by the
interossicular ligament as the latter passes forwards from the tripus
to its attachment to the scaphium.           Unlike the Cyprinidse, the com
plete closure of the external atrial aperture by the spatulate process
of the scaphium and the minute size of the hypoglossal foramen in
the Siluridse completely cut off all communication between the cavity
of the saccus and the cranial cavity.
    The first spinal or hypoglossal nerve perforates the exoccipital.
The second and third spinal nerves emerge from the neural canal
between the claustrum anteriorly and the arch of the complex
vertebra behind, but are invariably separated by the ascending
process of the intercalarium whenever that process is developed, as
in Macrones, Liocassis, and Bagroides.           The fourth and fifth spinal
nerves traverse the neural arch of the complex vertebra, and the sixth,
the arch of the fifth vertebra.         The additional spinal nerve described
by Sagemehl       in Silurus  glanis as  emerging between the claustrum and
Hie ascending process of the scaphium, we have never met with,
although our attention has been specially directed to that point.

      The air-bladder varies greatly in degree of development, not only
 in different genera, bnt in different species of the same genus. Even
 individual variations are not infrequent.       Very rarely does it exhibit
  the bipartite division into an anterior and a posterior sac so charac
  teristic of other families of Ostariophysero.        One of its most note
  worthy features is a tendency to lateral development, whereby the
  outer walls of the anterior portion become applied, through the
  divergence of the dorso-lateral and ventro-lateral muscles of the body
  wall, directly to the external skin ("lateral cutaneous areas ")• The
 insertion of the crescentic processes of the tripodes is always into the
 dorsal wall of the anterior chamber of the air-bladder in the normal
  Siluridae, or into the corresponding walls of the laterally situated air-
 sacs in the abnormal forms, and takes place in such a way that the
 fibres forming the anterior and lateral walls of each half of an anterior
 chambor, or of each air-sac, converge as they pass into and form the
 dorsal wall, and ultimately become inserted into the convex outer
 margin of the tripus of that side. Specialised fibres of the dorsal wall
  ("radial fibres") converge like the radii of a circle from the inner
 concave margin of the crescentic process, and are inserted either
 directly into the adjacent lateral surface of the complex centrum or
 indirectly through the intervention of an osseous nodule ("radial
 nodule "). Except, perhaps, in cases where the same effect is produced
by their partial encapsulation by bone, the anterior chamber of the
bladder, and its equivalent the laterally-situated air-sacs of the
abnormal Siluridae, generally have their walls so attached to, or
buttressed by, rigid portions of the axial skeleton, that only their
outer or lateral walls are capable by inward or outward bulging of
allowing variations in the internal capacity of the bladder to take
place.
     A    ductus  pueumatic us   is  very generally, but not      invariably,
present.
     In nearly all Siluroids the lateral growth of the air-bladder, and
the intimate relation of its outer walls to lateral cutaneous areas, have
led to the displacement of the lateral lobes of the liver and their
enclosure within peritoneal cul-de-sacs — a condition which usually
persists    even in cases   where   the air-bladder  has undergone    partial
atrophy.
     In many of the features to which reference has just been made, the
Siluridae differ from all the other families in which a Weberian
mechanism is present.
    As   a convenient   means of summarising the more important generic
and specific     variations, the Siluroids may be somewhat arbitrarily
divided into two principal groups : — (I) the Siluridce normales, and
(II) the Silnrida abn or males. In the former group the air-bladder
is always well developed and subdivided internally into three inter

communicating compartments, of which one is anterior and two pos
terior or lateral in position. Ihe anterior and dorsal walls of the
anterior chamber may be more or less completely invested by the
modified transverse processes of the fourth and fifth vertebrae, but
the latter do not form deep concave recesses or capsules for the
partial or complete enclosure of the entire air-bladder.
    In the Siiurida? abnormales on the contrary, the air-bladder is
always small relatively to the size of the Fish, and more or less dege
nerate, sometimes partially solid, but almost invariably includes two
laterally situated air-sacs with simple cavities, which together may
be regarded as eqaivalent to the anterior chamber of a normal
Siluroid.     Lateral compartments, as a rule, are absent altogether, or,
if present, are very rudimentary. Whatever its condition, the air-
bladder is almost always partially or completely enclosed within
transversely disposed bony recesses, formed either by the transverse
processes of the fourth vertebra alone, or in conjunction with those of
the fifth vertebra.
    Although a convenient method of classifying morphological facts,
it is obvious that this classification, based as it is upon so variable an
organ as the air-bladder, can have no genetic value.
                           (I.) Siluridve Xormales.
    Under this head may be included such genera              as  : — Plotosus,
  Wallago, Callichroux,    Cryptopterus (certain species). Eutropiits, Pan-
 fjaaius, Macroties, Rita, Pimelodus (certain species), Piramutana, Ariiis,
 Ofteugeniosus, Ozydoras, Malapterurus, and others.
     In the Silnroids included in this group the number of     rigidly inter
 connected    vertebrae  varies.   The first, the complex, and the fifth
 vertebrae are almost invariably so connected together that no motion
 is possible between them, and occasionally the sixth, the seventh, and
 even the eighth may be included in the series.         The rigidity of the
 complex and fifth vertebras, with the occasional     addition   of the sixth,
 may be further increased by the sutural union or partial anchylosis
 of their respective transverse processes. The anterior vertebra? are
 also firmly connected to the skull, generally by the articulation of the
 arch and spine of the third vertebra with the exoccipitals and
 supraoccipital, the transverse processes of the fourth vertebra with
 the post- temporals, and the spinous processes of the third and fourth
 vertebra? with the supraoccipital spine ; less frequently by the forma
 tion of interlocking accessory articular processes on the contiguous
 ventral margins of the basioccipital and the centra of the first and
 complex vertebra? (Macrones, Bagrus). In Arins the accessory pro
 cesses are very strongly developed, and by their downward growth
 and coalescence, form a stout, conical subvertebral process for the

1889.]           Contributions  to the   Anatomy   of Fishes.           315
attachment and support of the anterior wall of the air-bladder. In
some Siluroids the connexion of the sknll with the anterior vertebrae
may be rendered still more intimate by the articulation of the supra-
occipital spine with the expanded dermal plates of the first and
second interspinous bones, as in Aur.henipterus, Oxydoras, &c., or even
by the downward growth of paired processes from the supraoccipital
to unite with the dorsal surfaces of the transverse processes of the
fourth vertebra, as in Arras, Batraehocephalus, &c.
    The centrum of the first vertebra varies greatly in size, bnt is
always the smallest of the anterior vertebrae. Two pit-like sockets
are always found on its dorsal surface for the reception             of the
 globular condylar processes     of  the  scaphia.   The  complex  and  fifth
 centra are the largest, or, at all events, the longest of the anterior
 vertebrae, and, as a rule, their anterior and posterior concavities are
 unsymmetrically developed.       In nearly all cases these centra are not
 only elongated but laterally compressed, so as to form a prominent
 subvertebral keel, which gives rise to a deep groove along the medio-
 dorsal line of the anterior chamber of the air-bladder, and, at the
 same time, internally, to a prominent longitudinal ridge, partially
 subdividing the cavity of the chamber into two laterally bulging
 halves.    A fan-shaped subvertebral process may be developed from
 the ventral and anterior margin of the complex centrum for the
 support of the anterior wall of the bladder (e.g., Aurhpnaspis) , and
 the lateral surface of the same centrum is not infrequently thickened
 into oblique lateral ridges for the dorsal attachment of the anterior
 pillars of the anterior chamber.         For the same purpose a variously
 shaped    osseons  nodule  (" radial  nodule ") is attached to the dorsal
 extremity of each ridge, or in its absence directly to the centrum, and
 is either confluent therewith, or gntnrally, or by fibrous tissue only,
  connected thereto.    The radial nodules in addition to serving for the
 attachment    of the " anterior  pillars" receive also the insertion of the
 radial fibres of the tripus. Almost invariably a thin slender lamina
 of bone, the " radial ridge," is prolonged from each radial nodule,
  and, after passing obliquely upwards, outwards, and backwards,
  ventral to the posterior cardinal vein, blends with the ventral surface
  of the transverse process of the fourth vertebra.
     The neural arch of the complex vertebra is partially or completely
  anchylosed to the arch of the fifth vertebra, which, in turn, may be
  similarly connected with the arch of the sixth vertebra, or the rigid
 union of the different neural arches may be effected by a firm sutural
  union.
     The transverse processes of the fourth vertebra, very frequently
  those of the fifth vertebra, and more rarely those belonging to the
  sixth vertebra (Platystoma), are more or less expanded, and by their
  partial anchylosis or sutural union with one another, form on each

  side of the vertebral column a broad, wing-like plate of bone, the
  anterior margin of which is strongly decurved, for the investment of
  the dorsal and anterior walls of the anterior chamber of the air-
  bladder.   The transverse process of the fourth vertebra has a broad
  flat root, and may be simple, or, as is more usually the case, cleft
  more or less deeply into anterior and posterior divisions, of which the
  former is always decurved for a portion of its extent, and closely
 applied, even if not attached, to the lateral portion of the anterior
 wall of the bladder, in addition to its ligamentous or articular con
 nexion with the post-temporal.        In certain Siluroids the transverse
                                            "
 process becomes modified to form the         clastic-spring-apparatus," first
 described by Johannes Muller. In some of these forms (Malapterurus,
  Synodontis, Pangasius) each anterior division is almost completely
 separated from the posterior division, with an oblique origin from
 the arch of the complex           vertebra,    and, becoming     flexible and
 highly elastic, expands distally    into a  more   or  less oval plate, which
 is closely applied to the lateral portion of the anterior wall of the
 bladder. In others (Auehenipterus, Oxydoras) the anterior division
 also forms an
                 " elastic-spring-apparatus," but the posterior division is
 entirely wanting. In all such cases the modified transverse processes
 are provided with powerful protractor muscles, which have their
 origin on the posterior face of the skull, and their insertion into the
 anterior surfaces of the oval plates.
     The post-temporal bone always has a transversely, or obliquely,
 disposed inferior limb for articulation at its inner extremity with the
 lateral surface of the basioccipital, in addition to an ascending process
 for articulation with the pterotic and epiotic bones. Where the trans
 verse process of the fourth vertebra fails to articulate with and
 support the post-temporal, as is the case in all Siluroids possessing an
 "elastic-spring-apparatus," the inferior limb of the latter is exception
 ally massive, with an extensive articulation, or even partial anchv-
 losis, with the basioccipital or, in addition, with the exoccipital also.
 In other genera (Macroues, Bagrtcs, &c.) the inferior limb, in conjunc
 tion with the body of the same bone, may form a bony expansion or
post-temporal     plate, which, with the produced crescentic              distal
extremity of the anterior division of the transverse process of the
fourth vertebra, forms a slightly concave bony structure for the
support of the lateral portion of the anterior wall of the bladder.
 From being but faintly concave on its posterior face, the post-temporal
plate and the adjacent portion of the inferior limb may become deeply
excavated to form a goblet-shaped          cavity, into which a thin-walled
ccacal diverticulum of the air-bladder extends (Macrones anr).
    Apart from those which are characteristic of all Siluroids, no
important modifications of the hinder part of the skull are observable
in the normal members of the group, either as regards the more

or of its bilobed backward prolongation, the                           imparts."
The nniformity in the latter respect is so marked, that a description
of those structures as they occur in any one normal Siluroid will
 practically apply to all the others.
    As regards the internal ear, the condition of many of our specimens
was such that our observations were necessarily somewhat incomplete.
The condition of the membranons labyrinth, and its relations to the
 cavum sinus imparis and to the atrial cavities, were investigated in
a large number of Siluridae normales but with the purely negative
result that we could detect no variations of any importance from the
arrangement of these structures, already described for Amiurus catns
by Ramsay Wright, and for Silurus glanis by Weber. In all cases
 we found a transversely disposed ductus endolymphaticus connecting
 the two sacculi, and, attached to the ductus, a median pear-shaped
 sinus endolymphaticus projecting backwards into, and almost com
                       "
 pletely filling, the cavum sinus imparis."
    With the exception of the intercalarium, the Weberian ossicles
 exhibit but little variety in shape or in their relations to one another
 or to the atrial cavities and air-bladder.             The variations in the
 condition of the tripus relate principally to the degree and shape of
 the curvature of its posterior or crescentic process.          In some genera
 (Auchenipterus,    Oxydoras)   the  crescentic   process   is almost   straight;
 in others almost hook-shaped (Plotosui) ; and between these extremes
 the process may exhibit almost every degree of curvature.             A ventral
 ridge on the root of the crescentic process, to receive the insertion of
 a slip of fibres from the adjacent anterior wall of the bladder, is very
 generally present, and varies in size according to the thickness of the
 walls of the bladder.        In some Siluroids (Macrones, Liocasis) the
 outer convex margin of the process may be increased for the purpose
 of fibrous attachment by the addition of an outwardly directed heel-
 like process. The articular process of the tripus is usually distinct
 from the complex centrum, with which, however, it articulates at the
 lx>ttom of a deep pit-like depression.       It is very rare, as in one genus
 (Auchenipterus),    for the process   to be flexible and elastic, and directly
 continuous by an oblique origin with the anterior part of the neural
 arch of the complex vertebra like the adjacent and similarly elastic
 root of the
                 " elastic-spring-apparatus."       The proportional lengths
 of the anterior and crescentic processes vary somewhat in different
 forms ; generally, the two processes are of approximately equal length,
 but when otherwise it is the anterior which is the longer.
    The intercalarium varies greatly in development.             Usually a small
 osseous nodule imbedded in the interossicular ligament, the inter
 calarium may, in addition, be prolonged therefrom as a horizontal

spicule which terminates in the fibrous wall of the neural canal,
between the arch of the complex vertebra and the ascending process
of the scaphium, near the dorso-lateral margin of the anterior portion
of the complex centrum, with which, however, it is in no way directly
attached (Cryptopterus,      Callichrous).     In a few genera (Macrones,
Liocassis,   Pseudobagrus,    &c.)   the   horizontal   process is prolonged
upwards into a vertically disposed or ascending process, which also
lies in the fibrous wall of the neural canal, behind and parallel to the
ascending process of the scaphium.          In all cases where an ascending
process is present   it lies between   the paired foramina for the exit of
the dorsal and ventral roots of the second and third spinal nerves.
   The only variations noticed in condition of the scaphium relate to
the occasional absence of an ascending process.
   Glaustra are invariably present, but vary greatly in size, from the
condition of extremely slender spicules to somewhat triangular plates
 (Pangasius burhanani).
   The air-bladder has the same fundamental structure in all the
S. normales.     In all cases the organ is more or less cordate in shape,
and is subdivided internally by a "["•shaped arrangement of a primary
transverse septum and a longitudinal septum into three intercom
municating compartments, of which one is anterior and transversely
disposed, occupying the anterior third of the bladder, and two
posterior or lateral longitudinally arranged chambers, constituting the
posterior two-thirds of the bladder.         The dorsal wall of the anterior
chamber is closely moulded to      the  ventral and lateral surfaces of the
complex and fifth centra, including the subvertebral keel which these
centra form, and also to the ventral surfaces of the modified trans
verse processes of the fourth and fifth vertebrae. The lateral portions
of the anterior wall of the chamber are also partially buttressed by
the decurved anterior margins of the transverse processes of the
fourth vertebra, with or without the aid of the expanded inferior
processes of the post-temporals          (post-temporal plates), while the
median portion of the wall is not infrequently supported by a sub-
vertebral process (Arius). The lateral compartments, on the other
hand, are neither invested by bone, nor are they in any way directly
attached to the skeleton, but lie free in the abdominal cavity.       Except
in relation to the size of the Fish, the variations in the capacity of the
anterior chamber as compared with those of the lateral compartments
are but slight, and, as a rule, any increase or diminution in the
relative size of the bladder is mainly due to variations in the size of
the lateral chambers.        With the exception of two genera (Rita and
Aspredo) included in this group, the capacity of the anterior chamber
is always much smaller than the combined capacities of the two
lateral chambers, and, in one of the two exceptions referred to, the
partial suppression of the lateral compartments is compensated by the

 development of two large lateral caeca from the anterior chamber.
 Apart from its partial longitudinal construction into two laterally
 bulging halves, — a separation which in some cases may be emphasised
 by the formation of one or two longitudinally arranged and inwardly
projecting ridge-like aggregation of fibres from the median line of
 the posterior, ventral, and anterior walls, — the cavity of the anterior
 chamber has smooth walls, and is not subdivided by the growth of
 internal septa.
    The lateral compartments         may also have undivided cavities
 (Auchenaspis,    Callichrous, and Silurus), but not infrequently they are
 rendered more inexpansible, and possibly at the same time less
 compressible, by the formation of a variable number of secondary
 transverse septa (e.g., Macrones), which incompletely subdivide each
 chamber into a series of transversely arranged, intercommunicating
 spaces.   Occasionally the excessive development of these septa and
 their union by root-like bundles of fibres, which pass between their
opposed surfaces, may lead to the formation of a thick trabecular
network of fibrous columns or bands, and to the partial obliteration of
the cavities of the two chambers (Pangasius).
    The width of the primary transverse septum forming the posterior
 wall of the anterior chamber varies greatly in different Siluroids.     In
 some (e.g., Auchenaspis) the septum is co-extensive with the width of
 the air-bladder, although contracted dorsally to admit of the lateral
chambers      communicating with the anterior chamber ; in others
(Callichrous, Cryptopterus) the septum is reduced to the condition of
a narrow, but stout, column-like aggregation of fibres.
    Caecal appendages to the anterior and lateral compartments          are
not uncommon.         The anterior chamber may have small anterior caeca
 (Macrones    nor), or   much smaller antoro-lateral caeca (Osteogeniosus).
Lateral caeca are sometimes present, and may either take the form of
large funnel-shaped structures, which extend the whole length of the
abdominal cavity and are entirely free from internal subdivisions
(Rita), or may occur as small forwardly directed outgrowths, sub
divided internally by a network of fibrous bundles, and communicating
with the anterior chamber by a number of slit-like orifices in its
lateral walls (Platy stoma). Very rarely (Gallophysis) are the lateral
caeca so numerous as to form a wreath round the lateral regions of
the chamber.       The lateral compartments are frequently either con
stricted  or prolonged into a posterior caecal appendage.    This may be
a longer or shorter tubular, or a slightly oval structure, and confined
to the abdominal cavity (Pangasius buchanani, Bagroides melanopterus),
or a long, tapering, tubular structure, which, after traversing the
abdomen, extends for some distance along the right side of the tail,
between the haemal arches and the lateral musculature (Cryptopterus
micronema).      In some cases the postorjor caecum is very largo, and in

shape an elongated oval body (Pangasius djambal, Malapteruras
e'ectricus), or it may be flattened and leaf-like (Pavgasius macronema).
In one instance (Oxydoras) it is very rudimentary. The existence of
a pair of rudimentary posterior caeca is very rare (Auchenipterus
obscurus). Very generally the longitudinal septum extends backwards
into the posterior CEecum, and subdivides its cavity into two distinct
lateral canals or chambers, which communicate anteriorly with the
proper lateral compartments of the bladder. Not infrequently the
single or double cavity of the caecu m is partially subdivided internally
by a series of circularly disposed, inwardly projecting ridges (e.g.,
Malapterurus).       In some Siluroids (Pangarius), where the lateral
chambers are largely occupied by a trabecular network of fibrous
bundles, the cavity of the posterior caecum is largely obliterated by
the formation of a similar growth.             It may be remarked that in
                                        "                            "
nearly all   the  Siluroids   with   an   elastic-spring-apparatus     that we
have examined, posterior cieca were present, although in regard to
their size and the extent to which their cavities are subdivided, or
partially obliterated, considerable variety exists.        In two species only
 (Auclienipterus   nodosus  and Pangasius micronemd) are these structures
entirely absent.
    In all the normal Siluroids, without an exception, a ductus pneu-
maticus is present and opens into the anterior chamber in the median
line of its ventral wall, and immediately in front of the ventral margin
of the primary transverse septum.
    Not only is the anterior compartment of the air-bladder more or
less completely invested by bone on its dorsal and anterior surfaces,
 but its walls are attached to rigid portions of the axial skeleton and
 to movable ossicles at certain special points.           As to the nature and
extent of the fixed skeletal attachments, there is substantial uni
 formity in the different members of the group, and the physiological
 effect of such skeletal connexions is, in the great majority of cases,
 the same, viz., to render the anterior, dorsal, ventral, and posterior
 walls incapable of participating in any distension of the chamber,
 which, consequently, must solely depend upon the movements of the
 lateral walls.    The posterior wall, i.e., the primary transverse septum,
 is always attached by its dorsal margin to the ventral and lateral
 surfaces of either the complex or the fifth centrum — rarely to the sixth
 centrum ; laterally to this the dorsal edge of the septum is invariably
 attached to the ventral surfaces of the transverse processes of the fifth
 vertebra, or to those of the fourth vertebra, or exceptionally to the
 corresponding processes of the sixth vertebra ; and, in addition, a
 sheet of fibres is generally prolonged forwards, on either side of the
 complex centrum, into the dorsal wall, where it eventually becomos
 attached to the radial ridge of its side. We propose to speak of these
                                   " posterior          " of the
 attachments as fprming the                     pillars           compartment.

 As the anterior wall is usually more or less efficiently buttressed by
 the transverse processes of the fourth vertebra, or by post-temporal
plates, or median subvertebral processes, the extent of its attachment
to the skeleton varies inversely with the extent to which it is invested
 or supported by bone. The median portion of the wall is always
attached dorsally to the ventral surface and sides of the anterior
portion of the complex centrum, often by means of laterally situated,
oblique, bony ridges, and also to the radial nodules. Laterally to this,
on each side, the anterior wall may be so completely invested by bone
as to be free from any special connexion or attachment to rigid
portions of the axial skeleton {e.g., Macrones) ; or in correlation with a
less complete bony support, the outer stratum of the tunica externa
of the anterior wall may separate dorsally from the inner stratum and
become firmly inserted into the decurved anterior margin of the
transverse process of the fourth vertebra (e.g., Arius, Auchenaspis,
Pimelodus).     The dorsal attachment of the median portion of the
anterior wall to the radial nodules and the complex centrum occurs in
all the normal Siluroids, and may be regarded as constituting the
" anterior pillars " of the compartment. The ventral wall
                                                                may also be
considered as rigidly attached to the skeleton, both in front and behind,
inasmuch as its inner stratum of longitudinally disposed fibres, some
times thickened into stout inwardly projecting ridges, extends into
both the anterior and posterior walls, and shares the skeletal attach
ments of the anterior and posterior pillars.         Although, as a rule,
extremely thin, the median portion of the dorsal wall, over an area
bounded in front and behind by the anterior and posterior pillars, and
laterally by the dorsal walls of the two bulging halves of the chamber,
is always firmly attached to the ventral and lateral surfaces of the
complex centrum, and possibly also to those of the fifth centrum.
   The attachment of the walls of the anterior chamber to moveable
ossicles (the tripodes) is effected by the convergence of the fibres of
the anterior and lateral walls into the dorsal wall in the form of two
triangular sheets, and their ultimate insertion into the crescentic
processes of the tripodes, which are situated near the anterior and
inner corners of the lateral halves of the anterior chamber.            The
variations  in  the extent   to which   these fibres  are attached   to  the
tripodes are mainly confined to one feature.       A slip of fibres derived
from the median portion of the anterior wall is always inserted
dorsally into the ventral ridge of each tripus, or directly into the
ventral surface of the ossicle when the ridge fails to be developed.
Laterally to this point the fibres forming the whole thickness of the
tunica externa of the anterior and lateral walls may converge in the
dorsal wall and become attached to the tripodes {e.g., Macrones) ; or
as in many other Siluroids (e.g., Arius, Pimelodus,        &c.) the outer
stratum of the anterior wall is continuously attached by its dorsal
                                                              2 a 2

 edge to the transverse     process of the fourth vertebra, and only the
  comparatively   thin  inner  stratum, in addition to the fibres of both
 strata from the lateral walls, extend into the dorsal walls and consti
 tute the triangular sheets. In the latter case but few, if any, of the
 fibres of the inner stratum reach the tripodes, which, in consequence,
  only receive the direct insertion of the outer stratum of the tunica
 externa of the lateral walls.
    Radial fibres arising from the radial nodules and inserted into the
 concave inner margins of the crescentic processes of the tripodes are
 invariably differentiated from the dorsal wall of the anterior chamber.
 In one instance (Auchenipterus), where the function of the radial
 fibres is taken by the flexible and highly elastic articular process of
 the tripus, the former are but scantily and feebly developed.
    As we have previously pointed oat, the lateral compartments of the
 air-bladder are neither invested by bone nor are they directly attached
 to the skeleton, but project freely into the anterior portion of the
 abdominal cavity. The most important feature in connexion with
 their structure, apart from their relatively greater capacity when
 compared with the anterior chamber, is their separation by a common
 longitudinal septum and the frequently septate condition of their
 cavities.   Physiologically, the lonsritudinal septum and the secondary
transverse septa subserve the double function of rendering the
 lateral chambers almost incapable of distension, and at the same time
 diminishing their susceptibility to the effects of external pressure.
    Although we have never been able to detect the presence of
intrinsic muscular fibres in the walls of the air-bladder, powerful
extrinsic muscles are present in several Siluroids.       In Platystoma
tigrinum, Pimelodus maculatus, P. ornatus, and Piramutana piramuta,
a powerful muscle takes origin from the posterior face of the skull,
on each side of the foramen magnum, and is inserted into' nearly the
whole extent of the corresponding half of the ventral surface of the
anterior chamber.      As the contraction of these muscles must forcibly
compress the anterior chamber we shall call them the
                                                             " compressor
muscles
           " of the air-bladder. They probably occur in many other
Pimelodinae, but, so far as our investigations are concerned, are
probably confined to that group.
    The presence of compressor muscles is invariably associated with
the existence of a pair of much smaller muscles which arise from the
exoccipitals, and are inserted into the anterior wall of the anterior
chamber of the bladder.       The tendon of each muscle has its insertion
into the anterior wall immediately external to the complex centrum,
and the insertion coincides with the extension of a slip of fibres from
the inner surface of the anterior wall to the ventral ridge and concave
inner margin of the crescentic process of the tripus. As the contrac
tion of these muscles must evidently have the effect of limiting the

violent excursions of the tripod es which might otherwise take place
when the anterior chamber is forcibly compressed by the contraction
of its compressor muscles, we would suggest for each the name of
" tensor tripodis."
   An " elastic-spring-apparatus," provided with powerful protractor
muscles, has already been described by Johannes Miiller as existing in
the South American genera Auchenipterus, Doras, and Euanemus, and
in the African Siluroids Synodoutis and Malapterurus. To this list
our investigations enable us to add the South American form
 Oxydoras brevis, and the East Indian species Pangasius buchanani, P.
djambal, P. juaro, and P. macronema.       The absence of this mechanism
in one species of Pangasius, viz., P. micronema, while present in all
the remaining species of the genus that came under our notice, is an
interesting and noteworthy fact.
   In almost all normal Siluroids the lateral or outer walls of the
anterior chamber of the air-bladder are more or less extensively and
intimately applied to lateral cutaneous areas, and this relation of the
two structures is always brought about by the divergence of the
dorso-lateral and ventro-lateral muscles of the trunk, combined with
the lateral extension of the anterior portion of the bladder,
                        (II.) Siluridce Abnormales.
   Omitting for the present all reference to such extremely aberrant
forms as Hypothalmus, Rhinelepis, and the various Lo'ricaroid Siluridae,
 we confine our summary of this group to the various genera and
species that have come directly under our notice.           These are: —
 Glorias, Saccobranchus, Eutropiichthys, Cryptopterus (two species),
Ailia, Bchilbichthys, Silondia, Acrochordoniclithys, Akysis, Pimelodus
 (two species), Bagarius, Olyptosternum, Amblyceps, Cetopsis, Caiio-
mystax.
   In all these forms the series of rigidly interconnected vertebrae
includes only the first, the complex, and the fifth vertebrae, the sixth
being almost invariably free. The rigid articulation of the anterior
vertebrae to the skull is as marked in this group as in the preceding
one, and is brought about by precisely similar means.        The centrum
of the first vertebra  is usually  somewhat   more   rudimentary than in
the normal forms, and neither it nor the basioccipital or the complex
centrum are ever provided with accessory articular processes. The
complex vertebra has the same general characters as in the foregoing
group. Radial ridges and nodules are generally but are not invari
ably present ; exceptionally the radial ridge may have no connexion
at its inner extremity with the complex centrum (Ularias, Glypto-
sternum), and when this is the case the radial nodule may be absent,
or confluent with the inner extremity of the radial ridge and widely
separated from the complex centrum (Clarias).

    The mosb characteristic of the many skeletal modifications which
 are exhibited in this group is the formation of more or less complete
 osseous grooves or funnels for the partial or complete enclosure of
 the air-bladder.   Such recesses are formed by the transverse processes
 of the fourth vertebra, either singly, or in conjunction with those of
 the fifth vertebra, and vary greatly in depth and in the extent to
 which they are surrounded by bone. They may be comparatively
 shallow and widely open on the ventral side, as in Akyris, Bagarius,
 and Olyptosternnm ; or may take the form of deep, transversely
-disposed grooves, contracted distally and somewhat expanded proxi-
  mally (Pimelodus sapo, Eutropiichthys, and Schilbichthys) ; or they may
 partake of the nature of transversely arranged bony cylinders or
'funnels, open distally in the dry skeleton, but otherwise with more or
 less complete osseous walls (Clarias, Callomystax, and Cetopsis).    The
 transverse processes of the fourth vertebra always form the dorsal and
 anterior walls of the recesses, and sometimes furnish, in addition, a
 posterior wall, or even incomplete ventral walls; rarely do they com
 pletely enclose tubular recesses (Cetopsis) ; more frequently the
 posterior walla are formed by the transverse process of the fifth
 vertebra (Clarias, Callomystax).     Exceptionally, a slender, lateral,
 bohy outgrowth from each of the longitudinal ridges bounding the
 aortic groove in the region of the complex centrum may become
 attached to the ventral wall of the corresponding lateral air-sac
  (Ghjptosternum, Bagarius) ; or, as in one instance (Clarias), the out
 growths may be strongly developed and form no inconsiderable
 portion of the ventral walls of the two osseous funnels. Ventrally,
 the shallow recesses may be closed by a tough fibrous membrane which
 also invests thn corresponding walls of the contained air-sacs (e.g.,
 Bagarius) ; and by the same means vacuities in the walls of the more
 complete bony funnels are entirely closed (Clarias, Callomystax).    The
 formation of a horse-shoe-shaped recess by the transverse processes
 ot the fourth and fifth vertebras in conjunction with plate-like lateral
 outgrowths from the aortic ridges, which is open laterally and behind
 in the dry skeleton, occurs only in one genus (Ailia). In whatever
 way the osseous recesses or capsules may be formed they are almost
 always open laterally or distally in the dry skeleton, and closed by
lateral cutaneous areas in the fresh specimen.
    The condition of the air-bladder in this group is singularly varied,
and in proportion to the bulk of the Fish is always extremely small.
Many of its most characteristic features are clearly the results of
atrophy and degeneration.      The principal modifications appear to be
due to the partial or complete suppression of the lateral chambers and
the subdivision of the anterior chamber into two laterally situated
cavities or air-sacs, either by the solidification of the mesial portion
of the bladder or by more or less complete longitudinal constriction.

 1881).]          Contributions   to the  Anatomy  of Fishes.            325
  In all cases the atrophied bladder is partially or completely enclosed
 within osseous recesses. In one or two instances (e.g., Schilbichthys
 and probably also Eutropiichthys) the air-bladder, although solid
 mesially, nevertheless retains in each half traces of its original and
 normal division into anterior and lateral compartments, but the ex
 treme thickness of its walls, and the small size of its internal cavities,
 afford sufficient proof of its degenerate and fnnctionless condition.
 Solidification of the central portion of the bladder may reduce the cavity
 of that organ to the condition of a circular canal of fairly uniform
 calibre, surrounding a massive central pillar (Silondia).       Two species
 afford good examples of the extreme variability to which degenerate
 structures are liable. In one (A ilia), the bladder assumes the
 shape of a tnbular horse-shoe, and is almost solid, except at its hollow
 forwardly curved cornua ; in the other (Pimelodus sapo) the organ is
 solid mesially, and of its two pairs of forwardly curved lateral branches
 one only is hollow and receives the insertion of the tripodes.       In one
case (Gryptopterus micropus, and possibly also C. hexaptera) the bladder
consists of two partially separated lateral sacs, but its degenerate
character is betrayed by the partial obliteration of the cavity of the
posterior half by a network of fibrous bundles.
   The more frequent condition of the air-bladder in this group is in
the form of two simple, pyriform or globose, thin-walled, laterally
placed air-sacs, which are either quite distinct or connected by an
intermediate tubular portion (e.g., Glyptosternum, Cetopis, Acrochordon-
ichthys,    Bagarius, Akysis, Clarias, Saccobranchus, and Pimelodus
pulcher).
    The skeletal attachments of the air-bladder both to rigid portions
of the skeleton and to movable tripodes exhibit much the same
extent and kind of variation as we have already described in the case
of the anterior chamber of the more normal Siluroids.         In such forms
as possess rudiments of lateral chambers and of transverse and longi
tudinal septa the attachments of the air-bladder to the vertebral
column and its processes are quite normal, and even in many
members of this group where those structures are entirely wanting,
the skeletal attachments are in the main very similar to those of the
normal Siluroids.      Thus, in those cases in which the air-bladder is
represented    by two  entirely distinct or mesially intercommunicating
sacs, the dorsal attachment of the primary transverse septum is repre
sented either by the skeletal attachment of the dorsal edge of the
median portion of the posterior wall to the ventral surface and sides
of the complex centrum (Pimelodus pulcher), or by a similar attach
ment of the corresponding margin of the posterior wall of each lateral
air-sac to the transverse processes of the fourth or fifth vertebra
 (Bagarius, Glijptosternum, Clarias).       The median and tubular portion
of the   air-bladder, when    present,   is always thin, and its firm attach

 merit to the ventral surface of the complex centrum evidently corre
 sponds to the skeletally attached medio-dorsal portion of a normal
 anterior chamber (e.g., Pimelodus pulcher).         Whether this inter
 mediate tubular portion be present or absent, the inner portion of the
 anterior wall of each air-sac is always attached to the contiguous
lateral surface of the complex centrum, or to the radial nodule, or even
 to both, after the fashion of the anterior pillars of the normal bladder.
 Occasionally also, as in such normal forms as Arius, the outer stratum
of the anterior wall of each air-sac may be dorsally connected with
the decurved anterior margin of the transverse process of the fonrth
vertebra (e.g., Bagarius, Qlyptosternum) .
    As a rule, where the air-bladder is more completely surrounded by
its osseous capsules, the rigid skeletal attachments of the former are
not so obvious as in those cases in which the bony investment is but
partial.
    The relations of each lateral cavity or air-sac to the crescentic
process of the tripus imbedded in its dorsal wall are almost precisely
the same as in each half of the anterior chamber in a normal Siluroid.
The convergence of the fibres composing the anterior, lateral, and
dorsal walls of each air-sac, and their insertion into the crescentic
process of the tripus, takes place in nearly all the forms included in
the present group, but in two or three instances (e.g., Glyptosternum)
the dorsal wall has partially or completely atrophied, or at all events
has so far degenerated that it is extremely improbable that its fibres
can possibly exert any pull upon the tripus as the result of any dis
tension of the air-bladder.
    Radial fibres are always present, but in some cases are less obviously
specialised than in others, and, where radial nodules are absent, pass
directly from the lateral surfaces of the complex centrum to the
inner or concave margins of the crescentic processes of the tripodes.
   Broadly speaking, it may be affirmed that the skeletal attachments
of the air-bladder in the Siluridee abnormales, both to rigid portions
of the skeleton and to movable ossicles, are in substantial agreement
with those of the anterior chamber of the S. normales.
   The Weberian ossicles undergo but slight modifications in the
different members of this group. Claustra are occasionally absent,
and even when present are but feebly developed spicules of bone.        As
a rule, the scaphium has no ascending process, but only spatulate and
condylar processes. The intercalarium may be absent, in which case
the interossicular ligament is extremely short, or represented          by
a very small nodule in the usual position; horizontal and ascending
processes are invariably wanting.         The tripus is very variously
modified.    A ventral ridge is rarely present. The crescentic process
may be curiously angulated and heeled (Clarias) ; nearly straight
with a pointed posterior extremity (e.g., Bagarius) j or but slightly

  1889.]          Contributions to the Anatomy   of Fishes.            327
 curved (e.g., Glyptosternum).     The articular process is usually long
 and tapering.
     Lateral cutaneous areas are almost invariably well marked and, as
 a rule, close the distal openings of the osseous recesses in which the
 air-bladder is lodged, but their relations to the outer walls of the
 latter vaiy considerably.     In some forms, the structures are in close
 contact (e.g., Gallomystax), bat more frequently they are separated
 by a considerable interval which is usually occupied by the lateral
 lobes of the liver, or by the anterior end of the mesonephros, or even
 by both.
     A ductus pneumaticua may be present or absent. It is usually
 present where the laterally situated air-sacs are connected by an
 intermediate tubular portion, but is absent whenever the two air-
 sacs are completely separated.
     The genus Cetopsis, referred to above, is one of the genera of
  Siluridae in which J. Miiller denied the existence of an air-bladder.
 In a specimen of G. candira, however, we found a rudimentary air-
 bladder in the form of two small oval sacs. Each sac was not more
 than 6 mm. in length, and was enclosed within the slightly dilated
 proximal extremity of a tubular or flask-shaped recess, enclosed by
 the transverse process of the fourth vertebra.      The anterior wall of
 the recess was perforated by a small foramen, near the complex
centrum, through which the tripus passed from its attachment to the
 air-bladder to its connexion      anteriorly with the scaphium.        As
 Cetopsis is the last of the nine genera of Silaroids in which J. Miiller
 affirmed the absence of an air-bladder about which any doubt
 remained, it is now not unreasonable to assume that an air-bladder
 and Weberian ossicles are universally present in the group.
    Of the more general conclusions which the foregoing data seem to
 ns to warrant, we shall not now do more than draw attention to the
following : —
    (I.) The air-bladder and the Weberian mechanism in the Siluridae
are reducible to a common fundamental type, which is perhaps not
very dissimilar to that illustrated by the condition of these structures
in such normal forms as Macrones or Arius. From such a type the
extraordinary variations met with in different genera, or even in
different species of the same genus, are readily derivable, such varia
tions being in part due to increasing specialisation — the result of
physiological causes — and partly to the effects of disuse and consequent
degeneration.
    (II.)  The air-bladder exhibits a far higher degree of specialisation
in its relation to the Weberian apparatus than in any other
Ostariophyseae, but this fact renders it specially liable to degenera
tion, when the necessity for the exercise of its special function has,

328                            Prof. F. Smith.                  [June   20,
from any change of habit on the part of the Fish, ceased to exist ; and
hence the widespread degeneracy of that organ.
    (III.) In all the Siluridaa normales the air-bladder is a rndimentary
and more or less fnnctionless structure, and the numerous modifica
tions which it presents in this group afford abundant illustrations of
the extreme variability to which all degenerate organs are liable.
    (IV.) As far as the evidence at our command will enable us to
generalise, it seems extremely probable          that the degeneracy of
the air-bladder in the S. normales is due to their assumption of a
ground habit, whereby the continued existence of an air-bladder,
 capable of functioning as a hydrostatic apparatus, is rendered
unnecessary.
    (V.) That inasmuch      as the assumption of a ground habit is almost
invariably attended by degeneration of the air-bladder, which must
have the effect of rendering the Weberian apparatus inoperative, it
 seems to us a reasonable inference that the mechanism       in question is
related   neither to the function of audition as Weber contended, nor
to the appreciation of varying atmospheric pressures, as suggested bj
 Sagemehl, but rather to the perception of the varying hydrostatic
 pressures to which the Fish is continually exposed.      (Hasse's theory).
    (VI.)  Certain   facts appear   to throw  some  light on the nature of
 the Weberian ossicles.      The discovery of ascending processes to the
 intercalaria, which form part of the wall of the neural canal, and are
interposed between the foramina for the exit of the second and third
 special nerves, is confirmatory of the view, first suggested by Baudelot
 and supported by Ramsay Wright, that the ossicles in question
 represent the metamorphosed         neural arch of the second vertebra.
 The mode of origin of the tripodes in Auchenipterus, if not due to
 secondary fusion with the arch of the complex vertebra, but to the
 retention of a primitive continuity, is also confirmatory of the views
 of the same morphologists, that those ossicles represent the transverse
 processes of the third vertebra.

       1889.
   I   have attempted in the following paper to record the results
obtained from a series of analyses of the urine of the horse in health.
    When   I first commenced     my subject  I  was under the impression

1889.]           The Chemistry       of  the   Urine   of the Home.              329
that, with the exception of the following references,* the literature of
the subject was remarkably bare. It is true that nothing had been
                                           '
done in England, but on the Continent, in Germany in particular, the
nrine of the horse has received especial consideration. My attention
was later called to the following references.t
    My difficulty at starting was to obtain the whole twenty-four hours'
urine ; for this purpose I constructed a stall with sides which sloped
towards the centre ; running down the centre was a covered drain,
the cover being perforated, and arranged in segments so as to allow
of thorough cleaning; this drain led to the rear of the stall, anil
emptied into a vessel sunk in the ground suitably protected against
ingress of foreign material. The entire apparatus was made in cast
iron, and protected against rust.
    The arrangement was found to give absolute satisfaction.
    This plan of collecting the urine is nothing like so complicated as
 that used by Munk and others in Germany, which consists of a bag
 into which the penis is placed, the bag being secured by numerous
straps around the belly and between the thighs. There are very few
 English horses which would allow such an apparatus as Munk's to be
 strapped under the belly.          I shall use this appliance to collect the
urine from sick animals, for it is likely that these will not object to
 wear Munk's contrivance.
    The horse to be experimented upon was previously weighed, when
 considered necessary, and was then placed in this stall and tied up for
 twenty-four hours; the stall was made very narrow so that the
 animal could not possibly shift from his position.                To keep the feces
 out of the drain, a little clean straw was put down.
    One great object I had in view in making these experiments was to
ascertain the difference between the urine of work and that of repose.
 The only way in which I could get approximate results with regard
 to the former was by working the animal for one or more days, and
then collecting the urine for the last twenty-four hours ;                 I always
 took the precaution of ascertaining in every case the urine of repose
 after at least two or three days' rest.
    The total number of complete analyses made was fifty-fonr, and
 these extended over a period of two years ; the total number of
 urines examined was ninety-six. Influence of season, work, diet, sex,
age, <tc., were most carefully observed.                None of my results were

and that even from day to day the same horse will excrete a fluid of
very varying composition, though his condition of diet, &c., remains
absolutely the same. I am not prepared at present to offer an ex
planation of this condition, which so seriously affects my tables of
mean results as to render them only approximately true.
                       Physical Characters of   the Urine.
    Turbidity. — The normal nrine is invariably turbid, due to the
suspension of the carbonates of lime and magnesia which precipitate
 themselves in still greater abundance as the urine cools and stands,
and undergoes ammoniacal fermentation .
    The amount of salts in suspension is in some cases remarkable, the
most common being the carbonates of lime and magnesia, which
I  have in the majority of my analyses estimated separately as sus
pended lime and magnesia.          Boiling the urine by driving off C02
precipitates more of the lime salts. In one or two cases after the
urine had stood some days, a hard scum, quite crystalline, has formed
on its surface ; this has consisted of crystals of lime carbonate.      Only
once in ninety-six observations had I a perfectly clear urine presented
for examination, a urine which threw down no deposit on cooling and
standing, and was in most of its physical features closely allied to
human urine.
    Smell. — Perfectly fresh urine has a faint but distinctly ammoniacal
 smell ; the fluid which represents the twenty-four hours' excretion is
 always powerfully ammoniacal.        This latter creates a difficulty with
 regard   to the  determination   of urea,  for it is impossible to say how
 much of the ammonia is due to changes in the urea, and how much is
 preformed ammonia.        I  have always felt this a trouble throughout
 the work, but will later explain how         I  have endeavoured to over
come it.
    Reaction. — This is always alkaline, sometimes faintly, but in the
 majority of cases strongly so. The alkalinity shown by test papers
 is produced by a fixed and by a volatile substance — the volatile is the
 ammonia, the fixed is probably a salt of potash.          It is obvious that
 the amonnt of volatile alkalinity present depends greatly upon the
 time of year, the condition of the urine (those containing most mucus
 containing most volatile alkalinity), and the length of time which
 has elapsed before the estimation is made.         As remarked in the last
paragraph,     how   much  of the  volatile  alkalinity in urine twenty-four
hours old is due to preformed ammonia, and how much to the
ammonia formed at the expense of the urea, it is difficult to determine ;
 it is probable, however, that the preformed ammonia in urine is given

1889.]           The Chemistry    of the Urine of  the Horse.            331
off in twenty-four hours.       Calculated as ammonia, the mean volatile
alkalinity in twenty-four hours old urine amounts to 7-1016 grams for
work and 7'8534 for rest ; these amounts I have added on to the urea,
as  I am   convinced   from long observation that they are formed from
this substance.       The fixed alkalinity expressed in terms of KHO
gives   a mean   of 2'954  grams in urine twenty-four hours old, but in
perfectly fresh urine it is equivalent to 4-8856 grams of KHO in
twenty-four hours ; this latter is probably too high.
    Consistence. — A large quantity of mucus in the urine is by no
means an uncommon condition ; this is particularly the case in mares,
the urine being so thick and tenacious (more like linseed oil in con
sistence) that it takes some hours to get sufficient through the filter
for analysis.
   The smaller the bulk of fluid excreted, the larger the amount of
mucus it contains ; it then becomes sticky and difficult to work with,
still, it is a perfectly natural condition. In a urine of average con
sistence I have found 21 '9 grams of mucus, and in one very tenacious
31-396 grams in twenty-four hours.
    Specific Gravity . — The mean specific density is 1036, the highest
registered was 1050 and the lowest 1014. The formulae of Trapp and
Christison will not apply to the urine of the horse.       Solids calculated
by these give untrustworthy results.
    Quantity of Urine. — The mean amount of fluid excreted by working
horses is 4474 c.c. and in animals that rest 4935 c.c.          The largest
amount produced in twenty-four hours was 11,300 c.c., and the
smallest quantity secreted 2000 c.c. Neither season, sex, or age pro
duced any effect on the quantity of fluid secreted.              In thirteen
observations on the same horse, embracing both hot and cold weather,
the largest quantities passed, amounting to over 10 litres, were
produced during warm summer months.             I place, however, no stress
on this observation ; probably in another series of experiments the
results would be reversed.
   It is obvious that much of the bulk of fluid secreted will depend
upon the quantity consumed.          It is notorious that working horses
are often stinted in their water.         In one very careful experiment,
where all the water was measured, it was found that more urine was
excreted during the twenty-four hours subsequent to work than was
excreted after absolute rest for one week.        The water of the twenty-
four hours' urine equals     \ to £ of the water drunk.

   Total Solids. — The mean amount of solids excreted by horses at
rest was 230-0713 grams ; of these the combustible solids are repre
sented by 146'1649 and the ash by 83'9064 grams.         The total solids of

ash 79'967 grams.          Great variation both at rest and work is observed
in the total solids, even where the diet remains the same.
   The nature of the diet, according to Tereg,* considerably influences
the amount of the urinary solids excreted, as shown in the following

   About 90 per cent, of the ash is soluble in water, and 10 per cent.
soluble in acid.       In the watery solution of ash we find the chlorides
of sodium and potassium, traces of lime, phosphates, magnesia, and
sulphates.      In the ac;id solution lime, magnesia, and sulphates pre
dominate.      On looking at the inorganic solids, they are smaller than
I   had expected ; the extreme difficulty experienced in incinerating
urinary solids causes, undoubtedly, a loss by the volatilisation of the

    Urea. — In calculating the urea we have also to take into considera
tion the carbonate of ammonia which unavoidably forms during the
twenty-four hours the urine is being collected.
    To show how much of the urea breaks up owing to fermentation,
I  have calculated it separately in the table, and then added the two
together.     I used Liebig's method of determination for some time,
but it gives too high results.
    My most trustworthy observations have been made with the hypo-
bromite process.
    The influence of rest and work over the production has been most
 carefully studied.
    I originally held the view that more urea was excreted during work
 than during rest, and a long series of analyses supported this view.
 I  found, in fact, in tabulating my results that the resting horses
 excreted on an average 88'41 grams of urea daily, of which 13778
 grams were in the form of ammonia carbonate ; whilst working
 horses excreted 134-9291 grams, of which 12-4591 grams existed as
 ammonia carbonate.
    The incorrect conclusions which appeared forced on me were due
 to the fact that the excretion of urea, eveu on a fixed and rigid diet,
 is extremely variable, and iu the horses from which the above results

were obtained   I   failed to keep any of them long enough under obser
vation to find out this point of variability.
   Again, diet influences the production, as proved by the work of
Tereg, Munk, and others, who have shown that on a hay diet more
nitrogen is excreted than on one containing oats as well as hay ; this
seems so opposed to what one would expect that                I  overlooked the
point entirely.
   Tereg and Mnnk put down the amount of urea as 120 grams ex
creted daily in a horse weighing 400 kilos., the diet being oats (4'5
kilos.) and hay (2'5 kilos.).       The mean of my own observations is
111 grams; but urea varies much, even on a fixed diet, in different
horses ; in Tereg and Munk's experiments               it varied from 81-5 to
1495 grams in twenty-four hours.
   I experimented on a pony weighing 5 cwt. 21 lbs. ; the experi
ments lasted from 2nd February to 29th March, and were divided
into periods of rest and work ; the diet throughout remained the
same, viz., hay 7 lbs., oats 5 lbs.
   In the first series of rest and work             I  found that the animal
«xcreted, on an average, for the resting days 63'63 grams urea, and
for the working days 72-913 grams.
   In the second series of rest and work, all conditions remaining the
same, I found more urea daring the resting than during the working
period, viz., for rest 65-125 grams, and for work 43'33 grams.

    Hippuric Acid. — Owing to the statement made by Liebig that
 benzoic acid was found in the urine of working horses, and hip-
 puric in the urine of those which rested — a statement which has often
 been repeated since his time, and almost formulated into the doctrine
 that benzoic was present in the horses of the poor, whilst hippuric
 predominated in that of the wealthy — have been at great pains         I
 to discover what element of truth the doctrine contained.
    The method employed for the determination of benzoic and hip
puric acids was the following —                        :
   The urine      treated with excess of milk of lime, filtered, evaporated
                         is
to one-fifth of its bulk, and acidified with HC1. If hippuric acid be
present     forms in some cases almost immediately, but in the majority
            it
it  has to stand from twelve to twenty-four hours                  benzoic be                   ;    if
present      forms almost at once. Both acids are in

condition, the hippuric (in black seaweed-like masses)            dissolved in                       is

 a capsule, dried at a low temperature, and cnrefully volatilised, when
 beautiful white sparkling crystals form, which are carefully removed,
 collected, and weighed ; or the impure mass may be dissolved in ether,
 the solution evaporated, and then          volatilised.       This    volatilisation
 requires great care to avoid loss.
    I have tried many methods of obtaining these acids, but none give
 such satisfactory results as the above.
    The examination of the twenty-four hours' urine of fifty- four horses
 revealed the presence of hippuric acid on only eight occasions.
    The number of horses at work was seventeen, and out of these I
 found hippuric acid twice, 2-144 grams and 186 grams respectively.
 The nnmber of horses standing idle was thirty-seven ; of this number
 I found hippuric acid six times; two of these observations I must
 dednct, as the horses were not in perfect health, leaving four out of
 thirty-five as the proportion in which hippuric acid was detected.
    In a second series of observations consisting of thirty horses, the
urine from which was collected and at once submitted to analysis, 1
found that out of eighteen working horses thirteen had hippuric acid
in the urine and five had none. Out of twelve horses at rest three had
hippuric acid and nine had none. The diet in all cases was the same.
This would appear to reverse Liebig's theory.
   My observations show that hippuric acid is generally found in the
urine of working horses — seldom found in the urine of resting horses,
and that it is rarely found in urine twenty-four hours old.
   Diet influences the production of hippuric acid, and it is increased
by using meadow-hay and oat-straw, and decreased by using clover,
peas, wheat, oats, &c. ; as the urea rises the hippuric acid falls, and
vice versa.   (Tereg,* Weiske and Kellner.t)
   The mean hippuric acid found was 15-58 grams, the maximum
28'56, and the minimum 9'18 grams in twenty-four hours.
   Salkowski places the hippuric acid at 15'597 grams daily.

be found in working horses, or a urine may possess neither hippuric
or benzoic acids.
   The mean benzoic acid found in resting horses was 6'53 grams,
in those at work 362 grams in twenty-four hours.
   Total Nitrogen. — Tn my earlier observations              I  believed that the
nitrogen of work was greater than the nitrogen of rest.
   I  have explained under urea how I fell into the error, and                I have
there fully detailed the nitrogen during rest and work in a series
of experiments on a pony.          The nitrogen is as variable as the urea ; in
my earlier series it varied for horses between 46 and 70 grams per diem.

Here diet undoubtedly influenced its production — as previously pointed
out under the head of urea.
  E. Salkowski states that a horse fed on 2 kilos, oats, 2 kilos, hay,
and 1 kilo, bran, excreted 65-34 grams of total nitrogen in twenty-
 four hours.
     According to Tereg and Munk, when horses are fed on rye instead
 of hay and oats the nitrogen shows no change, but by feeding with
 peas the nitrogen increases, and that in proportion to the quantity
 given.   If fed on hay alone the excreted nitrogen is very great, a fact
 as pointed out by these observers, which is very difficult of explana
 tion.
    Ammonia. — This exists in the urine of horses free and combined ;
 the latter has been dealt with and its origin explained, the free
 ammonia may or may not be due to fermentation occurring in the
 bladder, but from a very large number of observations on perfectly
healthy horses I affirm that ammonia exists in a free state in fresh
urine.
    It may be that ammoniaeal fermentation has already taken place
in the bladder due to the quantity of mucus, and the long period
during which the majority of horses retain their urine, due both to
habit and circumstances,    but        quite certain that the perfectly
                                     it.   is
fresh urine caught directly into clean vessels contains a distinct
amount of ammonia.         The amount of this ammonia cannot be
estimated in urine twenty-four hours old, because    it is impossible to
distinguish    iffrom the ammonia formed as the result of urea de
composition.
   The only way       have attempted to overcome the difficulty
                       I                                           is  by
collecting perfectly  fresh urine,  and  by Schlosing's method determin
ing the ammonia before the slightest urea change, outside the bodv,
has occurred.    This process   is far from being free from error, but   is
the least objectionable mode of procedure.
I    have previously stated that the ammonia found in urine twenty-
four hours old may safely be calculated as urea, for that         is un
doubtedly its origin.
   The preformed ammonia        is probably completely given off before
the twenty-fonr hours have ended.        The amount of free ammonia in
the urine of rest    have calculated at 2'516 grams, and in the urine
                       I
of work 5
        '3    grams, but   Ido not regard these results as completely
trustworthy.
   They nevertheless agree very closely, particularly that of work,
with the ammonia obtained by the direct titration of fresh urine with
a standard     acid.
  Phosphoric   Acid. — This acid   only found in comparatively small
                                     is
quantities in the urine of horses, the phosphates being principally
eliminated by the bowels.

      According to Boussingault, horses do not excrete phosphoric acid ;
 this is not in accordance with our experience.
     Diet possesses no influence over its production, and the effect of
 rest and work is insignificant.          I found that working horses excreted
  1-897 grains as a mean, whilst horses at rest excreted 13 grams.
 Age has no influence over its production. The largest amount found
 was 9'45 grams and the smallest 0'13 gram.
     The amount of P^05 will vary very considerably,              many horses only
 just possessing traces of the acid, others            distinct quantities.      I am
 inclined to regard the mean amounts of phosphoric acid gi/en above
 for rest and work as rather high.
     Sulphuric Acid and other Sulphur Compounds. — Sulphur exists in
 two distinct forms in the urine of horses ; the one I have calculated
 as S02, the other, known as sulphur compounds, is calculated as S.
 Diet appeared to have no influence in the production of S0g, work,
 on the other hand, increased it. Working horses excreted on an
 average 15289 grams, and horses at rest 1064G8 grams in twenty-four
 hours. The S02 appears to be increased in working horses in the
  same proportion as the urea.
     The sulphur compounds are said to exist in combination with
 phenol and other organic substances ; on this point 1 am not prepared
 to offer any opinion.*
     Work did not influence        their production.      Working horses yielded
  7-6092 grams, horses at rest 7'31156 grams of sulphur.              It is singular
  that horses should excrete so much sulphuric acid and other sulphur
  compounds.
      Chlorine. — More chlorine is excreted during rest than work, the
 mean amount for the former being 31'7119 grams, and for the latter
 21 9806 grams       in twenty- four hours.
     The chlorine is not affected by diet ; it is united with potassium
 and sodium     ; the amount of the latter metal in the urine of the horse
 is small, and only yields with the chlorine about 5£ grams of NaCl
 daily ; the major part of the chlorine is united with potassium which
 is most abundant.
    *  Some excellent work, has, however, been done in this direction by Salkowski,
Tereg, and Munk.       The latter observers state tliat on an average horses excrete
 108S6 grams of tribromphenol in twenty-four hours. 10175 grams of inorganic
sulphur, and 5'039 grams organic sulphur in twenty-four         hours. The tribrom
phenol is equivalent to 3 grams of phenol daily.     Great importance is laid by these
observers on the excretion of phenol, a process which is suspended during intestinal
complaints, particularly colic, and is, according to them and others, a cause of the
rapid death in these affections, produced by the toxic effect of the unexcreted
phenol.     The production of phenol in the healthy body is greatly influenced by
diet, being largest on rye and hay, one part peas and two parts oats, and on hay
alone ; it is smallest on rye alone, and next smallest on oats and hay. Salkowski is
inclined to regard Tereg and Munk's estimate of 3 grams of phenol daily as too high.
                                                                      2 a 2

     Lime. — More lime exists in the urine of the horso than is soluble
in an alkaline fluid, we have thercforo lime both dissolved and
merely suspended ; these have been estimated separately.           No direct
connexion could be traced between the lime in the urine and the lime
in the food, but between the production of lime and work a direct
connexion appeared.         The mean amount of dissolved CaO at work
was found to be 1'9027 grams, and of the same salt at rest 3 43G7
grams     in twenty-four hours.
     Suspended Lime. — More suspended lime was found in the urine of
horses at work than in those at rest, for the former 369 grams, and
for the latter 1/1043 grams CaO.         To state these points briefly, when
horses work they excrete more lime in their urine than when at rest,
but the lime of work is principally suspended, and only a part of it
dissolved ; whereas, the lime of rest is nearly all dissolved, and but
little of it suspended.       There is no connexion between the amount
of mucus in the urine and the suspended lime.
     The largest amount of dissolved lime I found was 16-45 grams and
the smallest 0'627 gram in twenty-four hours.             The lime is found
principally in conjunction with a carbonate, but I have also found
sulphate and oxalate.         The most common deposit in horse's urine is
the wheel-shaped crystals of lime carbonate.
     On adding an acid to urine, extreme effervescence occurs as a rule,
and the fluid is left quite clear like human urine ; I have only on a few
occasions witnessed any different results from these. The effervescence
is usually extreme.
     Miignesia. — This, like the lime, exists partly in the suspended state
 and partly dissolved.       Neither diet nor work have any influence over
 the production       of magnesia.      The soluble magnesia of work is
 2'63 grams, and of rest 2'975 grams.           The suspended magnesia of
 rest is   0'4218  gram,  and  of work  07925  gram.
     Potassium. — This metal is found largely in horse's urine ; it is
 principally combined with chlorine.
      Rest and work influence its production, there is more potash found
 in the urine of resting than in the urine of working horses. Working
 horses gave 27-0G grams whilst resting horses gave 3G-59 grams in
 twenty-four hours.
      Sodium. — Is only found in small quantities in the urine, the mean
  amount being 2'17 grams, and it is combined with chlorine, yielding a
  little over 5£ grams of common salt for the twenty-four hours.         The
  mean amount of sodium in working horses was l-84 grams in twenty-
  four hours, in horses at rest it was larger, viz., 2'5 grams ; yielding
  with chlorine less than 0^ grams of common salt per diem.
      In some recent experiments, carried out on a pony, on the excretion
  of soda and potash during rest and work, the animal remaining under
  observation     for several days,    I  found that the mean amount of

 1889.]            The Chemistry    of   the Urine   of   the Horse.              339
mixed chlorides excreted remained about the same, viz., 40 grams
daily both at rest and work, but that during rest more potash and
less soda was found than during work.            This does not agree with the
above experiments on the horse.
   I   have compiled, from the mean result               obtained, the following
table of analyses of urine of healthy horses at work and rest.
   I observe that my inorganic solids of rest are in excess of the ash
found, and moreover, that the amount of organic substances found in
the urine of rest is much smaller than that obtained by evaporation
and weighing.         In both these matters the urine of work gives better
results.
   It   is obvious, however, that      I have  only dealt with the most com
mon and important substances found in urine ; there are many organic
substances which        I have not looked for, or estimated, or have only
estimated on so few occasions as not to entitle them to a place in the
table.
   I  do not for one moment intend it to be supposed that the table
represents what all horses at work or rest excrete, for I have pre
viously stated that the horse's urine is a fluid of very varying composi
tion; all the table represents is the mean of a large number of
carefully made observations, which must be accepted                as an     approxi
mation to the truth rather than as absolutely true.

340              Dr. W. Marcet.      A   Chemical Inquiry         [June  20,
   I  have made no mention of the changes which occur in the nrine
as the   result of disease, for the reason that I purpose devoting a
special article to this subject, which is at present under investigation,
though necessarily slow in progress, and far from being completed.
   It is singular to observe that any important derangement of the
horse's health is associated with an acid urine, the presence of uric
acid and large phosphates, and the production of a clear human-like
urine in appearance ; this change is produced as soon as the animal
refuses food and commences to live on its own tissues.
IX.     "A   Chemical    Inquiry into the Phenomena of Human
       Respiration." By William Marcet, M.D., F.R.S. Received
       June 3, 1889.
                                 (Abstract.)
   Before entering upon this communication,         I must beg to acknow
ledge the valuable aid of my assistant, Mr. C. F. Townsend, F.C.S.,
to whose diligent, methodical, and careful work I am greatly indebted
for the results obtained in the present research.            The numerous
calculations have all  been  made  by both   of us together, and the results
checked in every possible way to insure accuracy.
    My attention was first turned to the chemical phenomena of respira
tion in 1875, and since then I have had the honour of communicating
to the Royal Society a succession of papers on the
                                                              " Influence of
Altitude on Respiration," which have appeared in vols. 27, 28, 20,
and 31 of the ' Proceedings.'
   •These inquiries show in a most conclusive manner that altitude
exerts an action on respiration depending entirely on the fall of
atmospheric pressure.      The law can be expressed as follows : — The
 volumes of air breathed, reduced to 0° C. and 760 mm., in order to
 yield the oxygen necessary for the production of a given weight (say,
 1 gram) of carbonic acid, are smaller on mountains        under diminished
 pressures  than in the  plains under  higher   pressures.
    My earliest experiments on the Breithorn, 4171 metres (13,685 feet) ;
 the Col St. Theodule, 3322 metres (10,899 feet) ; the Riffel, 2368
 metres (8428 feet) ; St. Bernard, 2473 metres (Sll5 feet) ; and the
 Col du Geant, 3362 metres (11,030 feet), were all attended with a
 fall of temperature on reaching into higher altitudes.        This circum
 stance necessarily produced an increased combustion in the body,
 to overcome the action of the cold, and introduced an element
 in the inquiry not unlikely to interfere with the exclusive influence
altitude might exert on the chemical phenomena of respiration.
 In order to overcome the present difficulty I spent three weeks
on the Peak of Teneriffe in the summer of 1878, where the

  1889.]         into  the Phenomena      of Human Respiration.                     341
 experiments      were repeated.       The temperature, though varying to
 a   slight   extent   at  different   altitudes    on the Peak, was always
 high in the daytime; hence there was no cause for any increased
 formation of carbonic acid in the body towards the resistance
 of cold.     The result was most striking.             While in the cold Swiss
 Alps     I had  observed    an   increased   expiration of carbonic acid in
 ascending, on the Peak of Teneriffe there was no such effect produced.
 The mean weight of carbonic acid expired at the three stations, by
 two persons, was, with one exception only, applying to a Chamonix
 guide, the same for each of them respectively.               But the volumes of
 air breathed at increasing altitudes were lessened,* so that the law
 remained unchanged — that at increasing altitudes, less air, reduced
 to 0° C. and 760 mm., is required to produce 1 gram of carbonic acid
 in the body.       The experiments on the Peak of Teneriffe, by doing
away entirely with the influence of cold, place the fact beyond doubt.
    As it is important towards a clear understanding of the results
contained in this paper that those obtained formerly should be present
to the reader, 1 beg to subjoin them in a tabular form.

    The experiments were made by determining as carefully as possible
the volume of air expired within a given time, and then estimating
the amount of carbonic acid it contained by means of Pctlenkofer's
method.     The volume of air, reduced to 0° C. and 760 mm. pressure,

   Tliese experiments were subsequently repeated in 1882 on the
Rigi Mountain in Switzerland, altitude 1594 metres (5230 feet),
and as the results obtained have never been published, beyond a
short reference to them in a communication to the Alpine Club,
they are included in the present paper.          My companion, Mr. Thury,
a young engineer,        aged twenty-live, submitted to the inquiry.
Fifteen experiments were made near Geneva at a mean barometer
pressure of 728 mm., and a mean temperature of 15'9° C., and
 eighteen as soon afterwards as possible on the Rigi Staffel, at a mean
 pressure of 639 mm., and a mean temperature of 7'6° C. As might
 have been expected, more C02 was exhaled in a given time on the cold
 mountain station than in the Valjey of Geneva, a mean of 0'350 gram
 being expired near Geneva and 0445 gram at the higher station,
 giving an excess of no less than 21 per cent. of carbonic acid for the
 Rigi. The amount of air expired — say breathed — for the expiration
 of 1 gram C02, reduced to 0° and 760 mm., was 10' 78 litres in the
 Valley and only 9'45 on the Rigi.         Therefore, for a mean difference
 of 89 mm. of atmospheric pressure, and with a marked fall of tem
 perature, less air by 12 per vent. was breathed on the mountain to
 Supply the oxygen required by the body to burn the same amount of
 carbon as in the valley.
    The present investigation has been carried out in a laboratory of
 the Physiological Department at University College, which Professor
 Schafer has kindly placed at my disposal. Its object was to ascertain

the influence    of food and changes of atmospheric pressure on the
volume   of air breathed and weight of C03 expired.        Two persons,
my assistant, Mr. 0. F. Townsend, and my laboratory attendaut,
William Alderwood, kindly submitted to experiment.
   The person under experiment sat in a semi-recumbent posture in a
deck-chair, with his feet resting on a stool, so as to do away with all
muscular effort. He inspired by the nose only, and expii'ed through
the mouth iuto a wide india-rubber tube, connected with a bell-jar, of
a capacity of over 40 litres, and suspended over salt water.         The
bell-jar was  accurately counterpoised over a pulley fixed to a cycloid,
whose leverage power, increasing as the bell-jar rose, kept the latter
perfectly balanced, and therefore the air it contained was under
atmospheric pressure in every position.       The time for collecting the
air expired was measured with a stop watch. In order to make sure
of no air being expired accidentally through the nose, at the end of
each inspiration the nose was closed with the index-fingers, and thus
held during the expiration.
   In order to obviate the objection that the attention given to the
experiment might interfere with natural breathing, the air was
expired into the bell- jar through a double-way cock, disposed in such
a manner that the person under experiment might, unknown to him,
either expire into the external air or into the bell-jar. At the com
mencement of the experiment he was made to expire into the open
air, and when, after ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, his respira
tion had become perfectly regular, the stopcock was turned and the
air admitted into the bell-jar. The latter was so well suspended that
it rose without the least effort ; thus, the person experimented upon,
unless looking at the bell- jar, could not tell whether he was breathing
into it or into the external air.
   The carbonic acid was determined by aspiring with a pump the air
from the bell-jar into a glass cylinder of a capacity of 10U0 c.c, to
which was subsequently screwed, air-tight, a bottle holding 100 c.c. of
a normal solution of barium hydrate. After agitating the air with the
akaline solution for a minute or two, about 100 c.c. of common air free
from C02, and contained in a pear-shaped india-rubber bag, was forced
into the cylinder by pressure with the hand, and then the shaking
resumed for a quarter of an hour.       The addition of the air caused a
pressure inside the cylinder which was found to accelerate greatly the
combination of the C02. Finally, the alkaline solution was decanted
into a glass-stoppered bottle of a capacity of about 100 c.c, and the
stopper secured with paraffin.      The morning of the next day, when
the precipitate had entirely subsided, the clear fluid was titrated with
a standard solution of oxalic acid in the usual way.
   A number of precautions were taken to insure the accuracy of the
method ; perhaps the most important was blowing, with a bellows, a

 344           Chemical Phenomena        of Human Respiration.          [June    20,
 current of air over pumice-stone moistened with a solution of potas
 sium hydrate, through the wide mouth bottle in which the titration
 was being made ; by this means no atmospheric carbonic acid could
 interfere with the correctness of the result. Fourteen pairs of analyses,
 made to test the method, gave a mean difference of only 0'31 per cent.
    Two comparative experiments were carried out in a large air-tight
 chamber in which a person lying in a deck-chair breathed first into
 an india-rubber bag, representing the bell-jar, and next into the air of
 the chamber.       The air in the bag and in the chamber being subse
 quently analysed yielded practically the same weight of carbonic acid
expired within the same time.*
    The results obtained from the present inquiry are as follows: —
    1. The law of nature is further demonstrated          that less air, reduced
to 0° C. and 760 mm. pressure, is breathed at high than at low altitudes
for the formation in the body of a given weight of carbonic acid.
    2. The known usual influence of food on the formation of carbonic
acid in the body is confirmed — the maximum amount expired occur
ring between two and three hours after a meal, while the minimum is
before breakfast.
   3.  The influence of food on the relation between the volumes of air
breathed     (reduced) and the corresponding weights of carbonic acid
expired is clearly shown ; the volumes following, as a rule, the fluctua
tions of the carbonic acid, but there is apparently a sudden change in
this relation at a period of between four and five hours after a meal,
when the carbonic acid expired falls proportionally faster than the
volumes of air breathed.         The harmony of the tracings in one of the
charts accompanying my paper has recovered itself, however, over
night, and the lines are again nearly parallel before the first morning
meal.      In  the other chart there are no experiments          recorded     made
before breakfast.
   4.  The local state of the atmospheric        pressure, as shown by the
barometer,     has a marked influence on respiration, less air, reduced to
0° C. and 760 mm. pressure, being taken into the lungs for the formation
and omission of a given weight of carbonic acid under loiver atmospheric
pressures than under higher pressures;           but this influence varies in
degree according to different persons. In the present inquiry when two
young men were experimented upon — in one case, for a fall of pressure
of 10 mm. (0395 inch), there was a mean reduction of 1'076 per cent.
of the volume of air breathed for 1 gram C02 expired ; in the other
case, the mean reduction was greater, and amounted to 1'745 per cent.
   5. The above influence of local atmospheric pressttres on the volume
of air breathed is not the same throughout the whole day, being much
less marked from two to four hours after a meal when the action of

              experiment the difference amounted to 2'97 per cent. ; in the other to

food is at its maximum.     Thus digestion neutralises in a great measure
the effects on respiration of any local change of pressure.
    Two persons, both nged twenty-three, were found in the experi
ments     related in this paper to require respectively a mean of
9'29 and 10ol litres of air, reduced, to expire 1 gram carbonic
acid.     Experiments on another person, aged sixty, gave a mean
of H-30 litres of air; and with a number of others the propor
tion of air breathed for a given weight of carbonic acid expired
also varied, showing that different individuals           breathe different
volumes of air to supply their body with the necessary amount
of oxygen to make and expire a given weight of carbonic acid.              It
cannot be doubted that the less the volume of air inspired to burn a
certain weight of carbon, the more readily the oxygen taken into the
lungs finds its way into the blood, and, therefore, the more perfect the
respiratory function. This may have important bearings in medical
respects.     The age of sixty years apparently necessitated breathing
a comparatively large proportion of air (11 -30 litres) to supply the
blood with the oxygen it required.        One of the two young men was
physically stronger and possessed of a greater muscular development
than the other, he breathed 9'29 litres against 10'51 for the other, or
took ll- 6 per cent. less air into his lungs to yield the necessary oxygen
to burn the same weight of carbon within a given time.            The corre
sponding difference between the person aged sixty, and the strongest
of the two young men amounted to no less thau 17'8 per cent.

    Although    the fermentative    action of micro-organisms has from
 time to time attracted the attention of numerous investigators, both
 chemical and biological, still in by far the majority of cases there has
 been absolutely no guarantee that the chemical changes observed
 were the result of the activity of a pure growth of one organism and
 not of a more or less complex mixture of organisms.            Indeed, it is
only   within  recent years  that the most  familiar of all fermentations —
 the alcoholic— has been induced with growths of yeast definitely
ascertained    to be of absolute purity.
    Thns whilst Pasteur and others had many years previously studied
the fermentation of sugar induced by yeast, free from bacteria and
other micro-organisms, it is to Hansen that we owe the systematic
 investigation of the fermentations caused by distinct kinds of yeast in
a state of unquestionable     purity.

    The greatly improved methods of isolating and studying micro
 organisms, which we now. have at our command, necessitate that all
experiments on the chemical changes induced by micro-organisms,
should in future be carried out with cultivations of guaranteed
purity, as only under such conditions can the particular reactions be
 referred to the agency of particular organisms.       It is, moreover, essen
 tial that the micro-organisms themselves should be so fully described
 and characterised      as to render possible their identification by other
 investigators, a point which has been but little attended to in the
 past.   Thus the value of the classical work of the late Albert Fitz on
schizomycetic fermentations        is not a little diminished by the doubt
which attaches to the purity of his cultivation, and to the inadequate
 description of the micro-organisms he had under observation.                On
 the other hand, of course, these objections in no way detract from 'the
 importance of Fitz's work in demonstrating that particular chemical
 changes can be effected by the agency of bacterial life.
    The present paper deals with some of the chemical changes pro
 duced by a micro-organism which was obtained in a state of perfect
purity by one of us from sheep-dung, which was found to have the
power of setting up fermentation in suitable solutions of several
carbohydrates and polyhydric alcohols.
   Isolation and Morphological    Characters  of  the Fermenting   Organism
           (by Gr.ACE C.    Frankland and PErcy F. Frankland).
    A minute quantity of       sheep-dung was introduced into test-tubes
containing    a sterile solution of glucose (3 per cent.) and the necessary
mineral ingredients, together with a small quantity of peptone.             On
placing these tubes     in the incubator at 39° C. they were   found   to be  in
a state of fermentation on the following day.          A minute quantity of
this fermenting liquid was transferred by means of a sterile platinum
needle into other tubes containing sterile glucose-solution, and in
these a similar fermentation was established.           A number of further
generations were produced by successive transferences in the sameway,
with the result that in each case a vigorous fermentation was set up.
    Some of the fermenting liquid from one of these tubes was then
submitted to plate-cultivation with gelatine-peptone in the ordinary
way. On the appearance of centres of growth on these plates,
inoculations were made from a number of the colonies into tubes
containing glucose-solution. On subsequently incubating these tubes
some entered into vigorous fermentation, and from one of these a
number of inoculations were made into tubes containing glucose,
mannite,    glycerin, and other solutions to which reference will be
made later.       The inoculated glucose, mannite, and glycerin tubes
all entered into fermentation on being placed in the incubator.

    Plates wero aL'ain poured from a number of these fermenting solu
tions of various ages, the resulting colonies were carefully examined
and again inoculated into the fermentable liquids, and it was only
when the purity and uniform character of the organism had thus
been fully established          that the larger quantities of fermentable
material to be chemically examined afterwards were finally inoculated
as described below.
    Microscopic Appearances. — Under high powers ( x 1000 x 1500)
 the organism is seen to be a bacillus with rounded ends, occurring
chiefly in pairs, the individual bacilli vary in length from l-5 ft to
51 fi, and in breadth from 0'8 /i to       1-0 ft. Their appearance, however,
as is so      frequently    the  case, varies   considerably, according to the
medium from which they are taken.              Thus in the fermenting liquids
 they were often found to form long threads, whilst in gelatine and
 other solid media they were usually found in pairs only.
     The accompanying figures, Nos. 1 and 2, illustrate the differences
 in   the   appearance     of the bacilli when       taken from gelatine and
 mannite-solution respectively.

     That this difference in appearance was not accidental hut a constant
 character of the organism was demonstrated by inoculating gelatine-
  tubes from single colonies of the organism ; on microscopically ex
 amining the growths in these tubes, the characteristic short bacilli
  were found, but no threads ; on inoculating, however, a scries of
  glucose-tubes from these gelatine cultivations, the long threads were
  invariably found.
     Viewed in drop-cultivations, the bacilli were seen to be extremely-
  motile.
     Appearance in Gelatine-Tubes. — The growth is but little charac
  teristic ; in the depth the needle-track assumes a beaded appearance,
  whilst the smooth surface-growth causes more or less rapid liquefac
  tion of the gelatine, according to the temperature and according to
  the vitality of the organism; thus at low temperatures or when the
  organism has been inoculated from an old and exhausted previous
  growth, the liquefaction is very slow.
     Appearance in Agar-Agar. — The organism forms an extremely thin
  and almost invisible growth over the surface, which becomes hardly
  more conspicuous even when incubated for some time.

  Appearance in Gelatine -Plate Cultivations. — To the naked     eye the
colonies are very insignificant, appearing as small white dots ; later on
when liquefaction commences, clear liquid circles form round the
small centres, the circles gradually increase in diameter until the
whole plate may become involved.
   Under a low power (x 100) the depth-colonies in which neither
softening nor liquefaction of the gelatine has commenced, are seen
to be smooth-rimmed     disks with finely granular contents (see fig. 3),
whilst those around which liquefaction has taken place exhibit a dark
central mass surrounded by very finely granular matter, the periphery
having a delicate hair-like appearance (see fig. 4). The same dif
ferences in the rate of liquefaction are observable as in the case of the
gelatine-tube cultivations referred to above.
   In none of the cultivations were any spores discoverable.

2000 c.c. of solution being placed in each flask.   The solution was
prepared as follows —    :
   60 grams of pure mannitol,     grams of dry peptone, and 30 grams
                                     2

     The sterile liquid thus obtained was then, carefully inoculated with
  a minute quantity of a pure culture of the organism and placed in an
  incubator, the temperature of which was maintained at 38 — 40° C.
     The fermentation commences in the course of a few days and con
  tinues for several weeks.
     Three separate fermentations of mannitol were thus carried on.
     In each case, before commencing the chemical examination of the
  products, the contents of the flask were submitted to microscopic
  examination and to plate-cultivation with gelatine-peptone ; in each
  case the growth was found to have remained pure, only the charac
  teristic colonies of the organism itself making their appearance on the
 plates.
                        Fermentation  of Mannitol No.  1.
     Two litres of mannitol solution, prepared as above described, were
 duly sterilised and then carefully inoculated with a minute trace of
 a pure cultivation of the organism.        The liquid was then placed in
 an incubator the temperature of which was maintained at 38 — 40° C.
     The fermentation commenced on the third day and continued
 with more or less activity for about one month, but the liquid re
 mained in the incubator for upwards of three months ; at the close of
 this period it was submitted to plate-cultivation as above indicated,
 and the chemical examination then proceeded with.
     Separation of Alcohols. — The fermented liquid, which still contained
 a quantity of undecomposed carbonate of lime, was distilled down to
 about one-third of its bulk and until the distillate gave only the
 faintest indications with Lieben's highly sensitive iodoform reaction
 for alcohol.     The residue in the distilling flask was set aside to be
 examined for acids (see below), whilst the distillate, which would
 contain any alcohols, was redistilled over and over again so as to get
rid of the greater part of the water. When the volume of liquid
amounted to only about 50 c.c. a careful determination of the specific
gravity was made, and this indicated the presence of 11 "415 grams
of absolute alcohol.       Finally the liquid was dehydrated with fused
carbonate      of potash, and on then distilling it passed over at
79 — 80° C, showing it to be pure ethyl alcohol.
    Separation of Volatile Acids. — The residue remaining in the flask,
after distilling off the alcohol as above, would contain any acids in
the condition of calcium salts ; in order to liberate these acids a
calculated quantity of hydrochloric acid was added, sufficient exactly
to decompose the carbonate of lime originally added to the liquid.
On then repeatedly distilling with water the volatile acids passed over
and were converted into barium salts for analysis.
    The hydrochloric acid was not, however, added all at once, but
in several distinct portions, and after each addition the liquid was

severally treated with an excess of pure barium carbonate, boiled for
one hour to expel carbonic anhydride, and then filtered; the filtrate
containing the barium salt of the volatile acid was then evaporated
and weighed after drying until constant at 130° C.              A barium
determination was then made by conversion into sulphate, and from
the proportion of barium sulphate obtained the composition of the
volatile acid was calculated.     The following results were obtained
when the several distillates were treated as above :—

           BaSO,.
     IT. 41-58 grams Ba-salt gave 91¦29 per cent. BaSOI.
   III. 2'5<31 grams Ba-salt gave 91¦40 per cent. BaS04.
    IV. 1¦217 grams Ba-salt gave 91¦83 per cent. BaS04.
     V. 0'o¦21 gram Ba-salt. Barium- determination lost.
   With the exception of that in fraction IV, all the barium deter
minations show that the only volatile acid present was acetic acid,
inasmuch as the theoretical quantity of barium sulphate obtainable
from barium acetate is 91¦37 per cent.
   Thus even the proportion of barium sulphate obtained in frac
tion IV differs but slightly from the theoretical amount for barium
acetate, and the discrepancy was probably due to the presence of a
little barium carbonate (indicated by slight effervescence on treating
the residue with hydrochloric acid, and due to the permanent solu
bility of the barium carbonate even on boiling), for no formic acid
could be discovered by the silver nitrate reaction.
   The total amount of Ba-salt obtained, viz., 14¦893 grams, may bo
calculated as pure acetic acid, of which there were, therefore,
7¦008 grams produced in this fermentation.
   Separation of Fixed Acids, fyc. — After distilling off the volatile acid
as above, the calcium in solution was precipitated with sodium car
bonate, and the solution after filtering was evaporated to dryness.
The residue thus obtained was placed in a Soxhlet's apparatus, and
extracted with absolute alcohol, which would dissolve any sodium
lactate, but leave any sodium succinate, and the greater part of the
sodium chloride undissolved.       Both the residue and the alcoholic
extract, after evaporating the alcohol, were dissolved in water, acidu
lated with hydrochloric acid, and then repeatedly shaken with ether.
The ethereal extract of the solution of the residue yielded on evapo
ration 0¦0215 gram of substance, which on ignition gave the suffoca
ting fumes characteristic of succinic acid.
   No lactic acid was found in the ethereal extract of the other
portion.
   Both the residue and the alcoholic extract referred to above might
contain unaltered mannitol, which would have to be separated from

  1889.]       On a pure Fermentation         of Mannite and Glycerin.           351
  the large quantity of sodium chloride. This separation was partially
  accomplished       by means of strong alcohol in which mannitol is
  considerably more soluble than sodium chloride; 17-135 grams of
  mannitol, containing 362 per cent. of ash (sodium chloride), were
  obtained, corresponding to 10-93 grams of pure mannitol.
                          Fermentation     of Mannitol Xo.      2.
     A second fermentation of mannitol was conducted on the same
 lines as above, the liquid remaining upwards of three months in the
 incubator at 38 — 40° C, and then for another month at the ordinary
 temperature of the air before it was submitted to examination.
     Alcohol. — In the alcoholic distillate there was obtained                 after
 repeated rectification a liquid of specific gravity indicating the pre
 sence of 9'519 grams of absolute alcohol, on further rectification the
 specific gravity indicated 9'094 grams alcohol, and after dehydration
 with fused carbonate of potash, 7' 75 grams of liquid boiling at
 79 — 80° C. were actually recovered.              The amount of .ethyl alcohol
 actually produced in the fermentation may thus bo estimated at
 about 9'3 grams.
     Volatile Acids. — From the several          fractions of the volatile acids,
 the following barium salts were prepared             : —
        I. 6¦3435   grams Ba-salt giving       91 '61   per cent. BaSO4.
      II.  2'9525 grams Ba-salt giving 91 35 per cent. BaS04.
     III.  0-8080 gram Ba-salt giving 9388 per cent. BaS04.
     IV.   2-0385 grams Ba-salt.           (The Ba-determination in this salt
             yielded 116'2 per       cent,  of BaS04, an obviously erroneous
              figure :   unfortunately the determination could not                be
              repeated, the remainder of the salt having been lost.)
    Remembering the calculated proportions of barium sulphate for —
                   Barium acetate                       91-37 per cent.
                       „    formate                  102'64        ,,
 it is obvious that the fractions I and               II  consisted of pure barium
 acetate, fraction     III  of barium acetate with a small admixture of
barium      formate,   whilst   fraction IV, in which unfortunately no satis
factory Ba-determination was obtained, doubtless contained a larger
proportion of formate.
    The presence of formic acid in fractions                III  and IV was further
demonstrable by        means   of  the reaction    with   silver nitrate.
    The amount of barium acetate and formate respectively present in
mixtures of the two salts may be calculated from the following
formula —
                              Bz = 100P-r&a!-100&,

           Fraction   III             06281                  01799
   The total quantity of barium salts of the volatile acids obtained
from the fermented liquid thus amounted to 12-1425 grams; of
which probably about 1 gram was barium formate.
   Taking the whole of the barium salts as barium acetate, the quan
tity of volatile acid produced in this fermentation amounted to
5'7141 grams calculated as acetic acid.
   Fixed Acid's, Sfc. — The mode of dealing with the residue        left after
distilling  off the volatile  acids was somewhat       modified in this case.
The calcium was precipitated with sodium          carbonate and filtered off ;
after which the filtrate was acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and
repeatedly shaken with ether to remove any lactic or succinic acids ;
from the residue insoluble in ether, a quantity of mannite amounting
to 15-716 grams was recovered.           The ethereal extract was evapo
rated, neutralised with sodium carbonate, again evaporated, and then
extracted with strong alcohol (97 per cent.) to dissolve out any
sodium lactate, but none was found ; on the other hand, the sodium
salt insoluble in alcohol on acidulation and extraction with ether
yielded 0034 gram succinic acid.
   Thus the results obtained in the second fermentation were essen
tially the same as those yielded by the first, with the exception that
in addition to ethyl alcohol and acetic acid a small proportion of
formic acid was also produced, this is possibly to be accounted for as
the result of a secondary action of the ferment on the acetic acid
produced in the first instance.      This conversion of acetic into formic
acid being a process of oxidation, may be dependent upon the accession
of air to the liquid at the close of the main fermentation.
                       Fermentation   of Mannite No.   3.
   In this  case the fermenting     liquid was allowed to remain in the
                  —
incubator at 38 40° C. for three months, and then at the ordinary
 temperature of the air for nearly two months more.
   The alcoholic portion was unfortunately lost, but the volatile acids
yielded the following barium salts :—

1889.]       On a pure Fermentation        of Mannite and Glycerin.       353
      I. 7-623 grams Ba-salt giving 93'76 per cent. BaS04.
    II.  2-485 grams Ba-salt giving 96'39 per cent. BaS04.
    Both of these fractions were, therefore, mixtures of barium acetate
 and formate, and by applying the formula given above their com
 position is found to be —
                      Barium  acetate.              Barium formate.
             1            6-0062 grams                  1'6168 grams.

    The total quantity of barium acetate obtained thus amounted to
 73844 grams, corresponding to 3¦4750 grams of acetic acid, whilst
 the barium formate amounting to 2-7236 grams corresponds to
 1'1038 grams of formic acid.
    In the residue, after distilling off the volatile acids, 0'027 gram of
 succinic acid was obtained.
                         Fermentation       of Glycerol.
    Pure cultivations of the same organism on being introduced into
 perfectly similar solutions containing glycerol instead of mannitol
 caused a vigorous fermentation of the former. The fermentation was,
 however, distinctly less energetic than in the case of the mannitol,
 for it was later in commencing and continued over a longer period of
 time.    The investigation of the products of this fermentation of
 glycerol was carried out on precisely the same lines as in the case of
 the mannitol.     In each case 60 grams of pure glycerol were sub
 mitted to fermentation in 2 litres of water, to which the same
 additions were made as in the case of the mannitol referred to
 above.     The liquid was fermented at 37 — 39° C, and before com
mencing the chemical examination of the products it was submitted
to plate cultivation, with the result that no foreign organisms were
discoverable.
                       Fermentation      of Glycerol No.  1.
    This fermentation continued over          a period of three months, after
which the chemical examination of the products was immediately
proceeded with.
    Alcohols. — After repeated distillation a liquid was obtained weigh
ing 63-58 grams, and of specific gravity 0-9871, corresponding to
4-90 grams of absolute alcohol.          Unfortunately, owing to an accident,
the liquid was lost and the alcohol was not further isolated.
    Volatile Acids. — Proceeding as in the case of the mannitol fer-          ¦
mentations, the following barium salts were obtained : —
                                                                    2 r 2

              Pure Ba-formate yields 102'64 per cent. BaS04.
   Thus, whilst the first fraction was practically pure barium acetate,
the second fraction contained a notable proportion of barium formate,
the composition of this fraction, as calculated by the aid of the
formula given on p. 351, being —
                Barium acetate                      2'7419 grams

   The third fraction doubtless contained an even largeV proportion of
barium formate, but the barium determination was unfortunately
lost.
   It may, however, be taken that the volatile acids produced in this
fermentation consisted of about 2'75 grams acetic and 0 32 gram
formic acid.
   Fixed Acids. — After distilling off the volatile acids as above, the
residue containing any fixed acids, together with calcium chloride
and unaltered glycerol, was treated with sodium carbonate to precipi
tate the calcium, which was filtered off; the filtrate was evaporated
to dryness and extracted with a mixture consisting of 5 vols, of
alcohol and 1 vol. of ether.             Such a mixture, whilst dissolving
glycerol,  does  not  dissolve   either   sodium lactate or succinate.      From
the ether-alcohol extract 22'8615 grams of unaltered glycerol* were
recovered.     The residue, insoluble in ether-alcohol, was treated with
strong boiling alcohol to extract any sodium lactate, but none was
obtained, the residue remaining after treatment with alcohol was
dissolved in water, acidulated with hydrochloric acid, and repeatedly
shaken up with ether ; from this ethereal extract 0'079 gram of suc
cinic acid was obtained.
   The results show that only a part of the glycerol had undergone
fermentation (nearly one half having been recovered), whilst the
principal products were alcohol and acetic acid, together with a small
quantity of formic acid and traces of succinic acid.
                        Fermentation     of Glycerol No.  2.
   In this experiment      the fermenting liquid was allowed to remain in.
 the incubator at 37 — 39" C. for five months before examination.
       * This glycerol yielded on incineration only 0'85 per cent. of ash.

   Alcohol. — Repeated       distillation yielded 634775 grams of liquid, of
specific gravity O9803, corresponding to 8'20 grams of absolute
alcohol ; after further rectification the weight of liquid was reduced to
51'0 grams, of specific gravity 0'9770, corresponding to 8-14 grams
absolute alcohol.        By dehydrating this with fused potassium car
bonate, 7'518 grams of alcohol, boiling at 79° C, were obtained.
    Volatile Acids. — Proceeding as before, the following amount of
barium salt was obtained : —
   Total barium salt = 8239 grams, giving 91-08 per cent. BaS04.
   Pure Ba-acetate gives 91-37 per cent. BaS04.
   Thus the whole of the salt was practically pure barium acetate,
although a trace of formic acid was discoverable qualitatively.
   The total quantify of acetic acid, as calculated from the barium
salt, amounted      to 3'877 grams.
   Fixed Acids. — Using the same method of separation as described in
the first fermentation of glycerol, 0003 gram of succinic acid was
found, whilst 2419 grams of unaltered glycerol were recovered.                     This
glycerol on incineration yielded only 0'96 per cent. of ash.
   The results obtained in this fermentation, therefore, fully substan
tiate those of the first.             The glycerol was only very partially
decomposed,       the  principal products being again alcohol and acetic
acid, with traces of formic and succinic acids.
   In the fermentation of the glycerol, as in that of the mannitol, it
would appear that the formic acid is produced at the expense of the
acetic acid, for in this second fermentation of glycerol, in which only
traces of formic acid were discovered, the proportion of acetic acid
was considerably greater than in the first fermentation, in which a
notable quantity of formic acid was found.

356          Pure Fermentation of Mannite and Glycerin.         [June 20,
                                     Remarks.
    (1.) Both mannitol and glycerol are fermented by this organism,
with production of essentially the same substances, viz., ethyl alcohol
 and acetic acid, together with smaller quantities of formic and suc
cinic acids.
    The proportion of formic acid in both fermentations appears to be
formed at the expense of the acetic acid, inasmuch as in all cases the
amount of acetic acid found varied inversely as the proportion of
formic acid.      The proportion of succinic acid, although in both cases
very small, was distinctly greater in the glycerol than in the maimitol
fermentations.
    (2.) The proportion of alcohol to acetic acid in the mannitol fer
mentations is constant, viz., as 1'63 : 1, which corresponds to the
molecular proportions.
                      2C3EyOH     :   CEyCOOH = 153
                        (2 x 46)         (60)
    (3.) Excluding the first glycerol fermentation, in which the alcohol
found was doubtless too small, the proportion of alcohol to acetic
acid is as 211 : 1, corresponding to the molecular proportions,
                      3C2H5-OH      : CEyCOOH = 230
                         (3 x 46)           (60)
    (4.)  In all the fermentations the decomposition was only an incom
plete one, a considerable part of the mannitol, and especially of the
glycerol, being in each case recoverable after the fermentation was
finished. We propose subsequently to investigate the cause of this
 limitation.
    (5.) In the mannitol fermentation it is impossible to determine
whether the succinic acid is formed by a process of synthesis or
analysis, but in the fermentation of glycerol it obviously has a
 synthetical origin.
    (6.) In addition to ethyl alcohol, there appears to be also a small
 proportion of some higher alcohol produced, for in the alcoholic
 distillation the distillate was at first somewhat turbid, but became
 clear again when a larger quantity had collected.
    (7.) We have introduced pure cultivations of the same bacillus
 into solutions of a number of different substances likely to undergo
 fermentation. The bacillus, as already mentioned, ferments glucose
 vigorously, it also more slowly ferments cane-sugar, milk-sugar,
 starch, and calcium glycerate ; the products of these fermentations
are being further investigated by one of us.       On the other hand, we
have been unable to cause it to ferment solutions of dulcite, erythrite,
ethylene glycol, calcium lactate, tartrate, citrate, or glycollatc.

    Its inactivity towards dulcite is particularly           interesting, and fur
nishes another instance of the selective power of micro-organisms
towards the most closely allied isomeric bodies. Remembering the
relationship of dulcite to galactose and of galactose to milk-sugar
(galactose is converted into dulcite by nascent hydrogen, and milk-
sugar is converted into galactose and dextrose by the action of dilute
acids), it is to be anticipated that in the fermentation which this
bacillus induces in milk-sugar, the decomposition is limited to the
dextrose portion of the milk-sugar molecule.                In the action of this
bacillus on starch, the latter is in the first instance dissolved, doubt
 less through the agency of a diastatic ferment, to which the organism
gives rise, as well as to the peptonising one which brings about the
 liquefaction of the gelatine already referred to. A tube containing
 starch-liquid, which had been fermented by the bacillus, gave no blue
 coloration with iodine, clearly showing that the whole of the starch
 had undergone transformation into other products.

 acid  — to which this organism gives rise, we propose for it the name
 of Bacillus ethaceticus.

     The variation with temperature of specific inductive capacity was
 measured in different ways for solids and liquids.
     In the case of solids a condenser was made with thin sheets of the
 dielectric in question, and the capacity measured at different tempe
 ratures.    The condenser was suspended in an air-bath by wires pass
 ing through the top to an insulated support outside.                 This support
 was several feet above the bath, so that it was never heated, and its
 insulation was independent of the temperature of the condenser. The
 capacity was measured by Professor J. J. Thomson's method,* and
 conduction or absorption in the condenser allowed for by varying the
 time of charge and discharge.          The rate of increase per degree centi

 liquid in question, and the deflection observed at different tempera
 tures.    The liquid was heated in a water-bath, and the needle and
 quadrants were attached to insulating supports above the bath.                    The
 electromotive force was obtained from a Ruhmkorff coil without the
 condenser, and with a high resistance between the terminals by which

 connected to the poles of the liquid electrometer, and the ratio of the
readings of these two gave a measure of the specific inductive capa
 city independent of variations of E.M.F. The results are shown in

XII. "On       the Interchange of the Variables in certain Linear
       Differential Operators." By E. B. Elliott, M.A., Fellow
       of Queen's College, Oxford. Communicated by Professor
       Sylvester, F.R.S. Received June 5, 1889.

   Recent theories of functional differential invariants, reciprocants,
cyclicants, &c, have brought into notice a considerable number of

 1889.]    Variables in certain Linear Differential Operators.               359
linear differential operators, whose arguments are the derivatives
of one with regard to the others of a set of variables connected by
any single relation. By aid of such operators, in their quality of
annihilators or generators, the forms of classes of functions of the
derivatives having properties of persistence in form after various
classes of transformations have been discussed with some completeness,
and great light has been thrown on the properties of other functions
in connexion with such transformations.              Often, however, in cases
 where the transformations dealt with have not been symmetrical in
all the variables, the investigation has presupposed that a certain one,
or one of a restricted set, of the variables has been chosen as the
dependent variable.       A complete theory of the interchange of the
variables in the classes of functions has been a desideratum, and
towards the attainment of that end a theory of the interchange of
the variables in the operators has been a first requirement.              Such a
theory it is the aim of the present memoir to supply for the cases of
two and of three variables. I speak of the operators appertaining to
the two classes of cases as binary and ternary operators respectively.
 For the binary operators dealt with I adopt a general form, which is
a slight extension of one introduced in an able investigation of Major
MacMahon's, and for the ternary operators one that is closely
Analogous.

that of to, though somewhat special, is not excluded.
   What is sought and effected is the expression of any such operator
{ft, v ; m, n}x in terms of operators of the same form {/*', v ; to', n'},,
in y dependent.      The process depends on the use of a certain sym
bolical form for {/i, v; to, n}z, and on the proof that a simple factor
produces     from that symbolical form the symbolical form of the equi
valent y operator.

362               Decomposition       of C/ilomne-water    by Light.    [June    20,
   Most of the ternary operators which in recent investigations have
had their importance established, do not involve first derivatives.
They are the results of replacing first derivatives by zeroes in opera
tors such as above, or may be regarded as linear functions of different
operators.       The transformation of the various annihilators of pure
and projective cyclicants is considered from the latter point of view.
    It is indicated, however, without much development that, if pre
ferred, it is possible to consider the transformation of operators free
from first derivatives without use of operators in which those deriva
tives occur.       In illustration of the method it is established that, if

 XIII.    "On the Rate of Decomposition of Chlorine- water by
        Light." By G. Gore, LL.D., F.R.S. Received June 13,
        1889.
                                      (Abstract.)
   In this research, the author has investigated by means of the
voltaic balance the kind and amount of chemical change, the rate at
which decomposition proceeds, and the chemical composition of the
products formed at all stages of decomposition of chlorine-water,
when exposed to daylight and sunlight in colourless glass vessels.
   The chlorine-water, by exposure to diffused daylight, was decom
posed with moderate uniformity, but at a gradually diminishing rate,
as shown by the losses of voltaic energy, until no further loss of such
energy occurred ; the liquid then consisted of an aqueous solution of
hydrochloric acid, hypochlorous acid, and chloric acid. By further
exposure of the liquid to daylight and sunlight during several weeks,
peroxide of hydrogen was formed ; and the amount of hydrochloric
acid and of voltaic energy very slowly increased until that of the
latter became about equal to that of dilute hydrochloric acid of equiva
lent strength to the whole of the chlorine present ; all the other
chief properties of the final liquid agreed with those of a mixture of
dilute hydrochloric acid and peroxide of hydrogen.                    Still further
exposure      to  strong sunlight       caused   no further   change in chemical
composition, amount of voltaic energy, or other property of the
liquid.

    This research shows distinctly that the decomposition of chlorine-
water by light may be divided into two essentially different parts or
periods of chemical change, and that the kinds of chemical change
occurring daring these two periods are largely different. During the
first period, a very great and gradual loss of voltaic energy occurs,
attended by formation of hydrochloric, hypochlorous, and chloric
acids.     During the second period, a moderate and very slow increase
of voltaic energy takes place, accompanied by decomposition of the
hypochlorous and chloric acids, a further formation of hydrochloric
acid, and the production of peroxide of hydrogen.     Under the influence
of prolonged sunlight, the whole of the oxygen of the hypochlorous
and chloric acids united with water to form peroxide of hydrogen, and
the peroxide then combined with the whole of the hydrochloric acid
                                           "
 to form a definite " solution compound      represented by the formula
2HC1,H20S.
    The chemical composition of the products of the change at the
 ends of the first and second periods of change was ascertained by
 means of the voltaic balance and ordinary chemical analysis.     During
 the first period forty consecutive measurements of the voltaic energy
 at stated intervals of time were made, and the energy diminished from
 about 1219 millions to 2-9 millions; and during the second period
 eight such measurements were made, and the energy increased to
 9"3" millions.   A curve is given showing the rate of loss of energy
 during   the first period.
    It is interesting to observe, that suitably decomposed chlorine-
 water, or, in its stead, a mixture of 6HC1 + H CIO + HC103 dissolved in
 a proper proportion of water, has the property of absorbing energy by
 exposure to light, very much like that possessed by the green leaves of
 plants.
  XIV.   " Barium Sulphate as a Cement in Sandstone."' By Frank
       Clowes, D.Sc, Principal and Professor of Chemistry and
       Metallurgy in University College, Nottingham. Communi
        cated by Professor ARMSTRONG, F.R.S. Keceived June 6,
        1889.
     About six miles west of Nottingham there are two prominent
  conical sandstone hills which are so different in appearance from any
  surrounding elevations of the surface as to arrest attention. These
  are known as Stapleford Hill and Bramcote Hill. In the gap between
  them stands a remarkable sandstone pillar, some 30 feet in height,
  and 70 feet in circumference, and distinctly crowned by a flattened
  mushroom-shaped cap. This is locally known as the Hemlock Stone.
  The sandstone beds forming these hills and columns have been classed

   364                         Dr. F. Clowes.                    [June 20,
  by geologists as the Keuper basement beds of the Trias. But no
  satisfactory explanation has yet been given of the power possessed by
  these bold elevations to resist the denudation which has removed the
  surrounding deposit.
     An analysis of a sample of sandstone from the top of the Hemlock
  Stone was made a few years since by R. F. Blake and A. P. Beddard,
  then students in my laboratory.       They detected a large amount of
  barium sulphate in a crystalline condition, inclosing and binding
  together the grains of sand.    This appeared to furnish a clue to the
  cause of the resistent power possessed by the stone.     In the company
  of Professor  Blake,  I proceeded accordingly to collect specimens of
  the sandstone present at different levels of the Hemlock Stone and
  of the two adjacent hills, and to subject them to qualitative analysis.
     Qualitative Componition. — The cap of the Hemlock Stone was
  found to be free from carbonates and from calcium, and contained
  much barium sulphate ; the stone was compact and hard. The soft
  loose sandstone at certain lower levels, however, contained some
  calcium sulphate and a variable proportion of calcium carbonate, the
 barium sulphate being in much smaller quantity than in the top ;
  sodium was also present in fair proportion.         The resistent power
  conferred by the almost insoluble barium sulphate upon the top of
 the stone would probably explain its projecting cap-like shape, the
 lower portions having suffered by weathering to a far larger extent,
 owing to the more soluble nature of the calcium compounds which
 they contained, and to the smaller proportion of the barium
 sulphate.
     The sandstone   of which Bramcote Hill is composed showed a
 variation in chemical    composition    similar to that of the Hemlock
 Stone.     The sandstone at the summit of the hill was free from
 carbonates, and contained much barium sulphate ; this was the
 general character of the stone at lower levels, but one sample, taken
 about half-way up the hill, contained calcium carbonate and a less
 proportion of barium sulphate.
    Stapleford Hill, on the other hand, showed throughout an absence
 of carbonates and of calcium, while barium sulphate was always
 present, and usually in quantity.
                   Distribution of  the Barium Sulphate.
    In certain portions of  the sandstone the barium sulphate is evenly
distributed throughout the mass of the rock, giving on fracture a
surface of compact and uniform appearance.          In other portions the
sulphate is seen on the surface produced by fracture as a network of
light-coloured compact veins inclosing darker and more or less loose
sand grains; the weathered surface in this case presents a honey

1889.]          Barium Sulphate as a Cement in Sandstone.                             365
combed or fretted appearance, which is particularly noticeable on the
cap of the Hemlock Stone.             In other parts, the fracturod sandstone
shows compact blotches of sand cemented by the sulphate, with inter
vening loose and darker portions; the stone at the upper part of
Bramcote      Hill is of this character,      and after prolonged weathering it
has been converted into         what    has  been   called the pebble bed ; this is
a loose sand bed inclosing rounded pebble-like masses of sand grains
bound together by the sulphate ; these are usually about the size and
shape of a hazel-nut.
    Quantitative Composition. — As this sandstone appears to be unique
in composition amongst the sandstones of this country, quantitative
analyses were made of the portions which contained the largest
proportion of barium sulphate.                    They yielded the following
results : —

    Weathering. — It would be inferred from the composition of this
 sandstone, that it would suffer loss only with extreme slowness by
 weathering, owing to the very slight solubility under ordinary condi
 tions of the barium sulphate.              Experiments were made to confirm
 this supposition by treating finely powdered specimens of Nos. 1
 and 2, the analyses of which have been given above, with hot dilute
 hydrochloric acid for some considerable time. Analyses of the solid
 matter dissolved by the acid gave the following results : —

   It may be assumed that the loss which the sandstone suffers by
long treatment in the form of powder with dilute hydrochloric acid,
will be greater than that caused by very long weathering, since the
hot acid is a more powerful solvent than rain-water, and it is further
enabled to attack the whole mass of the stone instead of the surface
only. Under these extreme conditions, however, the stone forming
the cap of the Hemlock          Stone lost only 3-7 per cent. of its weight.
Its protective power      as  an unwasting cover over the column beneath
is therefore easily understood.          The whole substance of the two hills
will evidently behave in a similar way to the top of the Hemlock
Stone, and render them practically permanent under the action of
weathering.
   Microscopic Examination. — Professor Lebour kindly undertook the
microscopic examination of a fine section of this sandstone, prepared
                                                 " the
by Mr. G. Healey. Ho reports that                          cementing material is
undoubtedly crystalline barium sulphate," and that " besides the
quartz grains, there are others of much the same average size and
shape, the nature of which is not clear."                  The quartz grains are
" more angular than rounded, and include narrow, rod-like crystals,
which in all likelihood are apatite."
           Occurrence of Barium Sulphate          in other    Sandstones.
   The occurrence of barium sulphate in British sandstones has not
been hitherto noticed; this at least was the verdict of the geologists
assembled at the British Association meeting at Aberdeen, before
whom a preliminary announcement of the discovery was made (' Brit.
Assoc. Report,' 1885, p. 1038).
   A careful examination of a large number of specimens of sandstone
from the neighbourhood of Nottingham, and from other parts of the
country, has confirmed this verdict. I have in no case found even a
trace of any barium compound.             Mr. H. T. Brown, F.R.S., however,

 1889.]         Barium Sulphate as a        Cement  in Sandstone.          3f¦7
 after examining at my request a number of specimens in his possession,
 f mud in one of them a small quantity of barium, entirely in the
 form of carbonate. This specimen was taken from the rock of Beeston
 Castle Hill, Cheshire,       from Keuper basement beds, of the same
 formation, therefore, as those in which the sulphate has been found
 in this neighbourhood. In the geology of the neighbourhood of
 Chester (' Geol. Survey Memoirs,' 1882, pp. 7, 8), Mr. Aubrey
 Strahan, M.A., states that barium sulphate occurs in cracks in the
 rock of Beeston Castle : and further infers that the sulphate may
 exist as a cementing material, since the cement gives a sulphur reac
 tion with the blowpipe. The presence of the sulphate in cracks of the
 stone is similar to its presence in crystal tufts in the cracks of the
 septaria of the London clay, which has been long known. The occur
 rence of the sulphate over a large area in the Nottingham district,
 as well as in Cheshire, seems to indicate that the substance may be
 characteristic of the particular formation in which it occurs in both
 localities, namely the Keuper basement beds.
    On the Continent the occurrence of barium sulphate, under con
 ditions more or less similar to those recorded above, has been
 recorded by Bischof (' Chem. and Phys. Geology,' vol. I, p. 433).
 Sandstone cemented by barium sulphate,               was found by him in
 Miinzenberg, in the Witterau.            He also describes disintegrated
 granite  as  being  found  cemented    by the sulphate on the declivities
 of the Morvan ; and sand and clay were found compacted by the
 sulphate in the district of Keuznach.
                            Process of Deposition.
    There seems little to indicate the way in which the nearly insoluble
sulphate has been deposited in the sand in the c;ise under considera
tion.    There is the possibility of barium sulphide in solution becoming
insoluble by oxidation, as suggested by Professor Church ; or the
sulphate itself may exist in solution under conditions at present
unknown, and be deposited directly from its solution.
    The fact that calcium sulphate was detected in some specimens of
the sandstone which I examined, and that barium carbonate was
found in similar beds in Cheshire, lends probability, however, to the
formation of the sulphate by double decomposition.           Bischof (he. cit.)
describes experiments      in   which   solid  barium   carbonate, as well as
barium bicarbonate or barium silicate in solution, were readily con
verted into barium sulphate by the action of any soluble sulphate,
such as the sulphate of calcium or of magnesium.              And Haidinger
                  ' Annalen,'
(Poggendorff's                  vol. 11, p. 376) has traced the change in
progress in nature; barium carbonate present in mountain limestone
of Alston Moor being found by him undergoing slow conversion from

   The abundant presence of calcium sulphate in the sandstone in the

sulphate having been formed in situ by the process of donble decom
position, and probably from barium carbonate which has been found
elsewhere in sandstone beds of the same formation.

         municated by Professor          ARMSTRONG,      F.R.S.       Received
         June    6, 1889.
  Specimens of remarkable deposits which have formed in the water-
boxes of coal-mines in the neighbourhood of Newcastle-upon-Tyne
have been for many years         in the possession of the Museum of the
Durham College of Science.
    A rough analysishas been published by J. T. Dunn (' Transactions
of the Newcastle Chemical Society,' vol. 3,   261) of an apparently
                                                   pj.
similar deposit, which was formed during the autumn of 1876 in the
Jane Pit at Walker. During this short period the sectional area of the
box had been reduced     by the deposit from seven and a half square
inches to less than half   square inch, and had been in places almost
                            a
completely   closed.   The deposit consisted of layers which were
alternately white and     brown, and was moderately soft. Analysis
showed     the percentage composition to be 90 of BaS04,  of SrS04,
                                                                  8
1   of   CaSO(, the remainder consisting mainly of Si02, A1S03, and
Fej03.    The water passing through the box at the time of the
examination contained no trace of barium or of strontium.
    Another similar deposit was found by Dr. Richardson            Brit.('
Assoc. Report,' 1863) to contain about 90 per          cent,  of barinm
sulphate and        of calcium sulphate, the remainder consisting of
                        3
silica, alumina, ferric oxide, and moisture.
    Professor Lebour states the pipes which convey water from the
colliery workings of the Newcastle district are frequently entirely
blocked in     short space of time with deposits, amongst which barium
                a
sulphate     seldom absent, and
            is                      often the chief constituent; and he
                                    is
draws attention to the fact that veins of barium sulphate are by no
means uncommon in the coal measures of that district.

   The above deposits were mainly buff-coloured with thin layers of
brown interposed; they were soft and loose, powder being easily
detached by rubbing the surface with the finger.                 There was no
appearance of crystallisation, but every indication of the deposit
having been formed by rapid precipitation.
   Professor Bedson (' Journ, Soc. Chem. Industry,' vol. 6, p. 712) and
others have found barium chloride to be a common constituent of
colliery waters of the district in which the above deposits have been
formed. Relatively large quantities of the chloride hare been found
in some of these samples. The deposition may possibly arise from
the admixture with such water of water containing sulphuric acid or
ferrous sulphate, or both; since these substances are constantly
formed by the oxidation of pyrites in the coal or in the associated
shale beds. Or the barium sulphate occurring in veins in the coal
measures may pass into solution under conditions yet unknown, and
be deposited     again   as such.
   Bischof mentions that hot springs may contain BaC03 and Na2S04
together in solution; since at high temperatures these substances do
not undergo double decomposition.            Such a spring w.iter will, however,
deposit BaSO* as it cools; since at ordinary atmospheric temperatures
BaS04 and Na2C03 are produced by the interchange of constituents.
Possibly alteration of temperature may in a similar maimer give rise
to the above remarkable water-box and pipe deposits.
   Possibly the deposition of barium sulphate in the form of stalactite,
which has occurred in some ports of Derbyshire, may be due to the
same causes as these mine- water incrustations.

 XVI. " Protoplasmic Movements and their Relation to Oxygen
       Pressure." By James Clark. Communicated by Professor
       Vines, F.R.S.      Received June 19, 1889.
                                 (Abstract.)
    That the presence of free oxygen is one of the essential conditions
of protoplasmic movements has long been recognised.           Further than
 this however the subject has not hitherto been investigated.
    The following are the results of a long series of experiments made
to ascertain the minimum pressure of oxygen necessary to restore the
streaming, amoeboid and ciliary movements of protoplasm after they
 have come to rest in the absence of that gas.           The object experi
mented upon was in each case placed in a hanging drop of water and
exposed to an indifferent gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen, or else
put into connexion with the exhausted receiver of an air-pump. In
the former case when the observed movement had ceased a current of
indifferent gas containing a definite percentage of oxygen was passed
over the object ; in the latter a small quantity of air was admitted
and the pressure registered.       By varying in successive experiments
the percentage of oxygen mixed with the diluent gas, and the quantity
of air admitted into the air-pump, the minimum pressure of oxygen
necessary to restore movement could be ascertained by both methods,
 so that one could act as a check upon.the other.
    In this way the minimum for the streaming movement in the
 plasmodia of Myxomycetes, and in the cells of hairs, of parenchyma,
of xylem, phloem and cambium was found to vary from 1 mm. to
 over 3 mm. It was lowest for the plasmodia of Myxomycetes, the
 minimum for Chondrioderma difforme being 1 mm., and for Didymium
farinaceum 1'2 mm.         Except with very old plasmodia the results
 obtained    even  with  unfavourable   specimens rarely exceeded 2 mm.
 With the vegetable cell the variation was much more extensive.           In
 such a favourable object as the root hairs of Trianea bogotensis a
 minimum of 1'2 mm. was occasionally obtained, whereas for the
 partly cuticularised leaf hairs of Urtica americana it sometimes
exceeded 3 mm.        With the cells of the parenchyma the experimental
 difficulties were  usually very great, and for those of the xylem, phloem,
and cambium still more so.         With the former the minimum found
for each plant usually lay between 2 mm. and 3 mm., and was some
times even less.      With the latter, cells of all three were found which
gave   similar  results but these were rare, as death of the cell contents
 usually arrested the experiment.        It seems probable however that if
variation due to experimental difficulties and the resistance of the
 cell wail to the passage of oxygen could be eliminated, the minima

1889.}              their Relation  to Oxygen  Pressure.               371
for the various tissues of different plants would not vary any more
among themselves       than do the    actual results obtained for naked
plasmodia.       .
   The age of the cell or plasmodium and the conditions under which
it has been developed to some extent influence the minimum oxygen
pressure necessary to restore movement.
   The time taken by the protoplasm to recover its streaming move
ment is too short to be measured in cases where the conditions are
favourable, as in young hairs and in slender threads of plasmodia,
but increases with cuticularisation of the cell wall, the age of the cell,
and the length of time between the cessation of movement and the
introduction of the necessary oxygen supply.
   Very slight irritation of the plasmodia during the experiment
causes them to contract towards definite centres where the protoplasm
assumes a more or less spherical condition.
   Temporary deprivation of oxygen in a cell showing circulation
induces a simplification in the arrangement of the protoplasmic
strands.    In the leaf cells of Elodea for example the circulation may
occasionally pass over into rotation.
   After the streaming in plasmodia has been restored by the intro
duction of the necessary oxygen pressure it ceases again in a very
short time.       The movement in fact can be maintained only by
constant small additions to the oxygen pressure.        This is not caused
by the consumption of the oxygen in the immediate neighbourhood.
   Amosboid movements continue in an atmosphere of hydrogen for
some time after the streaming has ceased.
   After ciliary movement is arrested in any healthy infusorian by
the absence of oxygen the organism soon begins to disintegrate.
The introduction of an oxygen pressure of about 1 mm. is sufficient
to arrest disintegration and restore ciliary movement, provided the
breaking up has not proceeded too far.
   The growth of the plant and the streaming of protoplasm in the
active cells thereof appear to be parallel phenomena, streaming, or at
least the power of very rapidly assuming the streaming movements,
being possessed by the parenchyma and probably the phloem of plants
ro long as they continue to grow in an atmosphere of hydrogen.
Inability on the part of the protoplasm to continue its movements
seems to be always associated with total cessation of growth.

XVII. "Note         on the Development of Voltaic Electricity by-
       Atmospheric Oxidation of combustible Gases and other
       Substances."       By C. R. Alder Wright, D.Sc, F.R.S.,
       Lecturer on Chemistry and Physics, and C. Thompson,
       F.I.C., F.C.S., Demonstrator of Chemistry, in St. Mary's
       Hospital Medical School. Received June 20, 1889.
    About fourteen months ago we had the honour of communicating
to the Society (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 44, p. 182) the results of a large
number of experiments made with electromotor cells, of which a
special feature was that one of the plates of the combination consisted
 of an " aeration plate," or layer of conducting material exposed to the
atmosphere, and consequently         superficially charged with a film of
condensed air, which served as a means of indirectly effecting the
oxidation of the other plate (when made of oxidisable metal), or of
 the fluid surrounding it (when the plate is of non-oxidisable material
 immersed in an oxidisable fluid).      We showed that the E.M.F. of a
 given combination varies very considerably with the nature of the
 material of which the aeration plate is made, surfaces of platinum
 sponge, and especially platinum black, yielding the highest results
 when the electrolyte is dilute sulphuric acid ; a convenient way of
 constructing the plates being to apply the spongy metal to the surface
 of unglazed earthenware, or other similar porous non-conducting
 material, so as to form a conducting film, the electrolytic fluid being
 absorbed in the porous material and so making contact.            "We also
 found that "the substitution of pure oxygen for air only increased the
  E.M.P. by inconsiderable amounts, and that somewhat analogous cells
  are obtainable by employing combustible gases, e.g., hydrogen, to sur
  round the aeration plate, the opposed plate being either an incorrodible
  one immersed in a fluid capable of supplying oxygen (permanganate or
  chromic acid solution, nitric acid, &c), or one itself capable of parting
  with oxygen (compressed lead peroxide, &c).            By employing two
  aeration piates, one in contact with the air and one with the oxidis
  able gas, a form of gas battery was obtained which, like all other gas
  batteries, furnished a current considerably less powerful than that
  due to the chemical action taking place, even under the most favour
  able conditions.
     The most convenient form of simple cell of this class examined by
  us consisted of a thin plate of unglazed earthenware, such as that
  used for the porous pots of a Grove's battery, both sides of which
 were coated over with spongy platinum to within a short distance of
  he edges, contact being made by means of thin strips of platinum
  foil pressed again.' t the coated earthenware by means of the clamping

  1889.]    Electricity developed by Oxidation of Gates,    fyc.      373
portion of an ordinary binding screw (fig. 1, aa).      One of the faces
of the coated plate was boxed in by means of thin sheet gutta-percha,
so as to form a shallow chamber, 6, into which hydrogen or other gas
could be led as required, by means of the inlet and outlet tubes, c, c ;
the other face was freely exposed to the air.       By impregnating the
porous   earthenware   with dilute sulphuric acid, caustic soda solution,
or other electrolyte, and filling the chamber b with oxidisable gas
 (hydrogen, coal-gas, carbon oxide, &c.), maintaining a slow current
through it to prevent material alteration of the internal atmosphere
by diffusion and osmosis, a form of gas battery was* obtained, capable
of furnishing continuous currents of sufficient magnitude to effect
very appreciable amounts of silver deposition in a silver voltameter.
Obviously, by increasing the size of the plates and arranging a
number of cells in series, the power might be greatly augmented ; to
effect this we arranged a series of coated plates in a covered trough
or box of insulating material, so as to form partitions, and thus divide
the trough into chambers alternately closed in and filled with hydro
gen. Ac., and open to the air (fig. 2). the connexions being made as
indicated, the outer faces of each pair of plates thus being freely
exposed to the air, and the inner faces in contact with a hydrogen
atmosphere ; obviously, to effect this disposition an odd number of
chambers is requisite, including those open to the air as well as those

374          Messrs. C. R.   A. Wright and C. Thompson.           [June  20,
fi lied with hydrogen, and an even number of doubly-coated porous
partitions.     We found that the difficulty in avoiding leakage of gases
from one chamber to another and various other causes usually pre
vented the E.M.F. of a battery of n doubly-coated plates from reach
ing quite as high as n times the E.M.F. obtainable from a single cell ;
in no case did we obtain as high an E.M.F. as 1 volt per cell, even
 with only infinitesimal currents, whilst 0'6 to 0"7 volt per cell was
iibout the highest value obtained with currents of magnitude sufficient
to measure readily with the silver voltameter.        Still our results were
 sufficiently good to convince ns that if the expense of construction
 were no object, so that large coated plates could be employed, enabling
 currents of moderate magnitude to be obtained with but small
 current density, there would be no particular difficulty in construct
       "                               "
 ing     double aeration plate cells      of this kind, competent to yield
 currents comparable with those derived from ordinary small labora
 tory batteries ; although we concluded that the economical production
 of powerful currents for commercial purposes by the direct oxidation
 of combustible gases did not seem to be a problem likely to be readily
 solved, chiefly on account of the cost of the large appliances that
 would be requisite.
     Precisely the same remark applies to all other forms of cell in
 which oxidation is effected by means of atmospheric air applied as an
 " aeration
              plate," at least, so far as our observations have extended.
 Given sufficiently large aeration plates, there is no difficulty in setting
 up aeration cells capable of producing moderately powerful currents,
 the energy being due either to the oxidation of a m«stal (e.g., zinc or
aluminium, &c), or to the oxidation of an oxidisable fluid, such as
solution of sodium hydrosulphite (Schiitzenberger's), ammoniacal
cuprous oxide, and such like liquids. As yet we have not succeeded
in effecting the direct oxidation in this way of alcohol, petroleum,

 1889.]     Electricity developed by Oxidation    of Gates, fyc.      375
 coal, and such, like forms of comparatively cheap sources of energy,
but we are far from being convinced that such actions are impractic
able.
    Our reason for bringing this note before the Society is that at
 the Conversazione of the Society last night (June 19th) there was
exhibited by Mr. Ludwig Mond and Dr. Carl Langer an elegant and
           "
compact      dry gas battery," said to have been invented by them, bat
substantially identical in principle with one of those experimented
with by ourselves some two years ago, chiefly differing in being
far larger and more neatly finished, and in consequence capable of
producing much more current than any arrangement constructed by
us.    It consisted of a battery of fourteen double aeration plates of
films of platinum leaf and platinum black, supported by porous
material impregnated with dilute sulphuric acid ; when fed with
hydrogen and air, as the gases introduced into the compartments
formed by the parallel plates arranged in a trough or box, it furnished
a current powerful enough to keep alight for a long time a small
incandescent lamp, and was stated to be capable of giving a current
of 2 ampei-es per element, with an E.M.P. of about 0'7 volt, the total
effective surface of each element being 774 square centimetres.
   [Note.
          — Since the above was written, we have had the opportunity of
seeing an uncorrected proof of a paper by Mr. Mond and Dr. Langer
entitled " On a New Form of Gas Battery

                                                 (read before the Society
on June 20th, 1889) in which the dry gas battery above referred to
is described, as well as various experiments on aeration cells ; and the
causes discussed which prevent the     E.M.F. of such combinations  from
being as large in practice as it theoretically ought to be, calculating
from the heat developed during the chemical actions taking place.
From the internal evidence of this paper, as well as from Mr. Mond's
assurances   to us, we   are  convinced  that the form of gas battery
described by Mr. Mond and Dr. Langer was not, as might perhaps bo
supposed, in any way suggested to them by our previous work (with
which indeed they appear to have been entirely unacquainted), but
was arrived at by them quite independently.            In this paper the
authors have repeated unknowingly varions of onr former experi
ments on aeration cells, with substantially the same results, as the
following figures indicate, obtained with cells where the aeration
plates were layers of platinum sponge and black resting on porous
plates moistened with dilute sulphuric acid, and opposed to various
metals immersed in the acid.

    Similarly, in attributing the diminution of the E.M.F. of gas
batteries below the calculated amount to the circumstance that heat
is evolved during the condensation of gases on surfaces like spongy

previous papers by one of us, and more especially with one published
in 1881, in which this and various allied matters were pretty fully
discussed,* and the conclusion arrived at (inter alia), that the heats

 date, but, in consequence of the small number of spots which have
been visible, the number of additional observations is only a little
over 150.     Last year very few observations could be made. The
eighth hundred of observations dates from August, 1885, to August,
 1887, and the first half of the ninth hundred from August, 1887, to
February, 1888.
   As on former occasions, I give Tables A, B, C, showing the numbers
of lines of iron, nickel, and titanium respectively which have been
recorded amongst the most widened.             Table D shows the results in
the case of the lines which may at present be described as " unknown
lines."

    The relation of the present observations to former ones is shown
in the accompanying diagrams (figs. 1 and 2).
    [In each observation the six most widened lines in each region are
recorded, so that in each 100 observations there are 600 lines in each
region. The relative numbers of the lines which are due to iron,
nickel, titanium, and unknown substances are graphically represented
by the curves.     The dotted line refers to tho lines of iron, the chain
line to those of nickel, the multiple line to those of titanium, and the
thick continuous line to those of unknown substances.
    The minimum period occurred in 1879, and the maximum at the
end of 1883, so that the observations now nearly extend through a
Sun-spot cycle.
    It will be seen that the conclusion I arrived at in 1880,* namely,
that " as we pass from minimum to maximum, the lines of the chemical
elements gradually disappear from among those most widened, their
places being taken by lines of which we have at present no terrestrial
representatives," is supported by the continued observations, espe
cially in the F — b region.
    The 150 observations now added were made by Messrs. Fowler and
Taylor, and reduced and mapped by Messrs. Coppen and Porter. —

of the variable stars which have been observed belong to those classe.s
of bodies which I now suggest are uncondensed meteor-swarms, or
condensed stars in which a central more or less solid condensed mass
 exists.   In  some of thoso having regular periods tho variation would
seem to be partly due to swarms of meteorites moving round a bright
 or dark body, the maximum light occurring at periastron."

 402              Mr.  J.  N. Lockyer.        On   the Cause   of      [Nov. 21,
 revealed   in the phenomena of variability, that is to say, the vari
 ability of the bodies we are now considering should be different
 in kind as well as in degree from that observed in some cases in
 bodies like the Sun or a. Lyree, taken as representing highly
 condensed types.      There is also little donbt,         I think, that future
 research will show that when we get short period variability in bodies
 like these, we are here really dealing with the variability of a close
 companion."
    The recent work of Chandler* on the colours of these interesting
 objects, and the relation of colour to period, furnishes further tests of
 the theory which I suggested as to their origin.
                   Variability due    to  Subsidiary Swarms.
    Briefly, this was that in the case of the stars of Group IT, which
 spectroscopic   observations show to be composed of uncondensed
Fro. I-   diagram slowing the prubable origin of variability in condensing swarms.

1889.]       Variability in condensing Swarms       of  Meteorites.       403
swarms of meteorites, the variability is produced by the revolution of
one or more smaller swarms round the central swarm, the maximum
luminosity occurring at periastron passages, wlien the revolving
swarms are most involved in the central one.
   Fig. 1 illustrates this suggestion in the simplest case, where there is
only one revolving swarm, as in Mira Ceti.          The range of variability
depends upon the eccentricity of the orbit and the periastron distance
of the revolving swarm.
   According to this theory, the normal condition is that which exists
at minimum, and in this respect it resembles that suggested by
Newton, namely, that the increase of luminosity at maximum was
caused by the appulse of comets.          All other theories take the maxi
mum as the normal condition and the minimum as a reduction of the
light by some cause, such as a large proportion of spotted surface or
eclipses by dark bodies.      In the variables of the Algol type, where
the periods are very short, there can be no doubt, after the Henry
Draper Memorial photographs, that the eclipse explanation is the
true one. But in the variables of Group II, where the period is
about a year and the luminosity at maximum in the generality of
cases is about 250 times, though in others it runs up to 1600, that at
minimum (corresponding to a difference of six magnitudes), it is
obvious that the eclipse explanation no longer holds, on account of
period, and also that the spotted surface explanation is inadmissable
on account of range.        If, however, the minimum be taken as the
normal condition, and the effects of the revolution of such a swarm
as I have assumed be considered, both length of period and range of
variability can be explained.       In this class of variables' the rise to
maximum      is more rapid  than  the fall to minimum, and, according to
my explanation, the sudden increase is due to the first collision
 between the two swarms, while the fall to minimum represents the
gradual toning down of the disturbance.
                              Tests of the Theory.
    In the Bakerian Lecture (p. 84)      I showed   how this explanation of
variability bore four distinct tests.      The first test was that Group    II
should be more subject to variability, than any other group ; and I
showed that 1 out of every 7 stars of Group           II  are variable, whilst
only 1 in 659 of the stars included in Argelander's catalogue are
variable.     The other tests were : — (2) when the swarm is least con
 densed, we shall have the least results from collisions ; (3) when it
 is fairly condensed, the effect at periastron passage (if «e take the
simplest   case, where there is only a single revolving swarm) will be
greatest of all ; (4) in the most condensed swarms there will be little
or no variability, because the outliers of the central swarm may be

drawn entirely within the orbit of the secondary body.                     I gave tables
to show that these tests were satisfied by all the variables included
in Duner's catalogue of red stars.* In the tables which follow, it
will be seen that by far the greater number of variables in the group
under discussion fall in species 9 and 10, which may fairly be taken
to represent the mean condensation, there being in all 15 species.
There can, therefore, be no doubt that the three tests just referred to
are  fully satisfied.
   In this paper        I   propose to further test my theory by the colour
observations of Chandler and by the question of irregularity, con
fining myself to stars known to belong to Group                 II  of which Chandler
gives the degree of redness.               The stars selected for discussion are
the Ilia variables from Gore's revised catalogue.
                    II.   Details of Variarles of Group               II.
   The following tables contain all the particulars of stars with
periods varying from 50 to 500 days.                        Gore's, Chandler's, and
Duner's star numbers are given as well as the star's name. The
magnitudes of the variable at maximum and minimum, and also the
period, have been taken from Gore.
                                     Colour Notation.
   On Chandler's colour scale 0 corresponds to pure white, 1 to white
very slightly tinged with yellow, 2 and 3 to deeper yellow tinges,
4 to orange, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to gradually deepening reds, and finally
 10 corresponds to the deepest red stars known, such as R Leporis.
   The colour notation employed by Duner is as follows : —
               Brrj                                 Almost absolute red.
               Rrj                                  Red-yellow fonce\
               Rj                                   Red-yellow.

   In  the Bakerian Lecture for 1888               I gave  a series  of tables in which
the stars of Group            II  were classed in different species according
to their spectra.            I  have accordingly given with each variable
the number expressing the species to which it belongs.                          In some
cases, the details have not been sufficient to assign the star to a
definite species, but have been enough to determine whether it was
near the first (Species 1) or the last (Species 15). In such cases, the
words " early
                   " or "late" are                          Where the species of a
                                            appended.
star is doubtful, the word " indeterminate " expresses that fact.

1889.]        Variability in condensing Swarms of Meteorites.                      409
                  III.    The Relation of Colour to Period.
                             Mr. Chandler's Observations.
   In  the tables given the particulars relating             to period and range     of
variability are taken from Gore, and Chandler's colour-numbers are
placed in a separate column.
   Mr. Chandler has shown* that there is an                       intimate connexion
between the length of period of a variable star and its colour.                      In
general,   the  longer     the   period   the   redder   the  tint.   If  the period  is
between 500 and 600 days, the mean redness on his scale is about
7-5 ; for periods of about 300 days, it is about 3 ; and for shorter
periods it is 1 or 2. This is exactly what would happen if my theory
were true.
   In order to investigate the cause of this relation it is necessary that
I  should refer to Chandler's work in connexion with my previous
classification of the 297 bodies of Group             II  spectroscopically observed
by  Duner.
   The Relation of Colour to the Degree of Condensation                 in Swarms of
                                         Group II.
    In   the Bakerian        Lecture      I provisionally divided the bodies of
Group    II  into fifteen species,      the  first being the least and the last the
most condensed swarms.               If then the degree of condensation of a
swarm has any relation to colour, the work of Chandler on the colours
of variable stars, taken in conjunction with this classification, ought to
enable us to determine the nature of such relation.
   In order to determine Chandler's colour-numbers corresponding to
these, tables were prepared comparing Duner's colours of the variable
stars of the group with the colours assigned by Chandler to the same
stars.   Two stars which Duner gives as Rrrj occur in Chandler's list,
the colours being 6'9 and 8-l respectively, or a mean of 7-5.
   The colour-number corresponding to Rrrj has therefore been taken
as 7-5.     Similarly, there are ten Rrj stars in Duner's list for which
the mean colour-number assigned by Chandler is 5-9, and so on.
                               Duner's     Colour   = Brrj.

   It  will  be seen   that the increments for one colour stage of Duner are
1-6,  1¦7,  and   l-8 respectively, or a mean of 1¦7. Since there are none
of Duner's Jjr stars in Chandler's list, we may use this increment to
approximate to the colour ; this gives us the number 07. We thus
get:—

418               Mr.  J. N. Lockrer.        On the Came     of     [Nov. 21,
    The remaining stars observed by Duner are not included in the
classification at present, owing to insufficient details.
    The result of this comparison of Duner's and Chandler's observa
tions, taken in conjunction with my classification in species of the
bodies of Group II, goes to show that the swarms with a mean con
densation are the reddest.       For, although the results are not quite so
uniform as might be desired, there is a decided maximum of redness
in species 9 and 10, which may fairly be taken as the swarms with
mean spacing.      The greatest discrepancy is in Species 1, but here the
result depends upon the observations of one star, and even that is not
definitely"
            known to belong to Species 1. (See " Bakerian Lecture,"
p. 65.)
    It may be objected      that the foregoing series of numbers is not
sufficiently regular for any trustworthy conclusions to be arrived at.
But the very decided maximum in Species 10 is of itself sufficient
evidence that the irregularities on both sides of it are dne to the
difficulties of observation.     I  have g.me over Duner's observations of
the spectra and colours of the bodies of Group        II without reference to
my temperature      classification,   and  the result  shows   that where the
spectra are described as identical, the colours sometimes differ con
siderably. The table on page 419 shows that this is the case. The
numbers in the vertical columns indicate the numbers of stars of any
particular colour associated with a particular spectrum.                Thus,
amongst     the stars with a spectrum containing the band 1 — 10
uniformly developed, 3 have the colour Rij, and 5 are Rj.
   It will be seen, therefore, that, even if my classification into species
be not accepted, the relation between colour and spectrum in the
prosent state of our knowledge is not absolutely definite.
    [This is probably to a great extent due to the variability of the
stars of the group.     All of them may be more or less variable, and it
may often have happened that the colour of a star has been recorded
at one time and its spectrum at another, when the colour was slightly
different.    Some of the slight variations observed may also bo due
to variation in the atmospheric absorption. — November 1, 1889.]
    On reference to the tables of variables which I give in this paper it
 will be seen also that the relation between colour and period observed
by Chandler is only a general one.
    We may, therefore, for the present rezard the swarms with mean
 spacing as the reddest.         The sparsest swarms vary from blue to
 greenish-white, so that the redness will gradually deepen in passing
 from these to the mean swarms.           Again, in passing from the mean
 swarms to the most condensed ones, the redness must gradually dis
appear, for we know that the stars of Group         III  are yellow or white.
    The following represents the colour-condition of stars of Group         II
both more and less condensed than the mean swarms.

Hence no definite conclusion ns to temperature of Group               II   stars can
be  arrived at by colour observations alone, since stars cooler than the
mean, as well as hotter, give the same colour.
            The Cause of the Relation between Colour and Period.
   On reference to the tables of variables, it will be seen that there are
none less condensed than Species 7. This means that the sparsest
swarms either exhibit no variability at all, or their variability is of such
a character as to escape notice.            The reason for this is not far to seek.
Firstly, if there be any revolving swarms with small orbits, they will
never be entirely out of the central swarm, and their effect will
simply be to produce a general increase of brightness of the swarm.

4-20             Mr.  J. N. Lockyer.        On   the Cause    of    [Nov. 21,
 Only revolving swarms with large orbits will therefore be effective
 in producing variability, but even these will only cause variability of
 short range, since the number of collisions at periastron passage will
 be small, the swarm being sparse.       In the sparsest swarms, therefore,
 the variability will be of a long period and the range will be small.
 These are no doubt the causes of the variability having been over
looked.
    When we pass to the mean swarms, however, tho variability
becomes more strongly marked.          Cometic swarms of short period, if
they exist at all, will still only produce a general brightening of the
central swarm, and the swarms most effective in producing variability
will therefore be those with moderately long periods.            The range of
variability will depend upon the eccentricity of orbit and the periastron
distance of the revolving swarm, as in the general case.
   As the central swarm becomes more and more condensed, and
therefore gradually loses its redness, only shorter period swarms will
be effective in producing variability, as the oatliers will have been
drawn entirely within the orbits of longer period swarms, if they
exist at all.
   Still further condensation of the central swarm will draw the
outliers within the orbits of the revolving swarms, which would
produce variability in the swarms last considered, and now only very
short period swarms are concerned.           At the same time the colour
will have become yellow or yellowish-white, the swarm having
passed from Group II to Group III.
   It will be seen that my theory perfectly explains the general
relation of period to colour which has been observed by Chandler and
pi eviously by Schmidt,* and in fact demands it.
   The range of variability does not appear to tear any relation to the
periodicity (except perhaps in the sparsest swarms), and this is only
what we should expect, as the conditions on which the range depends
(periastron distance, and eccentricity of orbit of revolving swarm)
are special to each star.    Cometic swarms in our own system follow
no general rule as regards the eccentricities of their orbits, or their
perihelion distances.
              IV. The Irregular VariaBles of Group II.
   The next test is that of irregularity.        The apparent irregularities
in the variability of stars in the group under discussion are, on my
theory, produced by the revolution of several swarms of meteorites
at different rates and different distances round the central one.         The
swarms most subject to irregularity should, therefore, on this view,
be those which are most likely to suffer from the effects of the

greatest number of revolving swarms.              These will not be the sparsest
swarms, for the reason that the short period swarms will only produce
a general brightening, as already pointed out, leaving the long period
swarms predominant. Neither will they be the most condensed,
because most of the cometic swarms will sweep clear of the central
swarm at periastron passage. They must, therefore, occur in the
swarms of mean condensation, if anywhere at all, though mean
swarms need not necessarily exhibit irregular variability.                  The facts
observed show that out of the five irregular variables of Group II,
 three have colours indicating a mean condensation, while two appear
to be a   little further condensed.

    The spectroscopic observations confirm the conclusion that irregu
larity mostly occurs in mean swarms; it will be seen that with the
exception of a Orionis, which is only very slightly variable, the
species to which the irregular variables belong are 7 — 10, indicating
mean condensation.
         V. Bright Hydrogen in Variable Stars of Group II.
    I  have already pointed out* that in the class of variable stars
under consideration the bright lines of hydrogen might be expected
to make their appearance at maximum. For since the bodies of
Group    II    are very much akin to nebula?, an increase of temperature
such as occurs at maximum should be accompanied by the appearance
of bright hydrogen, because a greater quantity of incandescent gas
would then occupy the interspaces.
    Under normal conditions there are neither bright nor dark hydrogen
lines in the spectra of bodies of Group II, the simple and sufficient-
explanation being that the bright lines from the interspaces balance
the dark lines from the meteoritic nuclei. " Anything which in this
condition of light-equilibrium will increase the amount of incan-

422       Variability in Condensing Swarms of Meteorites.               [Nov. 21,
descent gas and vapour in the interspaces will bring about the
appearance of the hydrogen lines as bright ones. The thing above all
things most capable of doing this in a most transcendental fashion is
the invasion of one part of the swarm by another moving with a high
 velocity.   This is exactly what       I  postulate. The wonderful thing
under these circumstances then would be that bright hydrogen shonld
not add itself to the bright carbon, not only in bright lino stars, but in
those the spectra of which consist of mixed flutings, bright carbon
representing the radiation."*
   That the bright lines of hydrogen do make their appearance at
maximum, in some of the stars at all events, is placed beyond doubt
by the recent observations of Mr. Espin at Wolsingham.
     On August 13, 1883, Mr. Espinf noted " a very bright line, appa
rently F," in the spectrum of R Cygni, the maximum of the star
occurring on July 19th.
   The spectrum of o Ceti was also observed by Mr. Espint on
October 23rd and 30th, 1888, the maximum of the star occurring on
September 28th.        Duner's bands from 1 to 10 were seen, and the
observer noted that on October 30th, when the star had faded con
siderably, bands 8, 9, and 10 seemed to be broken into two, but he
was doubtful whether these interferences were due to bright lines or
not.    A brilliant line was observed in the violet, which was thought
to be h (hydrogen).         It is very probable also that bright F was
present on this date and caused the second maximum in band No. 9.
   Bright lines of hydrogen and other substances were photographed
in the spectrum of Mira by Professor Pickering in November, 1886,
the maximum occurring on November 14th.
   Mr. MaunderJ observed bright hydrogen (G) in the spectrum of
Mira on October 5th, 1888, but on December 1st it was not recorded.
   Mr. Espin has also announced in a recent circular (April 2nd,
1889) that there are bright lines in the spectra of R Leonis and
R Hydrae. He states that " the spectra of R Leonis and R Hydrae
contain bright (hydrogen ?) lines, first seen on February 25th.
Observations confirmed, through the kindness of Mr. Common, by
Mr. Taylor, at Ealing, who sees two in R Leonis and one in
R Hydrae." Both these stars were near their maxima at the time
of observation, that of R Leonis occurring on March 23rd, and that
of R Hydrae on February 1 7th.

   The appearance of the hydrogen lines at the maximum and their
disappearance as the stars fade will no doubt eventually be found to
be among the characteristic variations of the spectrum which accom
panies the variation of light in stars of this class.
                                 VI.   Conclusion.
   As far as Group      II  is concerned, I think it will be granted that
the meteoritic theory of variability is quite in harmony with the
facts observed, considering that the observations are still incom
plete.   The theory does not require that all the swarms of the
group should be variable, but only those which are condensing
double or multiple nebulae.           At the same time it requires that this
group should be more subject to variability than any of the others,
and this is one of the best established facts of modern astronomy.
Not only are these general demands satisfied, but the theory bears
the strain put upon it when it is used to explain the finer details, as
1 have shown in this paper.

       Connexion of different Classes of Nerve Fibres with them."

   Hirschmann* has shown that after a moderate dose of nicotin
stimulation of the sympathetic nerve in the neck causes no dilation
of the pupil. He concludes that nicotin paralyses the endings of the
dilator fibres in the pupil.
   In the course of some observations on the physiological action of
nicotin, we had occasion to repeat Hirschmann's experiment ; we
found in the rabbit that 30 to 40 mgrms. of nicotin injected into a
vein stopped the effect of stimulating the sympathetic in the neck,
not only on the pupil, but also on the vessels of the ear. A paralysis
of the vasomotor fibres of the sympathetic had been suggested by
Rosenthal, t on the ground that nicotin causes a state of congestion in
the vessels of the ear of the rabbit.
   Since we had been much struck with the profound action of nicotin
upon the central nervous system, and since it had seemed to onej of
us in some previous experiments with atropin that the secretion of
saliva from the sub- maxillary glaud of the cat failed earlier on stimu-

lation of the sympathetic nerve in the neck than on stimulation of
the sympathetic fibres proceeding from the superior cervical ganglion,
it occurred to us that the action of nicotin might be dne to a paralysis
of the nerve cells of the superior cervical ganglion, and not to a
paralysis of the peripheral endings of the sympathetic nerve.             On
testing  this  view,  by stimulating   the  sympathetic    above  and  below
the superior cervical ganglion after injection of nicotin, we found that,
whilst stimulation below the ganglion produced no effect, stimulation
above the ganglion produced a dilation of the pupil and a constriction
of the vessels of the ear, as if no nicotin had been given.        The effect
of stimulating the nerve fibres above the ganglion is not abolished by
an amount of nicotin four to five times as great as that sufficient to
abolish the effect of stimulating the sympathetic nerve in the neck.
This point, however, we shall consider more in detail in a later paper
npon the general action of nicotin.          We are here only concerned
¦with the fact that after a certain dose of nicotin       stimulation of the
sympathetic fibres   below  the ganglion   does  not produce dilation of the
pupil or constriction of the vessels of the ear, whilst stimulation of the
sympathetic nerve fibres above the ganglion     produces these changes in the
normal manner.
   It is conceivable    that the difference   in the effect of stimulating
above and below the ganglion might be due to the nerve fibres being
mednllated below and non-medullated above the ganglion, and to
nicotin paralysing the former and not the latter. But, in the first
place, although it is probable, it has not been shown, that the dilator
fibres of the pupil and the vaso-constrictor fibres for the ear are
 mednllated below the ganglion ; and, in the second place, it is obvious
that mednllated fibres as such are not paralysed by nicotin, since for
some time after the stage in which stimulation of the sympathetic in
the neck fails to affect the pupil or the ear, stimulation of a nerve
such as the sciatic will cause movement both directly and reflexly,
that is to say, at this stage neither the mednllated sensory fibres nor
the medullated motor fibres to skeletal muscle are paralysed.
   The method of action of nicotin can be tested in a more direct
manner.     If the alkaloid produces its effect by acting upon the nerve
below   the   ganglion in consequence of any peculiarity of structure
obtaining there, the local application of nicotin to the nerve should
abolish its irritability. If, on the other hand, it produces its effect by
acting upon the nerve cells in the superior cervical ganglion, the
local application of nicotin to the nerve should have very little effect
 upon the nerve irritability, but the local application to the ganglion
 should abolish the effect of stimulating the nerve centrally of the
ganglion.
   In making the experiment on these lines, we isolate the sympathetic
 nerve in the neck, the superior cervical ganglion, and to a certain

extent the filaments proceeding from it to the external and internal
carotid arteries.       Having stimulated the sympathetic in the neck, and
observed its normal action on the eye and on the ear, an inch and a half
or so of the nerve is brushed over with a 1 per cent, solution of nicotin.
Any excess of fluid around the nerve is removed by blotting paper,
and the moistening the nerve with dilute nicotin is repeated.                         The
central part of the nerve is stimulated several times at intervals of
about two minutes ; it produces the usual dilation of the pupil and
constriction of the vessels of the ear. The ganglion and the filaments
proceeding from it are then brushed over with 1 per cent, nicotin ; the
sympathetic in the neck is again stimulated ; it is found to be com
pletely without effect ; stimulation of the filaments running from
the ganglion to the arteries produce the normal action.                    Hence nicotin
paralyses the cells of the superior cervical ganglion.
    Besides the dilator fibres for the pupil and the vaso-constrictor
fibres for the ear, the cervical sympathetic contains vaso-motor fibres
for the head generally, and secretory fibres for the salivary glands.*
 On these we have made a few experiments only ; but, so far, we find
that (in the rabbit and cat) after the application of nicotin to the
superior cervical ganglion stimulation of the cervical sympathetic no
 longer causes secretion or pallor in the snb-maxillary gland, nor
pallor of the mouth. In fact, after nicotin has been applied to the
 ganglion, we have been unable to detect any effect from stimulating
 the sympathetic in the neck.
    We conclude that the dilator fibres for the pupil, the vaso-conitrictor
fibres   for the ear (probably also those for the head generally), and the
 secretory fibres for the glands end in the cells of the superior cervical
 ganglion.
     The paralysis of the cells is produced with remarkable ease ; in the
rabbit and cat a complete abolition of the effects of stimulating the
 sympathetic in the neck results from a single
                                                                   " painting " of the
 superior cervical ganglion with a small brush dipped in 1 per cent,
 nicotin. The experiment is most easily performed in the rabbit. In
 the cat the simplest method is to dissect away the connective tissue
 on the mesial and dorsal side of the ganglion, to pull upwards and
 laterally the muscles lying by the carotid, and then, without separa
 ting the ganglion of the trunk of the vagus from the sympathetic
 ganglion, to moisten the exposed medio-dorsal surface of the latter
 with dilute nicotin.         Of course, by this method, some nicotin will be
almost certainly applied to the ganglion of the trunk of the vagus ;
 we may mention, as showing that the nicotin affects the nerve fibres
    * According to Heidenhain
                                  (' Pfliiger's Archiv,' vol. 6, 1872, p. 316), when about
 15 mgrms.   of niootin are injected into the vein of a dog, the sympathetic secretory
 fibres are for a short time paralysed — presumably this is for stimulation of the
 cervical sympathetic.

the inhibitory power of the vagus upon respiration is apparently
unaffected.

applying nicotin to the ganglion and to the nerve is so great that
there      practically no danger of confusing the action on the cells

    To paralyse the ganglion           asecond time requires a very mnch
 larger dose of nicotin than was required the first time.               Painting
it  over with even 0'5 per cent, nicotin without any excess of fluid may
be sufficient the first time, but painting the ganglion half-a-dozen
times with       1per cent. nicotin may be required to paralyse         a second
                                                                          it

especially with nicotin. Apparently also the period of paralysis lasts a
shorter time after the second application of nicotin than after the first.
    A» rule, the application of nicotin to the ganglion causes for a
          a
brief period the same effect as stimulating the nerve.              The alkaloid
appears to excite the nerve cells before paralysing them.

                        Ganglion of  the  Solar Plexus.
    In the dog1, cat, and rabbit the splanchnic nerve on the left side
runs to two chief ganglionic masses. Since the npper of these ganglia
Bends its nerves chiefly to the coaliac axis and the lower sends its
nerves ch;efly to the superior mesenteric artery, we may call these
respectively the eceliac and superior mesenteric ganglia. From the
solar plexus nerve fibres run to the kidney. Usually these are joined
by fibres direct from the splanchnic. In the cat and dog there has
been in the cases we have examined a lesser splanchnic, running
partly to the Tenal plexus and partly to the solar plexus.             The renal
ganglia are, as is well    known,   scattered,   but  in the dog  the   chief one
often lies underneath the supra-renal body, and in the cat the chief
one is placed between the artery and vein on fibres proceeding chiefly
from the superior mesenteric ganglion and about ^ inch from it.
     Our experiments upon the connexion of the splanchnic with the
ganglia of the solar and renal plexus have been made almost entirely
on the left side, and in the following account we speak of the nerve
 and ganglia of the left side, unless the right side is especially men
 tioned.
     When the stomach and intestine are exposed there are usually slight
movements of the intestines, and there may be movements of the
 stomach.     When these are absent they may be brought about, with
 a degree of distinctness varying with the animal, by stimulating the
 vagns.    These movements continue for a short time after the nerve
 stimulation has ceased.       Stimulation of the splanchnic stops the
 movements, whether they are spontaneous or are occurring as the
 result of previous vagus stimulation.          These facts are well known ;
 but. whether the inhibitory fibres of the splanchnic end in the nerve
 cells of the solar plexus has so far been guess work.           To determine
 this we have proceeded as in the case of the superior cervical ganglion.
 Having ascertained that the application of 1 per cent, nicotin or
 nicotin sulphate to the splanchnic leaves its inhibitory power
  unaffected, we have painted one or other of the ganglia, or the whole
  plexus, with a small brush moistened with 1 per cent, nicotin or
  nicotin sulphate.    Nicotin applied to the whole plexus at once abolishes
  the inhibitory power of the splanchnic,            but inhibition, although
  naturally much less perfect,   can   still be  produced by stimulating the
  fibres proceeding from the ganglia. Hence the. inhibitory fibres of the
  splanchnic end in the cells of the solar plexus.     Further, if the superior
  mesenteric ganglion be brushed over with nicotin, stimulation of the
  splanchnic is still able to produce inhibition of the movements of the
  stomach, but is without any appreciable effect upon the movements
  of the intestine.    On the other hand, when nicotin ii applied to the
  coaliac ganglion, the inhibitory power of the splanchnic upon the intes

428      Messrs.  J.  N. Langley and W. Lee Dickinson.             [Nov. 21,
tines is not abolished,  but that upon the movements of the stomach in
the main at any rate is abolished.      Our experiments are not sufficiently
numerous, especially with regard to the connexion of the ccaliac
ganglion with the stomach, to make it certain that the one ganglion
is entirely connected with the fibres to the intestine, and the other
the fibres to the stomach, but we think they show that in the main, and
possibly altogether, the stomachic inhibitory fibres of the splanchnic nerve
end in the cells of the coeliac ganglion, and the intestinal inhibitory fibres
of the splanchnic end in the cells of the superior mesenteric ganglion.
The vagus is said to send fibres to the ganglia of the solar plexus.
We find, however, that copious application of nicotin to the plexus on
both right and left sides of the body does not interfere with the move
ments of the stomach and intestines produced by stimulating the
vagus in the neck : that is to say, the motor fibres of the vagus do not
end in the nerve cells of  the solar plexus.
   We may note that after nicotin has been applied to the ganglia of
the solar plexus the spontaneous movements of the intestine become
more pronounced ; that the ganglia recover in twenty to thirty minutes
from their state of paralysis ; and that to produce paralysis a second
time a larger amount of nicotin is required.
   The connexion of the vaso-motor fibres of the splanchnic with the
nerve cells of the solar plexus can be determined by taking a tracing
of the arterial blood pressure and stimulating the splanchnic before
and after the application of nicotin to the ganglia. In the rabbit and
cat, brushing either the ccaliac or the superior mesenteric ganglion
with 1 per cent. nicotin sulphate diminishes the effect of stimulating
the splanchnic.      The rise of blood pressure produced is much less
than previous to the application of niebtin.        By applying nicotin to
both ganglia, being careful not to allow any to reach the renal plexus,
the rise of blood pressure caused by stimulating the splanchnic is
reduced to very small limits — in the rabbit, indeed, there may be no
rise of blood pressure — and, by applying it to the renal plexus as
well, the effect of splanchnic stimulation on the blood pressure is
abolished.
   We have obtained some evidence that, as in the case of the inhibitory
splanchnic fibres, so the vaso-motor splanchnic fibres for the area
of distribution of the coeliac artery run to the coeliac ganglion, and
those for the area of distribution of the superior mesenteric artery
run to the superior mesenteric ganglion ; but the method of deter
mining this, viz., by observing the state of pallor of the viscera, often
gives unsatisfactory results.
   Bradford has recently shown that vaso-dilator fibres run in the
splanclmics to the kidney, and probably to the stomach and small
intestines. We find that after nicotin has been applied to the ganglia
of the solar and renal plexuses stimulation of the splanclmics causes

1889.]     On   the local Paralysis  of Peripheral Ganglia,      fyc.      429
no fall of blood pressure.      We conclude that the vaso-dilator as well as
the vaso-constrictor  fibres of the splanchnic end  in  the cells  of the solar
and renal plexuses.
    The connexion of the renal fibres with nerve cells, although it can
to a certain extent be deduced from observations like those we have
just given, is most satisfactorily made out by noting directly the
volume of the kidney with the aid of Roy's oncometer.            We have so
far only made this observation on the dog. In the dog copious appli
cation of nicotin 1 per cent. to the ganglia of the solar plexus
does not prevent stimulation of the splanchnic from causing a normal
large constriction, of the vessels of the kidney. This constriction, in
the few experiments we have made, has been as great as that occurring
before the application of nicotin to the solar plexus.      On the assump
tion that the constriction would be less if some of the vaso-constrictor
fibres had been put out of action, we conclude that few if any of the
splanchnic vaso-constrictor fibres for the kidney end in the gamjlia of
 the solar plexus.      On separating the supra-renal capsule from the
 underlying   tissue,   and  applying nicotin to the ganglia which lie
 underneath its lateral part, a decrease in the effect of splanchnic
 stimulation occurs, and on brushiug nicotin on the artery near tho
 supra-renal capsule there is a still further decrease in the effect.
 Since the dogs on which we have experimented have had much
fatty tissue around the artery and vein, we have not succeeded in
 laying bare the whole of the renal plexus without some mishap, and
 to this we attribute the fact that in the dog we have not obtained by
 the application of nicotin a complete abolition of the vaso-constrictor
 power of the splanchnic upon the kidney. Combining, however, the
 oncometer observations on the dog with the blood pressure observa
 tions on the rabbit and cat, we think there is fair evidence that the
 splanchnic  vaso-motor fibres  for the kidney end in  the cells   of the renal
 plexus.
     The immediate effect of the application of nicotin to the ganglia of
 the solar plexus is a rise of blood pressure and a dilation of the
 kidney, followed by a fall of blood pressure and a constriction of the
  kidney. The application of nicotin to the ganglia of the renal plexus
  causes a constriction of the kidney followed* by a dilation, both being
  greater than when nicotin is applied to the solar plexus, and with a
  comparatively small effect on the blood pressure.        Whilst normally
  stimulation of the splanchnic in most cases causes a slight primary
  dilation of the kidney, corresponding with the rise in blood pressure
 from constriction of vessels of the stomach or intestine, after nicotin
 has been given we have in no case observed a primary dilation of the
 kidney or stimulation of the splanchnic.
     We have experimented upon various peripheral ganglia other than
  those mentioned above, and, though our results are as yet incomplete,

 539 562,      PI. 32 and 33)        I  published the results of some investiga
tions into the structure and nature of the tubercular swellings on the
 roots of Vicia faba, the broad-bean of our gardens, paying attention
 to the hearing of the facts on other Leguminous plants, and discussing
 what had been done and written at various times concerning these
curious structures.
    The chief facts established in that paper were as follows : — That
 the tubercles occur in all places and at all times on the roots of
 Papilionaceous plants growing in the open land, but that in sterilised
 media and in properly conducted water-cultures they are not deve
loped, unless the root is previously infected by contact with the
contents of other tubercles.               In other words, the tubercles can be
produced      at   will  by  artificial  infection.    I also showed that the act of
infection is a perfectly definite one, and is due to the entrance into
 the root-hair of a hypha-like • infecting tube or filament, which
starts from a mere brilliant dot at the side or apex of the root-hair,
passes down the cavity of the latter, traverses the cortex of the root
from cell to cell, until its tip reaches the innermost cells of the cortex,
where it branches and stimulates these cells to divide and form the
young tubercle.
    It should be noted that these fruits of the infection were entirely
new, as were the methods, and that I showed actual preparations of
the infecting filaments passing                 down the root-hairs, to several
botanists at the time         (June, 1887).
    In my     paper      were also explanations of several points hitherto
obscure   — such      as  the curious trumpet-shaped enlargements of the
filaments where they transverse the cell-walls of the tissues,                  suggest
ing that they were due to subsequent stretching of the walls of the
meristematic cells. Also the peculiar haustoriom-like swellings of

cells of the inner parts of the tubercle are filled, and their relations
to the filaments, I expressed myself (somewhat cautiously it is true)
to the following effect.         From their curious shapes — those of the
letters V, Y, and X, and even more branched figures — suggested       I
that these bodies propagate by budding ; and from their relations to
the swollen ends of the intra-cellular branches of the filaments it was
not improbable that they are budded off from these, and multiply by
further budding in the protoplasm, Ac, of the cells.                Owing to the
extreme minuteness and high refractive index of these bodies, how
ever, I could not definitely decide as to the method of propagation ;
although no doubt existed that they are living
                                                           " germs," on the one
hand, and that they originate from the filaments, on the other.
I  also pointed out that their presence in the protoplasm of the cell
stimulates the latter and makes it resemble a plasmodium (p. 547).
Other points of importance will be recalled as we proceed.
   I   have now to draw attention to some results of my further
researches into this confessedly difficult subject.
   After numerous culture experiments and observations made last
year (1888), I have decided to abandon the broad-bean as the subject
for histological analysis, chiefly because it takes so long to exhaust its
stores of reserve materials ; it was better for the cultures to be made
with the pea, the cotyledons of which are so much smaller, and the
plant of which is more easily managed in every way in water- and
pot-cultures.     On the other hand, the tubercles and their contents
present   no  essential  features of difference, and, indeed, I may say at
the outset, that all that has been described with respect to the tuber
cles of the one is essentially true for those of the other. The position
on the roots and the sizes and shapes of the tubercles are the same,
and they appear under the same conditions.               The colour and general
structure of their internal tissues are similar, and the bacteroids of
the pea are so little different from those of the bean that it is difficult
to believe them specifically distinct.
   But I can offer more conclusive evidence than the above for the
  * Tschirch's word " bacteroids " is a very convenient one, as it does not
                                                                            commit
us to any statement as to the nature of these bodies.

  1889.]       Tubercles on the Roots   of Leguminous Plants.            433
  identity of the bacteroids in the two cases.      In some of the cultures
  made   in the summer of 1888 I infected the roots of the pea with bacte
  roids taken from the tubercles of the bean, and as this is a point
 of some importance, in view of the belief that each species of Legu-
  minosae may have its own species of bacteroid, I may say a few words
  on this phenomenon.
      Having satisfied myself that when the contents of the tubercles of
 the bean are placed among the root-hairs of the young bean root, the
 latter become infected, I prepared a number of beans and peas as
 follows : They were allowed to germinate in the sterilised sand until
 the radicle was about half an inch long ; each seedling was then
 pinned to a cork, and so fixed that the radicle pointed downwards
 into a large wide-mouthed bottle, in which the cork fitted.            The
 bottle was then carefully lined with filter-paper, kept moist by dis
 tilled water ; the cork fitted closely, and thus the atmosphere in the
 bottle was sufficiently damp to enable the radicle to go on growing
 at the expense of the reserve materials in the cotyledons, and in
 course of time to put forth a dense pile of delicate root-hairs. As
 each seedling was pinned on to the cork, I sprayed on to the surface
 of the radicle, by means of a freshly-drawn capillary tube, a mixture
 of bacteroids and water made as follows : Tubercles of the bean-roots
 were carefully washed, placed in alcohol for a few minutes, and then
 fired, then again washed with distilled water, and pounded in a
 mortar with distilled water : small drops of this were placed on the
 radicles as said — i.e., on the radicles of both peas and beans.
     In other cases    I  employed the hanging drops in which         I was
attempting to cultivate the bacteroids.        These consisted of nutritive
solutions with asparagin, and with or without gelatine, and in which
were placed a few of the bacteroids obtained from cleaned tubercles
 (cut with a razor sterilised by heat) by means of sterilised needles.
I   may here say that these cultures (i.e., as micro-cultures) have given
me much trouble, and little results : to obtain pure cultures is a
matter of greater difficulty than Beyerinck's paper would lead one to
expect, and it is not proposed at present to lay much stress on
the evidence got from them.        Nevertheless, colonies are obtained, and
in some cases at least I have transferred the infecting organism from
these cultures to the root-hairs of peas and beans.
                  I
    In any case, have succeeded in obtaining extracts of the tubercles
which contain the infecting germs, and although the latter were
always taken from the tubercles of the bean, they infected the root-
hairs of both peas and beans equally well.
    It is especially the very young root-hairs, with extremely delicate
cell-walls, that are infected, and the first sign is the appearance of a
very brilliant colourless spot in the substance of the cell-wall (figs.
A and B) : sometimes it is common to two cell-walls of root-hairs in
                                                              2 g 2

into a hypha-like filament at the expense of the- cell-contents. The
fui ther progress of this filament has already been described in my
memoir in the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1887.
    Before proceeding further, reference may be made to some re
searches made during 1888 and 1889 with the object of learning more
about the conditions which rule the development of the tubercles, and
the relations of the organism to them.       At first I set myself the task
of trying to discover a definite spore-stage, thinking that in the
rotting tubercles, or at the period of maturity of the plant, or at some
other time, it might be that the parasite would betray itself and
develop spores : this is not the case apparently, for my experiments
seem to prove conclusively that the well-being of the organism of the
tubercle and that of the pea or bean go hand in hand. This of course
is only so much evidence in favour of the view that we have here a
 case of symbiosis of the closest kind, as expressed in my previous
 memoir.
    One remark is necessary here. My object throughout had been
 more especially to determine the nature of the tubercles and of the
 organism which infests them : the further and larger question as to
 their function or influence in the economy of the Leguminous plant
 has been kept subordinate for the present, because         I am convinced
 that more time and appliances are necessary for its complete solution
 than are at my disposal at present.      At the same time some of the
 following results ought to help in solving the problem as to the
 possible   relations of the tubercle organism to the acquirement of
 nitrogen by the higher plant.
     During the spring and summer of 1888        I  made numerous experi
 ments with water-cultures with beans, allowed to germinate in soil so
                           "       " therein as demonstrated
 as to be infected by the germs                                 previously.
 Several dozens of such cultures were made, and some of them placed
 in the dark, others in the ordinary light of the laboratory, and some
 in a well-lighted greenhouse.      Tables were prepared showing the
 number of leaves, living and dead, the condition of the roots, the
 height of the stem, and so forth, as recorded every week or so (or at
 shorter intervals) when   I examined the plants. It resulted that when
 the beans are in any way so interfered with that they do not assimi
 late more material than is necessary for the growth and immediate
 requirements of the plant. the infecting organism either gains no
 hold at all on the roots, or it forms only small tnbercles which are
                              "
  found to be very poor in bacteroids :" in some cases the starving
 plants began to develop tubercles, which never became larger, and in
  which the infecting organism seemed to be in abeyance.           Whether
  this is due to the bacteroids being developed in small quantities, or
  to their absorption into the plant is still a question.
     I hardened many of these tubercles in picric acid, stained them,

  and    cut sections, comparing the results with similarly prepared
  normal tubercles : the chief difference was the paucity in bacteroids,
  and the prominence of the branched filaments in the cells.       Similar
  results were obtained by placing a box over beans growing in the
  garden, and comparing the tubercles of the etiolated plants with
  those of normal plants beside them.
                                        I
     In the spring of this year (1889) started a series of water-cultures
  of beans, infected artificially by placing the contents of tubercles on
  their root-hairs, and kept the roots oxygenated by passing a stream
  of air through the culture liquid for 24 hours at intervals of a few
  days : here again the increased growth of the plants — not compen
 sated by increased assimilation— seemed to cause the suppression of
 the tubercles, or the formation of very poor ones only. These experi
 ments, earned out on several dozens of plants, lead me to conclude
 that the organism which induces the development of the tubercles is
 so closely adapted to its conditions that comparatively slight disturb
 ances of the conditions of symbiosis affect its well-being : it is so
 dependent on the roots of the Legurninoste,        that anything which
 affects their well-being affects it also.
    Some experiments with peas, which are now being tabulated, may
 throw some light on the wider question which has been raised of late,
 as to the alleged connection between the development of these tuber
 cles and the increase of nitrogen in Leguminous plants. Thirty-two
 peas were sown in separate pots of silver-sand, or soil, in five batches
 of six each, and one of two, and treated in various ways.       Six were
 in garden soil ; six in silver-sand, with culture salts, including a
 nitrate; six in the same medium without nitrate; six in the sand,
 with traces of soil washings or with pieces of tubercles added ; six in
 sand sterilised by heating ; and two in sterilised sand, to which salts
 (including nitrogen) were added.       All but those in the thoroughly
 sterilised medium bore crops ; and these crops have been analysed for
 me by Professor Green. The soils, water, and other parts are being
analysed by Dr. Matthews of Cooper's Hill. I have to thank these
gentlemen for the great care and trouble they have kindly taken in
this matter.
    My object was to decide, if possible, certain points as to the effects
of such treatment on the development of the tubercles ; but the
experiment may possibly turn out more instructive than was at first
thought, and will at any rate suggest a line of inquiry to be followed
out in the coming spring and summer.

    With respect to these plants, may say that shall have data show

of the experiment ; how much was added ; how much the average
seedling pea contained ; and how much the crop contained in each
case.     The condition of each plant at convenient intervals was

    The tubercles were developed on all but one of the plants, except
those in the completely sterilised media.             However,    I  do not propose
 to go further into these matters at present, simply contenting myself
 with pointing out that all the evidence at present goes to show that
 the Leguminous plant gains nitrogen                by absorbing the nitrogen ms
 substance of the bacteroids from the tubercles; that nitrogenous sub
 stances are thus brought by the "bacteroids" ("gemmules") of the
 infecting organism of the plant ; and that, finally, no satisfactory-
 explanation seems forthcoming as to how the organism obtains this
nitrogen in certain cases where no compounds of nitrogen have been
added.        At any rate, if we regard the pot of sand and its pea as one
 system, there is in some cases a distinct gain of nitrogen in the crop,
 and in the sand at its roots.
     Since the publication of my paper in 1887, several observers have
 attacked the subject from various points of view. The most import
 ant papers are those of Vuillemin,* Beyerinck,t and Prazmowski,J
 who deal with the histology and biology of the subject ; and those of
 Hellriegel and Wilfarth, and of Lawes and Gilbert,§ who have con
cerned themselves especially with the nitrogen question ; papers on
accessory matters by Prank, Van Tieghem, and a few others have
also appeared in the interval.            I  propose to deal at present only with
 Prazmowski's papers, since there are several points in them that have
 special reference to my work on this subject.
     In the 'Botanisches Centralblatt ' for 1888,1] appeared a paper by
 Prazmowski, on the " Root-tubercles of the Leguminosse."                      After
shortly summarising the literature, and the various views promul
gated by different investigators as to the nature of the swellings, the
author proceeds to give an account of his own researches.                  He gives
me the credit of having taken a new departure ; speaking critically
of the want of experimental proofs for their speculative views on the
part of previous observers, he says,

438                       Prof. M. Ward.     On the             [Nov. 21,
    Experiments with peas and kidney beans enabled him to confirm
decisively the discovery that plants in sterilised media, watered with
boiled water, develop no tubercles on their roots, whereas those in
ordinary soil, or in sterilised media to which infective matter from
open soil or from, tubercles was added, always formed them.       In other
words, the tubercles arise by infection from without, as I had demon
strated.    He then proved that very young tubercles still show the
infecting filaments passing down the root-hairs,
                                                            " getvohnlichen

bright look, apparent want of membrane at first. granular contents,
 &c., all in accordance with my statements in 1887.
    The granular contents gave him much concern ; they are seen as
          -
minute rodlets under certain reactions.        The branching, piercing of
 cell-walls, &c, are described as by myself. The only difference here is
 that Prazmowski believes the rodlets to be the same as the bacteroids.
    He completely confirms my observation that the tubercle arises
from disturbances produced in the deeper cortical tissues by the
infecting filament, and describes the cell-contents, nucleus, &c., so
 well known. He also points ont that in the very young conditions,
 the bacteroids are simple rodlets, even in cases where they become
 V, Y, X,   &c., shaped later.
    To sum up, Prazmowski's        account  of the whole matter confirms
 that which     I gave to the Royal Society in 1887, excepting that he
 interprets the origin and nature of the bacteroids differently ; he
 regards them as produced from the contents of the filaments — as
 germ-like bodies developed in the interior of the filaments, and not
 budded off from them.        This is hypothesis only, however, for the
 author expressly states (p. 253), " Direct habe ich ihre Theilungtn
 nicht gesehen, obgleich ich mir die Milhe gab, sie in den verschiedensten
 Nahrmedien      und unter   den verschiedensten dusseren Bedingutigen zn
 ziichten."    He  concludes they can only multiply in the still liiring
 protoplasm.
     As to the shapes of the bacteroids      and tubercles,  Prazmowski's
 statements     agree with those of previous observers, and he also
 remarks the plasmodium-like appearance of the cell protoplasm at
 certain stages, as noticed by myself. Some observations on a possible
 spore formation need not be dwelt upon, as he recognised his mistake
 in a subsequent paper in 1889.
     He leaves the question as to the origin of the bacteroids by budding
 or otherwise quite undecided, having failed to satisfy himself whether

 1889.]       Tubercles   on the Roots    of Leguminous Plants.                 439
my suggestion is right or not ; at the same time he fully agrees
with me and others in believing that these tiny bodies must be the
infecting agents, easily and abundantly distributed as they are in the
soil, water, &c.
    In the 'Botanisches Centralblatt,' vol. 39, No. 12, 1889, p. 356,* is
a second paper by Prazmowski, on the nature and biological signifi
cance of the root tubercles of the pea, in which he sums up his views
so far.     He says, the root tubercles of the Papilionaceae are not
normal structures, but are caused by a special fungus, which inhabits
 the tubercles, and the spores of which must also occur in the soil.
 Hitherto he had been unable to determine the true nature of this
fungus, but only to show that it penetrates through the root-hairs
 into the young root, grows in it in the form of more or less branched,
 unseptate tubes, which are clothed by a dense refringent membrane
 and contain innumerable extremely minute rod- like bodies. Under
 the influence of this fungus the young tubercle is developed in the
 deeper parts of the cortex, and in its tissues the bacterium-like
 contents of the fungus become distributed, and grow, divide) and
 branch at the expense of the protoplasmic contents.              He regarded the
 phenomenon as one of symbiosis, and as benefiting the host as well
 as the parasite.
    Prazmowski then refers to the papers by Vuillemin, Beyerinck,
 Hellriegel, and Wilfarth, and says that these instigated him to take
 up the matter again, and to confine his attention to the pea. The
 summary of his new results runs as follows : —
     The tubercles are not formed in sterilised media unless infected.
     The infecting organisms are bacteria, identical in form and pro
 perties with those cultivated by Beyerinck from the tubercles of
 various species. From young tubercles the bacteria can be obtained
 and cultivated pure, and infections from the cultures cause the
 tubercles to develop.
     The development of the tubercles is only possible in young roots or
 rootlets ; infection does not occur in older portions of the root system.
     The tubercle-bacteria penetrate through young (not suberised) cell
 membranes into the root-hairs and epidermis cells of the root, and
 there multiply at the expense of the protoplasmic cell-contents.
  Their further development has so far been observed only in root-hairs.
 After accumulating and multiplying in the root-hair, they unite in
 racemose colonies at or near its apex ; these colonies become denser
 and closer, surround themselves with a resistent bright membrane,
 and join by its means the cell-membrane of the root-hair. Thus
 arises at the apex of a hair, and on its inner side, a bright knob,
 usually surrounded by free colonies of bacteria — i.e., colonies not

enveloped by membrane.         The top of the root-hair coils round the
knob, and the latter then puts forth a tube filled with bacteria and
surrounded by a brilliant membrane.
    From this stage onwards, till the tubercle is developed, this tube
behaves like a hypha, growing at tho apex, and putting out branches
beneath the apex which behave like the original filament.
     The tube now grows from the root-hair, through the cortex, and
even as far as the endodermis, boring through the walls of the cortex
cells, splitting them mostly into two lamellae, so that a swelling full
of bacteria and bounded by lamellae is formed.       In the cells the tube
grows towards the nucleus, and usually applies itself so close that the
latter is indistinguishable unless stained.         Hence, probably, the
reason why Beyerinck regarded the tube as "schleim
                                                          " debris remain
ing over from nuclear division. So far, we have no free bacteria in
cells ; they are all in the tube.
     As soon as the tube reaches the deeper layers of the cortex the cells
begin to divide, at first slowly and irregularly, then quickly ; and this
is especially true of the four or five innermost layers of the cortex.
Then also numerous thin branches are developed from the tubes,
enter the new cells, and branch in them.       The result is the meristem
of the tubercle.    The middle of the tubercle consists of a parenchyma
of larger cells, penetrated by tubes in all planes, and filled later with
bacteria freed from the dissolving tubes ; the outer layers consist of
smaller and more flattened cells with poorer contents, the membranes
of which are suberised later.     Between the bacteroid tissue and the
latter (cortex of tubercle) is a small-celled meristem, free of bac-
teroids ; this produces vascular bundles further back, and these fork
and are joined to those of the root.      Between the vascular bundles
and the bacteroid tissue is further a layer of starch-bearing cells, free
of bacteria.
     The place where the tubercle forms is predetermined by the infect
ing tube, and since this enters anywhere, the tubercles arise irregularly,
 i.e., opposite or not to xylem or phloem.      Pericambium has nothing
to do with it,   and  so Van Tieghem, Beyerinck, and others are wrong
in regarding these tubercles as modified lateral roots.
    After the tissues of the tubercle are differentiated and the bacteria
are set free (parts of the tubes do not burst and dissolve), the latter
fuse with protoplasm, multiply by growth and fission, become forked,
and subsequently form the bacteroids.          The further fate of these
depends on their role in the economy of the plant.
    As did Hellriegel, so also Prazmowski put some plants in soils
with, others in soils without, nitrogen, and he confirms Hellriegel 's
results — infected plants require no nitrogen at their roots; non-
infected plants pass into a state of hunger and die if not supplied
with nitrates.

  1889.]      Tubercles on  the Roots of Leguminous Plants.            441
    No decision is arrived at as to whether the nitrogen is got from
 nitrogen compounds or from the free nitrogen of the air, nor as to
 what advantage accrues to the bacteria and the host-plant respec
 tively.
    As regards the plants' mode of utilising the presence of the bacteria,
 cultivated bacteria (from pea tubercles) in nutritive media divide
 indefinitely, and are found there as moving rodlets. In tubercles
 they are only rodlets while enclosed in tubes ; they change their forms
 in the substance of the protoplasm, becoming forked and developing
 into bacteroids.     As bacteroids they can long go on multiplying by
 continually developing lateral branches, even in proper nutritive solu
 tion (" In diesem Zustande der Bakteroiden konnen sie sich noch eine
 Zeit lang vermehren unter fortwdhrender Bildung von Seitenzweigen
 selbst dann, wenn sie aus dem Knollchen heraus, in geeignete Nahrlosung
 versetzt werden").      With the further development of the tubercle
 they   become  hyaline, cease to multiply, and at length dissolve.    The
 contents of the bacteroid cells are resorbed as the bacteroids dissolve,
 certain substances being left behind.        In other words, the plant
 utilises the substance of the bacteria.
    When emptying begins, and with what energy it proceeds, depend
 especially on the quantity of nitrogenous compounds at the disposal
of the roots. In a soil rich in nitrogen the tubercles go on developing
unhindered, become large and typical, and rosy inside, and are not
 exhausted till late ; in poorer soils they attain no great size, are soon
emptied, and are green-gray inside.
    In both cases the exhaustion proceeds acropetally, from the base
onwards. At the apex remains a zone which is not emptied, and its
cells are full of bacteria.      Moreover, some bacteria in and out of
tubes remain in all the cells, and escape during decay into the soil ;
also animals eat the tubercles and disperse the bacteria.         In such
injured   tubercles  the bacteroid masses  often envelop themselves  anew
with membranes, and form smaller and smaller colonies ; these the
author previously mistook for spores (see p. 438).
    From the preceding, we see that the tubercles depend on a
symbiosis which is advantageous to both the plant and the bacteria.
The latter feed on the sap and cell-contents, and multiply through
innumerable generations, and, both during the life of the host aud
afterwards, become redistributed in the soil.          The plant derives
advantage in that it obtains nitrogen by means of the bacteria.
    Though the symbiosis is useful to both, the plant gains most, for
it is the more powerful, and sooner or later overcomes the bacteria, to
the multiplication of which it sets limits and finally absorbs the
substance of the latter. Being the stronger, the plant directs the
symbiosis.     It encloses the bacteria in the " Bakteroidengewebe," by
means of cork, and also protects them.         By an apical meristem the

442         Tubercles  on the Roots    of Leguminous Plunls.       [Nov. 21,
tubercle. provides continual successions of new cells for the bacteria to
accumulate in while it absorbs the older ones behind. Between the
bacteroid tissue and the cork it provides vascular bundles (1) to feed
the bacteria and convey the carbohydrates necessary to produce
proteids, and (2) to take up the dissolved substance of the bacteroids
as required.     The thin cell walls of the bacteroid tissue conduce to
the same end.
    I think it will be admitted by all who study the literature of this
subject, that the only real point at issue between Prazmowski and
myself is the nature of the bacteroids and their origin from the
filaments.    I interpreted them as extremely minute budding "gem-
mules," and not bacteria ; Prazmowski, with Beyerinck, regards them
as true Schizomycetes.        We have all alike failed to actually see the
process of budding or fission, a fact which will surprise no one who
has examined these extremely minute bodies, which are, as Beyeriuck
rightly puts it, among the smallest of living beings.
    The fact of infection, and the mode of infection, by means of a
hypha-like filament passing down the root-hair were definitely estab
lished by" myself in 1887, and it is satisfactory to find it confirmed in
every essential detail by Prazmowski.         Our views as to the symbiosis,
the struggle between         the protoplasm and the " gemmnles " (or
" bacteroids
               ") are the same : though Prazmowski and Beyerinck
carry the matter a step further in definitely inferring the absorption
of the conquered bodies of the latter, a point in part supported by
some of my experiments.
    As to the occurrence, origin, and structure of the tubercles,
Prazmowski's account is simply in accordance with my own ; and it
is interesting to note how many points of detail — the distortions of
the root-hairs, the relations of the branching filaments to the nuclei
and cell-contents, and those of the incipient tubercle to the end of the
filament, for example — are confirmed by him.
    There is one point of extreme importance between Beyerinck and
Prazmowski on the one hand, however, and myself on the other ;
they are positive on the subject of the cultivation of the "bacterium"
in nutritive media outside the host-plant — or rather the other
symbiont — whereas      I feel too little confidence in my cultures td

                     ANNIVERSARY MEETING.
      Sir G. GABRIEL STOKES, Bart., President, in the Chair.
   The Report of the Auditors of the Treasurer's Accounts on the
part of the Society was presented, by which it appears that the total
receipts on the General Account during the past year, including
 petty cash balances carried from the preceding year, amounted to
 £7,433 15s. 9d., and that the total receipts on account of Trust Funds,
including a balance of £2,112 6s. Id. carried from the preceding year,
amounted to £4,609 l4s. 10^.; and that the total expenditure in the
same period, including an overdrawn balance on the General Account
of £953 Is. 6d. carried from the preceding year, and including also
purchase of stock, amounted to £7,328 16s. 7d. on the General
Account, and £2,468 4s. 3d. on account of Trust Funds, leaving a
balance on the General Account of £94 7s. 3d. at the bankers' and
£10 lis. lid. in the hands of the Treasurer, and on account of Trust
Funds a balance at the bankers' of £2,141 10s. 7d.
   The thanks of the Society were voted to the Treasurer and Auditors.
   The Secretary then read the following Lists : —

   The President then addressed the Society      as follows : —
In an annual assembling of any body of men as large as that of our
Fellows, it must in the course of nature be expected that of those who
were or might have been present on one such occasion some will have
been removed by death before the next comes round.            But the death-
roll of the year, which according to our custom is read by the Senior
Secretary at our annual meeting, is on this occasion unusually heavy,
and the list recalls to us several who have taken an active pflrt in
the ordinary work of the Society, and some whose names will Ik;
prominently remembered by posterity.
   Warren de la Rue, who has repeatedly served on the Council and
Committees of the Society, was one of the early pioneers in the appli
cation of photography to the delineation and measurement of celestial
objects, an application which has now received such great extension.
He was one of the party who went to Spain, in 1860, to observe a
total solar eclipse, and he took up the department of observation by
photography. His results formed the subject of a Bakerian lecture,
                                '                                '
and are published in the          Philosophical Transactions       for 1862.
They threw much       light  on   the  subject of the solar prominences,
then, we may say, in its infancy.       He devoted much attention to the
subject of Sun-spots, and constructed an elaborate machine for their
measurement      on photographic negatives         under the microscope.
Several of our Fellows have had the opportunity of seeing the beauti
ful experiments on electric discharges in rarefied gases which he
carried out by means of his magnificent battery of 15,000 chloride
of silver cells, the use of which, with his usual urbanity, he accorded
to men of science who might be desirous of investigating some point
requiring the aid of so costly an appliance.
   Charles James Blasius Williams, who died last March, at a very
advanced age, was, with one exception, the senior of our Fellows,
having been elected in 1835. For many years one of the most
 prominent physicians in London, after retirement from medical
                                                                2 n 2

450                        Anniversary  Meeting.               [Nov. 30,
practice, in the evening of his days, he took up the examination of
solar spots, and their possible relation to meteorology.
    Stephen Parkinson was well known to Cambridge men as a mathe
matician, and was the author of several mathematical works in
common use in the University.
    John Percy was for more than forty years a Fellow of the Society,
and has served on the Council.                        I
                                      Many years ago was myself asso
ciated with    him  at the  Government   School of Mines, where we both
were lecturers together.      He was a man of accurate knowledge but
of a retiring character, and is perhaps best known to the world
through his excellent work on metallurgy, the value of which is
 evidenced by the fact of its having been translated both into French
and German.
    Owen Rees, also for more than forty years a Fellow of the Society,
did good service in the application of chemistry to the elucidation of
 disease.
    Miles Joseph Berkeley, who died at the advanced age of eighty-six,
 was distinguished as a cryptogamic botanist ; indeed in this branch
 of botanical science he was long looked up to as the leading authority.
     Our late Fellow John Ball was for a long time intimately associated
 with the work of the Society. Besides serving on the Council, he
 has very frequently assisted us on various Committees.         It will be
 recollected that he was associated with Sir Joseph Hooker in
 botanical exploration, and the two, at no little personal risk, ascended
 the Atlas range on the northern side, being the first Europeans who
 had penetrated so far. Fond of travel, and of mountain climbing, he
 was led to take up the subject of botany ; and in relation to this
 science, as well as to meteorology and geology, he turned his travels
 to good account.
     George West Royston-Pigott took up the subject of improvements
 in the microscope, specially as regards the correction of the residue
 of spherical aberration, and a paper of his on the subject is printed
  in the ' Philosophical Transactions.'
     John Frederic La Trobe-Bateman, who died in June, will long be
  remembered for his important engineering works, especially in relation
  to the supply of water to large towns.
     William Henry Bristow was associated with De la Beche, Edward
  Forbes, and other geologists in the early history of the Geological
  Survey, and remained in that department of the Civil Service of the
  country, in which he had been promoted to the post of Senior
  Director, almost up to the end of his life.      He particularly distin
  guished himself by the careful and detailed manner in which he
  carried out the mapping of the Cretaceous and Jurassic rocks of the
  South of England.       His maps and descriptions of that region have
  become classical in English geology.     Outside of Lis official work lie

published a few papers giving the results of his researches, and
was also the author of a useful glossary of mineralogy, as well as of
translations of popular geological works.
    On the 21st of April, our late Fellow Robert Stirling Newall
passed away at the age of eighty-seven.        Mr. Newall, as a successful
manufacturer, is well known through the improvements which he
effected in the construction of iron rope, which rendered him, we
may say, one of the chief founders of an important branch of national
industry, and through his success in the construction of those sub
marine cables which play so important a part in the conveyance of
intelligence all over the civilized world. But he did not confine him
self to the industrial application of scientific principles ; he took a
leading step in the development of the refracting telescope. At the
time of the Exhibition of 1862, the largest refracting telescope in
operation was the 16-inch one at Pulkowa.             Messrs. Chance, of
Birmingham, placed in that exhibition two disks of optical glass, one
of flint and one of crown, of far larger size, about 26 inches in
diameter.      These Mr. Newall, being possessed of ample means,
purchased,    with the intention of trying what could be done for astro
nomical observation by the use of a telescope far larger, of its kind,
than had hitherto been used. The construction was confided to Cooke,
of Tork, so well known for the excellence of his optical work. The
instrument was erected at Mr. Newall's residence at Gateshead, and
 is pronounced by competent judges to be of first-rate excellence.    The
atmospheric conditions of Gateshead were not however favourable
for the use of so grand an instrument ; and shortly before his death
 Mr. Newall offered it to the University of Cambridge. This generous
offer was referred, as is usual in such cases, to a Committee for report
 The Committee have issued a provisional report in which they
testify to the excellence of the instrument, and recommend its
acceptance ; but the final arrangements to be proposed are still under
consideration.
    By the death of James Prescott Joule, the Society has this year
 lost one of its Fellows whose name will go down to posterity in con
 nexion with his memorable researches on the mechanical equivalent
of heat. The circumstances of his birth would naturally have led
 him to devote himself to commercial pursuits, but the bent of his
 mind, animated in early years by the instruction he received from the
illustrious Dalton, led him to devote himself mainly to the pursuit of
science.    As in the case of Faraday, his investigations were carried
on without the aid of mathematics, at least of the higher mathematics.
 But, like Faraday, he seemed to have a sort of intuitive apprehension
 of physical laws.   His early scientific studies led him into the domain
 of electricity, and its connexion with heat ; and he showed that when
 a voltaic current passes through a conducting wire the heat gene

452                      Anniversary Meeting.                    [Nov. 30,
rated in a given time varies as the resistance multiplied by the square
of the current. It was in connexion with magneto-electricity that his
first determination was made of the mechanical equivalent of heat,
which was confirmed later by its accordance with the equivalent as
determined     independently altogether of electricity, by measuring
on the one hand the work given out by a descending weight, and on
the other the heat generated by internal friction in a liquid in which
that work was consumed in overcoming resistance. While much may
often be done towards discovering the laws of nature by merely qualita
tive experiments, the final testing of theories which we may have been
led to form involves almost always accurate quantitative determina
tions.     Joule as an experimentalist was accurate in quantitative
determinations,    and his final number for the mechanical equivalent
of heat is accepted as a fundamental constant in thermodynamics.
    On account of the great importance of Joule's labours, both
 directly, in the advancement of science, and indirectly, through the
knowledge thus acquired, in enabling improvements to be made in the
practical application of science for industrial purposes, it has been
 suggested that it might be desirable to raise some public memorial
 to him, and the Council has appointed a Committee to consider the
 question.
    Only yesterday our aged Fellow Martin Tupper passed away, who
 was the author of works which attained a very wide circulation.
    I have referred, and that very briefly, to some only of the Fellows
 whom we have lost during the past year, but fuller details both of
 them, of other Fellows whom we have lost, and of our recently
 deceased foreign members will be found in the obituary notices
 which appear from time to time in the Proceedings, according as
 they are received from the Fellows who have kindly undertaken to
 draw them up.
    Of those who last year were on our list of Foreign Members, we
 have since lost one who was truly a veteran in science.         More than
 three year3 have elapsed since the celebration of the centenary of the
 birth of M. Chevreul, and two more recurrences of his birthday came
 round before he was called away. He will be known for his researches
 on the contrast of colours.   But his great work was that by which he
 cleared up the constitution of the fixed oils and fats, and established
 the theory of saponification.    Few scientific men still surviving were
 even born when this important research was commenced — a research
 in the course of which he laid the foundation of the method now
 universally followed in the study of organic compounds, by showing
 that an ultimate analysis by itself alone is quite insufficient, and that
 it is necessary to study the substances obtained by the action of
 reagents on that primarily presented for investigation.
    Our late Foreign Member Franz Cornelius Donders stood in the first

1889.]                     President's Address.                      453
rank among the men of science of our day. He was educated as an
army surgeon; but the bent of his mind led him to scientific investi
gation, and he became one of the most eminent of physiologists as
well as the most distinguished ophthalmologist of his day. He con
tributed powerfully to the advance, not only of ophthalmology, but
also of general physiological science ; for on whatever physiological
subject he touched he left his mark, bringing as he did to bear on it
an acute and original mind, thoroughly trained in physical and
chemical principles, and a knowledge of the advances made by the
foremost among his scientific contemporaries.
    There is one whose name, though he was not a Fellow,       I  cannot
pass by in silence on the present occasion.    I refer to Thomas Jodrell
Phillips Jodrell, who' died early in September, in his eighty-second
year.    About the time of the publication of the reports of the Duke
of Devonshire's Commission, the subject of the endowment of research
was much talked of, and Mr. Jodrell placed the sum of £6,000 in the
hands of the Society for the purpose of making an experiment to see
how far the progress of science might be promoted by enabling persons
to engage in research who might not otherwise be in a condition to
do so.     But before any scheme for the purpose was matured, the
Government Grant for the promotion of scientific research was
started, under the administration of Lord John Russell, then Prime
Minister.     This rendered it superfluous to carry out Mr. Jodrell's
original intention, but he still left the money in the hands of the
Society, directing that, subject to any appropriation of the money
that he might make, with the approval of the Royal Society, during
 his lifetime, the capital should immediately upon his death be incor
porated with the Donation Fund, and that in the meantime the
income thereof should be received by the Royal Society.           Of the
capital, £1,000 was several years ago assigned to a fund for the
reduction of the annual payments to be made by future Fellows, and
the remaining £5,000 has now of course been added to the Wollaston
 Donation Fund.       By the Fee Reduction Fund the annual payment
of ordinary Fellows elected subsequently to the time of the change
 was made £3 instead of £4, and the entrance fee abolished. As
to the Donation Fund, a very wide discretion was, by the terms
 of the original foundation, left in the hands of the Council as
 to the way in which they should employ it in the interest of
 science.
    Since the Croonian Foundation for lectures was put on its present
 footing, it has been made the means of securing for us the advantage
 of a lecture delivered before the Society by distinguished foreign men
  of science.   In the present year our Foreign Member M. Pasteur was
  invited to deliver the lecture.   Unfortunately the state of his health
  would not allow him to deliver it himself, but at one time he hoped

 454                         Anniversary Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
 that he would have been able to be present at its delivery. It was
 ultimately arranged that his fellow labourer at the Pasteur Institute,
 Dr. Roux, should deliver the Croonian Lecture in his stead; and
 several of the Fellows have heard his lucid account, first of the
 discoveries of M. Pasteur in relation to diseases brought about by
 microscopic organisms, and then further researches of his own in the
 same field.
    In addressing     the Fellows at the anniversary      last year,  I men
 tioned   that Commandant Desforges had          kindly  offered to  compare
 that portion of Sir George         Schuckburgh's scale, with reference to
 which the length of the seconds pendulum had been determined by
 Kater and Sabine, with the French standard metre ; and as the ratio
 of this to the English standard yard was accurately known, the
 length of the pendulum, as determined by these accurate observers,
 would thus for the first time be brought into relation with the
 English yard by direct comparison              with accurately compared
 measures of length.           The comparison was shortly afterwards
executed, and the scale, which of course was very carefully packed
for its journey to Paris and back, has long since been replaced in the
apartments      of the Society.        This highly desirable comparison
oc-cupied   but a  few  days  in its execution ; which affords one example
of the scientific advantages derivable, under an international agree
ment, from the establishment of the Bureau des Poids et Mesures.
Our own country, which for some years held aloof from the Conven
tion, forming the sole exception to the general agreement among
nations of importance, joined it some years ago ; and we thus have
the privilege of availing ourselves as occasion may arise of the
appliances at the office in Paris for such comparisons of measures of
length or weight.
    The services of Mr. Arthur Soper, as a special assistant, have
been retained during the past session, with advantage to the library.
He has completed the much-needed shelf catalogue, and the re
arrangement      of the books where necessary.        In the course of this
work the volumes of a purely literary character have been collected
together, and a selection of the most valuable have been preserved in
a properly protected case.        Of the remainder about 150 volumes (in
addition to those reported last year) have been presented to various
public libraries, and a slip catalogne of the volumes which are
retained, containing about 1,700 entries, has been prepared.
    The manuscripts (other than the originals of ordinary papers read
at the meetings) which have accrued to the Society since the publica
tion of Mr. Halliwell's Catalogue have been collected from various
parts of the building into the Archives Room, with the object of pre
paring a complete catalogue of the manuscripts at present in the
possession of the Society.

 1889.]                   Presidents Address.                          455
   Since the last anniversary twenty-four memoirs have been published
in the ' Philosophical Transactions,' containing a total of 753 pages
                    Of the ' Proceedings twelve numbers have been
                                           '
and 33 plates.
issued, containing 1062 pages and 6 plates.     Dr. R. von Lendenfeld's
'
  Monograph   of the Horny Sponges,'   mentioned   in my last anniversary
address, has also been issued during the year in a quarto volume of
940 pages of text and 51 plates.
   The Fellows are aware that for a great many years the Royal
Society has devoted a part of its funds to the collection, preparation
for the press, and correction of the proofs of a Catalogue of Scientific
Papers. We have endeavonred to make the work as complete as
possible, and to include scientific serials in all languages.     The first
part, covering the period 1800 to 1863, is printed    in six  thick quarto
volumes, of which the last appeared in 1872.      The decade 1864-1873
occupies two more volumes, of which the second was published in
1879.    This work, in the preparation of which the Royal Society has
spent a large sum, is for the benefit of the whole civilized world, and
the sale of it could not be expected nearly to cover the cost of
printing, paper, and binding.       On a representation      to this effect
being made to Government, when the first part was ready for the
press, the Lords of the Treasury consented that it should be printed
at the public expense, the proceeds of the sale of the work, after
reserving a certain number of copies for presentation, being repaid to
the Treasury.     In consideration of the large outlay involved in the
preparation, those Fellows of the Society who wished to purchase the
work could do so at about two-thirds of the cost to the general public.
A similar application to the Treasury with reference to the decade
1864-1873 met with a similar response, and we proceeded, as               I
mentioned at the anniversary last year, with the preparation of the
manuscript for the next decade, 1874-1883, which was then nearly
ready.    On making application towards the end of last year to the
Treasury for the printing of this decade, our request was not acceded
to. While declining, however, to continue any further the printing
of this great work, the sum of £1,000 was put in the Estimates, and
has since been voted by Parliament, to assist us in the publication,
and the copies of the work still remaining unsold have been handed
over to us.    This has enabled us to conclude negotiations with
Messrs. Clay and the Syndics of the Cambridge University Press for
the printing of the decade last mentioned, and at the same time to make
some provision towards the future continuation of the work, without,
as it may be hoped, encroaching to a greater extent than hitherto on
our own resources.
   The utility of the work would obviously be much increased if it
could be furnished with some sort of key enabling persons to find
what had been written on particular subjects.          I am not without

456                       Anniversary   Meeting.               [Nov. 30,
hopes    that this very desirable object may yet be accomplished.
notwithstanding the magnitude of any such undertaking.
    Within the last year the Council of the Royal Society has accepted
a duty in connexion with scientific agriculture, of which it will be
interesting to the Fellows to be informed. It is well known that for
the last fifty years, or thereabouts, Sir John Lawes has carried out
on his estate at Rothamsted an elaborate and most persevering
series of experiments on the conditions which influence the growth
and yield of crops of various kinds, the effect of manures of different
kinds, the result of taking the same crop, year after year, from off the
same land without supplying to it any manure, &c.         Long as these
experiments     have  already been  continued, there  are questions, par
 ticularly as regards the capabilities of the sub-soil, which require
 for their satisfactory answers that similar experiments should be
 continued on the same land for a still longer period.      In respect of
 such questions, the investigator of the science of agriculture is in a
 position resembling that in which the astronomer is often placed, in
 having to make observations, the full interest of which it must be left
 to posterity to enjoy.
    To prevent the interruption of these experiments, which it would
 take a life-time to repeat on fresh ground, and at the same time to
 provide for the carrying out of researches generally bearing on the
 science of agriculture, Sir John Lawes has created a trust, securing
 to the trustees a capital sum of £100,000, and leasing to them for
 ninety-nine years, at a peppercorn rent, certain lands in his demesue
 on which the experiments have hitherto been carried on, together
 with his laboratory. The trust is intended to be for original research,
 not for the instruction of students.       The general direction of the
 experiments and researches to be carried on is vested in a committee
  of management consisting of nine persons, of whom four are to be
  appointed by the President and Council of tho Royal Society.
     The trustees named in the deed were Sir John Lubbock, Dr. Wells,
 and our treasurer, Dr. Evans.       One of these is now no more.    Lord
  Walsingham has been appointed a trustee in place of the late
  Dr. Wells.
     The Copley Medal for the year has been awarded to Dr. Salmon
  for his various papers on subjects of pure mathematics, and for the
  valuable mathematical treatises of which he is the author.           Dr.
  Salmon's published papers are all valuable.      Among others may be
  mentioned his researches on the classification of curves of double
  curvature, and on the condition for equal roots of an equation ; the
  very important theorem of the constant anharmonic ratio of the four
  tangents of a cubic curve ; his researches on the theory of reciprocal
  surfaces ; his paper on quaternary cubics.    But any notice of his con
  tributions to the advancement of pure mathematics would be iucom

plete which did not specially mention his invaluable text-books on
conic sections, higher plane curves, solid geometry, and the modern
algebra  — works which not only, give a comprehensive         view of the
subjects  to which they relate,     but contain   a great deal of original
matter.
   Of the Royal Medals, it is the usual though not invariable practice
to award one for mathematics         or physics, including chemistry, and
one for some one or more of the biological sciences.        No distinction
is, however, made between the two medals in point of order of
precedence, and   I will, therefore, take the names of the medallists in
alphabetical order.
   The Council have awarded one of the Royal Medals this year to
Dr. Walter Holbrook Gaskell for his researches in cardiac physiology,
and his important discoveries in the anatomy and physiology of the
sympathetic nervous system.
   In his memoir, " On the Rhythm of the Heart of the Prog "
                     '
(Croonian Lecture, Phil. Trans.,' 1882), and in a subsequent memoir,
"On the Innervation of the Heart of the Tortoise" (' Journ. of Physiol.,'
vol. 4), Dr.   Gaskell very largely advanced        our knowledge of the
physiology of the heart-beat, more especially as relates to the sequence
of the beats of the several parts, the nature of the inhibitory action
of the vagus nerve, and the relations of tonicity and conducting
power to rhythmical contraction.         These memoirs, however, lacked
completeness on account of their not taking into full consideration
the action of the cardiac angmentor or accelerator fibres, the existence
of which had been previously indicated in the case of mammals, and
suspected in the case of the frog and allied animals.
   By a striking experiment ('Journ. of Physiol.,' vol. 5) Dr. Gaskell
subsequently gave the first clear demonstration of the presence in the
frog of cardiac angmentor fibres ; also he gave a clear account of the
nature of the action of these fibres, and the relations of that action
to the action of the vagus fibres.        Revising his previous work by
the help of the light thus gained, Dr. Gaskell was enabled to give
the first really consistent and satisfactory account of the nature
of the heart-beat, of the modifications of beat due to extrinsic
nerves, and of the parts played by muscular and nervous elements
respectively.
   Important as was this work on the heart. Dr. Gaskell's subsequent
work " On the Structure, Functions, and Distribution of the Nerves
which govern the Vascular and Visceral Systems" ('Journ. of Physiol.,'
vol. 7) has a far higher importance and significance.      In spite of the
knowledge which during the past thirty or forty years has been
gained concerning vnso-motor nerves and the nerves governing the
movements of the viscera, physiologists had up to the time of the
 appearance of Dr. Gaskell's memoir failed to obtain a clear conception

of the nature and relations of the so-called sympathetic nervous
system.     By his researches, in which the several methods of gross
anatomical investigation, minute histological examination, and ex
perimental inquiry were, in a striking manner, made to assist each
other, Dr. Gaskell, by tracing out the course and determining the
nature of vaso-constrictor and vaso-dilator fibres, and comparing
them with the cardiac augmentor and inhibitory fibres, and with the
fibres governing the visceral muscles, has already reduced to order
what previously was to a large extent confusion, and has opened up
what promises to be the way to a complete understanding of the
whole subject.
    The results arrived at, besides their great physiological importance,
on the one hand promise to be of great assistance in practical
medicine, and on the other are eminently suggestive from a purely
morphological point of view.
    The other Royal Medal has been awarded to Professor Thomas
Edward Thorpe for his researches on fluorine compounds, and his
determination of the atomic weights of titanium and gold.
    Professor Thomas Edward Thorpe's experimental work has secured
for him a place in the first rank of living experimentalists.
    His researches, which are not confined to one department of chemi
cal science, but extend over many branches, are all distinguished,
both by accuracy and originality of treatment.             As examples of
<U+2666>he high character of his investigations those of the determinations
of the atomic weights of titanium and gold may be specially cited
as permanently settling the value of two most important chemical
constants ; whilst his researches on the fluorine compounds,            in
cluding    the  discovery  of thiophosphoryl   fluoride, a  body capable of
existing undecomposed in the state of gas, and his latest work on the
Vapour-density of Hydrofluoric Acid, do not fall short of the highest
examples of classical chemical investigation.
    The Davy Medal has been awarded to Dr. W. H. Perkin for his
researches on magnetic rotation in relation to chemical constitution.
    Dr. Perkin is well known as the originator of what is now a great
industry, that of the coal-tar colours, by his preparation and applica
tion to tinctorial purposes of a colouring matter which had pre
viously merely been noticed as affording a chemical test for the
presence of aniline.     This, however, is now a long time ago, and it is
 for more recent work, the interest of which is purely scientific, that
 the medal has been awarded to him.
    Dr. Perkin first showed, in 1834, that a definite relationship exists
 between the chemical constitution of substances and their power of
 rotating the plane of polarisation of light when under magnetic
influence   ; and he pointed out how the " molecular coefficient of
                          "                            "
magnetic rotation" or molecular rotatory power           might be deduced.

   la   1884 he presented to the Chemical Society a lengthy paper
describing his method and the results obtained for a very large
number of paraffinoid hydrocarbons and haloid and oxygenated
derivatives thereof; from these he deduced " constants," which he has
since shown to bo applicable in calculating the magnetic rotatory
power of paraffinoid compounds generally.       From time to time he has
published further instalments of his work, and only quite recently has
described the results obtained on examining nitrogen compounds,
which exhibit many most interesting peculiarities.
    The results are of special value on account of the exceptional care
devoted to the preparation of pure substances, and the guarantee
which Dr. Perkin's reputation affords, that everything possible has
been done to secure accuracy ; and also because the substances chosen
are for the most part typical substances, or belong to series in which
a simple relationship exists.
    The Statutes   relating to the election of Council and Officers were
then read, and Sir W. Aitken and Professor H. G. Seeley having been,
with the consent of the Society, nominated Scrutators, the votes of

   1st. Magnetic observations.
   2nd. Meteorological observations.
   3rd. Solar observations.

   The Royal Society's Committee of the Kew Observatory, since the
issue of the last Report, have lost by the death of Mr. de la Rue a
colleague who for nearly forty years had taken a prominent part in
the management       of the Observatory, and who had long presided
over the Committee as their Chairman. Mr. de la Rue was one of
the most munificent benefactors of the Observatory.              It was at
his suggestion    that  the first photoheliograph     was  constructed  and
brought into use under his supervision at the Observatory.              His
sound practical judgment and thorough familiarity           with   scientific
operations of all kinds were of constant service to the Committee,
 and his loss will be greatly felt by them.

                      Report    of the Kew   Committee.                 475
                        I. Magnetic Orservations.
   No change has been made in the magnetographs during the past
year.    The curves representing Declination, Horizontal Force, and
Vertical Force variations have been obtained uninterruptedly, and,
 as in former years, the scale values of all the instruments were
determined in the month of January.
   The ordinates of the various photographic curves were then ascer
tained to be as follows : —
             Declination  :  1 inch=0° 22'-04.    1 cm.=0° 8'7.
   Bifilar, January 15, 1889, for     1 inch SH = 0'0278 foot grain unit.
                                   „ 1cm. „ = 0-00050 C.G.S. unit.
   Balance, January 16,     1889   „ 1 inch 8V= 0-0285 foot grain unit.
                                   „ 1 cm. „ = 000052 C.G.S. unit.
   The principal magnetic disturbance of the year was recorded on
the morning of Jnly 16th ; on July 11th between 10 and 11 p.m. the
curves registered the passage of tremors from an earthquake which
was experienced in Central Asia.
   Observations with the absolute instruments have been made
monthly, and the results are given in the tables forming Appendix         I
of this Report.
   The magnetic instruments have been studied, and a knowledge of
their manipulation obtained, by Lieutenant W. J. Combe, R.N., of
H.M.S. " Penguin."
   With a view of ensuring accuracy in the tables employed in the
reduction of magnetic observations, which have been frequently
reprinted for use by observers, a careful examination has been made
by Professor G. Carey Foster of all the formulae and blank forms
employed in the Kew methods.           He has reported to the Committee
that he did not detect any inaccuracy.
   A careful examination of the observations of Absolute Declination
made at Kew from 1858 to the present date has been made at the
request of Professors Thorpe and Riicker, who have been inves
tigating the secular changes of Declination during the interval.
The results have been forwarded to those gentlemen with the object
of their embodiment in the paper on the Magnetic Survey of the
British Islands now in progress submitted by them to the Royal
Society.
   In order to examine certain features of the working of the Kew
pattern Vertical Force magnetograph instrument, Mr. Charles
Chambers, F.R.S., Director of the Colaba Observatory, Bombay, has
been provided by the Indian Government with a new instrument of
the same pattern, which has beeu tested at Kew, and forwarded by
the maker, A die, to Bombay.

 476                 Report   of the Kew  Committee.
    Dr. van Rijckevorsel,    of Rotterdam, visited the Observatory to
 redetermine the constants of his instruments, and make observations
 of the magnetic elements prior to the commencement of a new
magnetic survey of Holland and Belgium, which he has undertaken
under the auspices of the Koninklijke Akademie van Wetenschappen
te Amsterdam, 60 as to connect M. Moureaux's survey of France with
 Dr. Neumayer's survey of Germany. Dr. van Rijckevorsel selected
 Kew, Wilhelmshaven, and Paris as his base stations.
   Mr. Kitto, Superintendent of the Falmouth Observatory, visited
 Kew in the spring of the year, to study the methods of constructing
 tabulating scales for the conversion of the indications of his magneto-
graphs into numerical values, in accordance with the recommenda
tions of the International Commission.       He also took advantage of
the visit to become conversant with the use of the transit instru
ment, one of which has been recently acquired and set up at the
observatory under his charge.
                    II. Meteorological Observations.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion respectively of Atmospheric Pressure, Temperature, and Humidity,
Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain have been
maintained in regular operation throughout the year.
   The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic
records have been duly registered, together with the daily observa
tions in connexion with the U.S. Signal Service synchronous system.
A summary of these observations is given in Appendix II.
   The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly
made, and these, as well as copies of the eye observations,         with
notes of   weather,  cloud, and sunshine have been transmitted to the
Meteorological Office.
   The readings of the old 100-inch area square rain gange have been
discontinued since February, the new 8-inch, circular gauge being
now regularly employed, as a check upon the indications of the
Beckley self-recording instrument.
   The working standard barometer (Newman, 34) of the Observa
tory, which has been in use continuously since the date of its erection
in 1851, having become somewhat worn in its mechanism, was
dismounted,   and the scale and fittings repaired by Negretti and
Zambra, without interfering with the tube and cistern, which were
retained at the Observatory. On its return it was again put together
and restored to its old place, and fresh comparisons made with the
Welsh absolute standards.         These showed that a slight shift had
taken place in the position of the zero of the scale, a new deter
mination of the scale error was made and fresh corrections accord
ingly adopted.      During the period it was under repair the Royal

                       Report   of the Kew   Committee.                 477
  Society's old standard barometer was used in the daily observa
 tions.
     The barograph and thermograph formerly at work at the Armagh
  Observatory have been put in thorough repair, and set up in the
 Verification House awaiting the instructions of the Meteorological
  Council as to their transmission to the new Observatory now erected
  at Port William, Inverness, at the base of Ben Nevis. It is the
 intention of the Committee controlling the Observatory on the
 summit of that mountain, to maintain a second establish ment near
 the sea-level for the purpose of working in conjunction with it. A
 Beckley rain gauge has been also provided to complete the equipment.
    With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, weekly abstracts
 of the meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to, and
                 '              '      '
 published by The Times and              The Torquay Directory.'       Data
have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological
                          '
 Society, the editor of     Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine,'
 Dr. Rowland, and others. The cost of these abstracts is borne by
 the recipients.
    Tables of the monthly values of the rainfall and temperature have
been regularly sent to the Meteorological Sub-Committee of the
 Croydon Microscopical and Natural History Club for publication in
their Proceedings. Detailed information of all thunderstorms ob
served in the neighbourhood during the year has been forwarded
to the Royal Meteorological Society soon after their occurrence.
    Electrograph. — This instrument has been in constant action through
out the year, and comparisons with the portable electrometer
(White, 53) made in March, June, and September show the scale
value to have remained unchanged.
                         III.  Solar Orservations.
    Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 173 days, and the groups
numbered after Schwabe's method, the results being given in Appen
dix II, Table IV.
    Time Signals. — At the suggestion of the Engineer at the General
Post Office, a galvanometer has been fitted to the chronograph in
order that the Greenwich time signal may be observed on those occa
sions when it fails to record itself on the chronograph.        The 10 a.m.
signal has only failed on 16 days throughout the year.           On 10 of
these days, when    it was not  received  at the usual hour, the later one,
at 1 r.M., was duly forwarded by the Post Office. The errors of tho
Greenwich clock on certain selected dates, when some uncertainty
existed as to the correctness of the signal received, have been
courteously given after application to the Astronomer Royal.
    Transit Observations. — Solar and sidereal transits have been occa
sionally observed as a check on the signalled times.

  478                   Report  of the Kew Committee.
     Violle's Actinometer. — The Committee have undertaken at the  request
  of the Meteorological Council to make observations with a pair of
  Violle's actinometers.     These consist of two delicate mercurial ther
  mometers     encased, the one in a well-blackened hollow metal sphere,
  the other in the centre of a similar sphere thickly gilded and
  having a highly polished surface.      They have been suitably mounted,
  and are taken out on sunny days, placed side by side in the open air,
  and then alternately exposed to the Solar rays, and shielded from its
 action, the behaviour of the thermometers being noted. Up to the
  present date. 230 observations have been made with them on seven days.
     Solar Physics. — The Committee have handed over to the Solar
  Physics Committee, with the view of their utilisation, the collection
 of Solar Negatives from 1858 to 1872 taken at Cranford and at Kew,
 as well as a large number of undistributed copies of the papers on
  Solar Physics by Messrs. de la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy.
                           IV. Experimental   Work.
     Photo-nephograph. — As it was found that a much more suitable
 site was offered by the roof of the new building for the working of
 the cloud cameras, the pedestal was removed from the position it
 formerly occupied and set up on gratings placed on the new roof, the
 necessary alterations being effected in the electrical attachments.
 Opportunity was taken at the same time of replacing, by new wire,
 about 30 yards of the cable which had become damaged during the
 building operations.       As, however, the question of the most con
 venient way of utilising the cloud pictures is still under consideration
 by the Meteorological Council, ho photographs have been taken during
 the past year.
    Pendulum Observations. — In November last, the series of pendulum
 observations at the Observatory, as arranged by General Walker,
were successfully carried out, and the apparatus then dismounted and
conveyed to the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, where it was set up
in the Record Room. Mr. Hollis was instructed by Mr. Constable,
the Kew Observer, in the routine of observing in the manner employed
at Kew, but the operations had to be postponed for several months
owing to a pressure of other work at the Greenwich Observatory.
The pendulum swings were commenced in June and are now com
pleted, and the results, at both Kew and Greenwich, are being
prepared for publication.
    Anemometer Constants. — With a view of examining into the accuracy
of the graduation of the small anemometers or air-meters that are very
much employed in measuring draughts and air-currents in mine-
shafts, galleries, and similar places, a whirling apparatus was roughly
constructed with materials at hand and set up in the Optical Room.

                      Report  of  the Kew Committee.                  479
By means of this a number of experiments were made, which afforded
satisfactory results, with several Lowne's air-meters kindly lent by Mr.
Casella, the maker.        A more complete whirler has now been con
structed, and it is   intended   to include the examination of these air-
meters in the list of operations          carried on by the Verification
Department.
   The electrical anemograph mentioned in the 1886 Report as having
been sent to Valencia for erection on that island, was returned to
Kew in a somewhat damaged condition after a lengthened trial in a
very exposed situation. Certain defects in its construction which
became evident during its stay there have now been coirected, and,
after undergoing thorough repair, the instrument has been erected
on a suitable staging on the roof of the Observatory, with the
intention of submitting it to a rigorous comparison with the Beckley
anemograph working at the same level about 14 feet due south of it.
                      V. Verification of Instruments.
   The following magnetic instruments have been purchased         on com
mission and their constants determined : —
   An inclinometer and unifilar magnetometer for US. Navy Depart
ment, Washington.
   An inclinometer for    the University of Modena, Italy.
   Three magnets for Mauritius.
   The total number of other instruments compared in the past year
was as follows : —
          Air-meters                                            3

   Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 26 cases.
   The number of instruments rejected on account of excessive
error, or which from other causes did not record with sufficient
accuracy, was as follows : —
        Thermometers,    clinical                               38
                „        ordinary meteorological                16
        Various                                                 50
   13  Standard Thermometers have also been calibrated, and 6 supplied
to different individuals during the year.
   There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification,
10 Barometers, 850 Thermometers, 50 Hydrometers, and 8 Sextants.
   The increase in the number of sextants verified during the past
year has been considerable, 292 instruments of that kind having been
tested, whereas the greatest number in any previous year has been
157.     A much larger number of artificial horizons has also passed
through the Department, being in nearly all cases flat glass plates set
in levelling frames and supplied with spirit levels. These have been
all Hall-marked after examination as to trueness of the surface.      In
accordance with the arrangement mentioned in last year's Report,
440 Navy telescopes and binoculars have been examined and marked
for the Admiralty.     Also 33 standard measures of length have been
tested for the War Office.
   The Committee, having considered the advisability of Hall-marking
other instruments besides the thermometers submitted to them for
verification, instructed Messrs. R. and J. Beck to construct for them an
engraving pantagraph, which has been fitted on the Hollzapffel lathe
belonging to the Observatory, By its aid the Navy telescopes,
binoculars, and Standard Rules have been successfully engraved with
mark and number.

                          Report  of the Kew     Committee.                 481
                             VI.  Rating of Watches.
    During the year 528 entries of watches for rating were made.
They were sent for testing in the following classes : —
               For class A, 483; class B, 28      ; and class C, 17.
  Of these 119 failed to gain any award         ; 15 passed with C, 28 with B,
 366 with     A  certificates,  and  21    of the latter obtained the highest,
 class  A  especially good.
    In Appendix       III   will be fonnd statements giving the results of
 trial of the 26 watches which obtained the highest numbers of marks
 during the year, the highest position being attained for the third
 time by Mr. E. F. Ashley. His watch was a keyless single roller
 fuzee, which obtained 89'1 marks out of a possible 100.             He is very
 closely followed by Mr. A. E. Fridlander, of Coventry, whose keyless
 double roller fuzee stands only one-tenth of a mark lower on the list,
 having gained 890 marks.
    It is satisfactory to note the general improvement in the performance
 of the watches sent to the Observatory, the proportion of failures of
those submitted for trial being but 22 per cent, against 34 per cent,
 last year.       The effect is, moreover, seen in a diminution of the
 number of entries, for makers are more critical as to the performance
 of their watches during the timing and springing operations than
 they were before Kew trials were instituted.
    No difficulty has been experienced in maintaining the three safes —
in which the watches are placed dnring rating — at the three tempera
 tures of 40°, 65°, and 90° Faht. respectively, all the year round.
    Special attention continues to be given, as before, to the examination
of pocket chronographs, in accordance with the request of the Cyclists'
Union, and the extra tests alluded to in last Report have been regu
 larly enforced.
    Marine Chronometer s. — Certificates of mean daily rate and of
 variations of rate at three different temperatures have been awarded
to 10 marine chronometers after undergoing the 35 days' trial as
specified in the regulations
                               VII.  Miscellaneous.
    Assistance    to Observatories,   8/c.
                                           — There have been purchased on
commission       the    following   instruments : — Sunshine recorders       on
Jordan's pattern for the St. Petersburg and Coimbra Observatories ;
a low range aneroid for Dr. Lowenherz, of Charlottenburg ; various
pieces of apparatus for the Hong Kong and Mauritius Observatories ;
and an Ammeter and Voltmeter for Dr. H. Wild, of St. Petersburg.
    In accordance with a resolution of the International Meteorological
 Committee at their Zurich Meeting, a thermometer of very low
                                                                  2 k 2

International    Office of Weights and         Measures  at temperatures
innging from zero to abont — 70° C.
   Prepared    photographic paper has been procured and supplied to
the Observatories     at Aberdeen, Batavia, Colaba, Falmouth, Lisbon,
Mauritius, St. Petersburg, and Stonyhurst, as well as to the Meteoro
logical Office.
   Anemograph sheets have been sent to Mauritius, and blank forms
for entry of observations, &c, distributed to various applicants.
   Old Mural Quadrant. — The Department of Science and Art having
accepted the old mural quadrant for exhibition in the science collec
tion at South Kensington, application was made to the Governors of
the Armagh Observatory for the telescope and object glass belonging
to the instrument, which had been found by Dr. Dreyer in the Armagh
collection of astronomical apparatus, forwarded to that Observatory
at the time of the abolition of the King's Observatory at Kew in
1840.      The Committee's request having been acceded to, the missing
parts were duly received at Kew and forwarded to the Museum
 Galleries at South Kensington.
   Exhibition. — The Committee contributed to the annual exhibition
of the Royal Meteorological Society, held in March (19-22), several
actinometers, solar radiation thermometers, and photometers.
   Library. — During the year the library has received as presents the
publications of —
   29 Scientific   Societies  and Institutions  of Great Britain and Ire
         land, and
   81  Foreign    and   Colonial Scientific   Establishments, as well   as
         numerous private individuals ;
   The Librarian has been engaged for some time in the preparation of
a card catalogue of the library, on the model of that of the Meteoro
logical Office, and has now completed over 1,100 cards, which contain
the titles, &c, of all works received by the Committee during the
 past seven years, together with those of a like title which had been
received previously.
   The publications not yet catalogued formed part of Sir E. Sabine's
 Magnetic Office collection, and are chiefly excerpts from foreign
 publications and reports.       They have generally but little interest,
and are being examined          with  the view of binding such as the
 Observatory does not possess in other forms, and disposing of the
 duplicates.
   "Workshop. — The machine tools procured for the use of the Kew
Observatory by grants from the Government Grant Fund or the
Donation Fund have been duly kept in order.

  House,  S-c.
               — The external walls of the Observatory, as well    as the
out-houses,   have been thoroughly painted.      Book shelves and presses
have been fitted to the new rooms, which have also been furnished.
Glazed sashes have been inserted in the West Wing Thermometer
Room, in place of the panels which formerly filled the window frame,
and new pipes have been fixed for the water supply of the House.

                                APPENDIX I.
 Magnetic Observations made at the Kew Observatory, hat. 51° 28' 6" N.
    Long. Oh lm 15B1 W., for the year October 1888 to September 1889.
    The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
 Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1, and
 the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
    The Declination observations have also been made with the same
 Magnetometer, Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose.
    The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33, the
 needles 1 and 2 only being nsed ; these are 3i inches in length.
   The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
 values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
    These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the unit in
 the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0'46108.
   By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given.
   The value of log ir'K employed in the reduction is 1- 6436-5 at tem
perature 60°    F.
   The induction-coefficient /i is 0-000194.
   The correction of the magnetic power for temperature            t0 to an
adopted standard temperature of 35° F. is
                 0-0001194(Ko-35)+0-000,000,213(fo-35)>.
   The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-
bar marked 10 foot and 13 feet, are 1-000075 feet and 1-300097 feet
respectively.
   The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from
the mean of 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
of the suspension-thread subsequently.
   No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.

   In  each observation    of absolute Declination the instrumental read
ings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected
1250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the orientation
of which, with respect to the Magnetometer, has been carefully
determined.
   The observations     have been made and reduced by    Mr. T. W. Bakor.

then stationed at Sydney, with the view of obtaining definite informa
tion as to the existence or non-existence of the supposed phenomenon
of "explosion by influence."          It had been previously discovered
 (Threlfall, ' Phil. Mag.,' March, 1886) that in the case of small explo
sions of fulminate of mercury under water, there was a sort of
directed effect due to want of symmetry in the disposition of obstacles
surrounding th9 centre of explosion.          This suggested that a possible
explanation    of the  recorded cases   of  explosion by influence might be
found by a careful examination of the initial conditions. Since in
ordinary torpedo work in which the initial conditions of explosion
are greatly varied, coses of sympathetic explosion are generally
believed to have occurred, it was considered that the most hopeful
way of proceeding would be by endeavouring to obtain sympathetic
explosions between masses of explosive, fired under such conditions
as to preclnde the possibility of directed action.          To this end small
charges of guncotton were suspended in free air by strings, the
distance between the charges was measured, and one of them was
detonated.     Out of about fifty experiments of this kind we did not
succeed in obtaining any explosion by influence, though the target
charge was generally blown to atoms.              A similar series of experi
ments, in which
                    " 9-oz." disks of guncotton were wrapped in oil-silk
aud exploded under water, resulted in the same conclusion.             Explo
sion of the target charge was only brought about when so close to
the exploding charge as to be exposed to explosive violence amply
sufficient to account for the explosion.          In some cases the conditions
were varied by placing detonators in the target charge, but no excep
tion to the general result was noticed. At this time we succeeded in
obtaining a copy of Major-General Abbott's ' Submarine Mines and
Explosives,' and there found that the directed action had been
noticed by him in the case of explosive mixtures in a case with an

    Velocity of Transmission of Disturbances    through Sea-water.     497
 air-space at one end (p. 66), and in the case of dynamite (p. 82) in a
 "tin case, with saw-dust tamping" (Appendix B, p. 433). The
 sympathetic explosion of dynamite and gnncotton had also been
investigated by General Abbott, with the general result (pp. 122 et seq.)
that as a distinct mode of explosion it does not exist.
    As this conclusion agrees entirely with the one to which we were
 led, both with explosions by guncotton in air and water, and explo
 sions of guncotton, gelatine-dynamite, dynamite No. 1, and diazo-
 benzene nitrate on one side of a large iron plate, the target charge
being on the other side, we did not pursue the matter further. We
may remark that we found diazobenzene nitrate a very good substance
to experiment on in this direction, as it is exceedingly sensitive, but
not so violent as silver fulminate. Like the latter and iodide of
nitrogen, we believe that its explosion can be caused by the friction
 of the small crystals of which it is composed on one another.      If two
 heaps of this substance, placed on a thin iron plate, were protected
 by cardboard cylinders without ends, resting on the plate supporting
 the explosive and surrounding the latter, explosion always took place
 at a greater distance when the supporting plate was sheet iron than
 when it was a rather thicker pine board.   Owing to the thinness of the
 iron plate, the amplitude of the vibrations into which it was thrown
 was greater than in the case of wood, and consequently the target
 heap was more thrown about, and exploded (other things being equal)
 at a greater distance.   We have to thank Dr. Helms, Demonstrator
 in Chemistry at the University, for his kindness in preparing the
 diazobenzene nitrate for us ; it is both tiresome to make and delicate
 to handle.
    On page 433 of his ' Submarine Mines and Explosives,' General
Abbott gives in an appendix an account of a remarkable explosion of
5 lb. of dynamite.      In this experiment the axis of maximum effect
was bent out of the vertical (i.e., the normal to the water-surface
through the shot) to such an extent as to call for special comment.
A theory had been proposed by one of us which we thought might
account for this abnormal result, if it could be shown that it was
only an extreme case of a generally occurring phenomenon.            With
the view of testing this theory, we decided that the best way would
be to find the velocity of transmission of explosive energy through
water, varying the quantity and nature of the explosive and its case,
and noting any irregularity that might occur.       This, after two years'
work, we have succeeded in doing, extending our observations to gun-
cotton and Nobel's No. 1 dynamite, and varying the quantity of
explosive from 9 oz. up to 5 lb. charges.   The distance over which the
Velocity was    measured  was  varied three  times, from about 170, tho
least, to 200 yards, the greatest distance.       The results have been
such as to justify the title of this paper.

                               The Experiments.
                     The Site and General Arrangements.
   Through the kindness of the military authorities we were allowed
to use the torpedo station at Berry's Bay, in the harbour of Port
Jackson, as the base of operations.          This bay had the advantage of
deep    water  close   to  the shore,  of  being comparatively quiet, and
within about an hour's journey of the University.                The Sydney
Marine Board with great courtesy allowed us to use their steam-
launches for the purpose of getting to the ground, it being out of the
course of the ferry-boats. The general plan of the water and coast-line
will be understood from an examination of the chart (Plate 3) kindly
prepared for us by Mr. R. J. A. Roberts, who also undertook the sur
veying of the distance between the observing stations.           We desire to
express our indebtedness to Mr.       Roberts,   for his very accurate deter
minations to be referred to hereafter.        The general disposition of the
arrangements      was as follows : — Two piles, each about 45 feet long,
were driven into the mud of the sea-bottom at the stated distance
apart, and about 40 yards from the shore.               To these piles were
attached the apparatus for recording the arrival of the disturbance
due to the explosions ; the connexions with the shore were made by
means of two lengths of armoured cable, kindly lent to us by the
officer commanding the torpedo corps.          At first we tried to use over
head wires supported on telegraph poles, and running from the piles
to the shore ; these, however, were so systematically carried away by
passing steamers, that they had to be abandoned.
   In a portable constructor's house on the wharf we erected the
pendulum chronograph, to be described shortly, and there established
the arrangements for firing the charges and working the recording
apparatus.
   About a year was spent in experimenting with different forms of
apparatus for recording the arrival of the disturbance.        Three forms of
" gauge
          " were devised, tested, and abandoned before the ultimate
form was hit upon.         Considerable difficulty was also experienced in
avoiding    missfires,  as  we desired to avoid complicating matters by
using heavy cases for our torpedoes.         At one time work was entirely
suspended    for  three  months,  as  we  could  not get any guncotton, and
were not allowed to store the dynamite which we could buy in the
market ; guncotton cannot be procured here except through courtesy
of the Government. The same remark applies to detonators, which
we were forced to devise a means of manufacturing for ourselves.
Finally, owing to the good offices of Major Penrose, R.E., we obtained
a supply of 100 lb. of guncotton from the Government, and several
boxes of detonators, for which we desire to record our thanks.             In
our opinion any work of the kind should not in the future be under

  Velocity  of Transmission of Disturbances     through  Sea-water.   499
taken except by such military officers as are in a position to avoid the
imposition of difficulties abont the obtaining of explosives.
   The general course of conducting an experiment was as follows : —
   The gauges were got out, adjusted to their maximum sensitiveness,
and generally overhauled.
   The whole number of torpedoes       for the day's work were charged
and primed.
   The gauges were taken out in a dinghy, and adjusted to their
supports on the piles by one observer.      The electrical circuits were
completed and tested, and the firing wires were run out off drams,
and the ends buoyed at about 30 yards outside each pile, and in the
direct line of the two piles.
   The temperature of the water was taken at the surface, and at a
depth of 6 feet.
   Meanwhile the other observer got the chronograph adjusted, noted
the temperature of the tuning-fork, assured himself of the perfection
of the electrical firing arrangements, and smoked the glass plates.
All being ready, one observer (J. F. A.) generally assisted by
Mr. Proctor, the torpedo storekeeper, shipped a torpedo, and pro
ceeded to the firing point, and there connected it with the firing wire
in the usual manner.
   The other observer (R. T.) made the final arrangements in the
chronograph hut, and saw that all the precautions to prevent prema
ture explosion were observed. On receiving a signal to the effect that
the torpedo was ready, he replied by a signal to drop the shot and
run away. The end of the firing cable, previously carefully insulated,
was then connected to a wire passing into the hut. The plates of the
bichromate firing battery were then lowered into the liquid, and a
safety-plug was placed in the firing position. At a signal from the
party in the boat, the pendulum was allowed to fall, firing the torpedo,
and carrying the recording plate against the scribers connected with
the recording apparatus and the scriber of the tuning fork. Imme
diately after firing, the trigger was reset, the safety-plug placed in its
second position, the battery plates lifted out of the solution, and the
cable insulated.    It will be seen that no less than four separate and
independent acts of precaution were thus performed after each shot.
We have had no accidents of the nature of premature explosions after
several hundred shots, though once in boring a dirty guncotton disk
with a brass drill, a partial explosion, happily without doing any
damage, took place.
   After the firing of the shot the party in the boat proceeded to row
past the other pile, and there fastened the next shot to its appropriate
buoyed cable. Meanwhile the observer on Bhore took the smoked
plate out of the chronograph, wrote on it whatever data were neces
sary, allowed the pendulum to swing back, readjusted the scribers

500        Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.    J.  F. Adair.     On the
and tuning-fork, replaced the smoked plate, and waited for the signal
as before.
   The operations were then repeated till half the prescribed shots
had been fired ; the giuges were then reversed on the piles, and the
same process again gone through.        The greatest number of records
wo ever succeeded in obtaining in a single day was sixteen.             The
greater part   of the time  was  taken  up  in  adjusting  the  gauges and
preparing the charges.      At the end of the day's work the gauges
were brought in, the firing wires wound up, and the plates packed in
a box for measurement at the University.           Four complete records
were obtained on each plate.       Shots were fired alternately from left
to right, and from right to left, past the piles and gauges, with a view
to the elimination of the time-constants of the recording apparatus.
   We have therefore the following experimental matters to ex
plain  : —
   1st. The measurement    of the time of passage of the shock through
           water, from one gauge to the other.
   2nd. The measurement of the distance between the gauges.
   3rd. The precautions requisite to ensure symmetry of explosion,
           and of explosion in the line joining the two gauges.
   We shall consider the time-measurements first.        In deciding on a
chronograph we had to bear in mind that it was an essential condition
of success to get an instrument which allowed of rapid and easy
manipulation. Since we required to make absolute measurements,
that is, to be able to reduce our chronograph indications to mean
solar seconds, it follows that some standard time measurer must be
adopted, even at the expense of otherwise reducing the handiness
of the apparatus, and of running the risk of a diminished sensitive
ness. It is a truism that the methods which give the most absolute
values are seldom as sensitive as those which allow of a slight risk of
error in the absolute value of their indications.      Considerations such
as these led to the preference being given to an instrument of the
falling pendulum or myograph description. Such an instrument was
therefore commenced in January, 1887, by Mr. Cook, the University
Assistant in the Physical Laboratory, though at the time his appliances
were of the most meagre description. The pendulum was about a
yard long, the bob consisting of a flat oval. mass of lead. This carried
the supporting and adjusting screws for the glass plate.        There were
holdfast catches for the bob at each end of its swing. On the base of
the instrument there were three separate appliances.         First, a stand
to support the tuning-fork, and allow of its easy adjustment in a
vertical plane, and in a plane parallel to the plane of motion of the
pendulum. The plane of the latter was invariable, as it swnng on
hard steel knife-edges, supported on shallow grooves cut in steel plates.

   Velocity of Transmission of Disturbances     through  Sea-water.    501
    The tuning-fork —one of Koenig's — making, or rather marked as
giving, a hundred vibrations per second, -was maintained electrically
by a second battery.       The scribing apparatus, consisting of two
scribers and two electromagnets,      could be adjusted through a con
siderable range in a vertical plane, and in a plane perpendicular to
the motion of the pendulum ; and also to some extent in a plane
parallel to the plane of motion of the pendulum. There was a good
deal of trouble about this part of the apparatus, chiefly resulting
from the desire we had to lose no sensitiveness through slowness of
action. To this end the levers of the scribers were made of aluminium,
and the magnets and springs were very powerful as compared with the
moment of inertia of the scribers around their axes.      We altered this
apparatus, almost remaking it several times, as we found that the
limit to the accuracy of our time observations lay in the discrimina
tion of the precise point at which the straight line, traced by the
 scriber at rest on the smoked glass, began to be interrupted by the
motion of the scriber.     The sharper the bend the more accurate the
 discrimination.   Finally we got the scribers to break the line with
 almost complete suddenness, i.e., at something like 90° to its original
 direction.
    The trigger for firing the charge was of a kind that will easily
occur to the reader.     The catch on the pendulum could be slightly
set  forwards  or backwards,    and only affected the trigger when the
pendulum was moving in one direction. The trigger itself could be
moved along on an arc below the pendulum, so as to allow the firing
 to take place at such a time as would give the scribers the benefit of
 the pendulum's most rapid motion. In order to ensure a good instan
 taneous contact, the trigger on being let off drove (under the influence
of a powerful spring) a platinum-coated wedge between the opposing
faces of the brass interrupting plugs.     The firing battery consisted of
six good bichromate elements with large plates ; and the battery for
the recording gear consisted of twenty Leclanche cells, ten with large
plates and ten with small.    In all cases use was made of a good earth
" return," this being secured permanently at one end with a bit of
armoured cable, at the piles with copper plates, and at the torpedo
with a bit of old copper wire or thin plate.
                    Receiving Apparatus.  — " Gauges."
   This part of the experimental arrangement was the most difficult
to get to work satisfactorily. At first a sort of small pendnlum was
supported so as to hang near an india-rubber disk, inside a wide brass
cylinder ; the whole was sunk under water, leaving the contact wires
protruding.    The difficulties, however, were such as to render this
form of apparatus useless. The form finally adopted for very small
explosions, mere noises, in fact, is shown in Plate 4.         The great

502       Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.      J. F. Adair.        On   the
trumpet ends in a small tube, closed with an india-rubber film dia
phragm. Against this diaphragm rests an independently supported
strip of aluminium foil, as fine and light as possible ; at its end it
carries a tiny point of platinum.         The fine diaphragm, with its
tube and aluminium contact, is protected by an arrangement of flanges
carrying a glass cylinder, with stout brass ends. Through one brass
end passes a long brass screw, carrying a platinum disk at its lowest
point. This disk is insulated from the brass portion by means of
ebonite, and is connected by a wire with an insulated binding screw
outside the apparatus.    The screw is adjusted so that it just clears
the platinum point on the aluminium spring.            If the diaphragm is
disturbed the point is thrown against the disk and makes contact. In
order that the contact may be quite certain, the end of the platinum
wire must be cut off quite clean, and the platinum disk carefully
cleaned.   The contact obtained by means of a platinum wire with a
fused end is useless, as its definition is more a matter of pressure than
anything else. As the apparatus has to be sunk so that its lower
end goes to a depth of 5 or 6 feet -in water, it is of course necessary
to pump in air to distend the india-rubber, closing the mouth of the
trumpet, against the water-pressure.      This implies the use of a simple
pressure gauge, and will also explain the necessity for the air-tight
glass chamber in front of the fine rubber diaphragm.              In order that
the pressure on both sides of this diaphragm may be normally the
same, a "leak" is provided, running from the tube supporting the
                                                   "       "
diaphragm to the space in front of it. This leak consists of a bit
of drawn-out thermometer tubing, about an inch long.
   The apparatus with which all the earlier experiments were per
formed is only suitable for explosions of from 6 or 7 oz. of gun-
cotton.   In this apparatus the big trumpet is replaced by a drum
connected with the upper portion of the apparatus by means of a
brass tube having an internal diameter of nearly three-quarters of an
inch.   The diameter of the drum was 6 inches, and each drum-head
consisted of an india-rubber diaphragm, so that each gauge had two
india-rubber faces. In order to prevent the india-rubber cutting at
the edge of the drum, the latter must be finely polished round the
rim, and this should, if possible, be made of round brass wire. We
found that the decay of the india-rubber was lessened by lubricating
the rim of the drum with tallow.          By far the best thing to use for
binding the india-rubber    on to the  drums   is silk fishing-line.
   Both kinds of gauges were fixed to substantial wooden supports,
and these were provided with copper or iron cleats to run in guides

on a thick plank spiked on to the           turpentine       pile. The drum
gauges were sunk to the required distance               by means of lead
sinkers ; the trumpet gauges required to be hauled under water by a
block and tackle attached to a 5-cwt. sinker dropped at the foot

of the pile.      The handling of these big trumpets required several
men   ; even the smaller gauges were most troublesome            to fix if the
weather was bad. The chief difficulty met with in the earlier forms
of gauge was their liability to leak ; in the later forms this was got
over by the method of tying on the india-rubber and by cementing
in the glass cylinder between two concentric rings of brass with
melted sealing-wax.        Glue mixed with bichromate of potash and
melted in the dark is also an excellent cement, if coated with shellac
varnish. The screw carrying the platinum disk passed through a
stuffing box filled with an india-rubber bung, which could be jammed
tight by means of a screw top. During the course of the experiments
it was constantly necessary to adjust the depth of the gauges to allow
for the rise and fall of the tide.
    In the experiments, the results of which are given in this paper,

canses.     In the first place, we seldom commanded sufficient manual
 assistance to work the trumpets properly ; and in the second, these
latter were so sensitive to the action of small waves on the surface of
 the water that we could not utilise their full sensitiveness for the
purpose of registering the explosions.           Except on some few days in
the course     of  the winter, the   requisite  calmness   of the water is not
attained in Port Jackson.          It may be mentioned that it is easily
possible to set these large gauges to such a point of sensitiveness that
they will make contact on receiving the verbal order to do so — if it is
uttered in the right tone from a distance of 10 or 15 yards.
             Appliances  connected  with the  Firing of the Charges.
    The charges themselves were always enclosed in thin tin cylinders,
 or else in oil-silk or mackintosh. Except with respect to the detona
 tors, there is little to say.    When we were driven to make them for
 ourselves, we finally, with the assistance of Mr. Cook, hit on the
 following method.       A wooden mould was prepared, of such a form
 that it allowed a cylinder of plaster of Paris to be cast round two
 lengths of gutta-percha-covered copper wire running parallel to each
 other and to the long axis of the cylinder. When the plaster had
 set, the wires were cut off at one end to within about half a millimetre
 of the end surface of the cylinder, and at the other were allowed to
 protrude to a distance of 5 or 6 inches.            The fusible bridges of
 thin platinum wire were secured to the short ends of the copper wire
 by solder and resin only. These bridges were primed with a good
 covering of a mixture of guncotton fluff and meal powder, made into
 a paste with collodion.     In order to attach the detonating cap, advan
 tage was taken of the good workmanship of ordinary cartridge cases.
 A '" number twelve bore " case was taken and cut off above the brass

504            Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.        J.   F. Adair.        On    the
work in the lathe.       One end of the cardboard cylinder thus obtained
was closed by having a wooden ping glued into it. Throngh this
plug a hole was drilled to fit the detonating caps we were able to bny.
A cap was pushed, open end first, into the hole till it was flush with
the inner surface of the ping ; it was secured in this position with
the help of shellac varnish. The empty portion of the cap was then
filled with a mixture of fulminate of mercury and guncotton fluff, and
this filling was allowed to cover the bottom of the cartridge case
above the plug. Finally, some bees'-wax, resin, and linseed-oil luting
was poured over the surface of the upper portion of one of the plaster
cylinders, and this was then pushed home, so that the priming rested
on the loose mixture above the plug.
    Finally, the whole thing was dipped into some of the same luting,
so as to give it a waterproof coat.         The detonators were then tested
with    a telephone   and  stored.
    The advantage of this method is that as each operation is quite
simple the detonators can be formed by unskilled labour; a con
sideration, if many have to be made. The luting must have some
linseed oil with     it,otherwise      it apt to crack in cold weather.

have never known a detonator so constructed to miss fire, though
missfires often occurred till we used the fulminate and guncotton
priming.       The collodion paste       also very suitable, as
                                        is                            protects the

 delicate bridge.      In most cases the charges to be fired were contained
in tin cases, big enough to hold one 9-oz. disk of guncotton. The lid
of each tin had a cylindrical tin tube projecting from              to a distance
                                                                       it
 of  4   inches; this tube was not central, because 9-oz. disks are
bored with two holes.          The detonators were secured in these tubes
 simply    by   dipping   the  tubes in hot luting and then pushing the
 detonators down till the cap projected to           sufficient distance.

    The charge     was  then  placed  in  the  tin,  the detonator passing into
 one of the holes of the cotton, and then the junction between the lid
 and the tin was made secure with luting.             For smaller charges than
9   oz. other receptacles were provided        in most cases simply wrapping
                                                 ;
 the charge in mackintosh cloth was          sufficient  to keep out the water
 long enough for our purpose, the joints being well secured with a
 solution of india-rubber.       One terminal of the detonators was always
put to earth.

               as we can learn,   it
tion of the markings on     smoked plate simply to count the whole
                                  a
number of fork-beats, and to estimate the fractions at best by means
of   a   pair of spring dividers. In our case this method       obviously     is
not on     a  par, as far as accuracy goes, with the other measurements.

   Velocity of Transmission of Disturbances      through Sea-water.    505
Besides    this, the time is estimated by the distance between the
breaks, not in one line, but in two lines separated              by about
3  mm.,   the fork-line being      about  8 cm.  below  the lowest  of the
scribing lines.      It was clear at the outset, therefore, that special
arrangements must be made if real accuracy was to be •looked for.
This we have attained in the following manner : —
   By the construction of the myograph, and especially of the scribers,
it is possible to set the two scribing points and the scribing point of
the fork in the same vertical line.       Now, by proper adjustment, this
line is brought to coincide with a line passing through the knife-
edges and the centre of gravity of the smoked surface of the rect
angular glass plate when the pendulum is at rest. The three points,
therefore, at any instant during the motion of the pendulum, lie on a
radial line passing through the centre of suspension of the pendulum.
If, therefore, proper radial lines are drawn on the plates, correspond
ing to any epoch marked by the scriber, these lines will cut the
" fork " line at the
                        point corresponding to the same epoch. In fact,
the object   is to find  the exact point on the plate which was in contact
with the fork at the instant that the scriber concerned began to
move.
   We had a scribing table made to find these points in the following
manner.     A crossed board was prepared, about a foot longer than the
distance from the knife-edges of the pendulum to the bottom of the
glass plate.     A ground axle-pin was provided, passing through the
board perpendicular to its plane near one end, and firmly fastened to
it by brass collars. A long brass rod of rectangular section was fur
nished with a projection on one side at one end, and through this
projection was bored the hole into which the axle-pin was ground.
The brass rod could therefore revolve on the board about a point
situated at a distance of about three-quarters of an inch from one of
its shorter edges. The distance between the knife-edges of the pen
dulum and the centre of the glass plate was carefully measured, and
a recess was cut in the board in such a manner that when the glass
plate was dropped into the recess it occupied a position with respect
to the pivot precisely like that occupied by it during an experiment
with respect to the knife-edges of the pendulum. A V-shaped groove
was cut in the upper surface of the brass rod, over a length rather
greater than the breadth of the glass plate. A carefully made tri
angular plate of brass was furnished with two studs on its lower face,
and also with an adjustable sharp scribing point, just as far perpen
dicularly from the line joining the centre of the two studs as the
prolongation of the centre line of the V-groove was from the centre of
the axle.    Consequently, if the brass plate is caused to slide by means
of its studs up and down the groove, the scribing point marks a line
which if produced will pass through the centre of the axle. The

506        Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.    J. F. Adair.     On  the
accuracy of this depends, of course, on the accuracy with which the
groove is cut, and the accuracy of the equality of the distances
between the scriber and the groove and the prolonged axis of the
groove and the centre of the axle.       Great care was taken to secure
these conditions both in the making of the instrument and in the
adjusting of the scribing point.    The precise estimation in fork-beats
of the distance between the breaks in the scriber lines became an
easy matter with this table.
   The plate was dropped into the recess, and by means of the sliding
scriber two lines were drawn throngh the fork-line, each correspond
ing to radii of the pendulum and each passing through its appropriate
epoch mark on one of the scriber lines.     The estimation of the exact
position of the epoch mark was not eaBy at first, owing to the slow
motion of the scribers.     Finally, however, by making the battery
very strong, the springs also strong, the magnets very powerful, and
the moment of inertia of the scribers very small, this difficulty was
partially overcome.    Supposing that the two lines happened to cut
the fork-line in exact troughs or crests, nothing more remained than
to count the fork-beats. In general, however, this was not the case,
and then the following procedure had to be adopted.        A sliding-table
to carry a measuring microscope was arranged over the plate, and
was high enough to clear the radius bar and scriber. The scriber
was used to draw four lines in addition to the two marked on the
plate already ; the lines so drawn passed through the nearest crests
or troughs of the fork-line, between which the line of section lay. A
measuring microscope, with a micrometer screw of fifty to the inch
and the head divided into a hundred parts, was placed on the table
and adjusted by a special square, so as to be tangential to the arc of
mean position of the fork at the point where that arc is cut by the
epoch line.    Sometimes the arc was drawn by the radius bar, the
correctness of the setting of the measuring microscope was tested by
observing whether the arc left the cross-wires appreciably as the
microscope was screwed along.      If all was right, three readings were
taken with the micrometer, thus   —
     First reading, cross-wires on line through crest to right = O.
     Second             „               „                  epoch = P.
     Third             „               „            crest to left = Q.
   Supposing the whole number of fork-beats has been so counted
that an addition has to be made at each end to get the true length,
we have : if T be the whole time required, t the fork period, n the
whole number of beats, A and A' fractions of beats,
                           T = nT+(A     + A')T.
   Let 0, P, Q be the micrometer readings      as above, then—

and similarly                     A'=   ^
if  the rate of the pendulum be supposed constant during one fork-
beat   ; in practice this is very nearly attained, for the firing-key is so
set as to use only the middle or maximum velocity part of the stroke
for scribing.      In some earlier measurements the lengths between
successive fork-crests were measured, with the view of applying the
rigorous correction, but it was found that it differed from the one
here given by less than the breadth of a fine scriber line on the
smoked glass.       It would, moreover, be as likely to be in excess as in
defect, according as the fuse was more or less sensitive, and the firing
battery stronger or weaker.         Hence the whole time to be measured
comes to —
                         -,       ,  P-0    , P'-O'
   In order to eliminate    personal peculiarity of observation, the plates
were sometimes read by one of us and sometimes by Mr. Pollock, to
whom our best thanks are due. The measuring microscope was by
the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Co,, and had a respectable
screw ; this screw was compared with a standard scale, but found to
require no correction for its present purpose.
    It has been stated that observations were always made alternately ;
first the shot was fired so that it passed the piles, say, from pile X to
pile Y, and then immediately afterwards another similar charge was
fired, so that the shock passed from Y to X. It is clear on general
principles that if the time-constants of the gauges and scribers
remain the same from shot to shot, that then, by taking the arith
metical mean of the times obtained from the plates, we shall get the
time-value independent of time-constants.           In order, however, to
obtain additional security, both the gauges, magnets, scribers, &c,
were made as much alike as possible, so as to reduce the difference of
their time-constants to the least possible amount.         Our method of
elimination, however, is faulty, if there is any part of the time-
constant of the gauges which is reversed by the reversal of the shot.
If, for instance, the time-constants of the gauges are functions of the
violence of the shock the gauges receive, then there will be outstand
ing errors not eliminated by taking means.            In order to test this
point thoroughly, a large number of experiments were made during
the end of 1886 and beginning of 1887.
    There may also be small differences of velocity, depending on direc-
tirra caused by the configuration of the shore or sea-bottom.      Finally,

and   in individual    readings, this was often a tiresome matter; the
symmetry    of  the   fork-line   was sometimes disturbed by a super
imposed small ripple of different period to that of the fork.            This
ripple  was due  to  the  independent   vibration  of the  style attached  to
the fork.   Of course, as it was small it had no effect on the whole
number of beats, but made the estimation of the fractions more diffi
cult and less accurate than would otherwise have been the case.            It
is not very difficult  in  practice, however, to estimate from a slightly
rippled wave the position of the true crest, and this was always our
object in making the measurements, as we hoped to be as likely to
make them too large as too small, and hence to get rid of them in a
number of observations.        This uncertainty                is,
                                                      of course, entirely of
the second order, and, as a matter of fact,       negligible compared with
                                                          is
the irregularity observed, even           ifnot — as we consider— entirely
                                               it   is
eliminated through the number of the observations.
Experiments     to   find whether   the   Time-constant         of   the   Gauges depended
                           on the   Energy transmitted.
  It  is obviously impossible to reproduce the exact conditions of
explosive pressure in a laboratory, and hence the gauges were tested
with respect to their time of action by dealing blows of different
intensity to the india-rubber diaphragms. This was accomplished by
means of pendulums of constant lengths but of varying masses.        The
arcs through which the pendulums moved were also varied within
wide limits. The method of testing was as follows — The myograph      :
was so arranged that the firing key completed the circuit of the
electromagnet of       relay apparatus.
                       a                   The armature of the relay in
its position of rest completed the circuit of an electromagnet wbieh
held the st. iking pendulum (by means of an iron armature) in a fixed
position. The result of the fall of the myograph pendulum was,
therefore, to release the pendulum suspended opposite the diaphragm
of the gauge. The first scriber was arranged in such a manner that
it was brought into action directly the bob of the pendulum touched
the rubber diaphragm.       To this end, the diaphragm was temporarily
coated with a strip of tinfoil, so that the circuit of the first scriber
comprised battery, tinfoil, and testing pendulum. The second scriber
was in circuit with the contact portion of the gauge in the usual
manner.     Consequently, on dropping the myograph pendulum,                              a
record of the usual character        obtained on the smoked plate
                                      is                              the             ;

The pendulums employed were of different kinds. One set of experi
ments were made with         apendulum composed of     light brass rod,
                                                                      a
on which bobs of different sisses and materials conld be screwed.      In

  Velocity of Transmission of Disturbances    through    Sea-water.    509
order to eliminate any effect depending on the velocity of the impact
of the pendulum on the rubber, this arrangement was replaced by
another, in which the pendulum consisted of bobs supported by fine
wire, the armatures being attached to the bobs. The bobs themselves
were two in number, one being of lead and the other of plaster of
Paris coated with tinfoil; the effective length of the pendulums
was in each case 92 cm., the weight of the plaster arrangement com
plete was 160 grams, and of the lead arrangement 966 grams.            The
arc through which both pendulums fell was the same, and their
periods were approximately equal. The result of about ten experi
ments with this apparatus was that the time-constant with lead bob
was 0'0095 sec., and with plaster bob 0¦01008 sec., showing an
apparently smaller constant for the heavier blow. The energy of the
blow was, by the arrangement of the apparatus, simply proportional
to the masses ; thus the ratio was about as 966 to 160, or about six
to one, and the difference in the time-constants was 0'00058 sec.
One wave of the tuning-fork, however, was rather more than a
centimetre in length, and corresponded       sufficiently nearly for the
purpose to 0'01 sec., and the difference of the time-constants is there
fore about sixty-thousandths of this, say, less than six-tenths of a
millimetre on the smoked glass. This is much too large a quantity
to be accounted for by experimental error in measariag the plates,
but is not too large to be accounted for in other ways.     It has already
been mentioned that if metallic surfaces are greasy, the definition of
the epoch of contact is chiefly a matter of pressure between the sur
faces.   Now the contact with the lead bob of the pendulum was, as
far as the lead goes, on a clean surface, because the lead was scraped,
 but with the plaster bob the contact was between two tinfoil surfaces.
Now it was found in the experiments above referred to that a much
                                                     " contact ' when
greater pressure has to be exerted to produce                           the
surfaces are greasy than when they are clean, and tinfoil is always
greasy, and consequently we should expect that, as far as this effect
goes, the time-constant would appear longer with the lead bob than
with the plaster one. This is contrary to what was observed. On
the other hand, the tinfoil on the plaster was slightly creased, and
hence, if we suppose that a sensible wave of compression does not
begin to travel up the tube till the deformation of the india-rubber
has progressed to a certain extent, the effect of the tinfoil creases
will be to exaggerate the difference between the time-constants in the
same sense as that observed.       We conclude, therefore, that, setting
aside the difference in the rate of propagation of the waves in the
gauge tube depending on their amplitude, we must look to the
moving part of the contact apparatus for an explanation. This was
considerably heavier than was ultimately used in the actual experi
ments, and the adjustment was nothing like so delicate as we after

510            Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.      J.   F. Adair.    On the
wards succeeded in making        it,   and consequently there        is
                                                                      every reason
to believe that the difference in time-constant observed in these
experiments was very much greater than              itwas in the actnal observa
tions. But the times measured are of the order of one-tenth of a
second, and the amount we are now concerned with                is  of the order of
0-0006 second, so      it   is  clear we are discussing the correction of a
correction.
   It true, however, that the instantaneous pressures to which the
      is
gauges are exposed during explosions differ by considerably greater
amounts than those due to the action of the two pendulums                 ;   itwas
always arranged, therefore, that the gauges should have              a considerable
excess of sensitiveness when used to measure the explosion velocities.
It must be added that the length of the chord of the arc through
which the pendulums swung in the testing experiments was about
20 cm., so that the whole time in question           is only of the order of the
time taken by   the   pendulums      to swing through about half a millimetre
at their greatest velocity. In addition to this,                it  was extremely
difficult to keep the tinfoil properly and uniformly glued to the
surface of the rubber.        The effect of the blow was always to crumple
the tinfoil to a small extent    ;   a  wrinkle of the order of 0'l mm. would
explain   the  whole    effect,   and   after several impacts much greater
deviations were difficult to avoid.            The blows from the lead bob
resulting   in by  far   the   greatest   deformation   of the rubber produced
much the greatest trouble in wrinkling the tinfoil, and yet we could
not replace the tinfoil after such experiment because we desired to be
sure that the state of the surface as to greasiness was constant, and
consequently we were obliged to smooth the tinfoil down to the best
of our ability.      It may be added that, of course, the tinfoil was as
well cleaned as possible, but        it   is not a very easy substance to be
quite  sure  about  in  this  respect,   and  the thinnest silver and platinum
foil we had and tried would not stick to the rubber properly unless
stuck by so much marine glue as to weight the diaphragms sensibly,
and thus perhaps introduce a peculiarity.                  Having in view the
sources of error   above    indicated,    we did not  feel  justified in applying
any correction to the observed velocities of explosion-effect               on this
account the effect,
           ;             therefore,   will be   that  our velocities run the risk
of being a little too high to the extreme extent of, say,             2  per cent. ;
we are certain ourselves, however, that this             isnot the case.     It may
be mentioned that the experiments with the rod pendulums led, on
the whole, to rather smaller values for the time-constants,                 but we
have not laid any stress on them, as the pendulums did not move
with exactly equal velocities in all cases.

                     Comparison of the Fork with a Clock.
    The fork employed was a very excellent and massive one, belong
ing to a ribbon chronograph apparatus and made by Koenig.               The
fork was marked 100 VD. We felt confidence in this fork from the
first, as it was supplied with a style and platinum cord contact
apparatus for electric maintenance.          A comparison was made with
the laboratory clock (a very fine one, by Cooke, of York) by one of us
 and Mr. Arthur Pollock.          Lord Rayleigh's method was employed.
 The   fork  compared directly with the clock was also by Koenig, and
was reduced from about 35 complete vibrations per second to 33'194
approximately, by very carefully equalised weights. The approxi
mate period was found by counting whole and estimating partial
vibrations, over a period of 27 seconds; the chronograph above
alluded to was used for this purpose — one scriber marked periods of
2 seconds direct from the clock, and the other was included in the
driving circuit of the fork. The length of ribbon used was 56 feet.
We insist on the accuracy of this approximate measurement, because
the exact comparison requires it.             The clock, with its contact
arrangement, had been carefully rated for some time and adjusted so
that for this purpose the rate is negligible — it was about a second
a day.     The observation of the light spot was undertaken by Mr.
Pollock; it was found most convenient to interpose the adjustable
slit of a spectroscope between the object-glass and the eye-piece of
the observing telescope. The pendulum of the clock made a complete
vibration in 2 seconds, and the slits of the fork opened twice in each
complete vibration.        The period of recurrence of the flash system
was 432 seconds, and the fork was losing on the clock.
   The result is that the actual frequency of the fork is 33-1933 com
plete vibrations per second.        The second harmonic of this was the
frequency of the driven fork with which the standard was compared.
   Hence frequency of driven fork is —
                                    99-5799.
   The beats were counted over a period of five minutes, the driven fork
being at 20° C. by a Kew standard (and re-examined) thermometer.
This temperature was then changed to 30° C, and the beats again
counted.     Two Rets of experiments were made, which agreed very
well together.      During the observations at 30° C. the driving-fork
period of flash recurrence changed to about 270 seconds. The final
result, the calculation of which presents no new features, is that
                           » = 100-2622-001472     t,

 512        Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.     J. F.  Adair.    On the
day was 13° C.      This result amounts to making tho fork correct at
 IT'Sl" C. An experiment was made to try whether the slight damp
ing of the fork, produced by the friction of the style on smoked glass,
caused any appreciable change in the period. A plate of smoked
glass was set up so that the style rubbed the glass, and the beats were
again counted.      If any effect exists it is less than an alteration of
frequency corresponding to one complete vibration in two minutes.
    The effect on the observed velocity of transmission of explosive
energy at the extreme temperatures of 13'4i° and 28° of the tempera
ture coefficient of the fork is 0'065 and 0-15 per cent, respectively, of
tho uncorrected value, and is, of conrso, included in the reduction of
the observations.
                Measurement  of Distance   between the Gauges.
   For the purpose of estimating the distance          between  the piles    a
spike was driven into the top of each, to serve as a mark for the
cross-wires of the theodolite.        No less than three distinct sets of
measurements were made for us by Mr. R. J. A. Roberts, Government
Surveyor ; this was due to the fact that on one occasion one of the
piles was pulled up by a large steamer, which made fast to it in order
to swing, and after the pile had been re-driven rather badly it got
washed to one side by the heavy wash of another steamer.              Finally
the pile was moved further away, a better bottom was found, and we
had no further trouble.     In the intermediate position the pile was not
driven quite straight, consequently the distance between the gauges
had to be corrected according to their depth.         Now the gauges were
made to follow the tide, and consequently the correction had to be
applied to each experiment.      For this purpose, some measurements of
the slope were made and a table of corrections for what we called
immersion was prepared, by whose aid the distance on each occasion
was correctly arrived at.     The gauges were fastened to the piles in
such a way that no appreciable correction has to be applied to Mr.
Roberts's distance between the spikes.         We do not mean to say that
there may not be some small difference arising from the thickness of
the drum (about 3 cm.) and accidental straining of the woodwork,
but it cannot amount to more than a few centimetres, and will vary
from day to day, as probably in one direction as in another.              The
piles  were  also very possibly a  little bent  by the  wind and   tide ;  the
amount of this could not be estimated without keeping a theodolite
permanently set up, and this we could not do, partly because we had
no theodolite of our own. However, this small error is as likely to be
in excess as in defect.
   Much more important for the absolute velocity is the displacement

-The buoys were anchored with sinkers and attached to the pile by
  ropes, so as to keep them as rigidly as possible in one position.
 However, at low tides the ropes became slack, and then if a wind was
 blowing, the shot drifted for a few yards out of the direct line ; the
 result will be that the second gauge may be affected by a portion of
 the wave front (if there is one) which is not identical with the por
 tion affecting the first. Owing, however, to the end of the mooring
 line being permanently fastened to the nearest pile, the shot when
 displaced will practically move in an arc of a circle, with the pile as
centre, and hence we have a means of estimating the maximum effect
 of any amount of drifting.      It can readily be seen by drawing the
 figure that drifting of the shot will have the same effect as diminish
ing the distance between the piles, and hence the times will be rather
shorter, and the velocities rather greater, than would otherwise be
 the case.   An error of this kind will not, therefore, be eliminated by
any number of observations, as it is always in one direction. The
 remedy is to take as much pains as possible to prevent its occurrence,
and this was always done ; an account of the magnitude of the error
 which may arise in this way is contained in the third part of this
 paper.
Method Adopted to Determine the Distance retween two Spikes
     in Piles driven out in the Water, Berry's Bat, Port
     Jackson.
    The base-line was measured with a 100 link ^-inch steel riband with
adjustable ends, to which was applied a tension equal to 16 lb. The
chain was found after carefnl testing to be equal to the standard at
the Government Observatory, Sydney, at a temperature of 78° F.
It was tested on a calm, cloudy morning, the temperature being even,
and the base-line was measured the same day, the temperature being at
the time 61° P. The standard at the Observatory is T^ths of an
inch short, it having been measured off with the compensating rods
for measuring trig.-base lines. A correction was therefore applied to
make up for this error. The chain when tested was supported through
out its entire length, but was suspended when used for measuring the
base-line.    By careful experiment it was found that this made a
difference in length of -I-g^ths of an inch, for which a correction was
also applied. The expansion or contraction being equal to 0'005 of
1 inch for 1° F. for one chain, the distance   in chains, multiplied by
half the difference between standard and observed temperature, and
the result divided by 8, gives a correction in decimals of a link to be
added or subtracted, as the temperature is higher or lower than the
standard temperature.
    To the handle at the back end of the chain was attached        a small
                                                             2 m  2

514         Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.    J. F. Adair.    On the
piece of steel with a knife-edge, and this was regarded as the end of
the chain.     This end was worked by means of a slow motion screw
attached to a hoard, on which the chainman knelt, and so the end of
the chain was kept perfectly steady.      The knife-edge was brought by
the screw to the mark, which was a very fine pencil dot on a piece of
white paper, gammed on to a flat-headed nail driven into the ground.
On the forward end of the chain was hooked a spring balance, which
indicated a 16 lb. strain, applied by means of a light straining pole,
12 feet long, thus enabling the chainman to apply the strain far more
steadily and easily than by any other method at present in use ; and
also allowing the full length of the chain to be used on a slope equal
to about 1 in 5, the end of the chain sliding up and down the pole.
The greatest slope in this case was, however, only about 1 in 10, and
only for two chains of the entire length. The forward end of the
chain was taken as the position of a small hole, through which a
string, with a small plummet attached, passed. This plummet was
used merely to indicate the position of the nail, and to keep in adjust
ment a contrivance which gave the position of the transit theodolite
 (carefully adjusted for the telescopic axis) at right angles to the
direction of the chain.      The end of the chain was sighted by means
of the transit instrument, and the telescope being then depressed,
the fine point of a hard pencil was lined on the paper before described.
This method does away with any errors due to the use of the plummet
(especially in windy weather) for marking the end of the chain on
sloping ground. By the use of the instrument the end of the chain
can be marked to -v^ili of an inch.          This method has also other
advantages     for accurate  measurement.
   The instrument used was a 5-inch transit theodolite, by Troughton
and Simms, of London, having the circle graduated to 20 seconds.     The
telescope    was larger than, and of much superior quality to, those
usually   fitted  to 5-inch instruments.    The plummet was suspended
from the end of the vertical axis. The instrument was used on a
traversing top stand, and being in very good order, and the axis
moving freely, there was no twisting pressure (torsion) on the stand,
and the day being a cloudy one, and the sun completely obscured, the
effect of sunlight on the eyes was avoided.     The instrument was care
fully set up over each of the points   A,   B, C, and D on the base-line,
and angles were observed to the spikes in the piles (points E and F)
off line AD. The angles shown on the plan are the means of four
readings at each of the stations. After the first two readings the
telescope was turned over in the reversed position, so that any possible
errors due to change of focus (movement of the optical axis of the
instrument), want of horizontality of the telescopic axis, and imper
fect collimation, are entirely eliminated.     The levels were sensitive,
and of good quality.        The readings of both verniers were recorded

    Velocity  of Transmission of Disturbances     through Sea-water.   515
and a mean taken, and each angle was read off a different part of the
graduated circle each time, so that any error due to eccentricity was
entirely eliminated, and any errors due to imperfect graduation were
reduced to a minimum. In repeating an angle on the graduated circle,
not only is the second measures of the angle given on a different part
of the circle, but an angular quantity, which perhaps the vernier is
incapable of showing, has been doubled, and may therefore become
apparent.
    As an example, suppose the instrument carefully set over the point
A     (see Plate 3) and levelled, and observing to D as an initial point,
the two verniers are read off, and their position recorded in the field-
book.      Leaving the lower clamp fast, and releasing the milled-headed
screw clamping the vernier plate and that carrying the graduated
 circle, the point E is then observed to, and the readings recorded, and
so on to the point F. Then leaving the upper clamp fast and releasing
 the lower, the point D is again referred to, and the operation repeated
 three times, thus getting four measures for the angles, taking care
after the second round to reverse the telescope.        This movement will
 bring the vernier originally on the left hand side of the instrument
 to the right hand.       A mean of the verniers and all the readings is
 the required angle.       Tripods with fine steel points' and heavy plum
 mets were used as reference marks carefully set over the ends of the
 base-line.
     The alignment of the points B and C was very carefully performed,
 using the telescope in reversed positions, both from the ends of thu
 line and at the points themselves.
     The triangles obtained by the above operations for fixing E and F
 were too small to make it necessary to go into the equation of their
conditions.

                  Distance over which Disturbance   Travelled.
     The distance     between the gauges was at first 15,410 cm., it was
 afterwards     15,840  cm., minus a correction made for the slope of the
 pile which had been driven slightly out of the vertical. This correc
 tion varied between 51 cm. and 59 cm., and depended on the depth
 of the gauge below the top of the pile.       Finally in the third position
 the distance was 18,210 cm.
                               Time Measurements.
     Let  t be the epoch  of arrival of the disturbance at gauge A, and
  let Tj, ax be the time constant of the gauge and of the scriber attached
 to it respectively, then the record on the smoked plate occurs at

 516        Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.          J. F.  Adair.      On the
 time i+Tj + ffj. Similarly if T be the time required for the transmis
 sion of the disturbance, then the second record on the smoked plate
occurs at time T + tf + T2+<r2, where t2, <t2 are the time-constants of
the second gauge and its attached scriber respectively.
     Thus the observed interval as recorded on the smoked plate is —
                            T   = T + T2 + ff3 — Tj—  <7j.
    Similarly for a disturbance in the opposite direction the recorded
interval is —
                           t = T + T1 + a1-7a—aa,
provided that the time of transmission is the same in both directions,
and that the time constants of the gauges and scribers have not
altered between the two observations, and that the scribers are
attached to the same gauges in the two observations.

    Hence time of transmission of disturbance = — — .
                              *  .
    The velocity of transmission calculated on the supposition that
the fork has an exact frequency of 100 must be multiplied by
1-002622— 0-0001472 t, to get the correct velocity.
    The velocities had been originally deduced on the supposition that
the fork was correct ; these uncorrected velocities are given in
Column 9 of the Table ; the correction arising from the decimal parti
of the above factor, viz., from 0-002622—0-0001472 t, are given in
Column 10, and the corrected velocities in Column 11.
    The complete formula for V the velocity is thus —
                   V=    ——

where S is the distance between the gauges and t is the temperature
of the fork.     This gives the velocity at the temperature of the sea-
water during the observation.
                    Theoretical Calculation      of the Velocity.
    In Column    12  of the Table is given the velocity of sound, calculated
theoretically as follows.        The formula giving the velocity of sound
through water is taken to be —
                                     -Vft-
where E^ is the adiabatic resilience of volume, and              D is the density
at the temperature considered.

                  Observation and Calculation of the Density.
   In   the  " Challenger Report,"      vol. 1, ' Physics and Chemistry,'
p. 70 et seq., is given a table for calculating the density of a sea-
water at any temperature when its density at 15'56J C. is known.
To get the density of the Berry's Bay water at this temperature six
experiments were made on two samples collected at an interval of a
month.      The water of the Bay is practically Pacific Ocean water,
there being to all intents and purposes no fresh water flowing into
the Bay.      Four of the experiments were made by weighing a piece
of glass (English flint), both in doubly vacuum-distilled water and in
the sea-water ; and two experiments were made with a specific
gravity bottle. Both the glass and the water had been allowed to
stand in the balance case for seven hours before weighing ; the ther
mometer used was a standard compared at Kew, the correction being,
as it happened, zero, for the temperature observed.             The piece of
glass   was  suspended    from  the arm  of the balance     a
                                                         by platinum wire,
the length of which was 28 cm.           The weight of 1 metre of the wire
was 0"1004 gram, and the density        was  taken as 21. In each weighing
in water one half the wire was immersed.            The sensitiveness of the
balance was such as to give readings of eight scale divisions per
milligram.       The density of the sea-water is compared with that of
pure water by means of the formula
in   which    p   is the   density of the    water in which      the glass  is
weighed,
               G = mass of glass,
                y = density of glass,
              W = apparent weight in air,
              W'= apparent weight in water,
                a = density of the air during weighing,
                B = density of the brass weights = 8"4,
                P = mass of platinum wire = 0'028112 gram,
                p = density of platinum = 21.
     p on the  right-hand side is taken approximately.
   The above formula is got by neglecting
                         -(w-w)£+(SL+i
compared with       W— W.
    In  the present case this is equivalent to neglecting  —
             0'00000815 gram in comparison       with 4'93 grams.

518           Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.           J.   F. Adair.    On the
   By applying the above formula to the weighing in sea-water at
17° C. and to the       weighing in pure water at 16'65c C., the first expe
riment gave density of sea- water at 17° = 1 02702 density of pure
water at 16'65°. The density of pare water at the various tempera
tures was taken from Kupffer's observations as reduced by Professor
W. H. Miller (Everett's 'Units and Physical Constants,' 2nd edition,
p. 39). The densities for temperatures intermediate to those given
by Everett were obtained by interpolation.
   For the measurement of the density by means of the specific
gravity bottle, two bottles were used, one acting as a counterpoise,
together with the small requisite quantity of sand and aluminium
foil. The other bottle being quite clean was then filled with the
water to be weighed, great care being taken to avoid the retention of
any bubble of air. The dry and wet bulb thermometer apparatus
was observed, together with the barometer, in order to make the
usual corrections for weighing in air. The results of the two measure
ments made by this method agreed closely with the other four
measurements made by weighing glass.                    In order to have comparable
results and to get a mean, the results of the measurements made at
17°, 18-6°, 1865°, 198°, and 21° C. respectively were reduced by

 1'0234; and this solution contains approximately 3-14 per cent, solid
 matter.     Thus, since cp occurs in a small term, it may be taken
 without much error = 0'962. An experiment made by Mr. Flint,
one of the students in the Laboratory, gave a value practically the

    Velocity of Transmission of Disturbances       through Sea-water.          521
                 Determination   of the Isothermal Besiliences.
    With regard to E«, Professor Tait has kindly supplied us with
 information.     He gives formulae for the compressibility of fresh
 water and of sea-water at low pressures and high pressures.                  The
 compressibility, as given by him, is a function of the pressure and the
 temperature, and thus for a pressure which varies rapidly from a low
 value to such a great value as one or three tons weight per square
 inch, the compressibility would be a variable quantity. It did not
 appear at first whether his formula for moderately low pressures, or
 the formula for such pressures as from one to three tons per square
inch, was to be used to get E«, the reciprocal of the compressibility.
The further uncertainty as to the effect of viscosity is not allowed for
in finding the theoretical velocity. With a view to settle which of
Tait's formulae was to be adopted, it was remarked that for an incom
pressible uniform liquid, subject to impulsive pressures, the equation
 to determine the impulsive pressure at any point is (Lamb, p. 12) —
                             cPw   <Pw    cPw    „
    And hence, for an impulsive pressure uniformly distributed over a
sphere, the impulsive pressure at a point outside the sphere would be
inversely proportional to the distance at that point from the centre of
sphere.
    It seems  desirable to determine the function     •ar of x, y, z, and t, which
 will satisfy given boundary conditions and the equation
                          dp   <Pw    <Pw    cPw    „
                                                      '

arising from the equation of continuity combined with the equations
of impulses, when a relation is assumed between p and w. If it is
supposed that impulsive pressure is subject to the laws of ordinary
pressure, such a relation as that given by Van der Waals might
perhaps be taken, or one of Tait's relations giving the compressibility
as a function of pressure and temperature.
    Supposing that the above consideration approximately applies to
sea-water, it was further concluded, by the method of Berthelot in
discussing the experiments of Sarrau and Vieille, that in our crsp the
initial pressure on the walls of the case containing the explosive was
in each case (guncotton and dynamite) about 8000 kilograms weight
per sq. cm. This agreement between the initial pressure duo to gun-
cotton and that due to dynamite is accounted for by the density of
charge being rather different in the two cases.                  Supposing this
pressure uniformly distributed over a sphere of 1 foot diameter,

522        Prof. R. Threliall and Mr.          J.  F. Adair.     On    the
¦which is very much greater than the volume actually occupied by the
explosive, and that the pressure at a distant point is inversely propor
tional to the distance from the centre of the sphere, the pressure at
20   yards    distant would be approximately 64-4 atmospheres                    of
 1,014,412 dynes per sq. cm. each. This value for an atmosphere has
been taken as representing Tait's value, which he defines by 152-3
atmospheres      = 1 ton weight per square inch, at Edinburgh (?).
For pressures considerably below this, Tait's low pressure formula is
applicable.     If  the sphere supposed to be occupied by the explosive
is less than  1  foot in diameter, the pressure at a distant point would,
on the above       suppositions, be proportionately diminished ; and at
greater distance      than 20 yards it would be further proportionately
diminished. Viscosity would aid in further diminishing the pressure,
so that on the whole, for the space between the gauges, it seemed
advisable to use the low pressure formula as given by Tait.
   This formula is —
   Average compressibility of sea- water at low pressures is

   Taking such au atmosphere as 1,014,412 dynes par               sq. cm., we thus
get—

of the general table.      The calculation is laborious.
                      Explanation of  the General Table.
   The Table explains itself except with regard to the observations on
July   11, and the three first on August 10.      In these cases a mean of
three intervals was taken by taking a mean of two shots in the
direction left to right, and then a mean between that mean and the
interval from right to left. It is to be remarked that in the case of
the pair of shots on September 13, which gave the mean interval
0'1277, the mark on the smoked plate determining the single interval
0-1210 was extremely faint.       A photograph of this plate is shown
(p. 524), the single radial line showing the slight break in the line
traced by the scriber.
   On the lower part of the General Table are given the observations
from which a mean interval could not be obtained, together with the
first observations on April 25 and May 7, and. another pair of ob
servations on   July  5.   These  observations  were   rejected on account
of the gauge having been water-logged ; besides this they should be
regarded     with suspicion, since they would give results whose
departure from the final mean would be greater than the maximum
                                                                "
error
       "  found in accordance with the theory of adjustment of
observations.
   It may be added that as a general result of our experience we found
that (possibly owing to some interference effects) the distant gauge
was often more violently affected after its first indication.          Now
when the gauges were water-logged they became deficient in
sensitiveness, and consequently in the observations referred to the
probability is that the mark observed corresponded to the second, not
the first shock.     This conclusion is strengthened by a reference to
the photograph of the plate of September 13.
           Part  III. — Reduction   and Discussion    of Results.
   The experiments are divided into four classes, according to the
nature and, quantity of the explosive used*. In Class A the explosive
was a 9-oz. disk of guncotton, in Class B 10 oz. of dynamite, in
Class C 18, oz. of guncotton, and in Class P, 4- lb. of guncotton.       In

524 Prof. B. Tnrelfall and Mr. J. F. Adai, On the
Velocity of Transmission of Disturbances through Sea-water. 525
  526       Prof. R. ThrelfaU and Mr.      J. F.  Adair.      On  the
  Class A the velocity seems to increase with the temperature,          bnt no
 such law was detected in the other classes.
     In order to reduce the observed velocities (when corrected         for the
 temperature    of the  fork)  to a comparable   state,  they are   reduced  to
 one temperature ; and in the absence of a rule for doing this it is
 supposed that each velocity in Class A, &c, is expressible in the
 form VA + at, where VA denotes the velocity at some temperature
 between the extreme temperatures of the observations in Class A,
 and t is the excess of the temperature of the observation above the
 chosen temperature.       For Class A the temperature chosen was the
 mean of the temperatures         of the observations ; this mean is ap
 proximately 17"791° C.        Hence arises the system of equations
                             VA-0191a =     167567
                             VA-0191a =     165943

                             VA-0-791o = 148804
                             VA + 0-709a= 180697
                            VA+ 0709a = 193839
                             VA+0-209a   =  197940
                             VA+O-209a   =  163439
                            VA+0-209o    =  197540
                             VA + 0209o  =  174601.
If  the method   of least squares be considered applicable, the equations
for the probable values of VA and a are (Stewart and Gee, vol.               1,
p. 274)   :
                                 11VA-O001o = 1905469.

                          (0-091) VA + 25891a =       66858.
    These give —
                 VA = 173227,                    a = 25890.
    This large value of a will be merely used in getting the probable
error of the mean, i.e., of the above value of VA. If it has a physical
meaning it is very noteworthy.        Substituting the value 25890 for a
in the foregoing equations there arise the values : — '

                158                   VB + l-36 = 174657
   The equations for the probable values of VB and       b are —
                         f  24VB+  lib   = 4269946,
and                     \l-lVB+   27976=     476912.
Hence           VB = 177453,                    b = 10072.
   The smallness of   b compared  with o, the corresponding quantity iu
Class A, may perhaps be referred to the greater number of observa
tions in Class B ; yet it would not seem to represent the real increase
of velocity due to an increase of 1° of temperature.
   In order to get the probable error of the mean, viz., 177453, using
the above value of 6, the above equations become —

  Velocity   of Transmission of Disturbances      through Sea-water.    529
   Thus the result of Class   B  may be expressed    —
   Probable    value  of velocity at 14-5°     C = 1775 + 27 metres     per
         second.
   The theoretical velocity of sound is 1508 metres per second.
   For Class C the mean temperature is 18'3° C. Using Vc to repre
sent   the velocity at   18'3°, and   c  being  a quantity similar   to the
quantity a in Class A, the system of resulting equations is —
                            Vo-0-3c = 197354
                            V0-03c = 199519
                            Vc + 0-2c = 192756
                            V0 + 0-2c= 193659
                            Vc+0-2c = 187674
                 Hence probable value of Vc =         194192,
                                              c= -14147.
Substituting this value of   c above, the values are—
                                              Departure from mean.
                   Vc = 193110                       -1082

    Mean   as above  = 194192
   If the  method of least squares be applicable to such a small number
of values, then probable error of mean (Bessel) = 726 ; or by Peters's
formula probable error of mean = 807. Thus the result of Class C
may be written —
       Probable velocity at  18-3°  C. = 1942 + 8 metres per second.
   The theoretical velocity of sound is 1525 metres per second.         For
Class D, reducing the values to 19° C, the equations become —
                                   Vd = 210000
                                   Vd = 192568
                            { Vv + d = 192327
   Hence probable value of         Vd = 201284
                                     d =  -8957
   The values of Vd are therefore —

       Probable velocity at   19° C.  = 2013 + 35 metres per second.
   The theoretical velocity of sound is 1528 metres per second.         Thus
in each class the experimental velocity is greater than the theoretical
velocity of sound.
   During the experiments it sometimes occurred that the firing buoy
drifted slightly (by influence of wind and tide) from the line con
taining the piles. The deviation from that line could only be
approximately estimated, but it was judged that it was never so
much as 3-5 metres, although it was usually slightly out of line.
Suppose its distance from the line of the piles to be 3'5 metres,
and that the deviation at the other end was the same, then (see
figure) taking the distances as marked, A and B being the piles.

Thus the true velocity V is less than the velocity calculated                        in the
General Table by 0-137 per cent. of th9 velocity in the Table.
This amounts to —
     For the    mean  of Class A, vii  , 1732 metres,   the correction is 2°37 metres.

    Suppose       the firing point distant 1'5 metre out of line, a similar
calculation shows the correction to the velocity in the Table to be
0-00026 of that velocity or 0026 per cent.
   For the mean velocity of Class A this correction is 0-45 metre.

   It is probable that in general the firing buoy was not anything like
a metre out of line, and hence it is clear that it is useless to apply this
correction to the observed velocities.                   In any case a glance at the
Table will show that the irregularities observed are of such an order
as render any attempt to adjust the observations in this respect of
purely fictitious value.

    Though the regularity of the mean results is very satisfactory, a
glance at any of the Tables will show that several individual observa
                                                        J
tions deviate to the extent of nearly per cent. Now from our appara
tus, and from the fact that the observations are to a great extent made
automatically, we are at a loss to account for these deviations, unless
they are real. We hope to be able to show the cause of this imme
diately, for the moment we wish to add a little to what has already
been said as to the rejection of certain observations.                             When we first
began to get readings our gauges were not nearly so satisfactory as
they afterwards became ; the sensitiveness was sometimes so small
that we occasionally failed in obtaining any record whatever from the
apparatus which was furthest away from the firing point.                               The gauges
were also apt to allow water to leak in at the bottom, and the air
sometimes escaped slightly at the top, allowing the rubber faces to
collapse.        Both these accidents tend to lessen the sensitiveness of the
gauges very materially.                  It was soon noticed that the abnormal
results — and these always occurred in the direction of making the
velocity too small — were obtained when the gauges were for some
reason or other more or less out of order.                        When, as shortly occurred,
we succeeded in making the gauges uniformly sensitive, and prevent
ing water-logging and the escape of air, we got no abnormal times.
The only difficulty we experienced in deciding to reject certain obser-

   Velocity of Transmission of Disturbances through Sea-water.       533
vations lay in the fact that at first we conld see no reason why, if the
gauges worked at all, they should give results which differed.       We
could not see that the introduction of water, for instance, between the
rubber faces ought -to make the time-constant of the gauge greater —
and yet at first we could only explain the abnormal low velocities by
supposing that the time-constants were enormously increased at the
fnrther stations.    A fortunate observation, however, on September
13th, put us on the right track. We had noticed on several occasions
that the first mark made by the scriber on the smoked plates was not
nearly so strong as the second or third.    These marks did not depend
in any way on the natural period of vibration of the scriber, for that
was far too short, and hence we put them down to the passage up and
down the air-tube of the gauge of pressure waves.         It was not yet
clear, however, why it was that sometimes the second and third marks
of the scriber were stronger than the first.
    The strength or distinctness of these marks clearly depends on the
conductivity and duration of the contact effected in the gauge head ;
and this must depend on the increase of pressure and on its duration
in the water in the neighbourhood of the rubber disks. Now it is
probable that several waves and not a single wave of compression
start from an explosive centre. First there is the sudden expansion
by the explosion, then the cooling or escape of the gases and the con
sequent falling together of the water before the disturbance sub
sides.
    A  glance  at the mnp will show that our gauges were so situated
with    respect to the sheer stone wall of the quay that interference
might well be looked for. Supposing then that interference takes place
at the further gauge between the direct and reflected waves ; it is
clear that the first pressure to which the gauge is exposed is not
necessarily the strongest, and equally clear that the duration of the
interference pressure may be longer, but cannot very well be shorter
than that of the pressure first arriving.    It may well happen, there
fore, that the second or third marking on the plate is the most
distinct, or, even if the sensitiveness of the gauge is low, the first
mark might be suppressed entirely, and the second appear alone in
 its stead. Now, the distance from the first to the second marking
 on the plate was pretty constant so loDg as the conditions of the
 experiment remained the same, and, strangely enough, as it then
 seemed to us in the case of the abnormal results referred to, there
 was also a certain agreement.        It seemed as if the velocity was
 either a good deal greater than the velocity of sound — or else a good
 deal less ; the abnormal velocities were consistent with themselves in
 a rough way.     On September 13th, however, we found out the reason
 —on that day we got a record in which the first motion of the
  scriber (giving a normal time) was all but too small for detection —

'534        Prof. R. Threlfall and Mr.     J.  F. Adair.      On the
while a little farther on there was a strong mark giving one of the
 us HiU abnormal times.
     The result was that we obtained a normal observation, but we saw
 that had the gauge been slightly less sensitive, or the explosion
 slightly smaller, we should have had an abnormal observation.
     In order to obtain every satisfaction on this point, we applied
 (daring the reduction of the observations) the mathematical criteria
 of rejection, and found that we should thus reject those observations
 — and those only which we had already decided to reject on experi
 mental grounds. Altogether we rejected three experiments, involving
 six shots, out of forty- six experiments involving ninety-two shots.
     We now pass on to discuss the smaller variations in the observations
 which we retain.     It will be remembered that at first our primary
 object in undertaking this work was to find whether there were any
 great irregularities or not, with a view to finding whether the
 " directed action " already commented on existed to any great extent.
 If it did, we hoped to find considerable deviations in the velocity,
 principally above the mean.
     The result has shown, however, that while such irregularities do
 certainly exist to a slight extent, we have no evidence to show that
 directed action takes place from the explosion of freely suspended
 cartridges. The result would probably have been different if we had
 endeavoured to produce such directed action by the application of
 properly disposed obstacles or air spaces round the detonating point.
 We think that the small deviations, such as they are, are real, and do
 not depend on the gauges or chronograph, and certainly not on our
 measurement of the plates, which was always pushed to a much
 higher degree of certainty. It seems probable to us that though the
  directed action is small, it exists to some extent.        The observations
 themselves afford strong proof of the fact that waves of great energy
 travel faster than sound, and, indeed, in free water, at all events (and,
  of course, we have no opinion beyond), the velocity is greater the
  greater the amount of energy transmitted.         If it happens, therefore,
  that in any experiment the direction of greatest action coincides
  with the line passing from the shot through the two stations, we shall
  have that explosion register an abnormally high velocity.            On the
  contrary,  if the energy escapes away     from   the   piles, we shall  get a
  velocity correspondingly low.      In intermediate directions of escape,
  the velocity will be intermediate.
      A somewhat delicate question       presents itself as to the precise
  method by which these big waves may be considered                 to become
  extinguished.     A preliminary question which might very well be
  asked would be as to whether the increase in the velocity is to be
  looked for as depending on a greatly increased adiabatic resilience.
  We do not think that any probable          change in the resilience    would

   Velocity   of Transmission of Disturbances    through Sea-water.  535
account     for oar results — nor, indeed, would this view be consistent
with the remarks made on the subject of choosing Tait's formulae.
On the other hand, we have reasons for thinking that after the
pressure increases beyond a certain point, the resilience may increase
with very great rapidity; if this is the case, it will explain our
results, the wave would rush past the first gauge, and then slow
down with comparative suddenness.
   It may be remembered that with respect to Class A, there was
some evidence in favour of thinking that the velocity depends largely
on the temperature of the water ; this conclusion was not borne out
by Class B, where the temperature was slightly higher. Without
pretending to say that the evidence advanced is of any real import
ance, depending as it does on single observations encumbered with
their private peculiarities, we may note that it would not be at all
unlikely for velocities measured as we measured these to have large
positive temperature coefficients.       There is every reason to suppose
that under the conditions of our experiments the viscosity of the
water will be an important factor in determining the rate of decay of
the disturbance as it is propagated outwards.             Now, of all the
physical properties of water, viscosity    is the   one which varies most
rapidly with temperature, and, consequently, it is not unlikely that
the decay of amplitude, and hence velocity in the disturbance, may
depend to a great extent on the temperature.
   In addition to the wave of great amplitude whose velocity has
formed the subject of this paper, there are, in all probability, waves
of varying degrees of amplitude and velocity resulting from the
explosion.       These waves, together with the final group, having
 practically the velocity of sound do not, at present, present any
features of particular interest

" The Ferment-action of Bacteria." By T. LAUDER BRUNTON,
    M.D., F.R.S., and A. Macfadyen, M.D., B.Sc. Received
    March 23,—Read April 4, 1889.
  In the    course of the research the following                micro-organisms were
used: —
  1.    Koch's         comma      spirillum   (Pliigge,   'Die Mikro-organismen,'
          Leipzig, 1886, p. 334).
  2.    Finkler's comma spirillum             (FlUgge,    '
                                                              Die Mikro-organismen,'
           Leipzig, 1886, p. 382).
  3.   A   putrefactive micrococcus.
  4. Scurf hacillus            (Klein).
  5.   A   bacillus isolated from milk by Dr. Klein, which                     for con
           venience we may call the
                                    " Welford Bacillus."
  All   of these liquefy gelatine, the two last most energetically.
Anthrax was not used, on account of the resistance of its spores and
the consequent difficulty of completely sterilising the culture media.
The experiments were made in each case with pure cultures.
   The first question which we tried to solve was, What is the nature
of the substance by which bacteria liquefy gelatine ? Is it an enzyme ?
There are two ways in which they might do this.                They might
secrete some fluid which would dissolve the gelatine mechanically,
without altering it chemically, as saliva dissolves sugar in the month ; or
they might do it by secreting a specific enzyme, which would dissolve
the gelatiue by altering it chemically, as the ptyalin of the saliva
effects the solution of starch.     If the solution were effected in the
first way by the secretion of a mere solvent, we should expect that
when the microbes were removed or destroyed, either by heat or
chemical means, the portion of the medium already dissolved would
not have any extensive action on fresh media.            But if it had any
such solvent   action, it would probably continue    after the solution had
been heated to a temperature sufficient to destroy the action of an
enzyme.    If, on the other hand, the microbes liquefied the media by
secreting an enzyme, we should expect that the liquefied portion
would probably dissolve a considerable amount of new medium when
added to     it,
              but that its solvent action would be arrested by exposure
to a temperature sufficient to inhibit enzyme action.
   The culture medium was made by adding to meat broth gelatine,           :
10 per cent.    peptone,
                   ;        per cent. and sodic chloride, 0'5 per cent.
                                  1            ;
The reaction was rendered faintly alkaline with carbonate of soda.
In all the experiments Koch's methods to ensure sterile media and
pure cultures were followed out.

                       The Ferment-action   of  Bacteria.                 543
   Tubes of      10  per cent, gelatine were inoculated with the five
microbes, and placed in the incubator at 37° C, with the exception of
the putrefactive micrococcus, which was kept at 22° C.
   When liquefaction was complete the fluid was filtered into sterile
tubes, the bacterial deposit being washed with a small quantity of
sterile distilled water.
   Of the filtrate, one, three, and five drops were added respectively
to fresh gelatine, and the tubes placed in the incubators as before.
The gelatine liquefied, and in all cases bacteria were present.
   This liquefied gelatine was in its turn taken and subjected to a
temperature of 50° C. for one hour. Then one, three, and five drops
were added to fresh gelatine. After incubating, some of the cholera
comma tubes did not liquefy, but in all cases where liquefaction took
place it was due to the active bacteria, as proved by their growth on
control plates.      The control plates were made by adding a few
drops of the liquefied gelatine to fresh gelatine, and pouring it out in
a sterile glass dish.       After incubating at 22° C, the gelatine was
examined microscopically, and the presence or absence of bacterial
colonies noted.
   The liquefied gelatine was next subjected to a temperature of
100° C.   for fifteen minutes. The same number of drops were added
to gelatine. This fresh gelatine did not liquefy.        Finally, 6 c.c. were
added to fresh gelatine, but still it did not liquefy.
   The control plates showed no colonies.
   We therefore conclude that exposure to a temperature of (I)
100° C.   destroys—
                    (a.) The bacteria.
                    (6.) The liquefying power of the fluid.
(II)  50° C. does    neither.   It was not deemed advisable to continue
the sterilisation too long, having regard to the injurious action of heat
on soluble ferments.
   It was next necessary to determine the temperatures between 50" C.
and 100° C, which would be sufficient to kill the bacteria without
rendering any ferment which might exist inactive. A series of
experiments led to the following results : —
   60° C.  for half an hour killed Koch's and Finkler's spirillum.
   75° C. for fifteen minutes, on two successive days, killed the scurf
      and
           " Welford " bacilli.
   70" C. for fifteen minutes, on two successive        days, destroyed   the
     putrefactive micrococcus.
   Having established      these facts, a series of cultures at 37° C. were
made in small glass flasks, each containing about 100 c.c. of 10 per
cent, gelatine.     The liquefied gelatine was filtered, and the deposit
washed with sterile distilled water.

  These filtrates from the five series of cultures were sterilised as
described above.    Then 5 — 10 c.c. of each were added to 10 per cent.
gelatine (20 c.c.) and kept at 37° C, as well as control tubes of sterile
gelatine.
   On the third day the tubes were removed from the incubator and
placed in ice-cold water.
   Results : —
   Scurf bacillus      f The gelatine does not stiffen, but remains
   Welford bacillus   \     liquid.
   Koch's spirillum       f The gelatine is semi-liquid, and does not
   Finkler's spirillum    \    completely re-gelatinise.

   Control plates.    No bacteria.
   Kept at the ordinary room temperature, these phenomena persisted,
the liquid gelatine remaining liquid, and the solid gelatine not lique
fying.
   Here, then, we have complete liquefaction of the gelatine produced
in the first two cases, partial liquefaction in the next two, and no
effect in the last.
   That this liquefaction was brought about without the presence of
active bacteria is proved by the fact that control plates inoculated
from the liquefied gelatine remained sterile. The complete lique
faction was produced by the sterile fluid from the microbes which
were more active liquefiers of gelatine than the others.        In the case
of the two comma spirilla the enzyme action in gelatine was
evidently more feeble.         The negative result with the putrefactive
 micrococcus, and also the fact that tubes inoculated from    it, and kept
 at the optimum temperature of 22° C, also gave negative results,
 were probably due to the preliminary sterilisation having destroyed
 both the microbes and any enzyme which they might have formed.
   These introductory experiments led to the following conclusions —  :
   1.  100° C. destroyed both the bacteria and the liquefying power.
   2. 50° destroyed neither the bacteria nor the liquefying power.
   3. Temperatures between 60° and 75° C. destroyed the bacteria,
 but not the liquefying power in four cases.
   4. The liquefied gelatine treated as under      3,   and added to fresh
 gelatine, liquefied it, although active bacteria were proved to be
absent.
   5. The liquefaction must, we think, be due to a soluble enzyme,
inasmuch as liquefaction still took place after the elimination of the
microbes, while  it was prevented by exposure to such a temperature
as would   destroy the  activity of an enzyme but would not be likely
to affect the action of   simple solvent.

    Having regard to the fact that the peptonising action in gela
tine was slow, and in two cases partial, it was next sought to de
termine whether more active liquefaction of the gelatine could                    be
obtained by growing the microbes in some other albumenoid soil.
    Two culture fluids were made with meat broth as follows : —
         A. Meat broth —                     B. Meat broth —
              Peptone, 1 per cent.                    NaCl 0'5 per cent.
              NaCl      0-5     „
   Both were rendered faintly alkaline with the carbonate of soda.
    The bacteria grew well in both of these media, and so rapidly and
abundantly in B. that further experiments were made with it only,
i.e., without peptones.        For each culture, 100 c.c. meat broth were
used.     After inoculation and four days' incubation at 37° C, the
broth was filtered, and the bacterial deposit washed with sterile
distilled water.      It was then sterilised as already described, and
10 c.c. added to tubes of 10 per cent, gelatine.                  These tubes were
placed in the incubator, as well as control tubes of sterile gelatine.
When taken out, and placed in ice-cold water, the fallowing results
were obtained     : —

    From these experiments it will be seen that the enzyme developed
in meat broth is more active than that formed in gelatine.                         In
 twenty-four    hours   the gelatine   was   liquefied     by the scurf  and Welford
 bacilli ; in forty-eight hours by Koch's and Finkler's comma spirilla.
 Again the putrefactive micrococcus gave negative results.
    Conclusions : —
    1. An enzyme is formed in meat broth which liquefies gelatine,

 546             Dns.   T. L. Brunton and A. Macfadyen.
 and does so more surely and quickly than the enzyme                formed  in
 gelatine itself.
    2.  The liquefaction is produced by a soluble ferment, since its
 action can be demonstrated apart from the microbes which pro
 duce it.
                                      III.
    Instead of using heat sterilisation some experiments were made
 with menthol and thymol.
   It was found that when these substances were added in amounts
sufficient to prevent the growth of the bacteria — the ferment action
 was likewise inhibited.
                                      IV.
   The presence of a soluble ferment being            demonstrated,    can we
isolate   it ?
   (1.) From gelatine.
   (2.) From meat broth.
                         (1.) From Gelatine Cultures.
   Flasks containing 250 c.c. of 10 per cent. gelatine were inoculated
with the five microbes.       They were left in the incubator at 47° C,
(putrefactive micrococcus, 32° C), till liquefaction was complete.
The liquefied gelatine was treated with absolute alcohol and filtered.
The precipitate was extracted with glycerine, and finally repre-
cipitated with alcohol. The precipitate, after drying in a sterilised
flask, was taken up in a small quantity of sterile distilled water, and
allowed to stand over night. About 5 c.c. were then added to 10 per
cent, gelatine, and incubated at 37° C.
   Results. — Negative. No liquefaction was produced.
                           (2.) Meat Broth Cultures.
   In    each case 250 c.c. were     treated   in a similar manner — with
alcohol and glycerine, and the precipitate and sterile distilled water
added to 10 per cent. gelatine.

the action of the enzyme, a modification of the process was next
made in the following manner : — 500 c.c. of meat broth were inocu
lated with the microbes, and left in the incubator for seven days.
The precipitate, with an excess of alcohol, was allowed to stand
overnight, and, after drying, was dissolved in sterile distilled water,
and then reprecipitated by alcohol.         This precipitate was dried and
taken up in distilled water.        The next day about 20 c.c. were added
to 100 c.c. of a 5 per cent, gelatine, and placed in the incubator at
37° C.
    Results after four days : —
    The only positive results were obtained with the scurf bacillus and
the Welford bacillus.      In these cases the gelatine remained liquid,
while the control gelatine resolidified. The control plates gave no
colonies.
    Conclusion. — The bacteria     do form a soluble enzyme which can be
isolated,  and its action demonstrated on albnmenoid gelatine.
    Are the microbes which liquefy gelatine capable of exerting a like
action on other proteid bodies ?
    To test this, experiments were made with —
                              (a.) Egg-albumen.
                              (6.) Fibrin.
    In the first place, it was necessary to find out what resulted from
the direct action of the microbes.
    Faintly alkaline meat broth,     as developing the most active enzyme,
was used.
                              (a.) Egg Albumen.
    To flasks containing      100  c.c. of meat broth   were added small
 pieces of coagulated egg albumen.         The flasks were then sterilised
and inoculated with Koch's spirillum, Finkler's spirillum, the scurf
 and Welford bacilli.     They were then placed in the incubator at
37° C.

   To 100 c.c. of the meat broth small pieces of boiled fibrin were
added, and after sterilisation the flasks were inoculated with the same

albumen and fibrin, as well as on gelatine.
                                       VI.
   Can we demonstrate the action of the enzyme on proteid bodies
such as egg albumen and fibrin, in the same way that its action was
demonstrated      on gelatine  ?
   The alcoholic precipitate from 500 c.c. of the meat broth culture
whs dried at 35°     C, and then dissolved in sterile distilled water. It
was then reprecipitated by alcohol and filtered.      This precipitate was
dried in sterile plugged flasks, and to it were added 50 c.c. of sterile

distilled water, and 5 c.c. of a | per cent, chloroform water.         Car
bonate of soda was finally added to render the fluid faintly alkaline.
   In each flask was placed a small piece of boiled fibrin. After four
days in the incubator they were taken out and examined : —
   A. From each, gelatine plate cultures were made.
   B. The appearance of the fibrin was noted.
   C. After filtration the filtrate was tested for digestive products.
   A. Some of the plates showed bacteria.         The flasks from which
these had    been  made   were rejected;   only those were used which
had remained sterile.
   B. In none did the fibrin break up and disappear.       But it became
thinned and frayed at the edges. This was most marked with the
scurf and Welford bacilli.
   C. The filtrate was examined for soluble products : —
   On neutralising with dilute hydrochloric acid a precipitate ap
peared.    This was filtered off and the filtrate tested for peptones.
A solution of caustic soda was added, and then a highly dilute solution
of cupric sulphate was filtered down the side of the test tube. At the
line of demarcation the rose-coloured peptone reaction was strongly
marked.
   The simple boilel solution of the ferment only gave the faintest
peptone reaction.
   These results were obtained with the scurf and Welford bacilli,
and Koch's and Finkler's spirillum.      To sum up :—
   1. The fibrin was visibly affected.
   2. Neutralisation produced a precipitate.
   3. The peptone reaction was very distinct.
   The enzyme therefore, apart from the bacteria, can form soluble
products from fibrin, and amongst these peptones.
                                    VII.
   Are the microbes capable of forming a diastatis, as well     as a pep-
tonising ferment   ?

   Starch was heated with water so as to form a thin paste. To this
was added sodic chloride (05 per cent.). About 100 c.c. were placed
in each flask, which was then plugged with cotton wool and
sterilised.
   After inoculation they were placed in the incubator (S7° C.) along
 with flasks of sterile starch paste.
   Flasks were opened on successive days and examined : —

                      as follows : —
        (1 .) Iodine. — No reaction.
        (2.)  Caustic soda. — On gently boiling fluid becomes yellow.
        (3.)  Cupric sulphate and caustic soda. — A yellow precipitate on
                boiling.
        (4.)  Fehling's reagent. — A red precipitate.
        (5.)  Barfoed's reagent. — No reaction on gently heating.
    (Barfoed's    Solution : — One part of neutral acetate of copper dissol veil
in 15 parts       of water, and then to 200 c.c., 5 c.c. of acetic acid
(38 per cent.) added.)
   The control starch gave blue colour with iodine, but none of the
above reactions.
   B. Putrefactive micrococcus —
         Results were negative.
    C. Koch's spirillum.
          Finkler's spirillum : —¦
   The same starch solution was used, but a few drops of meat broth
were       added in each case.        The usual control experiments were
made     : —
   3rd day.       Starch lias lost its opalescence.     Iodine strikes a blue
                     colour.
   4th day.      Iodine gives a violet colour.
   5th day.      Iodine gives red reaction.
   7th day.      Iodine. — Red.
                 Caustic soda. — Yellow on boiling.
                 Cupric sulphate and caustic soda. — No reduction.
                 Fehling's solution. — No reduction. On previous addi
                     tion of H2S04 a slight reduction.
                 Barfoed's reagent. — No reduction.
                 Control starch. — Iodine strikes blue.
   From these experiments the following conclusions may be
drawn : —
   1. The putrefactive micrococcus did not grow on the carbohydrate
soil, and so we are left in doubt as to its diastatic action.
   2. The scurf bacillus and Welford bacillus were both capable of
cultivation, and evinced a marked diastatic action, in addition to
their peptonising power.           The failure of the iodine test, and the

                     The Fermmt-action    of Bacteria.                551
 precipitates obtained with Fchling, &c., indicate the presence of a
 reducing sugar.     The failure with Barfoed's reagent suggests that
 the sugar is in great part, at any rate, maltose.
    3. With regard to Koch's spirillum and Finkler's, though they
•evinced a diastatic action, it was feebler than in the former case,
 only traces of a reducing sugar being detected after the addition of
 sulphuric acid.   The red and violet coloration with iodine points to
 the formation of dextrin (erythro- and achroo-dextrin).
    At any rate, in the scurf and Welford bacilli we have two microbes
 which evince a marked diastatic action ; and a demonstration of the
 fact that the same germ can produce both a diastatic and a
 peptonising ferment.
                                    VIII.
    Can we demonstrate the action of the diastatic enzyme apart from
 the bacteria ?
    Starch cultures of the scurf bacillus and the Welford bacillus (two
 days' growth) were treated with chloroform water (1 per cent.) till
 they became sterile.
    The fluid was then added to fresh starch, and incubated at 37° C.
    In eight to ten days the iodine reaction had disappeared.         On
 boiling with caustic soda the fluid became yellow. Fehling's solution
 was reduced.     The fluid lost its opalescence.    Control plates — no
 growth.
    These experiments point strongly to the existence of a diastatic
 enzyme capable of isolation, and of acting apart from the bacteria.
                                    IX.
    That the peptonising enzyme bears the closest analogy to the
 pancreatic ferment will be seen from the following experiments.
 Sterile meat broth, in which Finkler's spirillum and the Welford
 bacillus had been cultivated, was added to 10 per cent. gelatine tubes
 of differing reaction : —
                          Gelatine.                      Results.

     D. Boiled after adding the ferment              No liquefaction.
   The digestive   action of the microbes was tested on several other
 bodies.

 552             Drs. T. L. Brunton and A. Macfadyen.
    1. Fats. —Alkaline meat broth and olive oil, 2 per cent.
   The results were negative.
   Experiments which were made by Manfredi* tend to show that fat-
containing media impair the vegetative energy of bacteria.
   2. Dextrose. — The culture fluid was prepared as follows : —
                      Dextrose                   2 per cent.
                      Peptone                    1        „

                      Reaction                   Neutral.
   After sterilisation, the flasks        were    inoculated with the scurf
bacillus and Welford bacillus.            Incubated at 37° C. They were
examined on the fourth day.
   Pehling's solution was no          longer reduced.          The fluid gave a
marked acid reaction.
   The control solution reduced Fehling's solution.                  Reaction was
unchanged.
   3.  Cane-sugar.  — Cane-sugar,     2 per cent.
                       Peptone,    1 per cent.
                       NaCl,  0"5   per cent.
                       Reaction, neutral.
   Inoculated with scurf bacillus and Welford bacillus, and incubated
at 37° C.
   The results were negative.        No reducing sugar detected.
   Muscle. — Alkaline meat broth cultures were used.                     Inoculated
with Finkler's spirillum and Welford bacillus.
   With the Welford bacillus a marked effect — the muscular tissue
becomes disintegrated, and the stri» indistinct.
   These experiments, though incomplete in themselves, are sufficient
to show that the bacteria which liquefy gelatine and diastase starch,
can also exert a digestive influence on dextrose and muscle.                    The
exact determination of the products of this action in the case of
these and some other organic bodies must be reserved for further
investigation.
   To sum up briefly the results of this inquiry : —
   1. The bacteria which liquefy gelatine do so by means of a soluble
enzyme.
   2.  This enzyme can be isolated, and its peptonising action demon
strated apart from the microbes which produce it.
   3. The most active enzyme is that formed in meat broth.
   4. Acidity hinders, alkalinity favours its action.
   5. The bacteria which form a peptonising enzyme on proteid soil
can also produce a diastatic enzyme on carbohydrate soil.

   6. The   diastatic enzyme is not so readily separated from the
microbes which produce it, but where that has been accomplished its
action on starch can still be demonstrated.
   7. The diastatic enzyme has no effect on gelatine, and vice versa.
   8. The bacteria are capable of evincing an adaptiveness to the
soil in which they grow.
   9. The microbes are capable of digesting other similar bodies
such as dextrose and muscle.
   10.  Fatty matter was not affected.
