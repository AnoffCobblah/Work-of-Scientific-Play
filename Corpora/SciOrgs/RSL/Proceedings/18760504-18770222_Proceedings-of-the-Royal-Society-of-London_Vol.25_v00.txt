for health, taking the carbonic acid
                                   as the measure.    The results showed
that the mean amount of carbonic acid as respiratory impurity in air un-
distinguishable by the sense of smell from fresh external air was under
0-2000 per 1000 volumes *. My object in the present note is to call
attention to the relative effects of temperature and humidity upon the
condition of air, as calculated from the same observations.
   If we adopt the figures of Class No. 1 (that is " fresh," or not differ
ing sensibly from the external air) we find the following                                    :   —
      Temperature.                           Humidity.                          Carbonic acid.

If,now, we arrange the observations according as they differ from the
above standard of temperature and humidity, and note the record of
sensation attached to each, we may ascertain how far the said record
departs (if at all) from what it ought to have been as calculated from the
actual COa. To do this we may employ the numerical values of the
different classes, taking No.                     1   (fresh)     as   unity, thus   :   —

Taking each observation and dividing the C02 found by the mean quan
tity of No. 1, viz. 0-1943, we get a number which will give the theore
tical value of its effect upon the se nes ; and by comparing this with
the actual value of the recorded sensation, we can note whether the
difference is plus or minus, if any. All observed quantities of CO below
0-1943 are considered     equal to that number, and all quantities above
0-9054 as equal to it, as the sense of smell does not seem capable of
differentiating quantities except between those limits.
   Out of 458 fully recorded cases, 186 gave a recorded sensation in excess
of the theoretical value — that                       is,

   The paper contains the results of an exact series of measurements of
the absorption-spectra      of the vapours of the element bromine and of
the compound iodine monochloride, made with the object of ascertaining
whether    the molecules of these two gases vibrate identically or similarly,
their molecular weights and colour of the vapours being almost identical.
The two spectra, which are both channelled, were compared simultane
ously by means of one of Kirchhofi's 4-prism spectroscopes, the position
of the lines being read off by reflection on an arbitrary scale.    In order
to determine the wave-lengths of these bands, the wave-length of each
of 27 air-lines lying between the extremes of the absorption-spectra was
ascertained by reference to Thalen's numbers ; whilst for the purpose of
reducing the readings of the absorption-bands to wave-lengths a graphical
method was employed, the details of which are given in the paper. This
method appears to be one of general applicability for the plotting of
spectra.
   Tables then follow giving the wave-lengths of 66 bands of each
absorption-spectrum ; and a map accompanies the text in which the bands
are drawn to a scale one half that of Angstrom's " Spectre Normal."
   A careful comparison of these Tables and of the map shows that, al
though both spectra contain a large number of lines which are nearly
coincident,    the spectra as a whole are not identical, either when the
vapours are examined at high or low temperatures, or when the lengths
of the columns of absorbing gas are varied.

V. "On the Origin of Windings of Rivers in Alluvial Plains, with
       Remarks on the Flow of Water round Bends in Pipes." By
       Professor James Thomson, LL.D., F.R.S.E.             Communicated
       by Prof. Sir William Thomson, F.R.S.            Received March 14,
       1876.
    In respect to the origin of the windings of rivers flowing through al
luvial plains, people have usually taken the rough notion that when there
is a bend in any way commenced, the water just rushes out against the
outer bank    of the river at the bend, and bo washes that bank away, and
allows deposition to occur on the inner bank, and thus makes the sinu
osity increase.     But in this they overlook the hydraulic principle, not
generally known, that a stream flowing along a straight channel and
thence into a curve must flow with a diminished velocity along the outer
bank, and an increased velocity along the inner bank, if we regard the
 flow as that oi a perfect fluid.   In  view of this principle, the question
arose   to me some vears ago : — Why does not the inner bank wear away
 more  than the onter one ?    We know by general experience and obser
 vation that  in fact the outer one does wear away, and that deposits are
 often made   along the inner one. How does this arise ?
     The explanation occurred   to me in the year 1872, mainly as follows : —
   For any lines of particles taken across the stream at different places, as

  6                       Prof.    J. Thomson on the Origin         of     ,       [May 4,
  A,B,, A,B4, &c. in fig. 2, and which may be designated in general as
  AB, if the line be level, the water-pressure must be increasing from A
  to B, on account of the centrifugal force of the particles composing that
  line or bar of water ; or, what comes to the same thing, the water-
  surface of the river will have a transverse inclination rising from A to
  B. The water in any stream-line CD E* at or near the surface, or in
  any case not close to the bottom, and flowing nearly along the inner bank,
  will not accelerate itself in entering on the bend, except in consequence
  of its having a fall of free level in passing along that stream-linet.
       But the layer of water along the bottom, being by friction much re
  tarded, has much          less   centrifugal force in any bar of its particles ex
  tending across the river ; and consequently it will flow sidewise along
  the bottom towards the inner bank, and will, port of it at least, rise up
  between the stream-line and the inner bank, and will protect the bank
  from the rapid scour of that stream-line and of other adjacent parts of
  the rapidly flowing current ; and as the sand and mud in motion at the
  bottom are carried in that bottom layer, they will be in some degree
  brought in to that inner bank, and may have a tendency to be deposited
  there.
      On the other band, along the outer bank there will be a general ten
  dency to descent of surface-water which will have a high velocity, not
 having been much impeded by friction ; and this will wear away the
     *  This, although here conveniently spoken of as a stream-line, is not to be supposed
 as liaving really a steady flow.     It may be conceived of as an average stream-line in a
 plnce   where  the flow is  disturbed with eddies or by the surrounding water commingling
 with it.
    t It must be here explained that by the/r« level for any particle is to be understood
 the level of the atmospheric end of a column, or of any bar, straight or curved, of par
 ticles of statical water, having one end situated at the level of the particle, and having
at that end the same pressure an the particle ha», and having the other end consisting
of a level surface of water freely exposed to the atmosphere, or else having otherwise
atmospheric pressure there ; or, briefly, we may say that the/rce level for any particle of
water is the level of the atmospheric end of its pressure-column,       or of an equivalent
ideal pressure-column.

 bank and carry the worn substance in a great degree down to the bottom,
 where, as explained before, there will be a general prevailing tendency
 towards the inner bank.
    Xow, further, it seems that even from the very beginning of the curve
forward there will thus be a considerable protection to the inner bank.
Because a surface stream-line C D, or one not close to the bottom, flowing
along the bank which in the bend becomes the inner bank, will tend to
depart from the inner bank at D, the commencement of the bend, and to go
forward along D E, or by some such course, leaving the space G between it
and the bank to be supplied by slower-moving water which has been moving
along the bottom of the river perhaps by some such oblique path as the
dotted line F G.
    It is further to be observed that ordinarily or very frequently there
will be detritus travelling down stream along the bottom and seeking for
resting-places, because the cases here specially under consideration are
only such as occur in alluvial plains ; and in regions of that kind there is
ordinarily*, on the average, more deposition than erosion. This consi
deration explains that we need not have to seek for the material for de
position on the inner bank in the material worn away from the outer
 bank of the same bend of the river.           The material worn from the outer
 bank may have to travel a long distance down stream before finding an
 inner bank of a bend on which to deposit itself.           And now it seems very
 clear that in the gravel, sand, and mud carried down stream along the
 bottom of the river to the place where the bend commences, there is an
 ample supply of detritus for deposition on the inner bank of the river even
 at the earliest points in the curve which will offer any resting-place.          It is
 especially worthy of notice that the oblique flow along the bottom to
 wards the inner bank begins even up stream from the bend, as already
 explained, and as shown by the dotted line F G in fig. 3. The transverse
 movement comprised in this oblique flow is instigated by the abatement
 of pressure, or lowering of free level, in the water along the inner bank
 produced by centrifugal force in the way already explained.
    It may now be remarked that the considerations which have in the
 present   paper been adduced in respect to the mode of flow of water
 round a bend of a river, by bringing under notice, conjointly, the lower
 ing of free level of the water at and near the inner bank, and the raising
 of free level of the water at and near the outer bank relatively to the free
 level of the water at middle of the stream, and the effect of retardation
 of velocity in the layer flowing along the bed of the channel in diminishing
 the centrifugal force in the layer retarded, and so causing that retarded
 water, and also frictionally retarded water, even in a straight channel of
 approach to the bend, to flow obliquely towards the inner bank, tend very
   • That is to gay, exeept when by geological changes the causes which have been pro
 ducing the alluvial plain have become extinct, and erosion by the river has come to
 predominate over deposition.

        produced by Injury"*.               By G. J. ROMANES, M.A., F.L.S.
        Communicated by          Prof.   SANDERSON,      M.D., F.R.S. Received
        April 13, 1876.
    § 1.   If  the gastrocnemius of a frog be placed in a horizontal direction
on non-polarizable electrodes with its convex surface uppermost, one
may generally observe that the muscle is somewhat more sensitive to
minimal       stimulation,   supplied by closure of the constant current, when
the femoral      end  rests  on the kathode, than when this end rests on the
anode. Conversely, under similar circumstances the gastrocnemius is
 more sensitive to minimal stimulation, supplied by opening of the con
 stant current, when the femoral end rests on the anode, than when this
end rests on the kathode.          In   view of the other facts of electrotonus, the
present ones are of interest        ; because, as the sciatic nerve enters the gas
trocnemius near        the  femoral    end of the latter, and then spreads out its
peripheral ramifications as it advances, in the experiments just mentioned
one electrode is in almost immediate contact with the nerve-trunk where
it enters the muscle, while the other electrode supports the part of the
muscle that contains only peripheral nervous elements.                  It is therefore
 to be expected, upon the theory of electrotonus, that the muscle under
 these conditions should prove itself most sensitive to the closing shock'
 when the nerve-trunk rests on the kathode, and most sensitive to the
 opening shock when the nerve-trunk rests on the anode.
     It is to be observed, however, that although this expectation is in most
 cases fulfilled, it is not so invariably.         Different gastrocnemius muscles,
 though treated as far as possible in exactly the same way, manifest con
 siderable differences, both in their general sensitiveness to electrical sti
 mulation, and in their relative sensitiveness to interruptions of the ascend
 ing and of the descending currents.            Even the same muscle, if rapidly
 prepared,      will generally  be found   to undergo fluctuations in these respects
 from minute to minute.          Attributing this fact to the unnatural conditions
 which the experiment imposed on the process of nutrition,                  I conducted
 some observations on muscles while they were still attached to the body

    § 2.   If  the gastrocnemius of a frog be placed on non-polarizable elec
trodes in the position already described in § 1, and if care has been taken
not to injure the attached sciatic nerve,                   I   find that upon now dividing
this nerve, either near or just within the muscle, remarkable alterations
ensue, not only, as is already known, in the general sensitiveness of the
muscle, but also, and more particularly, in its relative sensitiveness to
make and to break of the current.                    The following are the mean results
yielded by a large number of experiments : —

from the femoral to the tarsal end of the gastrocnemius, and " ascending,"
of course, passage of the current in the opposite direction.                            " Cutting "
means section of the sciatic nerve just after it enters the muscle ; and the
numbers represent the relative sensitiveness of the muscle to the stimuli
which are indicated above them*.                     I  have appended a diagram (p. 11),
   * The numbers are thus obtained : — Suppose A to be the battery, B a set of                  resist
ance-coils, C a rbeochord, D a commutator, and E the muscle.                    By removing     a plug
from   B the resistance    is increased,    and theretore   the current through E is diminished.
But the   effect of removing      a plug     from C, although likewise that of increasing the
resistance through the whole circuit, is to augment the current passing through E.
 For, previous to removing a plug from C, the current branched at x, and the resistance

  which    is intended       to represent, in a graphic form, the numerical re
  lations set forth in the above Table.                In each couplet contained in that
  diagram     the   left-hand    line   represents the sensitiveness of the muscle
  to the stimulus        indicated before        cutting, while the right-hand line re
  presents the sensitiveness        of  the  muscle    to the same stimulus after cutting.
  As in the Table, so in the diagram, all the proportions are referred to the
  ascending break as to a unit — this being the stimulus to which the
  muscle is least sensitive, and for which, therefore, the strongest current
 i s required in order to elicit a contraction.
     With regard to these results,            I  may offer the following observations.
  In the first place, it is evident that the increase of excitability shown by
  the muscle after cutting is affected to an extraordinary extent by the
  direction of the current ; and, further, that the manner in which it is so
  affected is very instructive when considered in relation to the known facta
  of electrotonus.        For just as before cutting the normal sensitiveness of the
  muscle is greatest to the closing excitation when its femoral end (or nerve-
  trunk) rests on the kathode, and to the opening excitation when this end
  rests on the anode, so after the general sensitiveness has been exalted
  by cutting the exaltation shows itself in a far higher degree to the closing
  excitation when the femoral end (or severed nerve-trunk) rests on the
 kathode, and to the opening excitation when this end rests on the anode.
 Thus it is that the curves in figs. 2 and 3 are so much steeper than those in
  figs. 1 and 4. The only fact, then, that does not seem to admit of any very
 satisfactory explanation is the altogether disproportionate increase of ex
 citability which the muscle after cutting exhibits to the descending
 break (fig. 3) as compared with the ascending make (fig. 2).                    This fact,
 therefore, led to the following experiments.
     § 3. Dr. Burdon Sanderson suggested that if we suppose the breaking
 excitation to be of a more instantaneous nature than the making one, the
fact in question might admit of a probable explanation ; for in this case
 the breaking stimulus would bear more resemblance to an induction-
 shock than would the making stimulus; and as it is well known how sen
 sitive nerve is to the induction-shock, we might reasonably conclude that,
 when the sensitiveness of the nerve is increased by section, it would
 in  E being high as compared with that in C, the principal part of the current takes the
course x, y, C,   A. But if a plug be removed from C, the resistance in C is increased,
and a proportional amount of the current takes the direction x, t, E, A. Hence the
effect of removing a plug from B is that of diminishing the current in E, while the op
posite effect results on removing a plug from C.
    Such being the apparatus, in all my experiments        I removed one plug from B, and
thus worked with a current of constant intensity so far as the whole circuit was con
cerned.    The requisite variations in the intensity of the stimuli were, of course, effected
by the rheochord C.        Now the numbers in the above Table are obtained by a very
simple calculation.      Suppose, for instance, that the minimal ascending break contraction
requires 18  ohms'  resistance to be thrown into the rheochord, while the minimal ascending
make only requires '5 to be thrown in, then the relative sensitiveness of the muscle to the
ascending break and make would be approximately represented by the numbers 1 : 36.

  probably become more than proportionally increased to the more sudden
 stimulus.    In order to test the correctness of this hypothesis, Dr.
 Sanderson further suggested that the period of the muscle's latent stimu
 lation before and after cutting should be taken, and also that the follow
 ing experiment should be tried.       By means of an appropriate apparatus,

the uncut muscle was to have supplied to it a galvanic stimulus of mea
sured duration ; and this duration was to be graduated down to the point at
which the break succeeded the make with a rapidity just sufficiently great
to prevent the muscle from responding to either stimulus.          The strength
of the current remaining unaltered, the nerve was then to be cut through
at the usual place ; and, lastly, it was to be observed whether or not the
muscle was thus rendered more sensitive to stimuli of short duration.         So
far as this part of the inquiry has as yet proceeded, the results are as follow.
    Section of the nerve (either just above the knee or immediately after

  12                         Mr. G.   J.  Romanes on the                  [May 4,
 it enters the muscle) is in all      cases attended   with a marked increase of
 sensibility to stimuli of short duration ; i. «. stimuli of much shorter
 duration are able to evoke responsive contractions in the muscle after
 cutting than are required to do so before cutting. At first, therefore, it
 seemed that this experiment was confirmatory of the hypothesis which it
 was designed to test.        This, however, is not so ; for it was observed that
 the increased sensitiveness in question was only shown when the femoral
 end of the muscle rested on the kathode, while it was scarcely, if at all,
 apparent when this end rested on the anode. This fact, of course, led to
 the inference that the augmented excitability to stimuli of short duration
 had reference, not to the opening, but to the closing excitation.         Accord
 ingly  I  fitted up  an appropriate arrangement     of wires and keys, by which  I
 could at pleasure throw in ordinary opening and closing excitations, or the
 closing and opening excitations of short duration. In this way        it was eaay,
 by comparing in the two cases the nature of the contractions            (which in
 almost every muscle presents some idiosyncratic differences on make and
 break), to obtain an optical proof that my inference was correct.             The
 exalted    sensitiveness  of  the muscle after section of its nerve to stimuli of
 short duration had reference exclusively to the closing excitation.
     This fact is of interest in itself, but it fails to answer the question as
 to why section of a nerve causes so disproportionate an effect on its sen
 sitiveness in the muscle to the excitation which is supplied by the
 descending break.          Nor have     I any satisfactory answer to give to
 this question, unless the following consideration may be deemed so.
 Before section of the sciatic nerve, the gastrocnemius muscle is im
 mensely more sensitive to the ascending make than to the descending
 break (figs. 2 and 3, left-hand lines).        Consequently, when the general
 sensitiveness of the nerve is increased by section, the increase has not
 so much room (so to speak)         for its occurrence in the one   case as in the
 other.     Seeing that the minimal make contraction occurs at a point so
much     nearer   to zero of the current's intensity than does the minimal
break contraction, when both these minimals are reduced still further by
nerve-section, the latter minimal has a much wider range through which
it is free to fall than has the former.        Of course this fact need not pre
vent the lesser fall from being numerically proportional to the greater
one, however small the observed differences may be. The question, how
ever, is as to how far a strictly numerical proportion is in this case a fair
one.     I  think we must certainly hold that the value as a stimulus of any.
given increment of current is determined by the proportion which such
increment bears to the intensity of current that is required to produce
adequate stimulation.        In other words, any given unit of electrical inten
sity  has   more   influence  as an excitant if added to a current of a small
number of units (a weak current) than if added to a current of a large
number of units (a strong current). But if this is so, it follows that
subtraction of a unit from a strong current must have less effect than

 1876.]                  Excitability of Motor Nerves.                        13
subtraction    of the   same    unit from    a weak  current.   Now when the
general  excitability of the muscle is raised by cutting, the effect is that the
muscle is able, both     in the case of the ascending make and in that of de
scending break, to afford (as it were) to part with some units of the stimu
lating influence which were previously required to cause adequate stimu
lation. Hence, forasmuch as the sum of such units which it had to spare
before cutting was so much less in the case of the make than in that of the
break, in the case of the make each unit must have been of a correspond
ingly greater value as a stimulant.        Consequently, when both the mini-
mals are reduced by cutting, the reduction may take place in a strictly
proportional manner ; only, if the proportion has reference to the value
of the electrical units as stimulants, it follows, from what has been said,
that there will probably be no numerical proportion between the two
ratios.
    In favour of this   explanation,   it is to be remembered that, as already
 stated, nerve-section produces much more than a proportional effect in
the ascending make as compared with the descending break, in respect of
increasing the excitability of the muscle to stimuli of short duration.     It is
as though the comparatively small number of units of electrical inteusity
by which the minimal make is diminished through nerve-section represents
 a great actual increase in excitability, when this is estimated by some other
 method ;  or, to turn to the diagram, it seems as though the small distance
 through which the curve in fig. 2 passes as compared with the curve in
fig. 3 really represents     an increase of excitability much more important
 than the curve expresses : it seems as though it is just because the dif
 ficulty of ascending (so to speak) increases in so rapid a ratio as its curves
 approach    the zero level, that the steep curve of the descending break
 terminates at, or below, the point where the much less steep curve of the
 ascending make begins.         This appears to be so, because, on testing the
 increase of excitability by means of stimuli of short duration, it is found
 that the relatively low curve in fig. 2 represents what would doubtless be
 a relatively steep curve, if it were possible to institute the numerical
  comparisons in the ease of stimuli of minimal duration, as it is possible
  to do so in the case of stimuli of minimal intensity.
     These remarks, however, are only made by way of suggestion ; and           I
  confess that, a priori,  I  should certainly not have expected so great a dis
  proportion to subsist between the curves in figs. 2 and 3.
     §4. Sometimes severe section of a tolerably well-curarized muscle
  will be followed by a development of the breaking contraction treated
  of in § 2.    I attribute this fact to incomplete poisoning of the nerve-
  elements   in the muscle ; for the following experiments prove conclusively
  that in an uncurarized muscle the development of the breaking contrac
  tion after cutting is .a purely nervous effect.
     (a) Section of the sciatic nerve just above the knee causes all the
  characteristic alterations in the minimal makes and breaks, and this nearly

as well as does section of the nerve   in the muscle. Moreover the higher
up the nerve is cut, the less is the degree in which these characteristic
alterations occur, until, if the section be made at about the origin of the
femur or one third of its length lower down, no trace of these alterations
can be detected.
     (6) Stimulating the sciatic nerve with acids, alkalies, &c., and warming
it   has the same sort of effects as cutting.
  (c) Throwing the end of the sciatic nearest the gastrocnemius into
kathelectrotonus has a well-marked effect of the same kind ; while throw
ing the same part into anelectrotonus has the opposite effect, though
not in so strongly marked a degree.
  (d) Severe galvanic tetanization             of the gastrocnemius is frequently
followed by an increase of sensitiveness           to the descending break nearly
as remarkable as that which    follows cutting.  As this effect does not seem
to occur in well-curarized muscles,        I
                                         conclude that it must be due to an
increase in the excitability of the intramuscular nervous elements through
injury.
     §   5.   Another method which   I
                                   employed to test the effects of nerve-
section on excitability was one which, in the first instance,   fell upon  I
accidentally.  It consisted in joining up  the non-polarizable  electrodes
with               bridge of clay made perfectly flat on its upper surface.
          a continuous
Care being  taken to  keep this surface uniformly moist, the sciatic nerve
in a nerve-muscle preparation was laid upon it ; so that when the current
passed through the clay bridge a portion of it also passed through the
sciatic nerve, thereby stimulating the attached muscle.     The advantage
of this method consists  in the facility with which different parts of the
nerve-length may be stimulated to the exclusion of other parts.  By a
curious coincidence, Prof. Rutherford appears to have been working at
this subject at about the same time as myself, though quite independently
of me. Jt was only a few days ago that             I
                                              became aware of this fact by
                                                     '
observing an article in this month's Number of the Journal of Anatomy
and Physiology,' in which Prof. Eutherford states his methods and results.
As nearly all the. latter agree in every particular with those which                I
obtained,       I
             am now relieved from the necessity of detailing them.     It is
desirable, however, to state that, viewed in the light of my other experi
ments, these results amount to this : — When a few millimetres of nerve-
length, including the extreme nerve-section, rested on the clay, a much less
strength of current was required to produce the breaking contraction in
the muscle than when any other portion of the nerve of equal length was
allowed to rest on the clay.   That     in Prof. Eutherford's words, " the
                                            is,
striking aet, however,
          f               that without altering the strength
                           is                                  the current
                                                                      of
all the phenomena of Pfliiger's law could be obtained           by
                                                           transmitting             it
through   central,
              a    middle, or peripheral portion of nerve,  at one time in
an ascending, at another time in a descending direction."
     It   may be worth while to state, as showing the astonishing excitability

of the extreme nerve-section,       that if the nerve, while hanging in a vertical
direction over the flat surface of the clay bridge, be lowered until the sec
tion just touches the flat surface of the clay, it may frequently be ob
served that the attached muscle responds to make and to break of the
current.     Tet this must be a case of almost complete transverse stimula
tion of nerve ; for, thinking that there might possibly be some passage of
the current from the clay into the nerve in a semilenticular form,            I tried
a number of times the effect of ligaturing a nerve wi1h a fine human hair,
then with a fine pair of scissors making the transverse section as close
beneath    the ligature as possible, and, lastly, lowering the nerve-section
on the clay as before.        In no one case, however, did       I  succeed in ob
taining any      results  similar  to those  which   I  obtained  with  unligatured
nerves.     It   may be stated that in all these experiments with the clay
 bridge, I graduated     the amount of nerve-length to be laid on it by means
 of a horizontal glass rod firmly fixed to the tube of a microscope. The free
 end of the    rod was pointed, and usually passed between the tendo Achillis
 and the tibia, the latter having been previously severed at the knee.
 The sciatic nerve was thus allowed to depend in a vertical direction, and
 could be very accurately adjusted upon the clay bridge by means of the
 rack-work which moved the tube of the microscope.
     § 6. During the course of the          above   investigation concerning the
 effects of nerve-injury on excitability, several other facts of interest were
 incidentally observed.        It seems desirable, therefore, to add a brief
 account of these facts.
     When an uncurarized muscle is in a state of moderately strong tetanus
 from the passage of a rather weak galvanic current, it may occasionally
 be observed that some part or parts of the muscle begin to pulsate in a
 strictly rhythmical manner — the parts concerned alternating their periods
 of tetanus with periods of repose, sometimes at about the rate which is
  observable    in a frog's lymphatic heart, and sometimes faster.            I  have
  counted such pulsations through more than 100 revolutions, without a
  single intermission and in perfectly regular time throughout.           That this
 interesting phenomenon        is exclusively  due  to  the intramuscular    nervous
  element   is,  I think, proved by the fact that    I have never seen it to occur
  in any one of the hundreds of curarized muscles which           I  have this year
  subjected to the influence of the constant current.            Moreover, on one
  occasion    I  noticed a very good instance of rhythmical pulsation in a
  partly tetanized gastrocnemius, when         I  happened to have the attached
  sciatic on another pair of electrodes.       Of course it occurred to me to try
  the effects   of throwing the nerve near the muscle first into anelectro-
  tonus and then into kathelectrotonus.            The results were most decided.
   With a current of properly graduated intensity passing through the
   gastrocnemius, it was always quite easy to inhibit the pulsating effect in
   the muscle by throwing the attached nerve into anelectrotonus, while
   the pulsations    were always seen to recommence as soon as the polarizing

 current in the nerve was broken.              Conversely, if the nerve was thrown
 into kathelectrotonus, the pulsating effect could be produced in the
  muscle by a current of less intensity than Was required to produce this
  effect when the nerve was cither in anelectrotonus                  or in the normal
  state.
     § 7.   I  have made several experiments with the view of showing the
  major   influence     of the kathode on closing, and of the anode on opening,
 in the case of well-curarized muscle ; but on the present occasion it
 seems unnecessary to describe more than one.
     If  the curarized sartorius of a frog is placed on non-polarizable elec
 trodes, and is somewhat stretched in a longitudinal direction by means
 of two weights attached to its two ends, it may almost invariably be
 observed (especially when the contractions become sluggish by exposure
 of the muscle) that upon closure of the circuit, and during all the
 time of its passage, the substance of the muscle draws towards the
 kathode, while on the kathode itself the substance of the muscle heaps
 up and spreads out in a very beautiful and distinctive manner.                   On now
 reversing the current, all the phenomena take place in the reverse way.
 Hence, by placing any minute body anywhere on the muscle between the
 poles, this body may be seen to travel some distance towards the kathode
 every time the current is reversed.            Again, if a small transverse incision
 be made in the muscle anywhere between the poles, it gapes towards the
 kathode every time the current is reversed.              Lastly, if two appropriately
 weighted      levers be attached one to each end of the muscle, when the
current is passing in one direction the lever nearest the kathode is
 raised ; whereas when the current is reversed this lever, which is now
nearest the anode, falls, while the other lever rises.
    § 8.   If   the copper wire terminals of a Daniell's element be taken one
in each     hand,   and the strength of the current be graduated down to the
point at which minimal stimulation is obtained by placing on a fresh
muscle      first the anode and then the kathode, it may invariably be
observed that if this order is reversed, by first laying on the kathode and
then the anode, no contraction will be given unless the strength of the
current is somewhat increased.               This curious fact may be observed
equally well on curarized and on uncurarized muscles.                  It is independent
of the direction of the current, and is not affected either by insulation of
the muscle or by placing it on a gas-pipe.              The phenomenon is likewise
unaffected by placing the anode or the kathode in an unclosed circuit of
a Grove's cell upon the muscle, and then experimented with the weakened
circuit from the Daniell's cell as before. It may be observed that the
long muscles of the thigh, either in situ or excised, are best adapted for
making these experiments*.
   * Until   a short time ago I was not aware that any difference had as yet been detected
between the effects of anodic and of kathodic closure.     My attention, however, has now
been directed to the observations   of Hitzig, in which  he finds that on minimal stimulo

   After noticing the works of Quekett, J. P. Eose, Wedl, and Kolliker
on the filament-shaped parasites within recent and fossil molluscan shells
and scales, and his own researches into and descriptions of correspond
ing growths in Madreporaria from the Silurian and Tertiary rocks,
the author proceeds to explain the method of investigation employed in
the examination of recent corals.     The range of the parasites is then
stated to he, in corals from the littoral zone down to 1095 fathoms,
and from Davis Straits to the tropical coral seas, and their lowest known
temperature habitat is that of 31°-5 Fahr.
   A list of species examined is given, and then the long slender canals
with their included filamentous organisms are described.        Then the
method of entry of the growth is stated, and its relation to the organic
basis of the coral sclerenchyma is explained. The reproduction by conidia
and oospores    is also explained.   After noticing that the direction,
branching, and size of the parasites depend upon the special peculiarities
lion of the brain anodic closure is more effective       than kathodic. This, of course, is
precisely the reverse   of what   I find to be true   of  muscle ; and as the fact of such a
difference existing between the two cases is very remarkable,        I    may observe that it
appears   to confirm  Hitzig's views  concerning  the  reversed relations that subsist between
central and peripheral galvanic stimulation.
  I  may also observe that   I   have repeatedly tried whether there is any difference to
be detected    between anodic and kathodic closure in the ease of motor nerves, but
hitherto without success.      Yet, as it seemed to me very improbable that there should
be any difference between nerve and muscle in this respect,     I     had intended to investi
gate the matter still further before publishing any thing with regard to norve.        I   now
find, however, that Hitzig's results with regard to brain had induced Engesser (Pflvig.
Arch. x. p. 157 Ac.) carefully to investigate the question with regard to motor nerves ;
and the conclusion he arrives at is that no difference    can in their case be detected
between the effects   of anodic and of kathodic         Therefore, as this result agree*

       MAXWELL, F.R.S., Professor of Experimental Physics in the
       University of Camhridge.        Received March 24, 1876.
                                  (Abstract.)
    The solution of the equations of motion of      a shot is necessarily ap
proximate,    because the resistance  cannot  be expressed by a single exact
formula, and, moreover, there are very few formulae which are capable of
affording an easy solution.       The results which Hutton obtained by
means of the ballistic pendulum were exhibited in the shape of a simple
formula ; and in like manner Piobert and Didion, who also used the
ballistic  pendulum, reduced their results, and were able to give simple
formulae. No one can doubt, however, that, in point of accuracy and
extent    of information, their results are inferior to those which Mr.
Bashforth obtained by means of his chronograph and screens. Now
the formulee which Hutton and Didion gave apply only to spherical shot ;
and even for that kind of shot they do not agree with Mr. Bashforth's
results except for a limited range of velocities.    Mr. Bashforth makes no
attempt to formulate his results, but produces them in the shape of two
Tables, one for spherical shot, the other for cylindrical. The nature of
the reductions of his experiments, and the fortunate circumstance that
for a large range of values of the velocity the resistance varies nearly as
the cube of the velocity, render it convenient to express the resistance in
the form /tv*, where v is the velocity and p a variable coefficient.       In
fact, if d is the diameter of the cross section of the shot in inches, and
W its weight in lbs., the retardation due to resistance is
                                      (

where    K  is a number which is tabulated for every 10 feet of velocity.
The question, then, is to solve the problem of the motion of a shot in
conjunction and agreement with the Tables for K. The problem is a
very important one, not only to the gunner but the gun-maker, there
 being many practical questions, for example, connected with the dimen

existed an easy method of calculating ranges.      Mr. Bashforth gives one

   The first equation gives         q ;    and   it will in general be sufficient in that
equation    to put   ft=°       ,   because       the secant of a small angle      varies
slowly.    If, however, the angle of projection is large, it will be necessary
to operate twice with the equation (a), the first time to determine an
approximate value of q, the next time to determine a more accurate^ value
after having obtained an approximation to the correct value of ^. In
the (b) and (c) equations the more accurate value will be employed in
the cosine and sine, which occur as factors outside of the integrals.
   As an example of the method, take the case of a shot fired from a
38-ton gun.       The following are the data: — Diameter of shot 12-5

III.     "Condensation of Vapour of Mercury on Selenium in the
        Sprengel Vacuum."              By R. J. Moss, F.C.S., Chemical
        Laboratory, Royal           Dublin    Society.   Communicated by G.
        JOHNSTONE STONEY, F.R.S.              Received March 25, 1876.
     In the course of experiments on the electrical conductivity of selenium,
a   cylindrical bar of this substance in the vitreous state was enclosed in
a glass tube which was attached to the exhaust-tube         of a Sprengel pump.
The bar of selenium was 45 millims. long and 3'5 millims. in diameter.
Platinum wires were attached to the ends of it and passed through the
sides of the glass tube.         The tube was exhausted, and allowed to remain
attached to the pump for four days. It was now found that the
selenium had acquired a conductivity greatly exceeding that of the pure
element in its most highly conducting condition.            The experiment was
repeated    with  the  intention     of observing  the time required to produce
conduct ivity. Ill forty-two hours the needle of a highly sensitive gal

 1876.]                 Vapour of Mercury on Selenium.                      23
ranometer was slightly deflected when the selenium was placed in the
circuit of ten Leclanche' cells. The conductivity of the selenium increased
rapidly for four days, when the experiment was unavoidably interrupted.
On admitting air to the tube no change of conductivity was observed.
The selenium was unaltered in appearance, even when examined micro
scopically.    On breaking the bar it was found that the conducting-film
was entirely superficial ; it was not removed by rubbing forcibly with a
cloth. Dilute nitric acid also failed to remove it. Bibulous paper
moistened with solution of silver ammonio-nitrate       was not stained by it
(Merget, ' Comptes Eendus,' vol. Ixxiii. p. 1356).       It therefore  appears
highly probable that the film      does  not consist of uncombined    mercury.
As it has not hitherto been known that mercury combines with selenium
at ordinary temperatures, a bar of selenium was immersed in mercury
and allowed to remain undisturbed for six months. At the end of this
time it was found that the selenium was coated with a highly conducting
 film.    I could not dectect any difference between this film and those
 produced in the Sprengel vacuum. An attempt was now made to esti
 mate the quantity of mercury required to produce the observed con
 ductivity.     A bar of selenium 125 millims. long and 2 millims. in
 diameter, having platinum wires fused into each end, was enclosed in
 a glass tube, containing also a minute globule of mercury about 0-5
 millhn. in diameter. The tube was exhausted by means of the Sprengel
 pump, and then hermetically sealed and detached from the pump. In 92
 hours the bar began to conduct, and the conductivity increased rapidly
 from day to day for four days. On the fifth day, no increase being
 observed, it was supposed that air had leaked into the tube ; and on
 examining it a flaw, which would account for the leakage, was detected.
 The tube was therefore again attached to the pump, exhausted, and
 again sealed, the defective portion being removed. The conductivity of
 the bar again increased from day to day, and is still steadily but slowly
  increasing (eleven days after the second sealing of the tube). Although
  the bar of selenium now possesses a comparatively low resistance,     I can
  not detect the slightest alteration in the size of the minute globule of
 mercury which has supplied the material for the conducting-film, extend
 ing over a surface one thousand times greater than that of the globule.
     The granular modification produced by subjecting vitreous selenium to
 a temperature of 100° C. for three hours also acquires a great increase of
 conductivity when exposed to the vapour of mercury in the Sprengel
 vacuum.
     As it is possible at any moment to arrest the formation of these cou-
 ducting-films,    bars  of selenium   of any given high resistance    mny be
 obtained   in this way with great certainty and accuracy.

  IV. " On     Simultaneous Variations of the Barometer in India."
         By J. A. BROUN, F.R.S. Received March 16, 1876.
                                   [PLATE 1.]
   In  this, the first of a proposed series of communications on the baro
metric variations, it may be useful to recall the views held by men of
science as to the causes which produce them.
   Since Pascal showed, by the experiments on the Puy de Dome, that the
height of the mercury in the tube was lower the higher the station, it
was a natural conclusion when the column of mercury fell while the
barometer remained in the same place, that this was also due to a dimi
nution of the mass of air above it.
   In  order to satisfy the facts, afterwards discovered, connected with
diurnal and annual variations of atmospheric pressure, hypotheses were
proposed as to the modes in which the quantity of gravitating matter
pressing on the barometer was increased or diminished.       The actions of
currents    containing colder and denser or warmer and rarer layers of
air, the accumulation of the air thus conveyed over a station, and the
overflowing from one station to another were the most obvious methods
of explaining the variations of mass. The fact that cold air enters along
the floor of a room while the air heated by the fire ascends the chimney,
was a suggestion applied on a large scale to the whole globe. The polar
regions took the place of the door as the source of cold currents, and the
tropical regions represented the fireplace ; from this last the air ascended
the great terrestrial chimney, passed over more northerly and southerly
countries till it descended near the poles, to seek its way back to the
place whence it came.      This hypothesis is represented by engravings in
many works treating of these variations, and the most ingenious figures
are made to cover the earth's surface, showing how the aerial movements
ought to be performed : ought to be, for there is a great want of the
facts which should show that the currents really move as they have been
represented.
   It was found, however, that, even with the aid of these hypothetical
movements, one of the most marked and most regular variations              of
atmospheric pressure could not be explained.        The barometer rises till
about 9 or 10 o'clock in the forenoon and evening, and descends till
nearly 3 or 4 o'clock, morning and afternoon.     The amounts of these rises
and falls are themselves subjected to laws varying with many conditions
which no system of ascensional currents can satisfy. The pressure of the
vapour in the air was the only remaining source of variation depending
on mass which presented itself ; and a well-conceived hypothesis founded
on this element in connexion with aerial currents was supposed to
explain the whole phenomena.
   When we seek for evidence that the causes proposed are either true or

 1876.]             Variations   of the Barometer in India.                  25
 sufficient,   we fail to find it.     From my own experience within the
tropics, where the great diurnal oscillations of the barometer have to be
explained by these currents, we may look in vain for any traces of them
during weeks of the season when the oscillations are most marked. At
stations near the sea, a slight breeze from the ocean during the day and
a  like breeze seaward during the night are the only movements perceived
for days together ; while at inland stations even these are unfelt, though
occasionally local gusts of air sweep in one direction or another.        From
the summits of the South-Indian Ghats, where the Coromandel sea
 borders    the eastern and the Malabar       Sea the western  horizon,  clouds
could be seen forming over sea and land, which scarcely moved, and dis
appeared near the places of their birth ; the highest cirri which mottled
the sky seemed frequently a fixed fretwork, or one which moved so slowly
 that the forms had changed before the direction of their motion could
 be determined.      The clouds which occasionally ascended from the val
leys to the mountain-tops remained so balanced in the air that the
size of their droplets could be estimated under the object-glass of a micro
scope. During these days of calm from sea to sea, the barometer rises
and falls, on the highest peaks as on the plains, with the regularity
of clockwork.
    When we transfer ourselves to the higher latitudes of the British
 Islands and seek for evidence of these currents, no such regular move
ments as the hypothesis requires can be observed : the only appearance
of the current from the pole is to be found in occasional north-east sur
face-winds ; the upper currents, as shown by the motion of the cirri,
proceed on the average from the west.           Here also the currents  fail to
follow their supposed courses.
    The vapour-pressure supplementary theory fails completely whenever
the diurnal variation of vapour-pressure is small compared with that of
the barometer ; its apparent success in other cases is a mere arithmetical
result which could never support a careful comparison with facts.
    When we turn our attention to the changes of barometric height
which occur from day to day, the hypothesis of aerial currents seems
to have a surer basis. These variations have been carefully studied by
Sir J. Herschel, Mr. Birt, A. Quetelet, and others. The first considered
that these oscillations " perhaps take their rise in local and temporary
causes prevailing over great areas simultaneously, the principal no doubt
depending on the prevalence of cloud, or clear sky, or dryness, over
great tracts for several days or weeks in succession "*.      He also thought
that the movements of the atmosphere thus produced should be a cause
of winds alternately progressive and retrogressive.
    Qnetelet, who projected the lines of maximum and minimum pressure
on the map of Europe, suggested that the tropical current descending

near the pole formed a kind of cap (calotte) to the globe, that this pass
ing towards the equator in all longitudes, or advancing in sectors, would

produce the atmospheric waves.
devraient se propager en meme temps que les courants polaires des pdles
vers 1'equateur, et dans notre hemisphere du nord vers le sud"*.        Yet
after a study of the directions of the wind, he concludes, " Les directions
des vents n'ont pas des rapports            apparents avec les directions        des ondes
baron) etriques"    t.
     It is
        not necessary to criticise these hypotheses further. That heated air
rises, and that currents of air are associated with great diminutions of
atmospheric pressure, are facts which do not suffice to explain the great
semidiurnal atmospheric tide, nor the sudden appearance of atmospheric
waves with crests reaching from London to Pekin + and breadths of 1000
miles §.
     It    does not appear impossible, however,         that other causes    of varying
atmospheric pressure may exist than change of the mass                       of air; in
other words, that the attraction of gravitation may not be the only force
concerned in the barometric oscillations : the following results, it ap
pears to me, will require some additional cause for their explanation.
  Having found that a marked variation of the horizontal force of the
earth's magnetism is produced by the sun's rotation on his axis, and that
the period of this rotation shown by the magnetic observations was
nearly 26 days,      I
                 sought whether some effect might not be produced by
the same cause on the atmospheric pressure.  A discussion of the ampli
tudes of the diurnal oscillations of the barometer within the tropics for
a period  of 26 days gave no sufficiently marked result ; if any such
period exists the variation due to it appeared small : a similar discussion
of the irregular diurnal oscillations in high latitudes gave a large variation.
The latter movements are evidently connected with the daily changes
which have been studied by Herschel and others. My attention was then
directed to the changes of daily mean barometric pressure within the
tropics ; and for this investigation, Singapore, a station near the equator,
was chosen, where the irregularities due to local causes might be sup
posed least. The variations of daily mean pressure there, when projected
in curves, were found to resemble those previously obtained by me for
 the earth's magnetic force         :   large oscillations   (for that region)    occupied
from 20 to 30 days for         some months, then disappeared to reappear            later   ||.

 The discussion of four years' observations            gave for the length of the
 period 25'86 days, and mean amplitudes                  of oscillation    (as repre
sented by the term a sin 0) between 0-01 and 0-032 inch in different
 years.
    These movements could not be traced in the observations made at
Hobarton or Makerstoun, where the daily changes of pressure are in
creased tenfold by other causes, and probably by other modes of action
of the same cause ; but some of them were still found to exist at St.
 Helena*. It is not intended at present to enter into the consideration
of the 26-day period (which will show, however, the existence of the
 other cause of varying pressure alluded to), but to examine all the
 various changes of barometric pressure within a given area and during
 a limited period of time.        When stations are chosen which lie nearly in
 the same parallel of latitude or great circle of the sphere, it might be
 supposed, by the purely gravitational theorist, that, however great the
distance, simultaneous variations of pressure are due to the rhythmical
expansion    and overflow of the atmosphere          ; in the following discussion
 it will be seen that this suggestion cannot be made use of.
    Hourly observations        of the barometur      made   at the three following
stations during the months of January, February, and March, 1845, have
been employed in this investigationt: —

   t In the note already cited, which appeared in the ' Comptes Rendus,'' the observa
tion! for the three months January to April were employed because they showed in
the most marked manner the large oscillations of the 26-day period ; the daily means
then used were those for the Gottingen astronomical day, given with the printed obser
vations to correspond with the daily means of the magnetic variations.    These means,
however, have the disadvantage that one day in every week is made up of the part of
the astronomical day oceurring on Saturday and the part occurring on Monday.        In
the present note the means for the civil days have been computed for Singapore and
Madras.    General Boileau has given the means for the civil days in the work cited
below. It is due to the recent publication of his valuable seri*« of observations
that I have been able to include so large an area in my investigation.

    The   daily mean height of the barometer, derived from 24 hourly
 observations for each civil day and for each station, are projected, p. 28.
The relative positions and approximate distances (in English miles) of
the three stations are given in the preceding figure.
   The first movements to be considered in the figures (p.28)are those shown
by the dotted curves, which represent the mean barometric height for 27
days, including 13 days before and 13 days after each point. In these
means the variations due to the solur rotation and lunar revolution
periods     may be considered approximately eliminated.                    It will be seen
that at all the stations         the height diminished from the 9th or 10th of
January till     the beginning of April : this movement is part of the annual
variation, which is most marked at Madras, amounting to 0'3 inch from
January to June, while it is only 0-06 inch at Singapore. At Simla in
1845 the range was about 0-25 inch, but less regular than at the other
stations*.
    The dotted curves show movements which appear independent of the
regular annual variation, and which are similar at all the stations ; these
will require a larger series for their consideration.
    When we examine the change of daily mean barometric height, three
well-marked movements are to be seen at all the stations.                      The first ter
minates about the end of January, the second in the beginning of
 March, and the third towards the end of March ; these movements are,
I  believe, due to the solar rotation, and perhaps the lunar revolution ;
 they will be considered in another note t. The special object of this
 discussion is the examination of the changes of pressure from day to
 day.
    It will be seen  from the curves,      p. 28, that  in general, on whatever day the
barometer attains a maximum (or minimum) at one station,                         a maximum
 (or minimum) occurs at the same time at the other stations.                     The means,
however, for the civil days only are not fitted to show the exact hours
of occurrence of the maximum or minimum : to determine these epochs
 with the greatest possible accuracy, the following method has been
adopted.       In  order to eliminate        the    diurnal oscillation, the means of
 24 hourly observations are always taken ; but these means have been
 obtained for the 24 hours, having for their middle hour each hour of the
    * The annual variation      obeys local laws; considerable differences of barometric
 height exist for months on two sides of the southern Ghats, where the conditions of
 temperature and humidity are far from being the same. The diurnal variation in
 India, especially the descent from the forenoon maximum to the afternoon minimum,
 seems to depend, though to a less extent, on the same conditions.            Mr. Buchan has
 lately shown by the difference of the amplitude of this oscillation for    the volcanic region
 of South  Italy and for the  Spanish peninsula,   that other conditions  may exist (" On the
 Diurnal Oscillations   of the  Barometer,"   Trans.  Roy. Soc. Ed1n.  vol.  xxvii. p. 406).
    t It may be remarked here that tho solar rotation appears to produce also, and
 more especially in high latitudes, a 13-day period, that represented by the term
 * »in 26 in the function of   sines for the 26-day period.

     The next maximum occurs on Sunday, for which there are no observa
 tions    ; it is easily seen, however, from the curves (p. 28) that this, the
 principal maximum for the whole period, occurred near January lld 12*
 at all the three stations.

    It might be supposed that the retardation of the epoch of minimum
at Simla was due to the greater descent of the barometer at that station ;
but the following maximum, which was also retarded, shows that this was
due to some other cause            : —

    Here ths exact epoch of maximum at Simla can only be estimated from
the curves, p. 28, since the barometer was still rising at the last observation
on Saturday ; the means for Simla have not been projected, fig. 4. An exa
mination of the curves, p. 28, will show that there can be little doubt as to

from the preceding minimum is so short, and the retardation of the
minimum at Simla so considerable, that the latter occurs only a few hours
before this maximum at Singapore.
   A faint minimum and following maximum occur January 21-23 at all
the stations, and these are followed by a minimum, January 24, at Simla,
which occurs later (on Sunday) at the other stations ; these movements
and the slight maximum, January 28, 29, which could be examined are
too small for any certain comparison.

   The principal minimum of this great movement occurs at the hours
given for Simla and Madras ; but the principal minimum occurs at Singa
 pore, February 3rd. An examination of the observations on Saturday
evening and Monday morning at Simla and Madras shows that a secon
 dary minimum probably occurred at these stations on Sunday, February
 2nd ; this minimum may thus be described as corresponding to the mini
 mum at Singapore.

   The curve for Singapore is not given, several observations having been
omitted on Monday morning (24th) : from a comparison with the obser
vations on Saturday, it does not appear probable that the maximum
occurred earlier than 23d 20h.              The general movement at Singapore
during   this week   does   not   agree    with   those at the other stations, al
though a slight minimum at Madras (25d 19h) shortly after the maxi
mum (fig. 10) seems        related    to a minimum        at Singapore      (see 20* 0h,

   The minimum preceding this maximum occurred on the Sunday : the
barometric fall after the maximum is considerably greater at Simla than

   A great diminution of pressure        begins immediately after this maximum
at all the three stations, forming the most rapid barometric fall within five
days throughout the three months.            The exact hour of minimum cannot
be  given certainly for want of observations on Sunday ; but from a com
parison of the means for Saturday (March 22d, curves, p. 28) with the daily

hours of the true times.

 not certain which of the two should be compared with the maximum at
 the other stations.      The minimum which follows this maximum occurs
 on Sunday.

    This is a very small movement which has been felt earliest at Madras ;
 it has nearly the same character at Simla and Singapore : the time for
 Madras is estimated from the Saturday mean (see curves, p. 28, March
 29*), and from the figure 17, p. 37.

happens oftenest first at any of the stations*.

occurred at    all the three stations within        a space of less than 16 hours.      In

For all the     cases, as well       as for these, the minium occur more nearly
simultaneously at        all  the   stations  than the maxima.
    AVhen the various local causes (including the different annual and
diurnal variations) which may accelerate or retard the epochs at different
stations are "taken into account, we may conclude that the maxima and
minima occur nearly simultaneously over the area embraced in this in
vestigation ; and it may be added that they are as nearly simultaneous
as the daily mean maxima and minima of the- horizontal force of the
earth's magnetism for different stations on the earth's surface.                        (See
plate 28, vol. xxii. Trans. Eoy. 8oc. Edin.)
    It has been already stated that other causes of change of atmospheric
pressure enter in higher latitudes than those here considered ; how far
the changes agree with each other, and how far they differ from those in
low latitudes, will be the subject of another note. It was found that at
St. Helena the movements now studied were much smaller in general
than in India, and sometimes in opposite directions*.                    I  have, however,
chosen the well-marked movement, March 31 to April 5 (which has
nearly the same amplitude at St. Helena as at the Indian stations),
for comparison.          The 24-hourly means for the four stations are pro
jected,   Nos.    4,  6, 7, and 8, Plate 1.            The epochs for this movement
have been already given (17 and 18).                   We find from the curve No. 4,

and the minimum about              G hours later than at Singapore         and Madras by
the local hours      t.
    The amplitudes of the different movements have not been taken into

 whole greatest at Simla and least at Singapore.                     The barometric falls
at the four stations, March 19 to March 24, are : —

   t It should   be observed    that the hours employed are in all cases the local hours for
each station ; and though, on account        of the epochs being sometimes earlier and some
times Inter at each place, the mean intervals are not affected for the three Indian
stations, where the greatest difference of longitude is not 2 hours, yet at St. Helena
there is a difference with Singapore of nearly 7 hours ; so that if the time is counted
from a common first meridian the intervals would be, for St. Helena, the maximum 4
hours, the minimum 13 hours later than at Singapore.

    The first movement      seems to diminish on proceeding southwards from
Madras    ;  the second remains nearly constant from Madras to St. Helena,
and is least at the most northerly station.
    Perhaps the most remarkable fact brought                 out in this discussion    is
the fewness of the cases in which a change of pressure perceived at
one station is not felt at the others ; and this holds true for changes of
not more than one hundredth of an inch of mercury.                      It will also be
remarked that though Simla is 7100 feet above the sea, the movements
are not diminished by this diminution of the superambient air ; what
part the higher latitude may have in this result cannot at present be
told.
    Remembering the distances of the stations, it will be seen that no
theory of propagation of waves by convection-currents or by rarefactions
and condensations due to them, founded on the facts as yet known to
us, can explain these maxima and minima which occur nearly simul
taneously on the level of the sea at Singapore and Madras, at St.
 Helena 1800 feet and at Simla 7100 feet above the sea-level, under
conditions      of temperature, humidity, clouds, winds, and woather dis
 similar in every respect*. The resemblance of the variations considered
to those of the earth's magnetic force suggests the idea that they may
be due to different modes of action of the same cause.
    I  have no doubt that by more extended investigations we shall arrive
 at the explanation of many meteorological phenomena by the action of
 this cause, which has not hitherto been taken into account.                I  shall con
 clude this note with the words of De Luc in the dedication                 of  his work
 on the atmosphere to the members of the French Academy of Sciences : —

 rule of  similar movements at all the stations occurred on the 14th and
 loth of February.      From   10 A.M. of the 14th to 10p.1t.    of the 15th, the
mercury     fell nearly 0'3 (three tenths) of an inch at Simla ; no other fall
of nearly equal amount occurred within the same space of time during
the three months under consideration ; yet this, the largest of all the
atmospheric disturbances, was apparently unfelt at Madras and Singa
pore.     On examining the weather registers at the three stations, it was
found that there was a great thunderstorm at Simla, which began on the
horizon on the 14th of February and continued throughout               the 15th.
There was nothing unusual at the other stations.
    As the daily mean height of the barometer was less on Monday at
noon than on Saturday at noon at Simla, the fall of the mercurv pro
bably continued during Sunday the l(ith.          This great atmospheric dis
turbance lasting during three days was not propagated even to Madras,
the nearest station : while the smallest of the other movements, some less
than 0'Ol (one hundredth) of an inch, were felt nearly equally well, and
nearly simultaneously, at all the three stations.
   We see here a distinction between local causes           of atmospheric  dis
turbance and that other cause which produces so many nearly simulta
neous movements ; it is also easily understood that the larger deviations,
of 16 or 24 hours, from absolute simultaneity may be due to similar
though much smaller superposed local disturbances,          a fact which an ex
amination of the weather registers confirms.
    On the other hand, the great continuous        fall of the barometer at all
the  three stations, from the 19th to the 24th March, does not appear to
have been accompanied by any other unusual atmospheric change at any
one   of the three stations.
V. "Supplementary Note on Simultaneous Barometric Variations."
          By J. A. BROUN, F.R.S. Received June 20, 1876.
                                   [PLATE 1.]
   It  has been pointed out   in the preceding note that       as  we leave the
tropics and approach the higher latitudes we find greater apparent irre
gularity in the variations of the barometric height from day to day ;
these irregularities are due,    I believe, to different causes — one being
a change in the amount, and even in the direction,            of the action of
the cause which produces so frequently        within the tropics similar and
simultaneous movements.        This change depends probably on local con
ditions which affect the medium through which the actions are produced.
Other causes are to be found which produce variations in the mass of
air above the barometer.     It is not to be expected, then, that the agree
ment shown generally in the barometric movements at the Indian stations
would appear were the investigation extended to higher latitudes ; at the

eame time the great  similarity which has presented itself between the
movements at St. Helena and at the Indian stations during the week
March 31 to April 5, 1845, induced me to make a comparison for that
week with the barometric movements at the Cape of Good                                        Hope, nearly
in the same longitude as St. Helena.
     The results of this comparison were                           so   important that observations        at
other stations were also examined.

   The observations made at these stations during the week March 31
to April 5 were discussed in the same manner as before, so as to obtain
the daily means corresponding to each hour or two hours                                 ||.
   The daily means thus obtained are projected, Plate 1.     Since tho
daily movements were found much smaller within the tropics than in
high latitudes, the curves are projected on different scales to make the
variations equally distinct^. The following are the principal conclusions
from these projections.
   All the curves show maximum near the beginning and another near
                                            a

    At Madras        a secondary maximum              appears at 31d 19b, agreeing nearly
with the mean of the epochs for Pekin and Simla.                          At Pekin a marked
maximum         occurs at     5d  18" ; the time given above refers to the inflection
corresponding with the secondary maximum at Hobarton : the principal
maximum at the latter station occurs nearly 24 hours later.
     It will be seen that the succession is different for the different turn
ing-points, so that no general law of precedence can be deduced relatively
either to latitude or longitude.
     The movements for the two most easterly stations, Hobarton and
Pekin, have been projected first ; and as the difference of latitudes is
nearly 83°, the agreement of the two curves will appear very remark
able.       The first maximum and the following minimum occur nearly
 simultaneously at the two places ; while even the secondary maximum
and minimum which follow at Hobarton are seen at Pekin in a distinct
 inflection, the mercury rising thereafter to a maximum at both stations.
      At the Cape of Good Hope the curve is very regular with two equal
 branches, having the maxima and the minimum within a few hours of
 those for Hobarton and Pekin.
      The curves for St. Helena and Makerstoun, the two most westerly
 stations, have been projected together                ; at both the minimum occurs later
 than at the other stations *.
     * D1fferences were expected to be the rule and not the exception in this investiga
 tion, and it has not been thought necessary to give curves for some stations merely to
 show that such differences exist ; as, however, the movements have been examined bj
 me.   I  shall note that at St. Petersburg the first maximum occurs at the same time us
 at Bogoslowsk, which is nearly in the same latitude, but the second maximum occurs 12
 hoars and the minimum 24 hours later at the former than the latter station. Also at
 Nertchinsk, 11° north of Pekin, the first maximum occurs 4 hours later than at Madras,
  and the second maximum fat 5* IP) 8 hours later than at Catherinenburg (7
  boors earlier than the last maximum at Pekin) ; but the principal minimum occurs 24
  hours before that at Pekin, and is followed by a secondary maximum and minimum not
  shown at the other stations.        In general at European stations the minimum appears to
  be retarded as at Makerstoun.          At Toronto there are three maxima and three minima
  during the week.        The object of this note has been to show the general action of
  the same cause over the earth ; the deviations from the same types m1nt be the lubjeat
  of other researches.

     Thus Simla, though in nearly as high a latitude                     as the Cape        of flofl
 Hope, belongs by the range to the tropical series.
     It is of much importance to observe that we have here to deal wi
 the great atmospheric movements experienced in high latitudes.                                Th
 the change of observed barometric height from minimum to maxim
at Catherineuburg was nearly 0'6 inch ; while at Makerstoun, thouI
the variation         of the daily m?ait pressure was                  less    than at the ot

    It will be seen that while the first minimum is not shown at any of the otk
stations after March 31d O1", and the first maximum occurs twelve hours later than 1
Bogoslowsk, yet the second minimum occurs nearly at the same local hour as
the Asiatic stations, and the second maximum at the same local hour as at
Cape of Good Hope. The movements of the mercury are still larger than in 1
of the other cases, the change from the minimum, April 2d 20*, to the maxima
observation, 4d 11", being upwards of one inch.                 The whole series of facts leav
it appears to me, no doubt that this great movement is connected with the
cause which products the comparatively small variations within the tropics ; and !
may be noted that as we approach the poles the amount and irregularity of
barometric oscillations seem to increase, as in the case of the magnetic variations.

          (n-f-1) Clairautians of nth order ;
          (r+1) terms in a Clairautian of rth rank in general ;
                                                                                    (2)

     Thus      a Clairautian                     expression, the order and rank of
                                 is a differential

     2.Clairautian Equations. — It is proposed to term a differential equa
tion involving Clairautian functions a CLAIBAUTIAN EQUATION. Upon
the important properties proved in arts. 4, 5, the solution of many such
differential equations may be founded and effected with elegance. These
will be developed in what follows.
   In consequence of the limitation of r, n as positive integers (art. 1 ),
the differential equations presented will all be of the ordinary type, that
is, involving the differential symbol D only in a rational integral form.
" General differentiation " will be freely used when necessary to the
generality of     solution (so that the quantity
                         a                           may have any value).

       M.A. Communicated by A. G. VERNON HARCOURT, Lee's
       Reader in Chemistry in the University of Oxford. Received
       April      12, 1876.
     Iodine,    as is well known,     when in 'very thin layers, appears red by
transmitted       light   ;   and when in solution the colour of the liquid depends
not only on the amount of iodine contained in              it,   but also on the nature
of the liquid in which    dissolved.
                                it   is
   Scbultz-Sellack  has pointed out (Pogg. Ann. vol. cxl.      334) that  p.

 first, those   with which it gives reddish-brown solutions, like alcohol :
and      secondly, those with which it gives violet ones, as bisulphide of
carbou    ;   and also that the colours of        these two     solutions   correspond
respectively    with the colour of solid iodine, when           seen by transmitted
light,   and with that of iodine vapour.
     Andrews    (Brit. Assoc. Eeport, 1871)        has   also remarked that iodine
vapour and the    solution of iodine in bisulphide of carbon arc dichroio,
while such is  not the case with its solution in alcohol.
   As I am not aware of any other observations on the absorption of
light by iodine in solution or in the solid state having been published,
I have the honour of having an account of some experiments           have       I
recently made on this subject communicated to the Eoyal Society.
   For these observations       I
                              have used one of Browning's spectroscopes
with a single dense-glass prism of 60°, as with a greater amount of dis
persive power      it           difficult to observe the beginning and end
                        became more
of the absorption.    The spectroscope was f1rmly screwed to the wall of
the room, with the collimator    pointing vertically downwards, the light
from a paraffin-lamp being reflected along it by a mirror — the width of
the slit and the position of the mirror and lamp remaining unaltered
during the course of the experiments, in order that the different absorp
tion-spectra should, as far as possible, be comparable with each other.
The solution whose absorption was to be observed was contained in a
small beaker, supported by the ring of a retort-stand between the mirror
and the slit of the collimator.
   This arrangement was adopted in order to be able 'to observe the
absorption through various thicknesses of the same solution, without
having to use a wedge-cell, as some of the liquids in which iodine is
soluble act very quickly on the cement with which such cells are
fastened     together.

                           the absorption through different known thick
nesses could be observed, the solutions of iodine in bisulphide and tetra-
chloride of carbon being covered with a thin layer of water to prevent
their evaporating.
  When the absorption-spectra    of solid and liquid iodine were to be
observed, the beaker was replaced by    large cork which fitted the ring
                                              a
of the retort-stand, and through which        hole had been bored in
                                                    a                                a
line with the axis of the collimator, and the glass slips between which
the iodine had been melted laid on this.         In the case of the liquid
iodine, the low conductive power for heat of the cork retarded the
cooling of the glass, and facilitated the observation of the absorption.
   The telescope of the spectroscope, the eyepiece of which was fur
nished w-ith cross wires, was carried by an arm moving over          divideda
arc; and the position of 10 of the principal lines in the solar spectrum
having been      observed, from       these   measurements,     and from    the wave

structed, by means of which the readings of the spectroscope were reduced
to wave-lengths.
                                  Solid Iodine.
   Layers of iodine sufficiently     thin  to be transparent can be readily
obtained,   as Schultz-Sellack   has remarked, by squeezing melted iodine
between two pieces of flat, well-polished glass : it is only necessary to
place a small fragment of iodine between two pieces of glass which
have been previously well cleaned with alcohol, and heat them over a spirit-
lamp till the iodine melts, and then press them together.      I  have obtained
the best results by heating the iodine till it just melts, placing the pieces
of glass on a smooth block of wood and squeezing them together with
a flat cork.
   The layers of iodine thus obtained are not usually of uniform thick
ness ; and, in addition to this, they contain so little iodine that       I was
unable to determine their thickness by ascertaining the weight and area
of the film. When seen, however, by reflected and transmitted light,
the iodine film usually appears surrounded         by coloured rings ; and as
these alter their position and shape when         the glass slips are pressed
together, they must be due to a thin layer        of air, and not to any sub
stance adhering to the glass ; and consequently the layers of iodine are
probably less than '00004 inch, or -001016 mm., in thickness.
   When    seen by transmitted   light, these layers of iodine vary in colour
from a deep brownish red, through different shades of brown, to a more
or less pure yellow, according to the thickness and nature of the film :
for, as is shown in .the paper " On the Polarization of Light by Crystals
of Iodine" (infra, p. 51), the colour of the transmitted light apparently does
not depend solely on the thickness of the layer of iodine through which it
passes. These films correspond in colour with alcoholic solutions of iodine of
different strength, and the absorption-spectra are very similar —the whole
of the blue end of the spectrum being cut off, and the absorption extend
ing further and further towards the less refrangible end of the spectrum,
as the thickness of the film increases, till at length only light having a
                                  " tenth-metres "), or slightly more refran
wave-length of about 650 (in
gible than the C line, passes through ; and a very slight increase in the
thickness of the film is sufficient to stop this also.
   Fig. 4 shows the appearance with a film of medium             thickness, the
strong absorption ending at a point about one third of the distance
between E and D, together with a certain amount of darkening extend
ing to about D, and represents the mean results from measurements of
the absorption-spectra    of seven different films  of iodine.

these thin layers of iodine by heating it over the flame of a spirit-lamp,

without causing it either to be dissipated in vapour or to run together.
The liquid iodine appears to be more transparent than the solid ;
for a layer which appears a deep red colour by transmitted light when
hot, sometimes becomes perfectly opaque on cooling.         When hot it
is also of a deeper red than when, cold ; and the spectroscope shows that
while the less-refrangible rays of the spectrum are freely transmitted,
there is more absorption of those of mean refrangibility than is the caso
with solid iodine.
 Fig. 3 shows the absorption-spectrum                from five observations.

Just as is the case with solid iodine, light of a wave-length of about 650
suffers the least amount of absorption during its passage through a layer
of iodine.
                              Iodine in Solution.
  As   I have before  mentioned, the liquids in which iodine is soluble may
be divided into two classes : first, those with which it forms brownish-red
solutions, as alcohol, ether, ethyl bromide, Dutch liquid, benzole, glycerine,
potassium iodide in an aqueous solution, hydrogen chloride, &c. ; second,
those with which it forms violet solutions : this latter class is less nume

rous, and as far as have hitherto been able to ascertain by actual experi
ment, only consists of the following substances — the bisulphide, tetra-
chlorido, and monochloride of carbon, chloroform, phosphorous terchloride,
tin tetrachloride, and under certain circumstances,           as   will   be hereafter
mentioned,    hydrogen sulphate.      In Watts's Dictionary of Chemistry,'

vol. i. p. 881, it is stated that the solution of iodine in chloral has a purple
colour.
   In order to obtain solutions of iodine of a known strength, some of
the liquids in which it is soluble being very volatile, a small glass weigh
ing-tube closed with a cork was nearly filled with iodine which had been
crushed small with the edge of a platinum spatula.       A stoppered flask
holding 25   c. c. was filled with the liquid in which the iodine was
to be dissolved ; and the tube having been weighed, a small quantity of
iodine was shaken out of     it,
                               and the tube again weighed, and so on,
till the desired amount had    been added to the    liquid.

 chloroform,  alcohol, and in aqueous solutions of potassium iodide were
 prepared, and the absorption produced by different thicknesses of these
 solutions observed.
    Solutions of iodine in alcohol, and of iodine in an aqueous solution of
potassium iodide, of different strengths were then prepared, and the ab-.
sorption produced by layers of these solutions, varying in thickness from
5 mm. to 25 mm., was observed.
    Solutions of iodine in both liquids were, when of equal strength, of
the same colour and the absorption-spectra were similar, and also similar
to that of the solid iodine, except that the absorption did not appear to
extend quite so far down the spectrum ; but as the transition from strong
absorption to none at all is a very gradual one, it is somewhat difficult
to determine the exact point at which the absorption ends. Fig. 2 repre
sents the mean results obtained from thirty observations through different
thicknesses of the alcohol solutions.
   Iodine dissolved in bisulphide of carbon absorbs most strongly light
of mean refrangibility ; and the absorption-spectrum      resembles that of
the vapour of iodine as represented in the map to M. Thalen's memoir,
'
  Le spectre d'absorption de la vapeur d'lode' (Upsal, 1869), except that
the absorption is continuous, and does not extend quite so far towards
the less-refrangible  end of the spectrum.
   Kg. 1 represents the mean result of eighty-one measurements of the posi
tion of the absorption produced by different thicknesses of these solutions.
The rays whose wave-lengths lie between 450 and 560 (approximately)
are first absorbed ; and as the thickness of the layer or the concentration
of the solution is increased, the absorption extends towards both ends of
the spectrum, though more rapidly towards the less-refrangible one.
    Just as was the case with the solution of iodine in alcohol, and with
solid and liquid iodine, light of a wave-length of about 650 passes t1n-
absorbed through a considerable thickness of the solution ; but a thick
ness which is sufficient to stop the whole of the red rays still allows the
blue and violet ones to pass ; hence, whilst dilute solutions of iodine in
bisulphide of carbon and other liquids of that class appear of a kind of
red, when the light passes through a greater thickness, or the solution
is more concentrated, they appear blue or violet.
   Iodine is insoluble in cold hydrogen sulphate ; but when some frag
ments of iodine are placed in a test-tube, partially filled with strong
hydrogen sulphate, and the tube heated, the iodine first melts, and then
gradually colours the liquid, till it becomes about the same tint as a
very dilute solution of iodine in bisulphide of carbon.
   '0100 grm. of iodine was placed in a test-tube containing 25 c. c.
of strong hydrogen sulphate, and the test-tube carefully heated over
a   spirit-lamp until the whole of the liquid iodine had disappeared ;
 the acid appeared of the same colour as a solution of iodine in chloroform,
 containing about the same amount of iodine. The colour of the acid did not

    alter on cooling   ; after standing 24 hours the upper     layer of acid for a
    depth   of about one centimetre from the surface had become colourless ;
   but at the   end of five months the acid in the lower part of the tube was
   still pink, the upper    half having become colourless, and a small quantity
   of a black powder having settled at the bottom.
       Only   a very small quantity of iodine can be held in solution by the
   hydrogen sulphate when cold, as any excess separates out in minute
  crystals.
       It does   not appear probable that the difference in the colour of the
   solutions which    iodine forms with liquids of these two classes depends
  on any      chemical fact,   as both classes contain   substances of very dis
   similar chemical    composition.    I have not, however, as yet been able to
  ascertain any common         property possessed by all the liquids of either
  class, beyond (as, indeed, is obvious) that all those in which iodine forms
  violet solutions are volatile liquids of high specific gravity.
      It has been shown by various observers (H. Morton, Pogg. Ann. vol.
                                                                         '
  civ. p. 573; Hagenbach, Pogg. Ann. vol. cxlvi. p. 533; Kraus,            Chloro-
 phyllfarbstoffe,' p. 53) that the position of the absorption-bands of sub
  stances in solution vary to a certain extent with the liquid in which they
 are dissolved ; but this would        appear to depend on some other cause ;
 for, in addition, to the displacement being small, it differs in amount
  with different liquids ; whilst in the case of iodine, as far as    I have been
 able to observe, the position of the absorption is the same for all the
 liquids belonging to one of the two classes.            The action on light of
 iodine dissolved in alcohol greatly resembles the effect it produces when
in the solid state ; whilst the absorption of its solution in carbon bisul
phide, and in other liquids of that class, bears, as has been pointed out
to me by Professor Stokes, the same relation to the absorption-spectrum
of the vapour as the spectrum of the solution of a coloured gas (nitrogen
peroxide for example) does to that of the gas.
II. "On the Polarization of Light by                Crystals of Iodine."       By
         Sir JOHN CONROY, Bart., M.A.                Communicated by A. GK
        VERNON HARCOURT, Lee's Reader               in Chemistry in the Uni
        versity of Oxford.         Received April    12, 1876.
     On   examining by means of a Nicol prism the light reflected from the
surface of a layer of iodine, obtained by heating a fragment of that sub
stance and then squeezing it between two plates of glass, as described
in the preceding paper,         I found that the film did not appear of uniform
Brightness,       and that  when  the Nicol was rotated the relative brilliancy
of different parts of the film changed — a portion that had appeared dark
when the principal section of the Nicol was vertical, became bright when
it was horizontal, and vice vend; ond, also, if instead of altering the
                                                                     £2

52                          Sir John Conroy on the
position of the Nicol, the film of iodine was rotated horizontally, the
Nicol remaining at rest, the same changes in brilliancy occurred .
    Eemoving the upper glass made no difference, except that the surface
of the film of iodine tarnished rapidly, and then the amount of light re
flected by   it became considerably  less.
    The light incident upon the surface of the iodine was either ordinary
diffused daylight or the light of a paraffine-la1np ; and in neither case
did it show more than the merest trace of polarization, and generally not
even that, when examined by means of a double-image prism and a plate
of selenite.
    It therefore appears that the light reflected from the surface of a layer
of iodine is polarized, and that the position of the plane of polarization
is not, of necessity, either parallel or perpendicular to the plane of in
cidence, but bears a definite relation to some direction within the crystals
composing the film.
    I  also found that when these films were sufficiently thin to be trans
parent the light they transmitted was polarized, and that the plane of
polarization of the transmitted light was perpendicular to the plane of
the light which was polarized by reflection from the same portion of the
 film.
    After making these observations     I ascertained that W. Haidinger had
announced, upwards of twenty years ago (Fogg. Ann. clxxi. p. 321 , 1 847),
that the surface-colours which certain substances show by reflected light,
in the case of some of the platino-cyanides, namely, those of potassium,
barium, and magnesium, consist partially of light polarized in a plane
which bears a definite relation to (ho axis of the crystal ; and in a sub
sequent paper (Sitzungsberichte der kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissen-
schaften, viii. p. 97, 1852) he states that certain other substances have
the same property.       He mentions iodine in this latter paper as showing
these    " surface-colours," but does not appear to have noticed that the
plane of polarization of the light reflected from its surface bore any
relation to some fixed direction within the substance.
    I  arranged a form of polariscope by means of which these observations
could be repeated with a greater degree of accuracy.         The instrument
used consisted of a divided brass circle fixed vertically to a firm support ;
a Nicol furnished with a graduated circle was carried by an arm moving
round the centre of the circle, and the slip of glass with the layer of
iodine rested horizontally on a stage at the top of a tube, the height of
which could be adjusted so that the surface of the iodine was level with
the centre of the graduated brass circle.       Both the stage and the tube
revolved horizontally, and could be rotated independently of each other ;
and the latter had an index moving over a divided circle attached to it,
and a diaphragm with an opening about 6 mm. wide fixed in it.              By
altering the position of the arm moving over the vertical circle the light
reflected from the surface of the iodine at different angles could be ex

 amined   ; and by reflecting light along the axis of the tube, by a mirror
 placed below it, and clamping the arm in such a position that the axis of
the tube and Nicol were in the same straight line, the polarization of the
light transmitted by the iodine could also be observed.           A second or
polarizing Nicol was so arranged that it could either be brought below
the tube or placed between the surface of the iodine and the source of
light, so that the behaviour of the film, when the incident light was pola
rized, could be studied.
    On repeating the before-mentioned observations with reflected light      I
found that occasionally portions of the film of iodine appeared quite
black in certain positions of the film and Nicol, and that these same
 portions, when examined by transmitted light, did not merely alter in
colour as the film or Nicol was rotated, as the remainder did, but in
certain positions transmitted no light at all — or, in other words, that they
behaved in a similar manner to what a plate of tourmaline would have
done ; and when seen by ordinary light and the naked eye, although they
 appeared to be of the same thickness as the remainder of the film, by
which they were wholly or partially surrounded, they were of a much
 paler colour ; usually, moreover, they reflected rather less light than the
rest.
     The change in the appearance of these portions of the film when seen
 through a Nicol was very striking in the case of some of the larger ones,
 as in certain positions they appeared perfectly transparent and of a pale
 yellow colour, and objects situated behind them could be clearly seen ;
 but on turning either the film or the Nicol they became perfectly opaque,
 and resembled highly polished metallic surfaces.
     On examining one of these films of iodine with a microscope with a
                 I
  f object-glass found that those portions of the film which polarized
 light most strongly differed considerably in appearance from the re
  mainder, and that they appeared to consist of long crystals about
  '003 inch wide adhering together side by side, whilst the rest of the film
  seemed to consist of thin plates of iodine overlaying one another, these,
 also, being long in proportion to their width.
                                                           I
     A Nicol prism was placed over the eyepiece, and then found that
 when the principal section of the Nicol was perpendicular to the long
 axes of the crystals, the maximum amount of light was transmitted,
 and when the principal section was parallel with the long axes of the
 crystals, they either appeared perfectly opaque or transmitted            the
  minimum amount of light, according as the crystals in the field of view
  belonged to one or other class.
     Other specimens of iodine showed this crystalline arrangement with
  different degrees of distinctness ; but in all, or nearly all, some trace of
  it could be seen.   In some cases, however, the minimum amount of light
  was transmitted when the principal section of the Nicol was not parallel
   with what appeared at first sight to be the long axes of tl1q c1ystals; but

     From the appearance of the film, when                        seen   under the microscope,      it
appears probable that this difference depends merely on the arrangement
of the crystals, and that when they are regularly disposed in a single
layer the film   one of those which
                          is          have called iodine

consists of several layers of thin crystals lying in various directions, or
itmay be due to different faces of the crystals of iodine being                        in contact
with the glass, and to the light passing through the crystals in                      a   different
direction.

    Iodine a. — Films of iodine a between two slips of glass were laid on
 the stage of the polariscope, and the light they transmitted examined
 with the analyzing Nicol; on turning either the stage or the Nicol, the
 colours of the film varied, according to their thickness and the relative
 positions of the film of iodine and the Nicol, from     kind of brownish    a
 yellow to    deep red, the colours being similar to those of solutions of
                     a
 iodine in alcohol of various strengths.
    When the incident light was polarized, and the film of iodine placed
 so as  to transmit the minimum amount of light, or at right angles to
 this position, the field was dark when the Nicols were crossed and light
 when they were parallel.     When, however, the film of iodine was in an
 intermediate position, the field was no longer dark in any position of the
 analyzer, the colour and intensity of the light varying slightly as   was                     it

the field was dark when the Nicols were crossed and light when they
were parallel.  When, however, the iodine film was placed in an inter
mediate position, the field was no longer dark when the Nicols were
crossed, though it was so in two positions of the analyzer 180° apart.
   In order to simplify the description of the experiments,   shall speak                     I
of the direction     in the film which, when placed parallel with the principal
section       of the Nicol, caused the field to appear dark, or in the case of
iodine a to be least bright, as the axis of the crystal.

deep red colour, when, under similar circumstances,    thicker film would        a
transmit no   light at all.
   Hence     would appear that iodine belongs to the class of double re

fracting substances in which the coefficient of absorption differs accord
ing to the direction in which the light passes through the crystal, and,
further, that the ray whose plane of polarization       perpendicular to theis

when the principal section of the Nicol and the axis of the crystal are

I   have shown, in the preceding paper, that solutions of iodine in alcohol,
when seen by transmitted light, vary in colour, from a pale yellow
                                                                         to a

the layer through which the light has to pass.     In similar manner, in     a

 imposed, and BO placed with respect to each other that they transmitted
the maximum amount of light.
    The light of a paraffine-la1np reflected from the surface of a film, con
sisting partly of iodine a and partly of iodine /3 between two slips of
glass, was examined by means of the Nicol, the angle of incidence being
 about 60°.
    When the principal section of the Nicol was in the plane of incidence,
and when consequently but little of the light reflected from the surface
of the glass was transmitted, portions of the film of iodine appeared of
different degrees of brightness ; and on rotating either the Nicol or the
stand, the relative brilliancy of different portions of the film changed,
those portions which consisted of iodine ft appearing perfectly black iu
certain relative positions of the film and Nicol, whilst the remainder of
the film merely became more or less bright.
   The film of iodine was then placed so that the portion consisting of
iodine  /3 appeared perfectly black when the principal section of the Nicol
was in the plane of incidence. On rotating the stand, light reflected from
the surface of the iodine was transmitted by the Nicol, and increased in
quantity till the stand had been turned through 90°, when the surface
of the iodine had a brilliant metallic lustre.   On continuing the rotation,
the surface gradually lost its brilliancy, and when the stage had been
turned through 180° appeared perfectly black again.
    On rotating the Nicol the same changes took place ; but the light
reflected from the surface of the glass marked the effect to a consider
able extent when the principal section of the Nicol was no longer in the
plane of incidence.
   The light incident upon the surface of the glass showed no signs of
polarization when examined by a double-image prism and plate of sele-
nite, and only the faintest trace of it after passing through, at nn angle
of about 60°, a slip of glass similar to those used for covering the layers
of iodine; consequently the polarization of the light must     be due to the
film of iodine.
   From this it appears that the light reflected from the surface of a
film of iodine /3 is polarized; and by examining the light transmitted by
the same portion of the film, it was ascertained that the plane of polari
zation of the reflected light is perpendicular to that of the ray which is
most freely transmitted, and consequently that the reflected light is
polarized in a plane at right angles to the axis of the crystals.
   When the incident light was polarized, it was found that it was
reflected from the surface of the iodine when the plane of polarization
of the light was perpendicular to the axis of the crystals, and extinguished
when parallel.
   As has been stated     before, when a film of iodine a is poen through a
Nicol, it  does not appear black in any position ; but the brilliancy of the
surface alters as the Nicol or iodine is rotated.

   Experiments similar to those just described show that when a ray of
plane polarized light is incident upon such a surface of iodine, it is never
completely extinguished, as is the case with iodine /3 ; but the intensity
of the reflected light depends on the relative position of the plane of
polarization and the axis of the crystals, being least when they are
parallel.
  When the slips of glass between which the iodine       has been melted are
carefully separated, the film usually remains attached to one of them in
a sufficiently perfect condition to be examined.   At first it is extremely
brilliant, and shows exactly the same appearances as have already been
described as occurring with film of iodine under glass. The surface,
however, not only tarnishes rapidly, but even at a low temperature (10°)
the film quickly evaporates ; and consequently the uncovered films are
somewhat difficult to examine.
   They, however, permit some additional facts to be observed, which
either are seen with difficulty or not seen at all when the iodine is
covered with a plate of glass : and chief amongst these is the " surface-
       "
colour which iodine shows when light is incident upon it at a high
angle.
   When     film of either iodine a or ft is placed on the stage of the polari-
             a
scope with its axis parallel with the plane of incidence and the principal
section of the Nicol in the same plane, the surface of the iodine appears
bright and metallic when light is incident on it at an angle of about 60°.
As the angle of incidence increases, the colour of the reflected light
changes ; at about 70° the surface appears blue, and is still bright, but
has lost its metallic appearance to a considerable extent, and at about
72° the colour is most intense ; but as, in addition to the difficulties
which are inseparable from determinations of this kind, the instrument
which    I
         have used for these experiments does not allow of any very
accurate measurements being made with        it, the value of these angles can
only be regarded as approximate.
   On rotating the stand the amount of reflected light diminishes rapidly,
and the iodine appears dark or nearly so when the axes of the crystals
are perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
   On rotating the Nicol, the axes of the crystals of iodine remaining
parallel with the plane of incidence, the surface of the iodine becomes
bright and metallic, the maximum amount of light being transmitted
when the principal section of the Nicol perpendicular to the plane of
                                            is
incidence.
  When the incident light      polarized in the plane of incidence the
                                is
surface of the iodine appears brilliant and metallic in all positions, and
when seen through the analyzer the amount of light reflected            by
                                                                       the
film alters as the former  is rotated, but there    no trace of colour.

   When, however, the light     is polarized perpendicularly to the plane of
incidence   the reflection from  the surface of the iodine  isa coloured one

58                            Sir John Conroy on the                        [May 18,
when the axes of the crystals are parallel with the plane of incidence ;
consequently the appearance of the film is exactly the same when un-
polarized light falls on its surface and it is seen through a Nicol whose
principal section is vertical, and when the incident light is polarized
perpendicularly to the plane of incidence and it is seen directly.
   These experiments show that when light falls upon the surface of a
film of iodine at an angle of about 72° a portion of the light is polarized
by reflection in the plane of incidence, and this independently of the
position of the crystals composing the film, and that another portion of
the light, which is coloured by reflection, and to which the surface-colour
is due, is polarized in a plane whoso direction depends on that of the
crystals composing the iilm, and, further, that this light is polarized
perpendicularly to the axis of the crystals.
   The surface-colour can only be seen when the angle of incidence
which the light makes with the surface of the iodine is a large one ;
and the reason that in the case          of iodine covered with glass it is not
visible, apparently    is,   that with   a large angle of incidence nearly the
whole of the light    reflected from the surface of the glass.
                      is                                          succeeded

been melted between     slip of glass and one of the sides of a small crown-
                        a
glass prism of an equilateral section, and also when such       prism was
                                                                        a
placed on the surface of one of the glass slips covering the iodine,               a
drop of carbon tetrachloride (the index of refraction of this liquid being
nearly the same as that of the glass) being placed between the slip and
the prism, as under these circumstances light can reach the surface of
the iodine at a greater angle than   possible when
                                         is               covered by

piece  of glass; but in neither case was  the surface-colour  so well seen
as when the iodine was uncovered.
   Haidinger    has   remarked    (Sitzungsberichte  der kaiserlichen Akade-
1nie   der 'Wissenschaften,    Band viii. p. 97) that the surface-colours are
complementary to the colour of the light transmitted by the same
substance and this also appears to be the case with iodine, as in the
           ;
solid and liquid condition, and also when           dissolved in certain liquids,  it
absorbs most readily the blue rays       ;    but at the same time, as Professor
Stokes has pointed out, the surface-colour             and the colour of the trans
mitted light can only be said to be complementary within very narrow
limits, as the colour of the transmitted light varies with the thickness of
the layer of substance through which     passes.

                               /3,
ata   considerable angle, were found to polarize the light elliptically in
certain positions of the film, as was shown by the black cross being dis
torted  when   a plate of Iceland spar, cut perpendicularly to the axis
of the crystal, and    aplano-convex lens of about 40 mm. focal length
were placed between the surface of the iodine and the analyzing Nicol.
The amount of distortion, which was never very considerable, increased

with the angle of incidence, and appeared to attain its maximum when tho
angle was about 72°.
   When a film of either iodine a or /3 is placed on the stage with its
axis  perpendicular to the plane of incidence, and the principal section of
the analyzer parallel with the latter plane, the black cross is perfect ;
but on turning the film till its axis is parallel with the plane of incidence,
the cross    becomes   slightly distorted, and the centre appears bluish.
When the light falling on the surface of the film is polarized in a plane
forming an angle of 45° with the plane of incidence, the principal
section of the analyzing Nicol still remaining in that plane, the black
cross is perfect as long as the axis of the iodine is perpendicular to the
plane of incidence, and distorted when it is parallel.
   Iodine /3 only shows the black cross very faintly with unpolarized
light when its axis is perpendicular to the plane of incidence.
   The distortion when the incident light is polarized is far greater than
that produced by the reflection of a ray of light, polarized at an angle of
45 degrees with the plane of incidence, from the surface of a piece of
glass, and quite comparable in amount with the effect produced when
the light falls on a metallic surface.
   I selected from a large quantity of freshly sublimed iodine a few pieces
bearing a more regular crystalline form than the rest, and amongst these
there were two nearly triangular plates, about 10 mm. long and 8 mm.
broad.
    One of these was arranged on the stage of the polariscope, and the
light reflected from the surface observed in the way that has already
been described in the case of the films of iodine.
   The light was most completely polarized when the angle of incidence
was about 72° ; when the length of the crystal was perpendicular to the
principal section of the analyzer    it appeared darkest, and when parallel
with it lightest.
   The    surface-colour and the distortion of the black cross were as
clearlv seen as with the film of iodine.
   After several unsuccessful attempts      I  succeeded in preparing some
 well-defined crystals of iodine by carefully heating on a sand bath a
 small quantity of that substance in a wide-mouthed          stoppered bottle,
 when some perfect       rhomboidal plates of iodine about 1 mm. long
 were deposited on the cool part of the bottle.            When these were
 examined with the polariscope, the principal section of the Nicol being in
 the plane of incidence, they appeared brightest when their long axis was
 parallel with, and darkest when it was perpendicular to, the plane of
 incidence.
    Hence   it appears that when the long  axes  of these crystals are parallel
 with or perpendicular to the plane of incidence, part of the light reflected
 from their surface is polarized in the plane of incidence, and part in a
 plane at  right angles to their long axes, and consequently     tt1at the long

axes of these rhomboidal plates correspond with that direction within
the film of iodine which has been spoken of as the axis of the crystal:
and as iodine belongs to the trhnetric system, this may be considered
the principal axis, as being the one in the direction of which the crystals
are prismatically developed to the greatest extent ; and it also appears
that when a ray of light passes normally through such a crystal it is
divided into two rays polarized respectively parallel with and per
pendicular to the same axis ; and the one whose flame of polarization is
parallel with the principal axis suffers the least absorption.
III.     "Picrorocellin."           By JOHN STENHOUSE, LLD., F.R.S., and
          CHARLES EDWARD             GROVES.  Received April 27, 1876.
  Through the kindness of Mr. C. Lavers Smith, the eminent orchil
manufacturer of Spitalfields, we were furnished with a quantity of a lichen
which he had observed to have a very bitter taste, and which came into
the market through a Portuguese house.     It is believed to have been
brought from the West Coast of Africa ; but our endeavours to ascertain
the exact locality have hitherto been unsuccessful.   From the appearance
of the lichen it seems to grow on limestone rocks ; and Mr. W. Carruthers,
of the British Museum, and the Eev.                   J. T.     Crombie, to whom we sub
mitted    it,   pronounced   it variety of Eocella fuciformis, the ordinary
                                  to be   a
Ilocella usually growing on trees.   This lichen     remarkable for its in
                                                                  is
tensely bitter taste and the preliminary experiments showed that this
                       ;
is due to the presence of    crystalline compound which
                                    a                           but slightly
                                                                           is
soluble   in water.
                                          Picrorocellin.
   The lichen was accordingly first treated with water and hydrate of
lime, in the usual manner, to extract the erythrin which   contains in     it
common with other varieties of Rocella, and the residue, after being dried
at the ordinary temperature, was extracted by boiling spirit. The alcoholic
solution, which contained the bitter substance together with chlorophyl
and various fatty and resinous impurities, was concentrated  distillation   by
until almost the whole of the alcohol was removed. When cold, the dark-
coloured pasty mass was pressed in          cloth, boiled up with
                                                     a            small           a
quantity of strong spirit, and allowed to cool, pressed, and again treated
in the same manner.   By this means much of the chlorophyl and almost
the whole of the oily matters were dissolved                out, leaving   a dark green-
coloured crystalline product.             In   order to remove the last traces of chloro
phyl from this,      was boiled up twice or thrice with benzine, in which
                      it
the crystals are only slightly soluble.

yields the same crystalline substance, but   much more difficult to purify

of lime. The erythrin in this lichen is identical with that from the ordi
nary kinds of R. fuciformis, yielding orcin aud erythrite when boiled
with lime or other alkalies.
    The nearly colourless substance was now boiled for some time with about
ten times its weight of spirit, and filtered whilst hot through a vacuum
filter.   In this operation it is necessary to use a hot-water funnel, as,
otherwise, the crystals which separate soon choke up the filter. The
filtered solution, which should be boiled until clear, on cooling, deposits a
large amount of crystals, which evidently consist of a mixture of two
 substances, one forming lustrous'prisms, the other feathery tufts of minute
 flattened needles.      These two substances can be easily separated mechani
 cally by elutriation, the comparatively large prisms of picrorocellin, from
their size and weight, rapidly sinking to the bottom of the solution, whilst
 the light feathery tufts of the other compound remain suspended.             One
 or two recrystallizations from spirit generally suffice to purify the former ;
 but if they have any green tinge, it is necessary to treat them previously
 with boiling benzine in order to remove the trace of chlorophyl to which
 the colour is due.
     The new compound crystallizes in long prismatic crystals of considerable
 lustre, which are moderately soluble in boiling spirit, slightly soluble in
 ether and benzine, but almost insoluble in water, petroleum, and carbon
 bisulphide. It melts at 192°-194° C., and when more strougly heated
 boils and gives off vapours of an oily substance of a pleasant aromatic
 odour, leaving a small amount of carbonaceous residue. Cold concentrated
 sulphuric acid colours it of a deep brown ; but when it is warmed it dis
 solves, forming a pale yellow solution, from which water precipitates a
  yellow compound.        If the sulphuric acid solution be heated nearly to its
 boiling-point, it darkens and gives off sulphurous anhydride       ; the addition
 of water then gives no precipitate.       It is also soluble in warm nitric acid,
 and the addition of water causes a yellow precipitate similar in appearance
 to that produced in the sulphuric acid solution ; the nitric acid solution,
  when heated, gives oS nitrous fumes.         If boiled with dilute sulphuric or
 hydrochloric acid for a short time, the picrorocellin is decomposed, a com
 pound, xanthorocMin, being formed which crystallizes from alcohol in long
  silky needles of a pale yellow colour.     When picrorocellin is distilled with
 a mixture of dilute sulphuric acid and potassium dichromate, it is de
  composed, an oil passing over having the odour of benzoic aldehyde, ac
  companied by a white crystalline substance.            The latter, after being
  purified by recrystallization, melted at 121° and had the general appearance
  and properties of benzoic acid, with which it is identical.         It was also
  found to be oxidized by an acid solution of potassium permanganate, but
  no odour of bitter-almond oil was observable.
     The substance dried at 100° was submitted to analysis, with the fol
  lowing results : —

   The numbers obtained from the results of these analyses agree very
closely with those required by the formula C^H^NjOj.                       As this com
pound    is   obtained   from   a species   of Bocella   and possesses    an exceedingly
bitter taste, we purpose calling it picrorocellin. It is remarkable as being
the first crystalline organic substance containing nitrogen which has been
found in the lichens.
   Occasionally specimens of Rocella are met with which have a com
paratively feeble bitter taste ; but hitherto we have been unable to isolate
any crystalline compound from them to which this property might be
 ascribed.
   We have not, as yet, examined the second substance crystallising in
 minute, difficulty soluble needles, and which accompanies picrorocellin in
this lichen, but hope to be able to do so ere long.               "VVe have ascertained,
however, that       it is not merely      a  fatty substance of a nature similar to
rocellic acid, since on boiling it with a dilute solution of sodic hydrate,

on being put aside for some time deposited crystals.                  These, after being
separated from the fluid portion and recrystallized two or three times from

insoluble in water.         This substance has been reserved for further inves

water, and the fluid product         if  poured out and allowed to cool solidified
to a resinous-looking mass.          This, when finely powdered and dissolved in
about three times its weight of boiling spirit, solidified on cooling to a pulp

stance may be  more conveniently prepared, however, by the action of dilute
adds on   picrorocellin, the proportions which gave the most satisfactory
results being 1 part of picroroeellin to 4 of strong hydrochloric acid and
4 of water.   The mixture was boiled for about 8 hours in a flask furnished
with a return condenser, and the product, which still contained some un
altered picrorocellin, was collected, washed, and dissolved in boiling spirit.
On cooling, the xanthorocellin was deposited in slender needles of a pale
yellow colour, which amounted to about 70 per cent, of the picrorocellin
originally employed.     They were easily purified by two or three crystal
lizations from boiling spirit. When dilute sulphuric acid was substituted
for the hydrochloric acid, the results obtained were not so good, oily im
purities seeming to be formed at the same time.      The compound as pre
pared by this process is identical with that obtained when picrorocellin is
subjected to a temperature of 220° in the manner previously described,
both substances   melting at 183°.
   Although xanthorocellin could be prepared with tolerable facility by
the action of dilute hydrochloric acid on picrorocellin, yet it had the dis
advantage that a portion of the latter always remained unattacked ; this
was due, no doubt, to its insolubility in the dilute acid.     It seemed pos
sible that this inconvenience might be obviated by employing an alcoholic
solution of picrorooellin. On making the experiment, it was found that
when an alcoholic solution of the substance was acidulated with hydro
chloric acid and boiled, although xanthorocellin was readily formed, yet in
order to recover it, it was necessary to partly distil off the spirit and then
precipitate with water ; the product was in this case accompanied with
more or less of a tarry matter.     These difficulties, however, were over
come by the use of glacial acetic acid. Picrorocellin dissolved readily in
the boiling acid, andif sufficiently concentrated crystallized out again un
changed  on cooling.   On adding a drop of hydrochloric acid to the hot
colourless solution and again boiling    it,   almost instantly became of

xanthorocellin.    These are stirred up with water, thoroughly washed to
remove adhering acid, and then recrystallized from spirit.      The yield in
this case was found to be 76 per cent, of the picrorocellin employed, and
the alcoholic mother liquors when evaporated left neither tarry residue
nor undecomposed picrorocellin. When dilute sulphuric acid was sub

similar to that observed with the aqueous acid ; xanthorocellin was formed,
but the yield was much smaller, only 56 per cent., owing, doubtless, to
secondary decomposition ; this supposition was corroborated by the fact
that the addition of water to the glacial acetic acid solution precipitated
the crude xanthorocellin as a yellow oil, which only crystallized after it
had been standing for some short time.    This substance is insoluble in
petroleum, and but slightly soluble in hot carbon bisulphide or in ether.

   Xanthorocellin is soluble in warm concentrated sulphuric acid with a
brilliant orange-colour ; but on adding water, the substance is precipitated
unaltered. If the acid solution be strongly heated, however, it effervesces
slightly, and becomes somewhat darker in colour : the addition of water
to this no longer produces a precipitate.
   Xanthorocellin dissolves in cold nitric acid, and if water be at once
added the substance is precipitated apparently unaltered.         On allowing
the nitric acid solution to stand for some time, however, or on gently
heating the mixture, decomposition takes place with the formation of
new compounds.       These may be more conveniently obtained, however,
by the action of nitric acid on the substance dissolved in glacial acetic
acid, in the following manner : — 5 grams of xanthorocellin were dissolved
in 10 c, c. of boiling acetic acid, and the solution rapidly cooled, but with
 out agitation, so as to avoid as much as possible causing the substance to
 crystallize out; 5 c. c. of nitric acid (specific gravity 1'45) were then
 added, the whole thoroughly mixed and gently heated in a water bath
 until the action had set in. When this took place, the source of heat
 was withdrawn, the heat developed by the reaction being sufficient to
 cause the liquid to boil; large quantities of nitrous fumes were given off,
 and lustrous scales soon began to appear in the liquid. If, as sometimes
 happened, the action became too violent and threatened to eject the
 contents from the flask, it was easily moderated by plunging the latter into
 cold water for a few seconds.      As soon as the reaction was complete, the
 contents of the flask were poured into a beaker, and put aside for a few
 hours; the solid crystalline mass thus obtained was then thoroughly in
 corporated with 30 c. c. of spirit, which dissolved nearly every thing except
 the scales. The latter were collected on a Bunsen filter, and washed
 thoroughly with cold spirit, in which they are almost insoluble.           The
 yield of  the new substance   is about 35 per cent, of the xanthorocellin  ori
 ginally taken ; it crystallizes in beautifully white hexagonal plates, which
 do not melt at 275°, but begin to undergo decomposition below that tem
 perature.     The spirituous washings from these crystals, obtained when
 the crude product was treated with alcohol, were allowed to evaporate
 spontaneously, until the latter had disappeared.     On distilling the residue
 in a current of steam, some benzoic aldehyde passed over with the
 aqueous vapour, but no hydrocyanic acid could be detected in the distil
 late.   The crystalline substance left in the retort appears to be a nitro-
 acid of high melting-point, totally different in its properties, however,
 from nitrobenzoic acid. We hope to be able, at some future time, to
 examine the products of this interesting    reaction more fully.

an aqueous solution of sodium hydrate was gradually added until all the
crystals had disappeared, a solution was obtained which, when filtered
and rendered acid with acetic acid, deposited crystals of very pure un
altered picrorocellin equal in weight to about half those originally taken.
   The alcoholic mother liquors on being evaporated left an oily residue
insoluble in water. It was exceedingly soluble in hot spirit, however ; and
the solution,       if sufficiently concentrated, deposited colourless crystals of
a new substance mixed    with more or less picrorocellin.

action of alkalis, a quantity of it was boiled with a concentrated solution

not possess one of the most important of these properties, there is no

        Professor of Natural History, Owens College, Manchester.
        Received May 2, 1876.
                                      (Abstract.)
    Fernt (continued). — Under the name of Eachiopterit corrugate a small
 item of a fern is described, the outer surface of the bark of which is corru
gated with innumerable transverse ridges and furrows.            It has a vascular
axis in its centre composed of several clusters of barred vessels filled with
tylose, which clusters are blended together at their periphery, forming a
cylinder ; its centre is occupied by a cellular medulla, mingled with small
vessels, which sends off radiating prolongations into the vascular cylinder,
partially separating the bundles of the latter. Besides this cylinder is a
second, smaller, isolated oval bundle, which soon escapes from the stem as
the centre of a petiole ; but before it does so a new one is detached from
the opposite side of the central cylinder, which, in turn, imitates its pre
decessor.     Besides these primary bundles, numerous secondary smaller
ones are detached, sometimes from the central cylinder, sometimes from
near the bases of the petiolar bundles ; these probably supplied rootlets.
The author points out that this fern, along with the Anachoropteria
Decaisnii and the Zygopleris Brongniarti of M. Renault, constitute a
group of ferns having a very distinct type of stem-structure different
from what is found in the rhizomes of recent ferns, and which approxi
mates to the lower Lepidodendroid stems a? represented by L. Harcourtii.

 Two kinds of sporangia of fems are described.                 One of these has a
 perfectly    vertical  annulus,  such as is  common     amongst the Polypodiacese.
 A second has a large, horizontal, subterminal annulus, approaching
closely to the form seen in the recent Gleicheniaceae and Schizaeaceae,
especially resembling the latter type.            Both these sporangia contained
spores   ;  in  the  first  mentioned  these were numerous and small ; in the
latter they are fewer in number, but of larger dimensions.               The Gym-
nospermous stems of the Coal-measures are next examined.                 The small
branch of Dadoxylon from Coalbrook Dale, described by the author many
years ago in the Transactions          of the Manchester Literary and Philo
sophical Society, is first restudied.       Its pith is Sternbergian ; its ligneous
zone has a medullary sheath of barred vessels, whilst its woody zone is com
posed   of wedges of diseigerous fibres arranged exogenously and separated
by mural medullary rays.          The disks of the fibres lack the central perfora
tions seen in those of recent conifers.          The bark is exactly like that of a
young shoot of a Taxus, consisting of an inner liber, the tissues of which
are arranged compactly in lines running parallel to each other and to the
surface of the wood ; whilst the outer layer consists of large parenchy-
matous cells, which in the living plant doubtless contained chlorophyl.
It appears to correspond to the phelloderm, no true phellein layer being
present. Other branches, especially from the Ganister beds near Oldham
ami Halifax, are also described.         Many of these are of much larger size,
but all have Sternbergian piths, with the exception of one in which the
parenchymatous medulla is not disciform, but like that of living conifers.
The chief peculiarity in the majority of these latter fossil branches and
twigs is that they give off small twin vascular bundles from the inner
most surface of the ligneous cylinder.           These pass outwards side by side
through the smaller branches, but can only be traced in the innermost
portions of the larger ones ; hence it is probable that they either supplied
leaves arranged in pairs (not distichously),             or that they went to a
binerved     leaf,  the   latter being most    likely to  have been their real des
tination.      The bark is rarely preserved in these larger specimens from
the Ganister ironstones, in which they are associated with myriads of
 Ganiatites, an indication that they have been drifted from a distance and
long exposed to water — conditions very different from those charac
terizing the origin of the coal in which most of the Oldham plants
have been obtained.
   The author discusses the claim set up by M. Brongniart and Professor
Newberry for the admission of Sigillaria amongst the Gymnospermous
exogens, as well as Dr. Dawson's opinion that some of them, at least, have
decided Gymnospermous affinities : but still believes that this determina
tion is not justified by the facts. All the additional observations which he
 has made since the publication of his second and third memo1rs confirm
\M original conclusion that no true distinction can be demonstrated to
 exist between the Sigtilariee and the higher forms of Lepidodendra, iu

 which the vascular cylinder assumes the exogenous Diploxyloid organi
 zation.    All the plants of which stems and branches have been found
 displaying an organization corresponding to that of living Gymnosperms
 are still comprehended within Endlicher's genus Dadoxylon.             On the
other hand, recognizing in Trigonocarpum all the external features of a true
 seed, the author cannot admit the probability of its having belonged to
the Lycopodiaceous     Sigillariee.
    Gymnospermous Seeds. — Attention is next directed to the curious seeds
discovered in America, and published in Professor Newberry's 'Geological
Survey of Ohio.'     These, however, merely display external forms.        Still
more remarkable is the collection of such seeds found by M. Grand-Eury
at St. Etienne in France. These exhibit their internal structure in a
wonderful manner, as is shown by M. Brongniart's brief memoir pub
lished in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles.' M. Brongniart called
                '
attention, in that memoir, to a remarkable organization of the micropylar
extremity of many of these seeds, where a peculiar cavity existed, between
the micropyle and the apex of the nucleus, into which the pollen-grains
obtained entrance through the micropyle, and were thus brought into
contact with the nucleus.          In a more recent memoir on the fertiliza
tion of the ovules      of   some    species of recent Cycads (Ceratozamice),
M. Brongniart showed that         a mammillar prolongation of the apex of the
nucleus projected    into   the   micropyle, which it filled ; but that during
fertilization the cells of this prolongation became disorganized, and a
cavity was produced into which the pollen-grains found their way, the
apex of the nucleus below this cavity becoming covered over by true peri-
spermic membrane. These structural peculiarities so far accord with what
he observed in M. Grand-Eury's seeds, as to lead him to surmise that the
latter had Cycadean rather than Coniferous affinities.
   The author has found a number of remarkable seeds of a similar type
to those from St. Etienne in the Oldham nodules, and he has been in
debted to his friends     Mr. Butterworth and Mr. Nield, of Oldham, and
to Captain Aitken, of Bacup, for a few others.
   The first of these is a very small, nearly spherical seed, which the
author names Lagenostoma avoides, about -16 of an inch in length
and 1 in breadth.
      •
                        It has a solid testa, within which can be recognized
                                                             "
two distinct membranes — an inner or " perispermic              one, which has
                                              "         "
enclosed the endosperm, and an outer or nucular one, which has been in
close contact with the perispermic one throughout the greater part of
the seed, but which splits up at its apex into two portions, the inner one
of which forms a remarkable flask-shaped cavity, which the author de
signates the lagenostome.        Its base has rested upon the apex of the peri-
sperm, and its upper extremity has been continuous with the micropyle.
Within this lagenostome is a little delicate parenchyma, which has shrunk
up towards the centre of the cavity, leaving a surrounding space in
which, in some examples, the author has found the objects regarded by

 1876.]              Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures.                    71
M. Brongniart     as pollen-grains — an opinion in which the author concurs.
 External to the lagenostome the second or outer division of the nucular
membrane     forms a remarkable     " canopy," which
                                                       hangs down from the
micropyle, enclosing the lagenostome within ten sharply defined and
regular crescentic folds, the concavities of which are directed outwards.
The walls of this lagenostome and of the " canopy " correspond with the
nucular membrane in consisting of flattened prosenchymatous cells. The
perispermic membrane, on the other hand, looks structureless, save that it
appears to have had imbedded in it an innumerable multitude of
minute crystals, like those observed by Dr. Hooker on the spicular cells
of Welwitsehia.
    A second species the author designates Lagenostoma physoides. In this
the apex of the endospermic sac contracts into a mammilliform prolonga
tion, overlapped by the base of the lagenostome, which overhangs it as a
bladder half-full of water might be made to overhang the neck of a soda-
water bottle upon which it rested. This species has other distinctive
structural peculiarities.
   Tor  a second genus     of new seeds the author proposes the name of
Conostoma.     C. oblonga from Oldham is about '18 of an inch in length.
Here, again, we have an endosperm enclosed in a perispermic membrane,
and this in turn is encased within a nucular one, the whole being invested
by a dense testa. The lagenostome is again formed out of divisions of
the apical part of the nucular membrane ; but it assumes a funnel-shape
at its base, whilst its upper extremity is continuous with the micropyle.
A second species, named C. ovalis, is from the Burntisland deposit, and is
more ovate than C. oblonga. In it the lagenostome assumes a remarkably
funnel-shaped contour.       The same deposit has furnished a third species,
C. intermedia. To another remarkable seed from Oldham the author
gives the name of Malacotesta oblonga, of which the maximum length,
exclusive of its funiculus, has been about '25. Its exotesta has been
soft and parenchymatous, with a prosenchymatous inner (nucular ?)
membrane.      The micropyle has been remarkably wide with incurved
margins at the exostome, and enclosing a mass of delicate parenchyma
through which a canal passed.
   The author has obtained a fine series both of longitudinal and trans
verse sections of Trigonocarpum olivceforme, the seed long ago made the
subject of a valuable memoir by Dr. Hooker and Mr. Binney.              So far
M the longitudinal    sections are concerned, the results obtained correspond
closely with those already arrived at by these two authors, except that
a modified form of lagenostome is shown to have existed at the apex of the
nucleus.    The transverse sections show that the two layers of the testa,
an outer soft parenchymatous exotesta and an inner sclerotesta, present
some striking features.      The exterior of the latter has exhibited three
 principal, acute, prominent, longitudinal ridges, between each two of
 which are three intermediate ones, the centre of these three being

72              On the    Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures.           [May 18,
rounded,    and the two flanking ones acute. The internal cavity of the
endotesta is prolonged like a narrow fissure only into each of the three
principal ridges. The ordinary sandstone specimens of Trigonocarpum
olivceforme   commonly seen in cabinets do not represent, as has hitherto
been supposed, the exterior of these seeds, but are casts of the interior
of the sclerenchymatous endotesta, the three thin, longitudinal, wing-like
appendages being merely casts of the three slit-like extensions of that
interior just referred to. These slits extend upwards into the prolonged
micropyle, the interior of which displays a triangular section, each of the
sides of which is convex, the convexity projecting inwards.
    The nomenclature of this type of seed is in great confusion, owing to
specific differences being based on mere differences of size, many of which
are probably nothing more than varieties due to age and development.
    Casts of seeds with six longitudinal wings are described, corresponding
with Brongniart's genus Hexapterospermum. They are more oblong
than    Trigonocarpum olivcrforme, but apparently identical with the T.
                     '
N1jggerathi of the Fossil Flora.' The author doubts the wisdom of Brong
niart's establishment of a separate genus for these seeds.
    Several species of the important genus Cardiocarpum                 have been
 obtained displaying     the  internal organization   of these  remarkable seeds.
 They all agree in possessing a central endosperm which is remark
 able for the very large size of its conspicuous parenchymatous cells.
                   '
 This is invested by a perispern1ic membrane, the whole being enclosed
within a testa composed of two very distinct and separate layers. A
 thin inner one, which may be identical with the nucular membrane of
 other seeds, is entirely composed of delicate prosenchymatous cells, and
 is prolonged into an elongated micropyle, into which the endosperm is not
prolonged.      Externally to this is an exotesta composed of a denser
 parenchyma. In some species this latter tissue is uniform throughout, in,
 others it is separable into a dense endotesta and a more lax parenchymatous'
 exotesta.    The first species described is apparently identical with the C.
 anomalum of Carruthers, and has a trigonous endosperm invested by the
 two layers of testa (?), both of which are prolonged into a slender tapering
 beak, half the entire length of the seed, and which contains the elongated
 micropyle.     Another species, designated C. compressum, has its apparent
 testa composed (as just described) of two continuous layers. In it the mi
 cropyle is comparatively       short, and its apical extremity is patulous or
 trumpet-shaped.       To a third very beautiful little cordato-lanceolate species
 with a peduncle or funiculus equal in length to the seed, the author gives
  the name of Cardiocarpum Butterworthii, after its discoverer. These seeds
 exhibit no specialized organ corresponding to the lagenostome of Lage-
 nostoma and other seeds described.        The pollen has passed down the long
 narrow micropyle into the triangular space at its inner extremity, where
 it came into direct contact with the endospermic membrane. It thus
 appears that the seeds known by the name of Cardiocarpum have a very

simple organization,     approximating   somewhat closely to that of the ovulea
of Jtmipen1s, Cdllitrie, and Welwitsehia.
   Some small seeds, which appear to be identical with the Cardiocarpum
tfnellum of Dawson, found in great numbers on slabs of shale by Mr.
John Smith, of Kilwinning, in Ayrshire, are described. They were found
in the upper Coal-measures near Stonehouse in Lanarkshire.
   The last form noticed is a very curious winged seed from the upper
most Coal-measures of Ardwick, at Manchester, and which appears to
have been a double seed, resembling in general form the samara of an
ash.     It belongs to Brongniart's genus Polypterospermum.
   The fact that large numbers of seeds of unmistakable flowering plants
exhibit very close resemblance to the ovule* of G-ymnospermous seeds
is a very important one.          Prof. Newberry has obtained such seeds in
America ; M. Grand-Eury has done the same thing in France ; and it now
appears that, though attention has but very recently been drawn to the
existence of the smaller forms now described in the British Coal-measures,
the discovery of a considerable variety has already rewarded the researches
of the author and his auxiliary friends.       There is no doubt that further
research    will materially increase that number. The question naturally
arises,   where    are  the   Gymnospermous      plants  to which   these seeds
                                                           "
belonged ?     Finding the latter in the thin " upper-foot   coal-seam suggests
that other remains of their parent stems should also be found there.
The Dadoxylons are the only ones which exhibit any probability of such
relationship. But these have chiefly been found in the marine Ganister
bed, which underlies the upper-foot coal from which the majority of the
seeds have been derived, indicating that the Dadoxylons grew apart from
the Calamites and Lycopods abounding in the coal side by side with the
seeds.     Time alone can solve these problems, as well as others relating
to the true homologies of some of the structures contained within these
seeds.
V. " On Stratified Discharges. — II. Observations with a Revolv
       ing Mirror."        By WILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE, M.A., Treas. R.S.
       Received May 3, 1876.
   In   a paper published      in Poggendorffs   '

A. Wiillner     has   described a series of observations made, by means of a
revolving mirror, upon the discharge of a large inductiou-coil through
tubes containing ordinary atmospheric air at various degrees of pressure.
When,     as is generally    the case with an induction-spark, the discharge
occupies an appreciable interval of time, the image in the mirror appears
spread out to a breadth proportional to the duration and to the velocity
of rotation.      The successive phases of the phenomena then appear, as
usual, arranged      in successive positions, and may be studied separately,
even when too rapid to be disentangled        by the unassisted eye.

74          Mr. W. Spottiswoode       on Stratified -Discharges.       [May 18,
    Wiilluer's observations appear to have been directed rather to the
nature of the coil-discharge than to that of the stratifications ; and some
of his principal conclusions are accordingly of the following kind, viz.
that at low pressures, i. e. down to 1 millim., when the discharge was
stratified, the striae showed an intermittence of intensity indicating
either a pulsation within the duration of the main discharge or a break
ing up of the main into a series of partial discharges.               At greater
pressures, e.g.    at  26 millims., when  almost all trace of stratification was
lost, this breaking up into partial discharges (especially at the com
mencement) was distinctly perceptible.         At yet greater pressures, t. e.
from 40 millims. to 75 millims., a cloudy kind of stratification showed
itself;    but, excepting a bright flash at the outset, no appearance of
partial discharge was visible.        The observations, which were at first
directed to capillary tubes, were extended to tubes of various diameters,
and also included the effect of a magnet on the discharge.
    For some time prior to the publication of the volume in question           I
had been engaged upon a series of experiments very similar in their
general disposition, but with a somewhat different object in view, viz.
the character and behaviour of the strioe ; and of these, together with
some     recent additions,   I  now propose to offer a short account to the
 Society.
    My general instrumental arrangements appear to have been similar to
 those of Wiillner ; in fact they could hardly have been very different.
 The tubes were attached to the coil in the usual way, and a contact-
 breaker of the ordinary form with its own electromagnet was in the first
instance used.        By suitably adjusting the velocity of the mirror to the
 rapidity   of the  contact-breaker  the image could be kept tolerably steady
 in the field of view. In order to obtain greater steadiness a special
 contact-breaker was next devised.          This was mechanically connected
 with the spindle of the mirror, and so arranged as to break the current
 when the image was in the centre of the field of view.          The only point
 in this part of the apparatus which requires special notice is the fact
 that this contact-breaker, like all others, should be placed in close
 proximity to the condenser of the coil, otherwise a great loss of light
 is sustained.     For the last-mentioned form there was finally substituted
 a mercurial    break (successfully arranged by my assistant, Mr. Ward),
 the plunger of which works on a cam attached to the axle of the mirror ;
 so that the action of the contact-breaker        is regulated by that of the
 mirror, instead of the reverse as in the former arrangement.           With the
 broader tubes a slit was used ; with the narrower this adjunct was less
 necessary; while with capillary tubes, such as are used for spectrum-
  analysis, it could be dispensed with altogether.
    In experiments for comparing the unstratified statical discharge with
 the stratified at the same pressure of gas within the tube, and for ob
 serving the transition from one to the other, a Leyden jar and a spark

 of air, the length of which could be regulated at pleasure, were intro
duced into the secondary circuit.
   Striae as observed by the eye have been divided into two classes, viz.
the flake-like and the flocculent or cloudy.            Of the former those pro
duced in hydrogen-tubes         may be taken as a type ; of the latter those
produced     in   carbonic-acid    tubes.     But upon examining some tubes
especially selected for the purpose, it was found that, while to this appa
rent difference a real difference corresponds, a fundamental feature of
the striae underlying both was brought out.
   The feature in question was this : that the striae, at whatever points pro
duced, appear to have generally during the period of their existence a
motion along the tube in a direction from the negative towards the positive
terminal. This motion, which          I  have called, for convenience, the proper
motion of the striae, is for given circumstances of tube and current gene
rally uniform; and its variations in velocity are at all times confined
within very narrow limits. The proper motion in this sense appertains,
strictly speaking, to the flake-like striaa only.           The apparent proper
motion of    the   flocculent  striae  is, on the  contrary, variable not only in
Telocity, but also in direction ; and on further examination it turns out
that the flocculent striae are themselves compounded of the flake-like,
                I
which latter have on that account called elementary striae.
   Elementary striae are in general produced at regular intervals along
the tube.     The series extends from the positive terminal in the direction
of the negative to a distance depending upon the actual circumstances
of the tube and current.         The length of the column, and consequently
the number of the striae, depends mainly upon the resistance of the tube,
the duration of the entire current, and, to a certain extent, upon the
amount of the battery-surface exposed; and in that sense upon the
strength of the current.        The velocity of the proper motion, other cir
cumstances being the same, depends upon the number of cells employed;
in other words, upon the electromotive force.
   The appearances of the striae, however, their essential features, and
the conclusions which may be drawn from them will be better appre
hended by means of sketches, even though imperfect, than by mere
description   ; and   I therefore   subjoin a few examples.
   Fig. 1 represents the appearance of (in the mirror) a carbonic-acid
tube with the slit attached.         This tube, viewed by the eye, shows flake-
like fluttering striae, with a slight tendency to flocculency near the head
of the column.         The commencement of the discharge is at the right
hand, and the negative terminal at the top.             The drawing fairly repre
sents the appearance of the upper part or head of the column of striae
during one complete coil-discharge.           When the battery-surface exposed
is small, the whole consists of, first, three or four columns of striae of
decreasing length, and afterwards of an almost unbroken field of striae.
Each of the initial columns is perfectly stratified ; and the same disposi

76         Mr. W. Spottiswoode      on  Stratified Discharges.    [May 18,
tion of  striae prevails throughout  the entire discharge.  The striae which
fill the main part of the field present a proper motion nearly uniform,
but slightly diminishing towards the end. These striae are for the most
part unbroken, but are occasionally interrupted at apparently irregular
intervals.     When the battery-surface is increased the elementary striae
are more broken, and near the head of the column the interruptions
occur as in the figure.       The separation of the earlier part of the dis
charged into striated columns divided by intervening rifts does not,
with the exception of the first, extend far towards the positive terminal.
Nevertheless, even as far as the positive terminal itself, there seems at
times to be a fuller development of discharge than is subsequently main
tained.
                                    'Fig. 1 .
    The first rift in the discharge, following the first outburst, is some
 times distinguishable even as far as the positive terminal ; and perhaps
 in those cases indicates a real cessation of the discharge. This is corro
 borated by the fact that a similar interruption is then perceptible in tha
 glow surrounding the negative terminal; but after this the negative

glow    retains its unbroken character throughout the entire period of the
discharge.
    The stratified columns       with their intervening rifts are sometimes
reproduced towards the close of the discharge ; but this appears to take
place only when the battery is in an unusual condition of energy, and
disappears when, as in the bichromate battery, polarization of the plates
rapidly takes place.        On these occasions especially, but also at other
times, traces may be seen of the faint lines of light connecting the posi
tive with the negative parts of the discharge mentioned by Wiillner in
the paper quoted above.
    Other tubes, when viewed by the eye, show flaky striae more or less
difficult to distinguish from one another.          Observed in the mirror, they
show much the same phenomena as the tube figured above, except that
the striae are rather more crowded together and slightly more broken.
This is the case especially with ammonia-tubes, in some of which the
striae are undistinguishable       by the eye, and which accordingly give the
impression      of an unstratified   column of light.
    Fig. 2 represents the appearance in the mirror of another carbonic-
acid tube with a current similar to that used in the former case. Viewed
 by the eye   it  shows flocculent striae, each having a contour sharply defined
towards the negative terminal, loosely defined towards the positive.           The
 following description of the phenomena, taken from my earlier notes,
 may now be regarded as a description of the apparent proper motion of
 the flocculent as distinguished       from the elementary striae : — " The dis
 charge opens with a considerable rush, indicated by the bright line at
 the commencement.          There   is no other indication of partial discharges.
 Proper motion at first towards the negative, afterwards towards the
 positive terminal.     In this, as in other tubes giving striae of this kind,
 ripples may be observed on the curve         of proper motion."
    So   far my older notes; but on closer examination,             and when the
 battery- surface exposed is sufficiently     reduced, the entire field is seen to
 be  traversed by elementary striae having a normal proper motion. When
 the battery-surface      is gradually increased, the elementary striae, espe
 cially  near  the  head  of the column, have their duration shortened so as
 to leave   dark intervals at regular stages in the column.        These successive
 short-lived elementary striae      form  a series  of diagonal  lines, each series
 of which traces a sketch of a flocculent stria.           As the surface is still
 further increased     these diagonal lines appear more and more crowded
 together,   until at last they blend into unbroken flocculent striae.
    This compound nature and mode of formation may be taken as a
  general characteristic of the flocculent striae.       In some tubes it is more
  easily brought out, in others only with greater difficulty.           In some it
  can hardly be verified experimentally without a loss of light so great as
  to mask the phenomenon.          The apparent proper motion of the flocculent
  »trie depends, as is easily seen, upon       the position  at which the elemen

 78        Mr. W. Spottiswoode      on Stratified Discharges.     [May 18,
 tary striae are replaced. If they are replaced in the positions which
 their predecessors held, the flocculent striae will appear straight in the
 mirror ; if they are replaced successively nearer the positive terminal,
 the apparent proper motion will be in the normal direction ; if nearer
 the negative, it will be reversed.
                                    Fig. 2.
   An ether-tube examined in the       same way showed nearly the same
features as the last.    The elementary striae were, however, not so easily
separable ; and the flocculent striae were formed as usual at an earlier
stage near the head of the column than near the foot of it.
   In another carbonic-acid tube the proper motion of the flocculent striae
was coincident in direction with that of the elementary ; and the latter
were consequently more difficult to disentangle.     One point in this tube
was particularly noticeable, viz. that as the column of flocculent stria
retreated, so did the negative glow advance. The two remained through
out the entire discharge the same distance apart.
   Fig. 3 represents the discharge in    a hydrogen-tube   of conical form,

 the diameter of which varied from capillary size to ^ inch, the capillary
 end being at the bottom.          The positive terminal is at the top. The
principal   interest  of this  tube   consists in showing the influence of dia
meter upon the velocity of proper motion.                The wider the tube the

freer, it seems, the striae are to move.          The same fact may be observed
by comparing       tubes   differing   in  diameter,   but in other respects the
same ; but the conical tube brings out the fact in the most striking
manner.
   Fig. 4 represents a chloroform-tube, in which a piece of cotton-wool
had been   inserted with a view of ascertaining whether any motion would
be communicated       to it by the current.       This proved to be the case ; but
I do not attempt     here   to  describe   the   phenomenon.    To the unassisted
eye the discharge was extremely brilliant ; it passed in a column not
quite straight, but in a writhing snake-like curve, with flaky striae at
                                         Fig. 4.

 intervals through       its length.   When viewed in the mirror the stria)
 were seen to spread themselves out with slight, but irregular, proper
 motion.      With an increased battery-surface, or with a greater num
 ber of cells, but more notably with the latter, not only were the striae
 lengthened, but from several of the long elementary striae shorter ones
 were thrown out nearly at right angles to the former.             These were of
 short duration, and had great proper motion.           The general appearance
 of these compound striae was that of branches of fir trees, the twigs of
 which represented the permanent striae, and the leaves the secondary.
     Beside these, a large (Geissler's " hydrocarbon ") tube was examined
 with a magnet the pole of which was placed near the head of the
 column ; and in order to trace more in detail the effect of the magnet, its
 strength was varied by raising or lowering the battery-plates.               The
general character of the discharge without the magnet was very similar
to that represented in fig. 1.          On slightly lowering the plates of the
 magnet-battery      the  discharge  spread itself over a greater breadth than
before.     At   the same time the elementary striae, which had for the most
 part   been continuous,     were now broken up into short lengths, presenting
 the first features     of flocculent striae. On further lowering the plates
 these flocculent strias became more and more developed until the whole
 field in the neighbourhood of the magnetic pole became filled with such
 striae.   It is well known that one effect of the magnetic field is to bring
 out striae in portions of tubes where no striae were visible before, and
 also that the striaB so brought out present a flocculent appearance ; but
the revolving mirror shows this fact in a more decisive manner. Another
effect of the magnetic field is to drive the discharge to one side of the
tube in accordance with Ampere's law —in other words, to constrict the
discharge.      In narrower tubes than the one here described, the constric
tion   goes so   far as to imitate the appearance of a   capillary tube ; and this
effect is borne out by the revolving mirror. The intensification of the
discharge and its concomitant phenomena within the range of the mag
netic field are in accordance with the experiment of Faraday, wherein he
 showed the increased loudness of the report perceptible on breaking a
current in between the poles of a magnet.
                                                      I
    In a carbonic-acid tube (Gassiot's No. 454) have succeeded in start
ing with a very weak current, capable of producing only elementary striae,
 and thence passing to the production of flocculent striae, either by
strengthening the battery-current, or by inducing upon the existing cur
rent the action of a magnetic field. The identification of the results of
these two independent processes, especially when combined with the com
parison made above of the effect of magnetism with that of narrowing
the tube, can hardly fail to have some important signification in the ulti
mate theory of the striae.
    Besides the tubes above mentioned many others were tried          ; but these
will probably suffice for the present purpose.

 1876.]         Mr. W. Spottiswoodc         on Stratified Discharges.             81
    The following are some of the general conclusions to which the fore
going experiments       seem to lead  : —
    I.  The thin flake-like striae, when sharp and distinct in their appear
ance, either are short-lived or have very slow proper motion, or both.'
    II. The apparent irregularity in the distribution of such strioe, during
even a single discharge of the coil, is due, not to any actual irregularity
in their arrangement, but to their unequal duration and to the various
periods at which they are renewed.           These striae are, in fact, arranged at
regular intervals throughout the entire column.            The fluttering appear
ance usually noticeable is occasioned by slight variations in position of
the elementary striae at successive discharges of the coil.           With a view
to divesting the coil-discharge of this irregular character, as well as for
 other purposes,    I  devised two different forms of contact-breakers (one of
 which is described in the Eoyal Society's 'Proceedings,' vol.xxiii. p. 45.3);
 but   I postpone a description of the second, as well as of the experiments
 arising from its use, to another occasion.
     III.  The proper motion of the elementary strioe is that which apper
 tains to them during a single discharge of the coil. This appears to be
 generally directed from the positive towards the negative terminal. Its
 velocity varies generally within very narrow limits.             It is greater the
 greater the number of coils employed, or the greater the electromotive
 force of the current.       In some tubes it may be seen to diminish towards
 the close of the discharge ; and even in rare instances alternately to
 increase and to diminish during a single discharge.
     IV. Flocculent striae, such as are usually seen in carbonic-acid tubes,
 are a compound phenomenon.             They are due to a succession of short
 lived elementary striae, which are regularly renewed. The positions at
 which they are renewed determine the apparent proper motion of the
 elementary striae.      If  they are constantly renewed at the same positions
 in the tube, the flocculent striae will appear to have no proper motion
 and to remain steady.          If they are renewed at positions nearer and
 nearer to the positive terminal,       the proper motion will be the same as
  that of the elementary striae ;     if  they are renewed at positions further
  and further     from the positive terminal, the proper motion will be
  reversed.
     V. The    velocity of proper motion varies, other circumstances being the
  same,   with  the diameter of the tube. This was notably exemplified in
  the conical tube. In tubes constructed for spectrum-analysis the capil
  lary part shows very slight, while the more open parts often show consi
  derable proper motion.
      VI. Speaking generally, the discharge lasts longer in narrow than in
  wide tubes. In spectrum-tubes the capillary part gives in the mirror an
  image extending far beyond that due to the wider parts.
      VII. The coil-discharge appears, in the earlier part of its development
   at least, to be subject to great fluctuations in extent.        In all cases there
      VOL. XXV.                                                           O

82         Mr. W. Spottiswoode        on Stratified Discharges.        [May 18,
is a strong outburst at f1rst.     This, although sometimes appearing as a
bright line, is always,  I  believe, really stratified.   Immediately after this
there follows a very rapid shortening of the column.           The extent of this
shortening varies with circumstances ; but when, as is often the case, it
reaches far down towards the positive terminal, a corresponding diminu
tion of intensity is perceptible in the negative glow. The column of
striae, after rising again, is often subject to similar fluctuations.      These,
which are sometimes four or five in number, are successively of less and
less extent, and reach only a short distance down the column or striae.
The rifts due to these fluctuations then disappear, and the striae either
continue without interruption, or follow broken at irregular intervals,
until the close of the discharge.
   VIII. The effect of the proper motion, taken by itself, is to shorten
the column of striae.      But, as we have seen, the striae are in many cases
renewed from time to time.         In regard to this point, the head of the
column presents the most instructive features.            After the cessation of
these rifts, the general appearance of the field is that of a series of
diagonal lines commencing at successive points which form the bounding
limit of the column at successive instants of time. If the points are
situated in a horizontal line, the striae are renewed at regular intervals at
the same place ; and the length of the column is maintained by a periodic
renewal of striae, a new one appearing at the head of the column as
Boon as its predecessor has passed over one dark interval.           If the boun
dary of the illuminated field rises, the length of the column increases ; if
it descends, the column shortens. In every case, however, the growth of
the column takes place by regular and successive steps, and not irregu
larly. The intervals of the new striae from one another and from the old
ones are the same as those of the old ones from one another.
   IX. The principal influence of a change in the electromotive force
appears to consist in altering the velocity of proper motion.           A change
in   the  amount of battery-surface        exposed produces a corresponding
change in the duration of the entire discharge, as well as apparently in
the development of some of the minor details of the striae.
   X. When the proper motion of the elementary striae exceeds a certain
amount, the striae appear to the eye to be blended into one solid column
of light, and all trace of stratification is lost. When this is the case
the mirror will often disentangle the individual striaa.          But there are,
as might well be expected, cases in which even the mirror is of no avail,
but in which we may .still suppose that stratification exists. A variety
of experiments have led me to think that the separation of the discharge
into two parts, viz. the column of light extending from the positive
terminal, and the glow around the negative, with a dark space interven
ing, may be a test of stratified discharge ; but        I cannot affirm any thing
certainly  on  this point.

VI. " The          Calculus of Chemical Operations.— Part II. On the
           Analysis of Chemical Events." By Sir B. C. BRODIE, Bart.,
           P.R.S., late Professor of Chemistry in the University of Oxford.
           Received January 13, 1876.
                               (Abstract.)
  Introduction. — An account is here given of the origin of our views of
the constitution of ponderable matter, regarded as constituted of units
compounded of "simple weights."       These considerations lead to two
systems, and two only, in which the unit of hydrogen is respectively
expressed by the symbols a and a". Between these systems we have no
absolute means of selection ; but a preference is here given to the system
a as immediately leading to the law of even numbers.
  The exception presented by the binoxide of nitrogen is then considered,
and an hypothesis suggested to account for this anomaly.
   The object of the work is then defined — namely, given a chemical
event, how are we to determine the events of which it is compounded ?
   Section I. — The question of tJ1e Mulfyrtication and Division of chemical
equations is here considered.       It is shown that we may multiply and
divide a chemical equation of the form u = 0 by any chemical function,
if the sum of the numerical coefficients in that equation is equal to zero,
but otherwise not.      A method is given by which every chemical equation
may be brought under this form.
                                                                       "
                                        Such an equation is termed a nor
      "
mal     chemical equation, for it is an equation on which we may operate
by the rules of elementary algebra.
   It is then shown that every chemical expression of the form A (x—a)
(y— b), and also A (x—a) (y—b) (?—c) • • • (that      is, the continued pro
duct of any number of such factors more than one), necessarily =0.
   As regards the interpretation of normal chemical equations.        Normal
equations express     the identity of the two members   of  the equation, not
only as regards matter, but as regards matter and space also. Thus the
equation    l   2a£=2a+£, asserts not only that the matter of two units
                 +
of water      identical with the matter of two units of hydrogen and unit
                is                                                     a
     oxygen, but also that an empty unit of space and the space occupied
of by of
     two units of water are identical with the space occupied     bytwo units
    hydrogen and     aunit of oxygen.
   It      further shown that in any chemical equation any one of the
           is
prime factors of the equation may be substituted for another, and the
equation will still be true.
   Section II. — Our knowledge of the identity of matter     is derived from
chemical transmutations             and every chemical equation may be
                             or events   ;
regarded as the record of such an event or some number of such events.
Chemical events may be regarded as compound or simple.    A compound
event   defined as an event which
           is                           regarded in the system of events
                                             is

   Section              III.
                 On the causes of events. — The cause                                                of an event is
given when the operations are denned by the agency of which the event
occurs.   Def.               If
                  in any chemical event the change in the arrangement
of the symbols, by which the composition of the units of matter before and
after the event respectively is symbolized, be of such a nature that where
in the arrangement before the event the symbol x appears the symbol
« appears after the event, and where a appears before x appears after,
so that the two arrangements differ in this respect and this respect alone,
then the event occurs by the substitution of a for x, which is the " cause"
of the event. Hence the same event may arise from more than one
cause.   Thus, for example, the event
                        Axy + Aab = Ay a + Axb
occurs by the substitution of a for x and of b for y, for these symbols
satisfy the condition given in the above definition.
   It is similarly shown that the event
                      Axyz   4- Aabz + Aayc + Axbc                 = Axyc        -+-   Aabc   +   Aayz   +   Axbz
occurs            by   the substitution  for       of        for x,
                                                for c; and, further, that
                                                         a
                                                                                                                             r) if

        If                   any symbol, say 'a'=l, the event occurs by
              in these substitutions
the transference of the simple weight thus symbolized.
   The following event occurs in three ways by the substitution                                                     of   {   for

mical event be capable of expression as the continued product of rational
factors of the form previously given (x — a), x and a being prime factors
of the equation, the event is a simple event incapable of further resolu
tion ; but occasionally the equations to events may be expressed by
rational factors, although not of this form. In this case they admit of
an easy analysis into other events of which they are the aggregates.
Take, for example, the equation
                                   a\2 + 2au= 2a\ + aw3,
                                   a(x + <--2)(x-W)                    = 0,

This equation      is   of the form

"Note on a Simultaneous               Disturbance       of the Barometer        and
       of the Magnetic Needle."           By the Rev. S.       J.  PERRY,    F.R.S.
       Received      April 27, 1876.
   As any question of the connexion between the different phenomena of
nature may be of interest,      I will venture to call attention to an observa
tion made, in February last, in China, which tends to establish a fresh link
between terrestrial magnetism and meteorology.
   From the curves that accompany this note (p. 91),        it would seem that the
same cause may be capable of producing a simultaneous              perturbation of
the barometer and of the suspended magnets.
   At   the newly established observatory of Zi-Ka-'Wei, near Shanghai,
no very considerable disturbances of the magnetic elements have been ob
served in 1874 and 1875 ; but on February 20, 1876, the director, the Eev.
M. Dechevrens, S.J., had the good fortune to notice the first irregularities
of any great extent that had ever been observed in China ; and these
movements were found afterwards to be almost identical in all their in
flexions with those traced by the mercury in the barometric curve.              The
first observations on the morning        of   the   20th  showed    an increase of
westerly declination and of dip, with a diminution of the horizontal com
ponent of the intensity, the observed value of H.F. being the least ever
recorded at this station.      From 10" 32m A.M. Mr. Dechevrens was able
to give hii whole attention to the declination-magnet, which was then
moving westward with a rising barometer.               The barometer attained a
maximum       about    10" 48m   A.M., followed     by two westerly maxima of
declination     at 11 A.M. and 11.40.       From    10" 48m until shortly after 4
P.M. the barometer fell rapidly, the magnet in the mean time moving
almost constantly in an easterly direction, attaining its least declination
of 1° 55'-07 W, at 4* 24" P.M. The amplitude of the declination dis
turbance was Ky-33, a large amount if we consider that the mean diur-
nal range scarcely exceeds 21-5 in the winter months.             On the previous
evening    the  possing clouds appeared    to  be lit up on their borders,  possibly
by an aurora.         A N.E. wind blew very constantly throughout the day,
and the rain     fell from 3 P.M. until the following morning.

        onboard H.M.S. 'Challenger.'            Communicated by Professor
        WYVILLE THOMSON, F.R.S., Director of the Civilian Scientific
        Staff.    Received May 5, 1876.
     On 14th February, 1876, in lat. 37° 17' 8., long. 53° 52' W., off the
 mouth of the     Eio de la Plata, the trawl brought up from 600 fathoms a
 number of specimens of corals of the family Stylasteridae (Gray *). The
 specimens included six genera of the family and seven species. They
 were all in most excellent preservation, notwithstanding the fact that
 they had been slowly raised from 600 fathoms, and all had their genera
 tive organs in full development.      An opportunity which had long been
 desired was thus afforded for making a detailed examination of the struc
 ture of the soft parts of this family, which, in the structure of its coralla,
 shows so many points of variance from that of Zoauthariau coralla. From
 observations made on a species of Stylaster obtained from 500 fathoms
 off the Meangis Islands, and on a Cryptohelia, a short account of which
 is given in the Eoyal Society's ' Proceedings,' vol. xxiv. p. 63,         I had
 already been led to suspect that the Stylasteridae might prove to be
 Hydroids, although     I did not venture to express this opinion because the
 evidence was then insufficient.     The examination of the series of forms
 obtained off the Eio de la Plata at once showed that the Stylasteridae are
 true Hydroids.
    Unfortunately the trawl came up rather late in the day, and hence a
 very short period of daylight was available for the examination of the
 animals in the fresh condition ; but it sufficed for the sketching of the male
 gonophores of a new genus of Stylasteridoe (Polypora), with the stages
 of development of the spermatozoa, and of the female gonophores of
    Portions of the corals were preserved by means of chromic acid, osmic
 acid,  absolute   alcohol,  and  glycerine ; and they were subsequently
 examined    in the usual    manner by means of sections.         In cutting the
 sections,  a new method, described by Mihakowics, 'Arch, fiir mikro-
 skopische Anatomie,' ii. Bd. 3 Hft. p. 386, was adopted, and found to
 yield most astonishingly successful results.     The method seems to supply a
 want  long felt of a means of cutting fine sections of structures the parts
 of which are very loosely held together, and where it is desirable to main
 tain the exact relations in position of parts which in the sections often
 become    entirely disconnected from one another.           Mihakowics used his
 method for sections of vertebrate embryos ; it is certainly the best pos
 sible method for the investigation of decalcified tissues, such as those of
'Corals or Echinoderms.       A strong jelly, composed of equal parts of gly
 cerine and gelatine, is used as an imbedding substance ; it permeates
                     * Ann. nml Mag. Nat, H1st. vol. rix. (1847).

94                             Mr. H. N. Moseley         on the                 [June 15,
the tissues, and takes the place of the hard calcareous supporting struc
tures which have been removed by the acid. The sections are mounted
1n glycerine, and the imbedding              substance, which is left 1n situ in the
sections, becomes         perfectly transparent, in fact almost invisible in this
fluid.    I  stain the decalcified corals with carmine, then soak them in gly
cerine, and then transfer them directly to the warm fluid jelly, instead
of treating them first with absolute alcohol after staining, as does Miha-
kowies.      A teaspoon heated in hot water is a most convenient instrument
for transferring the small masses of tissue, with the fluid jelly, to the
cavities in the hardened liver used as an imbedding base.                    I have dwelt
upon this method because it seems to me likely to be one which will
prove of the greatest service in all kinds of difficult histologieal problems,
such as Corti's organ, early stages of embryos, retina, &e.                    It is quite
possible by the method to obtain sections of a single hydroid sporosac or
pianola.
   The Stylasteridae obtained off the Eio de la Plata comprised six genera,
viz. : — Stylaster ; Cryptohelia ; Allopora ; Errina ; a new genus, Polypora ;
and a further new genus allied to Errina, which                       I propose to term
Acanthopora.            There   is  much    confusion    as   to the    determination       of
even the genera of the Stylasteridae, and                 I  have found it impossible
to determine species in the absence of specimens for comparison.                         The
Stylaster appears probably to be S. ervibeseens                  of Powrtales*.          The
 Cryptohelia is the same            as  that  obtained    all  over   the world by the
                 '
•
  Challenger         in deep water, and apparently not specifically distinct
from C. pvtdica t.             Of the Allopora        I   cannot determine the spe
cies. There is one coral which appears to belong to the genus Errina,
Gray J, of which a further diagnosis is given from the type specimens
by Saville Kent §, and one of the allied new genus Acanthopora'.                         The
whole of the classification of the Stylasteridae will need revision on the
more certain basis of the knowledge of the structure of the soft parts.
In the older regions of its stem Lepidopora appears to assume the
character of a Stylaster.               The coral for the reception of which                 I
form the new genus Polypora differs markedly from other members of
the family;        I   at first took it to be a Millepora with unusually large
zooids.
    The genus may         be thus characterized, as     far  as the hard parts are con
cerned    : —
                                       Genus POLYPOBA.
    Corallum pure          white, composed of a finely reticular but compact
ccenenchym.           It forms   single, stout, vertical stems, usually compressed
from before backwards, so as to be oval in transverse section.                    The stem
gives off a limited number of irregularly dichotomous                     branches, which

are flattened like the stem from before backwards, and tend to coalesce
by their lateral margins and assume a flabellate form, which is some
times somewhat curved.         The surface of the corallum is perfectly even
and smooth, and pierced by deep calicular cavities, simply circular in
outline, and of two kinds, large and small. The larger less numerous
calicles are disposed at irregular intervals over the surface ; they are very
deep, reaching nearly to the centre of the axis of the branch or stem, and
contain a deep-seated, very long, and slender style with a brush-like tip.
The more numerous smaller calicles vary in size            ; they are thickly dis
posed   between    the larger ones  ; they have  no  style.   Seated beneath the
surface between the calicles are numerous ovoid cavities, the ampullae,
which in this genus do not project ; at certain stages of development
these communicate with the exterior by minute irregularly shaped pores,
seated in small shallow pits on the surface of the corallum.          The calicles
are usually more abundant on one face of the corallum than on the other,
especially   in its older basal region.
   Type of the genus Polypora dichotoma.
   Dimensions of the specimen : — Height of the corallum from 1| to 1
inch ; breadth of fan 6 inches ; diameter of stem from 1| to 1 inch ; dia
meter of the mouths of the larger calicles -j^ of an inch.
   A further examination of the species of Stylaster obtained off the
Meangis Islands was made in connexion with that of the corals referred
to above. This Stylaster resembles Cryptohelia in every particular, ex
cepting that it has not the peculiar lid in front of its calicles. It will
have to be separated from the other Stylasters, and placed in the same
genus as Cryptohelia.
                  Structure of the toft parts of the Stylasteridce.
   In all  the Stylasteridae examined there is present an abundant coeno-
sarc, made up, as in the Milleporidae, of a network of anastomosing canals,
composed of an endoderm and ectoderm, and ramifying in corresponding
canals  in the spongy trabecular calcareous coenenchym.           In Polypora the
meshes of the network are comparatively close ; in all the other genera
examined far more widely open.          In Cryptohelia and the Stylaster from
off the Meangis Islands, in which the calicles appear as swellings seated
upon slender connecting branches, bundles of larger canals traverse the
axes of these branches, and connect the zooid groups of the several cali
cles with one another. A continuous layer of tissue, as far as has yet
been seen without cellular structure, but containing thread-cells, covers
the external surface of the coenosarc in all the genera. In all the Stylas-
tcruUu there are two kinds of zooids, as in MUlepora ; the larger and less
numerous have mouths and a special layer of digestive cells lining their
body-cavity.      The more numerous smaller zooids have no mouths and no
gastric cells.      The alimentary zooids are short and cylindrical ; the
smaller or tentacular zooids long and tapering.           The ahmentary zooids

pora they have twelve, in Errina four, in Acanthopora six, in Polypora
 dichotoma four. In Polypora, in which the tentacles of the alimentary
 zooid were examined in the fresh condition, the tentacles were seen to be
 clavate, the heads of the tentacles being somewhat elongate, not spherical
 as in Millepora. I     am as yet uncertain whether these tentacles are cla
 vate in the other genera.     The point     difficult to determine in the ex

 lar zooids, because, though invariably devoid of tentacles themselves, they
 have the form of the simple elongate tentacles, and evidently must per
 form tentacular function. In Polypora, Errina, and Acanthopora these
     a
 tentacular zooids are dispersed irregularly amongst the alimentary zooids               ;
in Cryptohelia, Stylaster erubescent, and Allopora they are arranged in                  a
 circlet around a   centrally placed alimentary zooid in each so-called calicle
of the corallum.      The bases of these zooids communicate               by
                                                                      large vascu
lar offsets with the general network of the coenosarc.          The cavities of the
alimentary zooids are four-rayed in transverse section, and in Polypora
they divide at their base into four large vascular trunks, which subdivide
to join the coeuosarcal meshwork.        The cavities of the tentacular zooids
are circular in transverse section. Both kinds of zooids are provided with
strong circular and longitudinal muscles, which form wide conspicuous
bands beneath the ectoderm.        The alimentary zooids are situate on the
summits of the styles of the corallum, where these are present.                  In
Polypora, in the retracted condition of the zooids, the styles traverse
the axes of the zooids from below for at least two thirds of their length.
In Polypora, Errina, and Acanthopora the zooids of both kinds are re
tracted within long sacs, the cavities of which communicate with the sur
rounding network of the ccenosarc             by
                                             series of radially disposed canals,

which canals in transverse sections of the zooids have at first sight exactly
the appearance of   a   system of mesenteries.      In CryptoMia and the Sty
laster so closely resembling       itthe alimentary zooids, lying as they do
deep in the calicles, are probably never far protruded.           The tentacular
zooids are partly retracted between the pseudo-septa, partly doubled
down within the calicles when the colony          in the retracted condition. In

  larger cells are mostly gathered together in nematophores, which are dis
  posed irregularly amongst the zooids in Polypora, regularly in the inter
 vals between the tentacular zooids at the margins of thecalicles in Cryp-
 tohelia and the Stylaster resembling            it. The smaller kind of thread-cells
 are  of an ovoid form, slightly flattened on one side; they occur in the
 tentacles of the alimentary zooids, and form a closely set covering over
 the entire external surfaces of the tentacular zooids.                      No three-spined
 thread-cells, like those occurring in Millepora, exist in the Stylasteridae.
 Eeproduction takes place by means of adelocodonic gonophores, which are
 produced as buds from the coenosarcal network without having any other
 connexion with the other zooids.              They occupy in the corallum the am-
 pullac which in Polypora are concealed beneath the even external surface
 of the corallum, but in the other genera of Stylasteridae show them
 selves    as  rounded         prominences     on   the surface of the coralla,          being
 specially    prominent in Errina and Distichopora.                       The Stylasteridee
 are   all dioecious.          Females only of Errina and Cr1/ptohelia* have
 been examined, and males only of the other genera.                      The generative ele
 ments of Acanthopora were hot observed at all. In the males of Polypora
 the gonophores present the usual structures occurring in Hydroids ; they
are simple ovoid sacs, with an axially placed spadix, and resembling
 in all respects those, e. </., figured by Allman from Laomedea fltxw>sa\.
The gonophores               are sometimes single in the ampullae, sometimes
 in groups of two or three arising from a common base with their
contents in various stages of development.                   The ripe spermatozoa are
precisely similar in form to those of Garvcia nutans+.                          In Allopora,
Acanthopora,        and    Str/laster  en1bescens  the  male   gonophores      have  a similar
structure. In the St1/laster allied to Cryptohelia the male elements are
developed in a series of sacs, which encircle the calicle, often in a double
row.     The sacs spring from the ccenosarcal network ; they contain nume
rous smaller globular cysts, attached to a common basal endodermal
tissue.     These cysts are some of them filled with ripe spermatozoa, others
with spermatic cells in various stages. The female gonophores are, in
Errina, simple, i. e. each ampulla contains only a simple ovum or embryo.
In Cryptohelia large           sacs are present at the sides of the calicles, which
contain ova and embryos in all stages of development.                        Only a single sac
of the kind is developed in relation with each calicle. In both genera the
spadix in its earliest stage is cup-shaped, the cup having fitted into it an
ovum with germinal vesicle and spot well marked.                        The ova early lose
the germinal vesicle and spot, and develop into very large planulae, in the
same manner as,           e. y., those in Laomedea jfc,vuosa§.           In Errina the pla-
nuloe are more ovoid            in form than in Cryptohelia, in which they are long

parent   ectoderm,     abundantly supplied           with the larger form of thread*
cells.   The spadix in both genera, as the development of the ovum pro
ceeds, becomes divided at its margin into a series o£ lobes, which lobes
subdivide and encroach over the surface of the ovu1n until more than
half the proximal surface of the ovum is thus embraced by the cup of the
spadix.     The lobes of the margin of the spadix appear just like develop
ing tentacles; and the spadix of Cryptohelia was at first supposed to be a
developing actinula.          The outer, thin, perforated calcareous walls of the
ampullae in Errina appear to get thinner as development of the embryo
advances, until they fall away or are absorbed altogether, and give
free exit to the planula.             In Cryptohelia the planulae probably escape
through the mouths of the calicles.                  The eudoderm, spadices, &c. are
coloured red by a colouring-matter, soluble in spirit, insoluble in gly
cerine, in Polypora, Cryptohelia, and Errina.               In the Stylaster resembling
 Cryptohelia the coloration is dusky green.                The green colouring- matter
is soluble in spirit, and yields an absorption-band in the spectrum.                   In
Polypora the living layer of ccenosarc set free by decalcification is very-
thick, not merely a thin superficial film as in Millepora ; indeed all but
the most central axial regions of the branches of the corals are in active
life. In the other genera the whole of the coral appears to maintain
its vitality, there being no dead region represented by a cavity after
decalcification.
                                          Conclusions.
    Since the observations of Prof. Sars            * on the polyps of Allopora oculina
it has been to some extent suspected that the Stylasteridae were not
Anthozoa,     but possibly allied to the Milleporidae,           although    the fact was
not in any way demonstrated.                Milne-Edwards long ago expressed him
 self extremely uncertain as to the affinities of Distichopora, and suspected
that it might be an Alcyonarianf.                In consideration of the facts now
 ascertained, there can be no doubt as to the hydroid affinities of the
 family. The Stylasteridae appear to form a very natural family. They
 all possess two kinds of zooids. The tentacular zooids are closely simi
 lar in form in all the genera ; and in the variations in the forms of the
 alimentary zooids all gradations are present.               The thread-cells appear to
 be alike in form in all the genera.            In all the gonophores are developed
 within ampullae.       The corals all bear, as far as has yet been ascertained,
 fixed sporosacs, as do, according to Allman, all deep-sea Hydroidst.                   It
 is possible, however, that forms such as Stylaster sanguinev* occurring in
 shallow water § may bear planoblasts.                There can be no doubt that Dis
 tichopora will prove closely allied to the other six genera of Stylas-
teridae : its well-marked ampullae and two kinds of pores are decisive in

 the matter.      Pliobothrus ia said by Pourtales * to have " occasional round
 cavities   in the centre of its branches filled with a yolk-like substance
 contained in a membrane."              These cavities seem to be ampullae; and if
  BO, then Pliobothrus may prove to belong to the Stylasteridae, and not to
 the Milleporidae.         In a specimen of Pliobothrus obtained by the ' Challen
        I
 ger' have been able to detect neither ampullee nor tabulae. It will evi
 dently     be possible      easily to form natural genera for the Stylasteridee
 characterized by the number of tentacles of the alimentary zooids, group
 ing of the tentacular zooids around them, &c. This                 I  propose to attempt
 when    I have completed         my study of the subject.
     The Milleporidae differ from the Stylasteridae in having tabute, and in
 possessing neither styles nor ampullae, as well as in having their mouth-
 less zooids provided with numerous tentacles.                  The two families have,
 however, many points of alliance, and they should, provisionally at least,
 be referred to a special suborder of the Hydroidea, which may be termed
 the Hydrocorallinae.
    A most remarkable            result of the present inquiry is the determina
 tion that the calicles of Stylaster and Cryptohelia are tenanted and
formed by colonies of zooids, and not by single polyps, as was most
naturally hitherto supposed to be the case.                     Prof. Verrill, in criti
 cising    Prof.  Agassiz's relegation         of  the   Eugosa     to the Hydroidea t,
dwells on the utter impossibility of Acalephs forming corals with distinct
septa; yet in Cryptohelia and the Stylasters septa are present in the
corallurn, which in many cases so closely resemble those of Zoantharian
corals that these corals were placed by Milne-Edwards in the Oculinidae,
and the septa were never suspected to be pseudo-septa until Sarst ob
served that in Allopora oculina the tentacles (tentacular zooids) were
situate between the septa, and not upon them.                    I should not have de
tected    the  compound        nature   of the  calicular   groups in Stylaster had          I
not been led up to the fact by the examination of other genera of the
family, in which the tentacular zooids are widely separated from the ali
mentary ones. The determination of the compound nature of the cali-
cnlar groups at once explains the otherwise very anomalous arrangement
of the pseudo-septa in many Stylasteridae.                The condition existing has
been described § as a "tendency of the septa to unite by their inner edges
and enclose     in the interseptal chamber thus formed the septa of                  a higher
order."      The real explanation of the matter is that the apparent inter
septal   chambers      are the pores or calicles of the tentacular zooids.                 In
those species in which the tentacles are removed from harm's way in the
retracted condition of the coral by being bent inwards down into the wide
cavity containing the alimentary zooid (calicular cavity), these pores
have   their walls incomplete on the side nearest to the calicle, and take
the form at their mouths of elongate slits, in order to allow of this inward

inclination of the contained tentacular zooid when at rest, or when feed
ing the deeply seated alimentary zooid. The supposed included septa of
higher order are the styles of the tentacular zooids. In some forms of
the family these styles are brush-like in shape, just like the central styles
of the alimentary zooids ; they have this form in Allopora mineacea *,
and less markedly in Stylaster eomplanatus, Pourt. t In some Stylas-
teridae, as e. g. in Stylaster amphihelioides, 8. Kent i, there is no appear
ance at all of pseudo-septa. The pores of the tentacular zooids are simple
circular-mouthed pits, arranged in a circle around the large pore of the
alimentary zooid.       In Allopora subviolacea, 8. Kent §, the pores of the
tentacular zooids are, in some zooid groups -in the same specimen, mere
pores ; in others slits communicating with the cavity of the pore of the
alimentary zooid.       The irregularly scattered condition of the zooids
existing  in  Polypora   is to be regarded as the primitive one in genesis,
from which that existing in Stylaster ampl1ihelioides and that in Allopora
subviolacea represent transitional stages towards the high specialization
of the zooid groups found in Cryptohelia and other species at present
termed Stylaster.
   It has hitherto been a matter of regret that the Hydroidea were of such
a structure as to be unsuitable || for preservation in the fossil state, and
that thus we were almost, excepting as far as Graptolites are concerned,
without direct evidence as to the forms which may have been presented
by their remote ancestry.   We have now two families excellently adapted
for preservation as fossils, viz. the Milleporidae aud the Stylasteridae. At
present no members of these families appear to have been observed in
rocks older than the tertiary deposits. A single species only, Distichopora
antiqua, is known to occur in tertiary beds in France, at Chaumont and
Valmondois          51'
                    ;      but now that special attention will be directed to these
corals, and their structure            better understood, no doubt allied fossil forms
                                          is
will be detected. It seems just possible that amongst Palaeozoic corals such
forms as Cyathonaxia may have been tenanted by           group of hydroid                 a

the Marquesas group, are sold to tourists at Honolulu.       The corals are
said to come from deep water.     The results of the ' Challenger's ' dredg
ing off the Rio de la Plata in 600 fathoms showed that at that depth
very considerable deposits of calcareous matter must be formed by these
various genera of hydroid corals, growing associated as they do in masses
and attached to one another.      Large dead masses of Polypora brought
up by the dredge were especially remarkable, weighing more than 1 lb.,
and forming bases of attachment for sponges and all kinds of other
animals.

of the anatomy of the Stylasteridae, which    I  hope shortly to lay before
the Eoyal Society, together with a more complete account of the struc

III. " On the Comparative       Anatomy of the Auditory Ossicles of the
       Mammalia."       By ALBAN H. G. DORAN, F.R.C.S. Communi
       cated by Professor FLOWER, F.R.S.         Received May 5, 1876.
                                 (Abstract.)
    The following observations have been made during the preparation of
a series of the small ear-bones of the higher Vertebrata for the Museum
of the Eoyal College of Surgeons of England, an undertaking which was
commenced in the autumn of 1874, and is in the course of rapid enlarge
ment up    to the present date.
    The foundation of the entire series was a small collection of the
osseous auditory apparatus of the domestic and common indigenous
animals of Germany, purchased by the College of Dr. Max Hiibrich, of
Munich, a few years since. Following the suggestions of the Conserva
tor, Professor W. H. Flower, F.R.S. , the author succeeded in removing
from the crania of mammals in the College Museum a sufficient number
of auditory ossicula to illustrate the characters of those bones in most
of the important subdivisions      of that class of vertebrated animals.
Numerous additions from rare specimens have been obtained through
the kindness of Sir Victor Brooke, Bart., Professor Parker, Professor
 A. H. Garrod, and other gentlemen.
    These observations are now brought forward with the object of
demonstrating how far the characteristics of the auditory ossicles of the
 different orders of the Mammalia accord with those distinctions through
 out the whole organization which have assisted anatomists up to the
 present day in g1ving a definite position to each member of the class.
 Dr. Hyrtl has already published a well-known work on the Comparative

    102                     Mr. Alban H. G. Doran          on the          [June   15,
   Anatomy of the Internal Auditory Apparatus of the Mammalia *, but
   the subject of the ossicula themselves has not been considered in that
   able treatise quite fully and precisely enough for the present purpose.
       All the Mammalia are known to possess three of these small bones,
   named respectively the malleus, the incus, and the stapts ; the two
   former are occasionally fused.          Their form and characters in our own
   species may       be   regarded    as  fairly typical, so that it is advisable to
   commence the subject by considering the ossicula of Homo.
       Speaking from the stand-point of comparative anatomy, we may
  describe the malleus of man as having a well-developed head somewhat
  compressed        antero-posteriorly     and   expanded laterally.    It rises con
  siderably above       its articular region, and bulges markedly in an outward
  direction.      The articular surface lies on the posterior aspect of the head
  very obliquely, so that its external extremity lies much higher than the
  internal. It is generally spoken of by human anatomists as forming one
  single saddle-shaped facet ; but on comparing it with the same surface in
  the malleus of most of the lower mammalia, say in a cat or a pig, it will
  be seen that it is in reality made up of two facets, much less distinct
  than in those animals, but more marked than in many monkeys.                      A
  very    faint  groove    divides  them,  and   runs  in the  very oblique long axis
  of the whole surface. The more internal and upper facet above this
 groove represents that which is almost completely superior in the lower
 animals, the more external, below the groove, corresponding to their
 lower facet. Both rise into a high vertical convexity about the middle
 of the surface, where the latter is a little contracted ; their planes slope
 towards the groove, so that the articular surface appears concave,
 especially when viewed sideways.
      The neck of the human malleus is constricted and shorter than in
 most of the Mammalia, though longer than in most of the Primates.
 On its ertero-superior aspect is a sharp sigmoid ridge, beginning near
 the anterior border of the articular surface, and losing itself on the root
 of the manubrium.            This ridge is of the same form, and probably repre
 sents the sharply curved entire neck of the malleus of most Carnivora
and      Buminants and many other Mammalia, where a bony lamella
extends from that portion as far as the processus gracilis.              A very faint
trace of that       " lamina," as it may briefly be called, may be seen extend
ing,    in  a fully  developed foetal human malleus, from the neck to the root
of the processus gracilis ; but it seems reasonable to infer that the stout,
compact portion of the neck in front of the sigmoid ridge represents in
a more solid form the lamina referred to.                 Close to the root of the
manubrium,        and on the inner side, a very faint eminence, to which the
tensor tympani is attached, represents the processus muscularis of some
other mammals.            The well-known processus gracilis of the malleus of
Homo is known to be to a great extent absorbed in the process of extra-

uterine growth, and hence is far less stable than       in animals where it is
held together, speaking roughly, by the manubrium.
    The manubrium is rather short, and forms with the neck an angle of
about 140°.     It is broader at the base than in the Simiidae, and flattened
laterally ; still the sides are slightly convex. The extremity is slightly
recurved and spatulate, and the processus brevis is very well developed.
    The body of the incus in Homo is well developed and rather longer
than deep vertically ; the crura are very divergent, and the " processus
brevis," or posterior crus, very high in the natural position of the bone,
is stout and rather long ; the long, slender " processus longus " is gently
curved, and bears a small os orbiculare or Sylvian apophysis rather firmly
seated on a not very thin pedicle.
    The stapes of man is noted for the great width of its aperture,
although there is no canal between its crura as in many lower animals.
The head is proportionally rather small, and the anterior of the two
slender crura is the straightest.      The footplate is necessarily wide hori
zontally, but rather narrow vertically ; its outline is reniform, the upper
border being convex or arched, the lower is slightly concave in the
middle. Its posterior extremity is blunter than the anterior, and it ia
somewhat convex towards the vestibule.
    Comparing the ossicula of Homo with those of the Simiidae it appears : —
    1st. That the ear-bones of Homo, Troglodytes, and Simia closely
resemble one another.
    2mlly. The malleus of Hylobates has greater affinities to the above
genera than to the lower monkeys, but the incus and stapes are of a
lower type.
    Srdly. The ossicula of Troglodytes niger are altogether most like those
 of Homo ; but in the form of the head and articular surface of the mal
leus Simia most approaches Man. The malleus of the gorilla is less
 human than the chimpanzee's, the outer segment of the articular sur
 face being wide, whilst its manubrium more resembles that of Simia :
 but the incus and stapes of T. gorilla are very much like the same
 ossicula in Homo.
    4thly. Taking the characters of these high animals into general con
 sideration, we must conclude that they tend far more towards Homo
than to the tailed Old- World monkeys.
    The ossicula of the CERCOPITHECID.E possess several prominent
 characters, some of which are absent in certain genera ; and they are
 most marked in Macacus.          These peculiarities are principally : —in the
 malleus great shortness and great constriction of the nock, and a manu
 brium forming a very wide angle with the rest of the bone, possessing
 both a processus brevis and a processus muscularis, and well dilated at
 the extremity ; in the incus a square or high and narrow body, and in
 the stapes extremely straight crura ; this latter feature is constant.
    Semnopitheeus   in its incus, and in the slight lateral compression of the
 well -developed   head   of the malleus, approaches the Simiidce, but in the

  104                 Mr. Alban H. G. Doran        on the            [June   15,
  characters of the neck and manubrium and of the whole stapes it re
  sembles the other genera of this group.       Cercopithecus comes next, the
 head of the   malleus being well  developed and  prominent ; but its incus is
 generally square-bodied or high and narrow.        In Culobus and Cercocebus
 the head    of the malleus   is almost as flattened and comparatively ill-
 developed as in Macacus, and the incus is similar. In Cynopithecus and
  Cynocephalm the flattening of the head of the malleus and shortness of
 its neck and other characters already referred to are as marked as in
 Macacus, and there are no distinctions of the slightest importance be
 tween the ossicula of those three genera.      In the shortness of the neck
 and form of the incus the Old- World monkeys resemble or tend more
 towards the Cebidft than to Man.
    The PLATYRRHINI differ considerably in their ear-bones from the Old-
 World monkeys, and chiefly in the complete or practical absence of the
 neck of the malleus in all genera excepting A1eles, and the peculiar shape
 of .the neck in that genus. The Hapalidt1o have mallei which approach
 in type the corresponding ossicle in the Lorises (Nycticebidee), and the
 stapes, by the partial fusion of its crura, reverts to a condition frequent
among the Edentata and Marsupialia.         Such fusion may be seen both in
 Hapale and Midas, but is not constant.
    Whilst Attics differs from all the other Cebidae in its malleus, Cebus
closely resembles that genus in having a similar incus; but in the absence
of neck to the malleus it rather resembles     Myeetcs.   In  the high narrow
incus PitJu'da agrees with Mycetes.
    Among the LEMURID^; the ossicula of the Galagos, Nycticebidae, and
 Propithecvs differ hardly at all from the type of the smaller Ccbidso.      In
Lemur the neck of the malleus, and often a trace of the proeessus brevis
mallei, reappears ; and in that genus and the Indrisinrc there is a bony
canal between the crura of the stapes not observed in the Galagos and
Lorises or in Tarsius.     Whilst retaining certain points of resemblance
to Lemur, the ossicula of Chiromys decidedly remind the observer of the
same bones in certain Eodents, especially the Castoridae and Sciuridae.
    Among the CARNITORA the auditory ossicles of the Fissipedia differ
completely in character from those of the Piunipedia.
    The ossicula of the terrestrial flesh-eaters bear on the whole a strong
general resemblance to one another ; still they present some interesting
points of distinction in the more typical families.         These distinctions
are mostly to be found in the malleus.        The presence of a lamina of
thin bone between the neck of the malleus and the processus gracilis is
a constant character, except in Herpestts and its allies ; and there is
always a processus muscularis for the tendon of the tensor ty1npani,
except in the Bears, as Hyrtl has observed.
    Putting aside the Ursidse, which are at once readily distinguished
from all other families by the absence of that process, the more typical
divisions present certain salient distinctions in the malleus.      In the cats
and dogs    the muscular process is long, slender, and curved     :  but in the

1876.]                  Auditory Ossicles of the Mammalia.                    105
Canidae the manubrium          forms   a bold curve with the concavity forwards,
and its outer surface, towards the membrana tympani, is broad through
out ; in the Felidae this curve hardly exists, and the outer aspect is very
narrow. In Hyaena and Proteles the processus muscularis of the malleus
is very stout, blunt-pointed, and almost straight, and the manubrium is
curved as in the dogs ; its outer aspect is broader near the tip than at
the base in the Hyaena, but broad throughout in Proteles.             Hence the
mallei of these animals are more canine than feline, particularly that of
the Aard-wolf.         Among the Canidae themselves Lycaon most approaches
the H   1 .i nm_-r in the stoutness     of its processus 1nuscularis. In all the
above families, as well as in the Civets and in the Cryjptoprocta, the
incus is small with slender crura, the posterior almost as long as the
processus longus, and the stapes is small and triangular.
    The Procyonidae, ./Eluridae, Viverridae, and Cryptoproctidae resemble
one another in the ill-development of the processus muscularis of the
malleus, which, however, is never quite absent. The outer surface of the
manubrium in those families is narrow, as in Felis and Ursus. In the
^Elurus and the Procyonidae, including Bassaris astuta, the incus has a
 very short processus brevis, as in the bear ; in the Civets and Crypto-
procta that cms is well developed, as in the cats and dogs. From the
 above observations        it follows that Cryptoprocta is more Feline than
 Canine, and more Viverrine than Feline, in the character of its malleus.
     The weasels and the other Mustelidae are known from the rest of the
 Fissipedia by the extreme narrowness of the lamina of the malleus, and
 the very wide angle which the rather short manubrium forms with the
 neck.      The processus muscularis of the malleus is as well developed as
 in the cats and dogs ; but the Mustelidae exceed the bears and the Pro-
 cyonidae in the extreme ill- development of the posterior crus of the incus.
 In the smaller weasels the base of the stapes is generally bullate.
     In the genera Herpestes and Suricata the malleus differs in form from
 the type existing in the other Viverridae and the rest of this suborder.
  The head of that ossicle is more developed, but there is hardly a trace of
  a lamina.      The processus muscularis is not situated on tie neck close to
  the root of the handle as in the other Carnivora, but on the inner edge
  of the manubrium itself.         The incus is of the form seen in Felis, Viverra,
 and Canis, not of the ursine type.
     The ossicula of the Pinniped1a are large, well marked, and readily dis
  tinguishable in the different genera.
     The Otariidae are exceptional in having very small ossicula, but they
  are of dense consistence as in the true seals. The malleus has a head
  which is concave anteriorly, and the articular surface is of the same pro
  minent character as in Phoca.           The neck is constricted, and the manu
  brium     rather   longer   than  in  the  other Pinnipedia.   The incus differs
  from that of all other members of this suborder ; in its non-divergent
  posterior crus and its long, far-reaching slender processus longus it is

almost arctoid.     On the other hand, the stapes has oftener fused crura
without any aperture (as in the dolphins) than in the Fhocina.
   The walrus possesses a malleus with a head much like that of Phoea ;
but the articular surface is less abnormal in character, and above all the
manubrium is extremely short.         The incus is phocine ; but in the stapes
Trichechus approaches Macrorhinus.
   The ossicula of Macrorhinus differ very markedly from those of Cysto-
phora ; in the malleus the former resembles Stenorhynchus, whilst in the
stapes it is more like Trichechus. The stapedes of Stenorhynchus and Cyt-
tophora are more of the Phoca type.         In the Phocinae alone is seen a
second articulation between the malleus 'and incus, and this feature is
not constant in every species.
   Among the UNGULATA the laminated type of malleus prevails          ; the pro-
cessus   muscularis  is rarely quite obsolete, but    seldom  very long.    The
incus is very variable in form, and bears important distinguishing features
in certain families.    A quadrilateral form of stapes, due to great breadth
of the head of that ossicle, occurs very frequently.
   Among the Perissodactyla Equus in its malleus least resembles the
remainder of the whole order, the head of that bone being well developed
above the level of the articular surface as well as anteriorly, and the
lamina is almost obsolete.      In the Rhinocerotidro   (where all the ossicula
are proportionally very small) and in         the Tapirs the malleus has a
narrow lamina, not simply extending between the head and the processus
gracilis, but running forwards to the very extremity of the latter.          All
these   animals have  perfectly triangular stapedes, differing  from   the form
almost constant in the larger Artiodactyla.
   In the Tylopoda the malleus resembles that of the pig and its allies in
the great anterior development of its head ; but unlike those animals the
articular surface of that ossicle is wide and shallow, as in the Rhinoceros
on the one hand and the larger Euminants on the other ; but it most
resembles Rhinoceros in the ill-development of the processus muscularis
mallei and in the triangular form of the stapes.
   In the Suidffl, in Hippopotamus and Phacochcerus, the head of the
malleus is greatly produced forwards with a rather deep articular sur
face ; the lamina and the processus muscularis are well developed.          The
incus has a typical character ; the body is very square in form, with the
crura short, especially the posterior.      The form of the articular surface
in Hippopotamus and in large specimens of Phacochcerus differs from
the. same in the pigs.      Hippopotamus, though so Large, has a triangular
stapes,  whilst that bone  is  quadrilateral in the Suidae, as in the ox and
adult sheep.
   In Tragulus the malleus is indistinguishable from those of many small
antelopes and deer, the head not being produced forwards as in the
pigs ; whilst the incus retains to perfection the square body and short
posterior crus of the Suidee.

markable    for the strong resemblance which the ossicula of the adults of
the smaller species bear to those of the mature foetus or young of the
larger members of those families.       The head of the malleus is always
ill-developed,   the processus muscularis always present, and the manu-
brium ia frequently very long. In the adult Bos the great shallownesa
of the articular facet of the malleus, the bold curve of the manubrium,
the very high and well-developed body of the incus with its long and
divergent processus brevis, and the quadrilateral form of the stapes are
all very distinctive ; on the other hand, in the adult Ovis the articular
surface is deeper and the facets less level than in Bos, and the manu
brium is almost straight ; nor is the body of the incus so developed,
although the posterior crns is very long.      The stapes is nearly as qua
drilateral in a large adult Ovis aries as in Bos, but it often remains
triangular in small sheep.
    In the lamb or fully developed foetal sheep the articular surface of the
malleus is still deeper cut and the facets more prominent than in the
adult ; the incus has a shallow body and the stapes is quite triangular.
Most of the remaining Bovidae imitate, in the ossicula of the adults, the
types of the ox, the sheep, or the lamb.         Thus in the wild sheep, the
goats, and many small antelopes, as Nemorhcedus,        Oreotragus,  and Saiga,
the ossicula much resemble those of the young Ovis aries ; Gazella and
its allies are more bovine in the type of the malleus, whilst the stapes is
generally triangular, even in the adult ; the incus appears quite transi
tional between Ovis and Bos, the body being almost square ; indeed as
the posterior crus is sometimes rather short in these antelopes, that
ossicle approaches     the pig and chevrotain type.      Nanotragus, Cephalo-
phus, Neotrayia,    Tetraceros, and Nanohcedtu are also balanced   in characters
between Bos and Ovis.
    Kobus,   Tragelaphus, Alcelaphus, and Catoblepas lean more, in the
general characteYs of the auditory ossicles, towards Bos ; the gnus are
remarkable for the great length of the manubrium, which is straighter
than in the ox.      In the adult Ovibos and Anoa the ossicula are slightly
more calf-like than ox-like.
    The ossicula of Camelopardalis are remarkably like those of Bos, and
 undergo similar changes during the growth of the animal. In Antilocapra
the ossicula have not strongly defined characters, although perhaps they
most resemble those of the medium-sized antelopes.           The quadrilateral
form of stapes allies it to Ovis or Bos; the incus, as in Oazella, may either
be considered intermediate between the form in those two domesticated
ruminants, or (as the posterior crus is not long) to relate the prong-horn
antelope to the Chevrotains.
    In the Cervidae the malleus always retains in the adult the characters
seen in the fully developed foetal ox, the articular surface having well-
marked facets, and the manubrium being almost straight.          The processus
inuscularis is large in the genus Certrus. The body of the incus is always
                                                                  i 2

 shallow-, with an even, stouter, and more divergent posterior crns than
iu other ruminants.      The stapes remains triangular in full-grown large
 deer. Moschus is quite cervine in its ossicula, the shallow body and
thick, long, divergent posterior crns of the incus being very different
from the square-bodied incus with short crura seen in the Tragulidae.
    Among the EODENTIA we find great variety in the form of the auditory
ossicula in different families, as is also the case among the Insectivora.
Nearly every type of malleus may be observed among the various sub
divisions of the order, such as the large-headed, distinctly necked form
 of the higher Primates, the neckless variety of the lower monkeys, the
laminated type of the ruminants and terrestrial carnivora, and the fused
 condition of the malleus and incus of the guinea-pig and its allies.     The
stapes,  too, varies, being sometimes  large in proportion to the size of  the
animal, iu other cases very small in large species.
    The most constant character in the rodent's malleus is the broad,
laterally flattened manubrium, with a processus muscularis on its inner
edge far from the neck of the ossicle, which may be said to present three
prevailing types — the ueckless form in the squirrels, the laminated
variety of the rats, and the malleo-incudal fusion of the Hystricidae.
The incus varies little, and its processus brevis is always shorter than
the anterior crus, and but little divergent.      A bony canal between the
crura of the stapes is frequent in several families.
    Classifying the animals intermediate in the character of the malleus
between the genus Sciurus, where it is neckless without a trace of any
processus brevis, and Castor, where both neck and process exist, the genera
will be found to run as nearly as possible in the following order : —
Sciurus, Anomalurus, Marmotta, Tamias and Spermophilus, Pteromys,
Myo.rus and Castor, the separation of the head from the manubrium
becoming more and more apparent in each of these genera towards the
 last ; but, taking other points into consideration, Anomalunts should be
placed after the ground-squirrels, having a small stapes with crura not
very divergent, as in the Hystricidae ; and Marmotta separates itself from
other sciuroid rodents by the peculiar form of its head, which is ex
tremely flattened laterally and projects above the articular surface.       In
all the above rodents, except Anomalurus, the stapes is large, with wide,
thin, divergent crura; and an intercrural bony canal exists in most
species.
    In the Muridae the malleus has a well-formed lamina and a manubrium
rather broad at the base.      The former peculiarity is most marked in
Mus, Hapalotis, Hydromys, and their allies, where an orbicular process
standing out from the front of the neck is a frequent feature, and appears
identical with a similar projection in the shrews, and is probably an
extreme development of the sharp angular protuberance seen in the
malleus    of the badger, and in that from a Bassaris in the College col
lection.    In Fiber the lamina is smaller and the manubrium broader than

in M1a, so that the malleus more resembles that of Lepus.                The stapes
of this family has generally long, slender, and not very divergent crura,
and the intercrural canal is wanting.
    In the Hystricidae the great feature is the ankylosis of the malleus to
the incus, already      well known to zoologists.      It is almost invariable in
the adults     of that family. The manubrium is very broad, and the inner
edge above the processus muscularis is very thick.             The varieties among
the different genera are trifling : the head of the malleus is produced
forwards to an extreme degree in Aulacodus, Capromys, and particularly
in Chinchilla, but less so in the porcupines and the agouti.             The stapes
is always proportionally small, with stout and not very divergent crura ;
a bony intercrural canal occurs in many genera, but is an inconstant
feature in individual specimens of the same species.
    As the ankylosis of the two outer ossicles occurs in Dipus, whilst the
head    of    the malleus remains       small and   unproduced, and that bone
possesses      a wide lamina,    it  must be considered intermediate, as far as
those   little bones are concerned, between the Muridae and Hystrieidae.
    As occurs in other orders, the fossorial members of the Eodentia pre
sent great peculiarities in their ear-bones.         In Geomys the malleus some
what resembles that of Marmotta ; the stapes is remarkable for the large
bnlla on its base.       Rhizomys and Ellobius approximate most to the rats,
Bathyergus to the Hystricidae, which it exceeds in the degree of fusion
of the malleus to the incus, which latter bone, however, differs in form
from the same in that family. In Spalax the malleus approaches the
more central type of Castor or Lepus ; but the stapes is of a very unique
type, somewhat similar to that of Chrysoehloris, except that one crus is
quite straight      and very divergent.
    In both species of ELEPHAST the large ossicula appear rather like the
modified ear-bones of certain rodents than like any ungulate.               There is
neither the lamina or long manubrium mallei, nor the thick and diver
gent processus brevis incudis, nor the quadrilateral               stapes frequent
among      the   large Ungulata    ; on  the  other hand    the  short, broad-based
manubrium, the thin, short, and hardly divergent processus brevis of the
incus, and the wide       intercrural aperture of the stapes are characteristic
in Elephas and common among the             Eodentia.
    In  the HYRACES the ear-bones bear a slight affinity to those of the
horse, but none of any importance to the common types among the
 Ungulata or Eodentia.
    The ossicles of the remaining groups of the Mammalia will be described
 in a subsequent communication.
 IV. " On       two new Vanadium Minerals."            By H. E.    EOSCOE,   F.R.S.
                             Received    May    10, 1876.
     No. 1. — The first of these remarkable        minerals   contains 28 per cent,
  of vanadium pentoxide.        It   was forwarded to me by       Dr. James Blake,

110                               Mr. H. E. Roscoe             on                  [June 15,
of San Francisco, with the following statement : — " discovered it in    I
a gold-mine, and it serves as the matrix for the gold.                     It occurs in small
bunches, filling cavities in a schistose porphyry."
   The mineral occurs iu radiating and foliated talc-like masses, greenish
grey in bulk, and light greenish yellow when seen in fragments, forming
a grey powder.            Its lustre is subvitreous to fatty. In mass it is
opaque, but is translucent in thin splinters.                       Its hardness is about
equal to that of     talc   ; its specific gravity is 2-902.
   Blowpipe reactions. — When heated in thin splinters the mineral fuses
easily to a black non-magnetic bead.                In a closed tube a little water is
given off.     With borax and microcosmic salt the reactions of vanadium
and silica are obtained.           It is only partially attacked by acids.
   Composition. — Two complete analyses of the mineral have been made
with the following results : —

   The following formula approximately represents the composition of

    Vanadium and aluminium salts cannot be separated by fusion with
 sodium carbonate and subsequent precipitation by ammonium chloride,
 as some of the alumina is thrown down as aluminium vanadate together
 with the ammonium vanadate.

   The vanadate of aluminium and the ferric oxide precipitated together
by acetate   of ammonium are separated by fusion with sodium carbonate
and subsequent boiling with water.         The vanadic acid in the acidified
solution ia then reduced by sulphur dioxide, the liquid well boiled, and
the vanadium estimated volumetrically          by means of potassium per
manganate.      The  larger portion    of the vanadium    remains in solution
after the addition of ammonium acetate, and this is precipitated as lead
metavanadate by the addition of lead acetate solution.          The lead salt is
dissolved in nitric acid, and the lead thrown down by sulphuretted
hydrogen, the filtrate on evaporation yielding pure vanadium pentoxide,
which after ignition is weighed.      This method was likewise made use of
for the separation of vanadium in the portion of mineral which served
for the estimation of the alkalies.
   A direct assay of the vanadium was made by heating 0-5105 grm. of
the mineral with' strong sulphuric acid, diluting with water, reducing
with a current of sulphur dioxide, and titrating with a standard solution of
permanganate of 1 cub. centim.= 0-00534 grm. of metallic iron. Of this
solution 17-3 cub. centims. were needed ; this corresponds to 29-5 per cent.
of vanadium pentoxide, the change of oxidation being from V,O4 to V,O,.
From this must, however, be deducted the amount of vanadium pentoxide
equivalent to 1-13 per cent, of ferric oxide ; this leaves 28-21 per cent, of
VsO,, an amount closely approximating to that (28-6) obtained by analysis.
   Dr. James Blake, in his communication referred to above, states : —
" At the
           suggestion of my friend Professor Gibbs,        I  propose to name
the mineral Eoscoelite, should the name not be already appropriated."

   Xo. 2. — The second vanadium mineral, to which propose to give the
name of Mottramite, occurs as a crystalline incrustation on Keuper
sandstone found at Alderley Edge and at Mottram St. Andrew's, in
Cheshire, and at other localities.
   The incrustation is usually very thin ; but occasionally it becomes 3 or
4 millimetres in thickness, and in one or two cases masses almost the
size of a walnut have been found.           Sometimes the incrustation has a
black velvety appearance, and consists of numerous extremely small
crystals, so minute that their form has not yet been ascertained.          More
commonly, however, the mineral possesses          a compact     character.   The
crystals are black by reflected light, but very thin particles are sub-
translucent and transmit yellow light. The compact mineral is purplish
brown and opaque. The lustre of the crystals is resinous.            Streak yel
low. Hardness of compact portion about that of calc-spar.                Specific
gravity 5-894.
   Behaviour before the blowpipe. — In the closed tube a little water is evolved
on heating, and the mineral fuses very easily.          On asbestos it fuses
easily and slightly tinges the flame green.         Heated on charcoal with
sodium carbonate      in reducing   flame, a yellow incrustation and grey
 malleable  bead  are obtained.    On dissolving the bead in nitric acid and

adding ammonia in excess, a blue solution is obtained.                     Heated with
borax on platinum wire in the oxidizing flame the bead is yellow when
hot, then becomes green, and when cold is blue.                 In the reducing flame
the borax bead is bluish green, with a red skeleton of reduced copper.

possible from the matrix, gave the following results              : —

    As this mineral contains no aluminium, the determination of vana
 dium is made by fusing the mass, after separation of copper and lead,
 with sodium carbonate, treating the fused mass with water, and pre
 cipitating the soluble sodium vanadate as ammonium salt.
    In  addition   to the above constituents         the mineral contains        traces of
 arsenic, cobalt, and sodium.
    Mottramite is interesting        as     forming the third term in a second
 (doubtless) isomorphous group of phosphates, arsenates, and vauadates
 corresponding to the well-known pyromorphite,                  mimetesite, and vana-

 1876.]              On the Action of Light on Selenium.                                 113
 V.    " The   Action of Light on Selenium." By Prof. W. G. ADAMS,
          F.R.S., and Mr. R. E. DAY. Received May 18, 1876.
                                          (Abstract.)
    The paper contains an account of a series of experiments which have
been     carried on during the past year, and which have had for their ob
ject the investigation of the electrical behaviour of selenium, especially
as regards its sensitiveness to light.              The first part contains a short
summary of the results obtained by Professor Adams, which have been
communicated to the Society *.
    It has been already shown that the action is due principally, if not
entirely, to those rays of the spectrum which are luminous, and that the
ultra-red or the ultra-violet rays have little or no effect ; also that the
intensity of the action depends on the illuminating power of the light,
being directly as the square root of that illuminating power.
    It was also observed that with the same piece of selenium at the same
temperature,        the    resistance    diminished       as   the    battery-power      was
increased.       Also  it was found that the electrical resistance of the rod of
selenium was different for currents going through it in opposite direc
tions. Thus if two platinum wires be melted into the selenium at two
 points, A and B, and the resistance of the selenium be balanced by the
 Wheatstone's bridge arrangement, the positive pole of the battery being
 connected to the electrode         A, then on reversing the current              so that the
 negative    pole of the battery was now connected to the electrode A, the
 numerical value of the balancing resistance was always found to be
 different from that previously obtained.
    If the electrical conductivity of selenium followed the ordinary law of
 metallic conduction this would not be the case ; and hence it seemed
 probable that a careful investigation of these points would lead to some
 important results.
     In the experiments recorded in this paper, the objects we have had
 especially in view have been : —
     (i) To examine the character of the electrical conductivity of selenium
 when     kept in the dark.
     (ii) To determine        whether    light could actually generate an electric
 current    in the selenium.
     Several    pieces    of selenium were prepared as follows : —A small
 piece varying from a quarter of an inch to an inch in length was
  broken off a stick of vitreous selenium.                  A platinum wire was then
  taken and bent round into a small ring at one end, and the re
  mainder of the wire turned up at right angles to the plane of this
  ring.    The rings of two such wires were then heated in the flame of a
  Bpirit-lamp, and pressed into the ends of the little cylinder of selenium,
                *  See
                       '
                         Proceedings,' vol. xxiii. p. 535| and vol. xxiv. p. 163.

 thus    forming   platinum    electrodes.    The whole  was   then   annealed.
 After annealing copper wires were soldered on to the platinum electrodes,
 and the selenium was then inclosed in a piece of glass tube, the electrodes
 being passed through corks fixed at the ends of the tube. A numbered
 label was then     attached   to one of the electrodes, and this was then
                                       "

     The method of annealing which we have found to give the best results
 is very simple.    A large iron ball is heated to a bright red heat, and then
 placed in a large iron bowl of sand ; the sand is then heaped up all over
  the ball, and left for an hour.      The ball is then taken out, and the
 selenium, wrapped up in paper, is put into the hot sand and left there
 for twenty-four hours.     On removing it from the sand its appearance has
 generally changed from a bright glassy character to a dull slate-coloured
 one ; and when this is the case its conductivity is generally very good.
     In most of our experiments it was important to know what was the
 direction of the current in any particular case, and we therefore decided
 to call those currents      direct or positive currents when the positive
 electrode of the battery was connected with the marked electrode of the
 selenium plate    under  examination.      In order to be able to reverse the
 current with respect to the selenium without affecting any other portion
 of the circuit, the ends of the wire electrodes of the selenium were made
 to dip into two little mercury cups fixed on a plate of ebonite, and then
 were connected to the binding-screws of the Wheatstone bridge arrange
 ment.     Thus by reversing the position of the electrodes the direction of
 the current through the selenium was reversed.         The positive direction
 of the current was always determined at the commencement of each
 series of experiments by means of a delicately suspended magnetic
needle.
     A  few preliminary experiments were made to determine whether the
 change of resistance with change of direction of the current had any
connexion with the position of the selenium or the direction of the cur
rent with respect to the magnetic meridian.           No such connexion was
found to exist.
    From the results obtained from a great many experiments made to
determine the diminution of resistance with increased battery-power, and
the change of resistance with a change of the direction of the current,
the following conclusions were drawn : —
    (1) That on the whole there is a general diminution of resistance in
the selenium as the battery-power      is increased.
    (2) The first current through the selenium, if a strong one, causes a
permanent set of the molecules, in consequence of which the passage of
the current through the selenium during the remainder of the experi
ments is more resisted in that direction than it is when passing in the
opposite direction.
    (3) The passage of the current in any direction produces a       set of the

  1876.]                the Action    of Light  on Selenium.                  115
  molecules which facilitates the subsequent passage of a current in the
  opposite,    but obstructs one in the same direction.        Hence when two
  currents are sent through successively, after a very small interval, in
  the same direction, the resistance observed in the second case, even
  with the higher battery-power, is often equal to or greater than it was
  before.
       The results of these experiments seeming to indicate that the con-
. ductivity of selenium is electrolytic, a number of experiments were
  undertaken in order to discover whether after the passage of an electric
   current through a piece of selenium any distinct evidence of polarization
   could be detected.      It was then found that, after passing the current
   from a voltaic battery for some time through the selenium, and after
   having disengaged the electrodes from the battery and connected them
  with a galvanometer, a current, in some cases of considerable intensity,
  in the opposite direction to that of the original battery-current, passed
  through the galvanometer.         This proved that the passage of the battery-
   current sets up polarization in the selenium.
       All the results hitherto described were obtained with the selenium
   kept in the dark.
       We then tried to discover whether on exposing the selenium to light
  during the passage of the polarization-current any change in the inten
  sity of that current would be produced : wo found that in several
  cases there was a distinct change ; in most instances the action of the
   light assisted the passage of the current ; but in one case we found that
   the effect of light was not only to bring the deflection of the galvanometer-
   needle down to zero, but also to send it up considerably on the other
   side.
       Here there seemed to be a case of light actually producing an electro
   motive force within the selenium, which in this case was opposed to and
    could overbalance the electromotive force due to polarization.
       The question at once presented itself as to whether it would be pos
   sible to start a current in the selenium merely by tJn action of ligfU.
   Accordingly the same piece of selenium was connected directly with the
   galvanometer.      'While unexposed there was no action whatever.           On
   exposing   the  tube to  the light of a candle, there was at once a strong  de
    flection of the galvanometer-needle.         On screening off the light the
    deflection came back at once to zero.
       This experiment was repeated in various ways and with light from
    different sources, the results clearly proving that by the action of light
    alone we could start and maintain an electrical current in the selenium.
       All the pieces of selenium hitherto used had repeatedly had electrical
   currents passing through them, and it therefore seemed desirable to
   examine the effect of exposure to light on pieces of selenium which had
   never before had an electrical current sent through them.

116             Prof. W. G. Adams and Mr. R. E. Day on             [June  15,
    Accordingly three pieces were prepared, as nearly alike as possible,
and were annealed.       Two of them were found on trial to be sensitive
          —
to light that is to say, light impinging on them produced an electri
cal current.     The third piece, however, showed no signs of sensitiveness.
Hence it appears that three pieces which were made up from the same
stick, which are of the same length and were annealed at the same time,
may, owing to some slight difference in their molecular condition, be very
different as to their relative sensitiveness to the action of light.
    In  the experiments by which the above results were obtained, the
piece   of selenium under examination had always been exposed as a whole
to the influence of the light, so that it was not possible to tell whether
any one part of a piece was more sensitive than any other.
    In  order to examine into this point more fully, we used the lime-light,
and    then  by means of a lens the light was brought to a focus on the
particular portion of the selenium plate which was to be tested.
A    glass cell containing water, and having parallel sides, was inter
posed in the path of the beam, so as to assist in absorbing any obscure
heat-rays.
    The results   of these experiments    proved  conclusively  the following
points   :—
    (1) That pieces of annealed selenium are in general sensitive to light,
i. e. that under the action of light a difference of potential is developed
between the molecules which under certain conditions can produce an
electric current through the substance.
    (2) That the sensitiveness is different at different parts of the same
piece.
    (3) That in general the direction of the current is from the less
towards the more illuminated portion of the selenium, but that owing to
accidental differences in molecular arrangement this direction is some
times reversed.
    The currents produced in the selenium by the action of light do not
resemble the thermoelectric currents due to heating of the junctions
between the platinum electrode and the selenium ; for in many cases
the current produced was most intense when the light was focused on
points of the selenium not coinciding with the junctions ; also the cur
rent was produced suddenly on exposure ; and on shutting off the light
the needle at once fell to zero : the gradual action due to gradual cooling
was entirely wanting.
    When the light fell upon a junction, the current passed from the
selenium to the platinum through the junction, which is not in accord
ance with the place assigned to selenium in the thermoelectric series of
metals.
    Experiments were next undertaken in order to examine what effect
would be produced on the strength of a current which was passing

1876.]               the Action of Light on Selenium.                    117
through a piece of selenium in the dark when a beam of light was
allowed to fall upon it.
    The results obtained from these experiments were as follows : —
    'With pieces of selenium of low resistance and with a weak current
passing through them —
    (1) When light falls on the end of the selenium at which the current
from the positive pole of the battery is entering the metal it opposes the
passage of the current.
    (2) When light falls on the end of the selenium at which the current
is leaving the metal it assists the passage of the current.
    With pieces of selenium of a high resistance we found that in all
cases the action of light tended to facilitate the passage of the battery-
current, whichever was its direction.
    We also found that in those pieces which appeared so little sensitive
to light that no independent current was developed in them by exposure,
yet when a current due to an external electromotive force was passing
through them, the exposure to light facilitated the passage of the current.
    The results of the experiments described in this paper furnish a pos
 sible explanation of the character of the action which takes place when
light falls upon a piece of selenium which is in a more or less perfect
 crystalline condition.
     When a stick of vitreous selenium has been heated to its point of
softening, if it were possible to cool the whole equally and very slowly,
then the whole of the molecules throughout its mass would be able to
take up their natural crystalline positions, and the whole would then be
 in a perfectly crystalline state, and would conduct electricity and heat
 equally well throughout its mass. But from the nature of the process
 it  is evident that  the outer layers will cool the most rapidly, and we
 shall have, in passing from the outside to the centre, a series of strata
 in a more and more perfect crystalline condition.
     Light, as we know in the case of some bodies, tends to promote crys
 tallization, and, when it falls on the surface of such a stick of selenium,
 probably tends to promote crystallization in the exterior layers, and
 therefore to produce a flow of energy from within outwards, which
 under certain circumstances appears, in the case of selenium, to produce
 an electric current.
    The crystallization produced in selenium by light may also account for
 the diminution in the resistance of the selenium when a current from a
 battery is passing through it, for in changing to the crystalline state
 selenium becomes a better conductor of electricity.

VI. "On        the Application      of the Principle      of Reciprocity to
       Acoustics."     By Lord RAYLEIGH, F.R.S.           Received     May 27,
       1876.
   In  a memoir published some years ago by Helmholtz (Crelle, Bd. Ivii.)
it was proved that if a uniform frictionless gaseous medium be thrown
into vibration by a simple source of sound of given period and intensity,
the variation of pressure is the same at any point B when the source of
sound is at A as it would have been at A had the source of sound been
situated at B, and that this law is not interfered with by the presence
of any number of fixed solid obstacles on which the sound may impinge.
   A simple source of sound is a point at which the condition of con
tinuity of the fluid is broken by an alternate introduction and abstrac
tion of fluid, given in amount and periodic according to the harmonic
law.
   The reciprocal property is capable of generalization so as to apply to
all acoustical systems whatever capable of vibrating about a configuration
of equilibrium, as     I proved in the Proceedings of the Mathematical
Society for June 1873, and is not lost even when the systems are subject
to damping, provided that the frictional forces vary as the first power of
the velocity, as must always be the case when the motion is small enough.
Thus Helmholtz's theorem may be extended to the case when the medium
is not uniform, and when the obstacles are of such a character that they
share the vibration.
   But although the principle of reciprocity appears to    be firmlv grounded
on the theoretical side, instances are not uncommon in which a sound
generated in the open air at a point A is heard at a distant point B,
when an equal or even more powerful sound at B fails to make itself
heard at A ; and some phenomena of this kind are strongly insisted
upon by Prof. Henry in opposition to Prof. TyndalPs views as to the
importance of
                  " acoustic clouds " in relation to the audibility of
                                                                           fog-
signals.    These observations were not, indeed, made with the simple sono
rous sources of theory ; but there is no reason to suppose that the re
sult would have been different if simple sources could have been used.
   In experiments having for their object the comparison of sounds heard
under different circumstances there is one necessary precaution to which
it may not be superfluous to allude, depending on the fact that the au
dibility of a particular sound depends not only upon the strength of that
sound, but also upon the strength of other sounds which may be heard
along with it. For example, a lady seated in a closed carriage and carry
ing on a conversation through an open window in a crowded thorough
fare  will hear what is said to her far more easily than she can make herself
heard   in return ; but this is no failure in the law of reciprocity.
   The explanation of his observations given by Henry depends upon the
peculiar action of wind, first explained by Prof. Stokes.        According to

1876.]            the Principle    of Reciprocity     to Acoustics.               119
this view a sound is ordinarily heard better with the wind than against
it, in consequence of a curvature of the rays. With the wind a ray will
generally be bent downwards, since the velocity of the air is generally
greater overhead than at the surface, and therefore the upper part of
the wave-front tends to gain on the lower.               The ray which ultimately
reaches the observer is one which started in some degree upwards from
the source, and has the advantage of being out of the way of obstacles
for the greater part of its course. Against the wind, on the other hand,
the curvature of the rays is upwards, so that a would-be observer at a
considerable distance is in danger of being left in a sound-shadow.
    It is very important to remark that this effect depends, not upon the
mere existence of a wind, but upon the velocity of the wind being greater
 overhead than below.        A uniform translation of the entire atmosphere
 would be almost without effect. In particular cases it may happen that
the velocity of the wind diminishes with height, and then sound is best
 transmitted against the wind. Prof. Henry shows that several anoma
lous phenomena relating to the audibility of signals may be explained by
 various suppositions as to the velocity of the wind at different heights.
 When the distances concerned are great, comparatively small curvatures
of the ray may produce considerable results.
    There is a further possible consequence of the action of wind (or
 variable temperature), which, so far as         I   know, has not hitherto been
 remarked.      By making the velocity a suitable function of height it would
 be possible   to secure an actual convergence of rays in a vertical plane
 upon a particular station.      The atmosphere would then act like the lens
 of a lighthouse,   and  the intensity of sound might be altogether abnormal.
 This may perhaps be the explanation of the extraordinary distances at
 which guns have sometimes been heard.
     The difference in the propagation of sound against and with the wind
 is no exception to the general law referred to at the beginning of this
 communication, for that law applies only to the vibrations of a system
 about a configuration of equilibrium.          A motion of the medium is thus
 excluded.     But the bending of the sound-ray due to a variable tempera
 ture, to which attention has been drawn by Prof. Reynolds, does not
 interfere with the application of the law.
     An experiment has, however, been brought forward by Prof. TyndalT,
 in which there is an apparent failure of reciprocity not referable to any
 motion of the medium *.          The source of sound is a very high-pitched
 reed mounted in a short tube and blown from a small bellows with
 which it is connected by rubber tubing.           The variation of pressure at
 the  second   point is made   apparent by    means   of the sensitive flame, which
 has been used by Prof. Tyndall with so much success on other occasions.
 Although the flame itself, when unexcited, is 18 to 24 inches high, it was
    • Proceedings  of the Boyal Institution, January  1875 ; also Prof. Tyndall's work
 on Sound, 3rd edition.

120                    Lord Rayleigh       on the     Application of            [June 15,
proved by a subsidiary experiment that the root of the flame, where it
issues from the burner, is the seat of sensitiveness.                With this arrange
ment the effect of a cardboard or glass screen interposed between the
reed and the flame was found to be different, according as the screen
was close to the flame or close to the reed.               In the former case the flame
indicated the action of sound, but              in  the latter remained uninfluenced.
Since the motion of the screen is plainly equivalent to an interchange of
the reed and flame, there is to all appearance a failure in the law of
reciprocity.
   At first sight this experiment           is difficult to reconcile with theoretical
conclusions.       It  is true that the conditions        under which reciprocity is to
be expected are not very perfectly realized, since the flame ought not to
be moved from one position to the other.                  Although the seat of sensi
tiveness may be limited to the root of the flame, the tall column of
highly heated     gas might      not  be without effect ; and in fact it appeared to
me possible that the response of the flame, when close to the screen,
might be due to the conduction of sound downwards along it.                    Not feeling
satisfied, however, with this explanation,             I  determined to repeat the ex
periment,    and    wrote    to  Prof.  Tyndall,    asking to be allowed to see the
apparatus.      In reply he very kindly proposed to arrange a repetition of
the experiment at the Eoyal Institution for my benefit, an offer which                    I
gladly accepted.
   The effect itself was perfectly distinct, and, as it soon appeared, was
not to be explained in the manner just suggested, since the response of
the flame when close to the screen continued, even when the upper part
of the heated column was protected from the direct action of the source
by additional screens interposed.             I  was more than ever puzzled until
Mr. Cottrell showed          me another experiment in which,           I  believe, the key
of the difficulty     is to  be  found.
   'When the axis of the tube containing the reed is directed towards the
flame, situated at a moderate distance, there is a distinct and immediate
response   ;  but when the axis is turned             away from the flame through a
comparatively       small   angle,   the effect   ceases,  although the distance is the
same as before, and there are no obstacles interposed.                    If now a card
board screen     is  held   in  the prolongation      of  the  axis  of  the reed, and at
such an angle as to reflect the vibrations in the direction of the flame,
the effect is again produced with the same apparent force as at first.
   These results prove conclusively that the reed does not behave as the
simple source of theory, even approximately.                   When the screen is close
(about   2 inches      distant)   the  more   powerful     vibrations   issuing along the
axis of the instrument impinge directly upon the screen, are reflected
back, and take no further part in the experiment.                    The only vibrations
which have a chance           of  reaching   the   flame,  after  diffraction round the
screen, are the comparatively feeble ones which issue nearly at right
angles with the axis.            On the other hand, when the screen is close to

  1876.]            the  Principle of Reciprocity to Acoustics.                          121
 the flame, the efficient vibrations       are those which issue at a small angle
 with the axis, and are therefore much more powerful.                       Under these
 circumstances it is not surprising that the flame is affected in the latter
 caae and not in the former.
     The concentration of sound in the direction of the axis is greater than
 would have been anticipated, and is to be explained by the very short
 wave-length corresponding to the pitch of the reed. If, as is not im
 probable, the overtones of the note given by the reed are the most
 efficient part of the sound, the wave-length will be still shorter and the
 concentration more easy to understand*.
     The reciprocal theorem in its generalized form is not restricted to
 simple sources, from which (in the absence of obstacles) sound would
 issue alike in all directions ; and the statement for double sources will
 throw light on the subject of this note. A double source may be thus
 defined   : — Conceive two equal aud opposite simple sources, situated at a
 short distance apart, to be acting simultaneously.                 By calling the two
 sources opposite, it is meant that they are to be at any moment in op
 posite phases.      At a moderate distance the effects of the two sources
 are antagonistic and may be made to neutralize one another to any
 extent by diminishing the distance between the sources.                        If, how
 ever, at     the same time that we diminish the interval, we augment
 the intensity of the single sources, the effect may be kept constant.
 Pushing this idea to its limit, when the intensity becomes infinite and
 the interval vanishes, we arrive at the conception of a double source
 having on axis of symmetry coincident with the line joining the single
 sources of which it is composed.           In an open space the effect of a double
 source is the same as that communicated to the air by the vibration of a
solid sphere whose centre is situated at the double point and whose line
of vibration coincides with the axis, and the intensity of sound in direc
tions inclined     to the     axis varies as the square         of the cosine of the
obliquity.
    The statement of the reciprocal theorem with respect to double sources
is then as follows : — If there be equal double sources at two points A
and B, having axes A P, B Q respectively, then the velocity of the medium
at B resolved in the direction B Q due to the source at A is the same as
the velocity at A resolved in the direction A P due to the source at B.
If   the waves observed at        A and   B   are sensibly plane, and if the axes
A P, B Q are equally inclined to the waves received, we may, in the above
statement, replace " velocities
                                      "      " pressures," but not otherwise.
                                        by
   Suppose, now, that equal double sources face each other, so that tha
common axis is A B, and let us examine the effect of interpos1ng a screen
near to A.       By the reciprocal theorem, whether there be a screen or not,
the velocity at A in direction A B due to B is equal to the velocity at                   1$

in direction   AB  due to  A.     The waves received at B   are  approximately
plane and perpendic-ular to A B, so that the relation between the velocity
and pressure at B is that proper to a plane wave ; but it is otherwise in
the case of the sound received at      A.   Accordingly the reciprocal theorem
does  not lead us to expect an equality between the pressures at      A  and B,
on which- quantities   the behaviour of the sensitive flames depends.       On,
the contrary, it would appear that the pressure at A corresponding to
the given velocity along A B should be much greater than in the case of
a plane wave, and then the relative advantage of the position A would
be explained.
   It  will  be seen that    if  the preceding arguments are correct, Prof.
Tyndall's experiment does not bear out the conclusions that he has based
upon it with respect to the observations of the French Commission at
Villejuif and Montlhcry.        No acoustic clouds could explain the failure
of reciprocity then observed ; and the more probable hypothesis that the
effect was due to wind is not inconsistent with the observation that the
air (at the surface) was moving in the direction against which the sound
was best heard.
   Further experiments on this subject are very desirable.
VII. " On      Phosphorus Pentafluoride." By T. E. THORPE, F.R.S.,
      Professor of Chemistry in the Yorkshire College of Scieuce.
      Eeceived   June    6, 1876.
   Arsenic trifluoride acts violently upou phosphorus pentachloride with
the formation of arsenic trichloride and the liberation of a heavy fuming
gas, which analysis shows to be ptwsphorus pentafluoride.
   The production of the new       gas may be represented  by the equation
                      5 AsF, + 3 PCI, =    5 AsCl, + 3PF5.
   Direct experiments have shown that the amount of arsenic trichloride
actually produced in the reactions agrees closely with that demanded by
this equation.
   The accuracy of the formula was further controlled by determinations
of the density of the gas. Three experiments made by two independent
methods gave the numbers      —

 1876.]                    Phosphorus Pentafluoride.                          123
   Phosphorus pentafluoride is a colourless gas : it is incombustible and
 extinguishes flame ; it is absolutely irrespirable even when largely diluted
 with air ; it fumes strongly in moist air, and is rapidly decomposed
by water, forming hydrofluoric and phosphoric acids.          As it is nearly 4J
times heavier than air, it may be collected by downward displacement,
and may be poured from vessel to vessel.           It may be preserved in glass
vessels over dry mercury for some time without much alteration ; but its
volume very gradually diminishes, aud the glass after prolonged contact
with the gas is found to be slightly corroded.
   An attempt was made to liquefy the gas by compressing it in an
Oersted's apparatus as arranged to show the condensation of the more
readily liquefiable gases.      Under a pressure of 12 atmospheres (which
was the highest pressure the apparatus would safely bear) it showed no
signs of change.       When compared with the same initial volume of air,
no deviation from Boyle's law was observed sufficiently marked to warrant
the belief that the gas under this pressure was anywhere near its poiut
of condensation.
    Phosphorus    pentafluoride   experiences no apparent change on the pas
sage of induction-sparks, either when pure or when mixed with oxygen
or hydrogen.        The character of the light emitted during the discharge
is under investigation ; the spectrum which it affords is exceedingly
complicated.
    Phosphorus pentafluoride combines immediately with ammonia-gas.
forming a white solid body of the composition 2PF,.5NH,.              The gas is
readily absorbed by au aqueous solution of ammouia, aud the liquid on
concentration yields a crystalline deposit cousisting of a mixture of am
 monium dihydrogen phosphate,         NH4 H, P0t, aud acid ammonium fluoride,
 NH4F.HF.
    Wurtz has conclusively        shown that phosphorus peutachloride can
actually  exist  in the gaseous   state  under dimiuished pressure and between
certain narrow limits of temperature.           On the other Laud, the author
has given reasons, derived from considerations of specific volume, for the
supposition that phosphorus oxychloride, POOL,, and phosphorus thio-
chloride, PdCl, (bodies which are frequently adduced to show its peuta-
dicity), are in reality derivatives of triad phosphorus*.
   The existence of the gaseous peutafluoride, taken in conjunction witu
the fact that it is perfectly stable, even at very high temperatures, 1s of
great interest theoretically, inasmuch as this body unequivocally indicates
the pentadicity of phosphorus.

VIII.     " On Supersaturated Saline Solutions." By J. G. GRENFELL,
       B.A., F.G.S. Communicated by C. TOMLINSON, F.R.S. Re
       ceived June 6, 1876.
   In  making experiments on the sensitiveness of supersaturated solutions
to air and greasy surfaces, 1 was much annoyed by the solutions so
frequently crystallizing on the removal of the cotton-wool, as this
necessitated boiling the flask again and waiting till it was cool.           I
noticed that frequently part of the cotton-wool adhered to the mouth of
the flask ; aud it struck me that in removing this some fibres must get
detached and fall iu, carrying with them in all probability crystals of the
salt.    I soon convinced myself that this was the case, and that cotton
wool is perhaps the worst material that could be chosen for covering
these solutions.     I                                       I
                        now always use paper or tinfoil ; and find that these
can be removed many times from the same solution without inducing
crystallization.     I  then found that even the most sensitive solutions
could be taken up in a clean glass tube aud dropped on a clean glass
plate without crystallizing ; and that they will remain liquid exposed to
the air for a very long time, often, in fact, till they dry up by evaporation
in modified forms.       Twenty drops on a plate give twenty experiments
on the effect of air, clean and unclean surfaces, and evaporation ; then
the plate is cleaned, and more drops are taken from the original solution
till this is used up. The trouble of boiling is thus reduced to a mini
mum, and the drops can be put upon all kinds of surfaces to test their
activity.    The slow growth of the modified salts can be watched for
hours ; and their forms are sometimes peculiar.         Thus sulphate of soda
often gives a single, square, flat pyramid, or a broad well-shaped prism, or
occasionally small octahedra round the edge of the drop.        The pyramids
and prisms change to opaque white when touched, and are apparently
the 7-atom salt ; the octahedra do not change, and are evidently the
anhydrous salt.        This fact is interesting, from its supporting the view
that it is the anhydrous salt which is in solution.
    Or, again, a plate with drops may be dried over calcium chloride ; and
this sometimes modifies the results, as in the case of ammonia alum.
This salt, when allowed to evaporate in air, generally forms a shining
semitransparent film of greenish colour with a depression at the top, in
which is often a circular opening, while inside small globular concretions
of a dull, opaque, milky white colour are formed ; these will remain
moist inside for a couple of days or more.            When touched with the
normal     salt, the whole   drop  becomes  brilliant opaque white, quite dry,
and apparently increases in volume, as the crust often breaks up and
curls outwards.
    This modified salt is apparently new. 1 put some drops over calcium
 chloride: no film wns formed, but the drops crystallized very slowly in

 1876.]              Supersaturated Saline Solutions.                     125
the globular forms mixed with little, clear, flat, very thin pointed plates
which reminded me much of a particular form of aluminium sulphate.
When dry all the drops were brilliant opaque white, and retained a good
deal of water.
    Potash alum forms similar films and globular masses.        The mother-
liquor of the ammonia alum sometimes slowly deposits short, fine, silky
needles with a faint milky tinge and small globular masses.      I have only
recently adopted the method of using drops, and have not much leisure
for working ; but the field is so wide, and the results already obtained
have such an important bearing on the theory of the crystallization of
                       I
these solutions, that have ventured to put them forward in their present
incomplete state.
   The most commonly received theory is that of which M. de G-eruez is
the most prominent advocate — that only a crystal of the same salt causes
crystallization, and that these are introduced by the air, which is a vast
storehouse of crystals of all kinds.
   The following experiments seem to support the crystal theory ; but at
the same time they clearly show that the quantity of salts present in the
atmosphere is indefinitely less than we have hitherto been led to sup
pose, and, in fact, they bring that quantity down within the limits of
ordinary probability.
    1. Put drops of a very strong solution of sulphate of soda on a plate on
my laboratory table ; waved a newspaper over them for some time, pro
ducing a strong, current of air : most of them did not crystallize, and
one slowly dried up in octahedra.       I have repeatedly of late boiled sul
phuric acid in the laboratory, so that there can be no lack of sodium
sulphate in the dust.
   2. Drew a strong current of air over drops of sodium sulphate in a
glass tube : inactive.
   3. Drops of sodium sulphate put upon the leaves of many plants in
my garden.       They slowly evaporated, giving the 7-atom salt.         The
leaves were covered with dust, as the garden opens on to a road, and the
weather has been hot and dry ; we are not far from Bristol, so we might
expect to find sulphates.
   4. Carried sodium sulphate to an upper room; drops on the wash-
hand stand, on the window-sill inside and out, on the iron bars outside :
all inactive.   Washed my hands and spread a drop with the finger on
the window-sill, inside : inactive.       Three drops crystallized    on the
mantlepiece, and one on the window-sill.      Several drops on the window-
frame evaporated as 7-atom salt.
   5. Potash alum on a window-sill outside gave a modified film.
   6. Sodium acetate put upon the cork of a large bottle which had stood
for two years untouched in my laboratory.       The drops were quite thick
with dust, but remained liquid for more than 24 hours.
   7. Other drops of the same put on the floor of the laboratory, on the

126                           Mr.  J. G. Grenfell on                   [June 15,
dusty corners of the shelves, on paper, on every place and kind of sur
face   I  could find : remained liquid in all cases.
    8. Spread a number of drops of the same on a glass plate, covering
nearly the whole of it.       Made about half crystallize.  Left them exposed
for three days ; they remained liquid, though the normal salt effloresces
slightly.
    9. Ammonia alum : many drops on a glass plate ; they formed films
by evaporation ; made a good many crystallize, when they broke open,
early in the day : carried them out in a high wind to the house of a
neighbour, and brought them back ; then late at night put a number of
fresh drops on the plate, and several of them remained liquid all night.
    10. Sodium carbonate is not affected by any surface in my laboratory.
I  have spread a drop over a dirty glass plate so as to cover a good many
square inches, and it slowly evaporated, giving crystals.          Drops on the
floor, shelves, bottles, &c. of the laboratory invariably remain liquid.
    I could give many other instances, but these are sufficient to show that
the air does not ordinarily contain these salts, and that    it  does  not readily
catch them up and deposit them on all kinds of surfaces ; and yet
these salts are remarkably sensitive to crystals of the same kind. The
effect of using cotton-wool is a good example of this. Another is this : —
 Touched a crystallized drop of sodium acetate with a pin ; passed the
pin repeatedly      through my coat : active at once. After touching a
crystal the finger needs to be washed carefully.        Again, sodium sulphate
crystallizes almost invariably on any dirty surface in my laboratory, and
ammonia alum generally.          Even the sodium acetate crystallizes at times
when     I  am at work with the same salt close by.
    Sodium sulphate crystallizes generally on a clean plate exposed in my
laboratory as 10-atom salt, whilst if protected by an inverted beaker it
dries up by evaporation, forming the modified salt. So, again, have hadI
two drops of sodium sulphate liquid all night, and both crystallize within
ten minutes of my entering the room in the morning.             In my bedroom,
however,     I left a test-tube containing this solution open all night with
the pipette on the mantlepiece.          In the morning the solution had not
crystallized,    while the end of the pipette was covered with a white
incrustation, which was inactive in the liquid. The incrustation was
again left to dry up, and then contained plenty of water, being evidently
the 7-atom salt.
   For sodium acetate and carbonate it is quite useless to have any cover on
the flask or test-tube which contains them, and also for the sulphate in an
ordinary room. Care must be taken that crystals are not formed near the
mouth of the tube, so as to fall in ; but that is the only precaution neces
sary.      Carbonate of soda by evaporation becomes oily like sodium and
potassium acetates.       I  have not yet investigated the composition of the
films and crystals which these solutions deposit.
   Normal sodium acetate when heated leaves a white mass              which deli-

  1876.]                  Supersaturated Saline Solutions.                      127
quesces, forming a strongly supersaturated solution.              The anhydrous
 sulphate     also   forms  a  supersaturated solution   when  added  to water, as
 De Coppet pointed out.
     I touched      a drop of the acetate with the point of a penknife ; a little
 drop crystallized on the penknife, but the drop itself did not.             I then
 repeatedly touched the surface of the drop rapidly with the solidified
part and obtained a little rod, formed of separate layers and nearly
 i  inch long. At last the rod broke in the drop, which instantly crystal
 lized,     I have repeated this with carbonate of soda.      The fact is interest
 ing   as showing how very local the crystallizing force is.      Faraday had an
 idea that this force might possibly be transferred by wires ; but           I have
 poured out part of a solution which was crystallizing into a test-tube,
 where    it remained supersaturated.
     Professor Tomlinson has long maintained with great ingenuity the
 theory that the cause of crystallization in these solutions is adhesion.
 To a surface covered with a film of greasy matter the salt adheres, while
 the liquid does not, and therefore separation follows.            I do not think
 that theory can be sustained in the presence of the following facts : —
     1. Eubbed the finger on the palm of the hand, and took up solution
of alum from a drop, and deposited on another part of the same plate :
inactive.
     2. Eubbed oil on the palm of the hand, and repeated : again inactive.
    3. Smeared oil over a glass plate : inactive to drops of alum.
     4. Eubbed oil on the finger; took up some sodium carbonate, and
rubbed it hard on the plate : inactive.
    5. Eepeated this with sodium acetate.
    The mere fact, however, that the salts are, as a rule, perfectly insensible
to every kind of surface, wood, paint, paper, glass, and dust of all kinds,
seems to me fatal to this theory.
    A solution of one part of normal sodium sulphate in about six of sul
phuric acid possesses some curious properties. This solution, which sets
quite firm, can be kept for a week in an open beaker, so that the air ap
parently has no crystals to introduce ; and yet when dropped on to a
dirty surface in my laboratory it more often crystallizes than not. It is
thus much more sensitive than an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate
or acetate. The crystals are apparently a hydrate of the hyperacid salt
NaH, (SOJ, ; and it is almost inconceivable that the dust should con
tain crystals of this salt. It is extremely deliquescent, and the excess of
                                                                                    '
acid should certainly be taken up by the dust, and very often by the
surface itself.
    The solution sometimes crystallizes suddenly in the test-tube as though
something had fallen in. The crystallized drops will not stand exposure
to air for more than 30 minutes or so.         Hence, although there is plenty
of sulphuric acid in my laboratory, where              I have often heated this
solution,     I  find it very hard to believe that the salt exists in this form

128                             Mr.     J.  Gh  Grenfell on                     [June 15,
in any part of the room. The normal salt and the anhydrous salt are
 without action on the solution. It crystallizes in a test-tube in fine
stellate masses, with projecting points on all sides, as alum sometimes
does ; these ultimately coalesce. These crystals are composed of very fine
parallel fibres like ferns, and are opaque white.                   It sometimes sets in
long fibres, radiating from different points like aluminium sulphate.
 Owing to the fineness of the fibres it would be very difficult to free them
from the mother-liquor.
    My reason for believing them to be a hydrate is this : —In a beaker
 this solution gradually deposits clear crystals, varying from very fine
needles to rhombic           plates, prisms, and short, nearly globular, highly
 modified forms.        These are formed near the top, and may perhaps be
 different hydrates.        They are formed, however, at the same time, and at
 present    I  believe  them     all to be the hyperacid salt.            Similar ones are
 formed      by putting the normal salt in the 6 to 1 solution, and this
 remains liquid, sometimes dissolving the crystals.                An opaque amorphous
 mass is formed at the same time, which appears to be hydrated, but it
 also is inactive.'     A   mixture      of two parts of acid to one of salt in a
 flask, when boiled to get rid of all water, sets firmly in a clear mass, in
 which the opaque variety makes no change. Then if a little water is
 added the salt turns opaque white wherever the water reaches ; and this
 is entirely absorbed, the cake remaining quite dry.
    If  this is again melted it deposits clear prisms, leaving a little mother-
 liquor; but the opaque variety when introduced from the 6 to 1 solution
causes the whole          mass to set firmly opaque white and become quite
 dry. The opacity spreads slowly, and a kind of beard of fine crystals
 can sometimes be seen growing round the prisms at the edge. Lovely
 foliated films are often formed at the same time.                  The clear crystals are
inactive in the 6 to       1  solution,     while the opaque is active : and this is a
clear proof of their identity.           Solutions of intermediate strength between
 2 to    1  and 6 to     1 often deposit         in flasks the whole excess in clear
crystals,     which   are  sometimes       inactive   in the 6 to 1 in a test-tube.      It
is almost impossible to obtain these solutions supersaturated in flasks,
though      it may be done with the utmost facility in test-tubes.                  Out of
many trials with one flask           I  only succeeded once by leaving it to cool on
the sand-bath.         In  a test-tube       they give the same forms as the 6 to 1.
The variety of the forms in which these solutions crystallize is truly
astonishing, according to the proportion of acid and salt, amount of
water, and the temperature.              A flask once gave the roost exquisite little,
flat, open flakes closely resembling snow-flakes ; but                  I  have not been
able to reproduce them.             In short the relations of these two substances
to each other want working out thoroughly.                    A certain amount of acid
added to the salt       which    is  in  excess   gives  a  thin  liquid, which will not
crystallize, and a little fine white powder, the anhydrous salt.                      Two
drops    of  acid  iu a test-tube     half-full   of solution  cause drops   to  evaporate

1876.]                   Supersaturated      Saline Solutions.                       129
on a plate in octahedra        ; and when the anhydrous          is thrown down on
heating     the teat-tube  locally  after  crystallizing,  it is redissolved, leaving,
however, well-marked octahedra just before it all disappears.
    The most curious property, however, of the 6 to 1 solution is this : —
On a clean glass plate it can be spread out into a thin covering of the
plate with the handle of a tooth-brush ; then with the end of a glass rod
scratch a letter hard 011 the plate, and the letter will come out at once
in slowly growing crystals.           The effect is certain with the right pro
portions, and is most striking, as a plate of any size can be used.
Scratching has the same effect when the solution is placed on gold or
copper, but not on platinum foil, load foil, bone, gutta percha, or any
soft substance.       The effect is of coarse analogous to that of scratching
on the ammonio-magnesic phosphate and on soda water in a clean
 tumbler.       Mr. Tomliuson explains these by supposing that a partial
 vacuum is formed into which the salt and gas separate.                     I  confess it
 seems to me more probable that the result is due to vibration.                    With
the same solution of sodium sulphate in add, but of different strength,
 scratching is inactive, and        I  have tried it in vain on many aqueous
 solutions.
     I cannot see why the vacuum should not act equally on all ; but it is
 easy to understand how the molecular vibrations of one unstable system
 should be affected by a particular set of vibrations, whilst those of another
 system should not. The results obtained thus far, then, are : —
     1. Exposure to air and dust has no effect on some supersaturated
 solutions.
     2. The sulphates are the most sensitive.             Exposure of a clean glass
 plate   for  half an   hour to  the  air of  my laboratory caused nearly all the
 drops of sodiuu1 sulphate put upon it to crystallize at once, whilst the
  same plate recently cleaned is quite inactive.
     3. Even the sulphates are unaffected by the dust of the open air and
  generally of ordinary rooms.
     4. Anhydrous salts or modified salts, sometimes new, are produced by
  the spontaneous evaporation of the solutions in drops.
      5. Drops can be rapidly touched on their surface with crystals of the
  same salt without crystallizing.
      6. Greasy surfaces, whether films or lenses, have no effect.
      7. The shape of the vessel has sometimes a material influence                on the
  possibility of obtaining a supersaturated solution.
      8. Air and dirty surfaces are active on salts which apparently cannot
  exist in air.
      9. Scratching a hard surface will cause a particular solution to
   crystallize.
      The crystal theory, modified as it now must be, seems on the whole
   the best explanation       of the phenomena.         The case of the hyperacid
   sodium     sulphate,   however,     remains   to  be   explained.     If   the crystal

  130                On Supersaturated Saline Solutions.                 [June 15,
 theory is true, the order of sensitiveness of the solutions should be
 the order of comparative rarity of the salts ; and this remains to be
  proved.
     As to the cause of supersaturation, a good many facts seem to show
 that it is the anhydrous salt which enters into solution.               The lower
 hydrates seem to be first formed, as in the case of sodium sulphate and
 the alums.     In the case of the hyperacid sodium sulphate with two parts
 acid to one of salt, repeatedly boiled, it seems to be the anhydrous salt
 which is first deposited.       When the aqueous solutions of sodium sul
 phate and the alums are made to crystallize, the modified salts become
 opaque white, while the hyperacid salt remains unchanged, and can be
 obtained unchanged by heating the opaque variety from the top so as to
 dissolve this, but not the anhydrous.
     Against the theory that it is the anhydrous sodium sulphate in
 solution at low temperatures must be set the following fact.
    Lowel, in his Tables of the solubility of the three forms of sodium
 sulphate, which are found in all our text-books, gives 412 parts of «alt
 to 100 of water as the maximum solubility of the 10-atom salt; and this
is the highest number for any of the three kinds.               Now   I   have dis
solved 600 parts of 10-atom salt in 100 of water at 37° C. without
throwing down a trace of anhydrous.                I then warmed it : at 45° a
doubtful trace of anhydrous ; at 51° verv few ; at 60° still very few ; at
67° about as much as would lie on a little-finger nail ; at 75° eight or
ten times as much, the liquid nearly opaque ; at 80° a large quantity ;
 boiled, the salt thickly covered the bottom of a large flask.
    Now here the solution at 60° practically retained the whole of the 6 oz.
of salt to 1 of water, while according to Lowel it should have retained
only 2£ oz.
    Then between 70° and       80° a sudden     change takes place, and a large
quantity is thrown down.          This agrees so far with Lowel's Table, as,
according to him, at 84° the whole of the excess was practically thrown
down.     This looks very much like dissociation taking place at that tem
perature; and that would involve the supposition that it was the 10-atom
salt in solution before.     The difference in our results springs from the
different modes of working.         Lowel always maintained a large excess of
anhydrous present,      whilst  I  added  the salt in small portions, carefully
avoiding throwing down any anhydrous.              This is pretty easily done by
keeping up    a  very rapid motion    so as  to  prevent the liquid from getting
heated too much at any point.          It seems to me that in any case, as the
six ounces fairly dissolved,     the  solubility of the 10-atom salt should be
given in those proportions.          Further experiments would,         I  have no
doubt, give still higher figures.
    In conclusion,   I  would remark that if the crystal theory of these
solutions be accepted we have a test of great delicacy in these drops for
the presence of the salts.        Interesting experiments might be made as

    De Coppet has already remarked             that the mass   of a solution  exerts
some influence on its crystallization,         and  I have  shown that the form of
the vessel also has a decided effect.          The effect again of different vibra
tions on different solutions        is worth trying, as there seems to be no
reason whv the hyperacid sodium salt should be an exceptional case.
    A good deal of work has yet to be done before we arrive at a satis
factory explanation      of these obscure phenomena.

    In  my last paper (No. VII.)      I  illustrated the Law of Fatigue by experi
ments made in lifting weights varying in amount, without rest, at a fixed
rate of motion ;     I shall now illustrate the Law by experiments made in
lifting a fixed weight at varying rates of motion, without rest,          as before.

    " When    the same muscle (or group of muscles') is kept in constant action
until  fatigue sets in, the total work done multiplied by the rate of work is
constant."
    The following experiments were made during the last six months by
Dr. Macalister and myself : —
    A pair of 10-lb. dumbbells, held one in each hand, were raised simul
taneously from the vertical to the horizontal position, and again lowered,
at a rate regulated by a metronome made for the purpose.              No rest was
allowed at the beginning or end of the motion, which took place as
before, under the following conditions,          viz. : —
    1. To keep time with the metronome.
    2.  To raise the weights in the transverse plane.
    3. To supinate the hands.
    4. To abstain from all bending of the knees or spinal column.
    5. The experimenter not to count the lifts.
    The experiments were made at intervals never less than 24 hours, so
as to avoid all risk of the muscles becoming trained ; and on each occa

In  the following diagram these results are plotted to scale.
   I shall   now proceed to compare these results with calculations made
from the Law of Fatigue. In the examples of the Law of Fatigue given
in No. VII. the work done by the muscles is dynamical work, and con
sists in lifting weights at a fixed rate until fatigue sets in ; but in the
present     experiments the work done is partly dynamical        and partly
statical,   the latter consisting in the efforts made by the    muscles to
hold the weight and arm extended in positions varying from the vertical
to the horizontal position.
   Let W,, R, be the dynamical work and rate of work, and let W2, R,
be the statical work and rate of work.
   If  the work done were purely dynamical or purely statical, we should
have, by the Law of Fatigue, either
                                       W,
                            W, R, =         = constant,

   The Law of Fatigue         may be applied in oue or other of two ways.
   1°.  The total work done        is W, + W„ and the rate of work — ' — '•
                                                                                 ^

    The dynamical work is proportional to a; the length of the arm, to
    io + a, the weight plus half the weight of the arm, and to n the number
of lifts.
    The statical work is proportional to w, the length of the arm, to
   te-f a, the weight plus half the weight of the arm, and to T the total
time.
    The total time T is proportional to
                                n, the number of lifts,
and to                           t, the time of each lift.

 This represents a cuspidal cubic ; and we are required to find values for
 /3 and A which will satisfy the experiments.
      2°. The second method of applying the Law of Fatigue leads to an
 equation which represents the experiments better than equation (2) ; and
 the principle on which it is founded is probably a more correct applica
 tion of the Law of Fatigue.                  I    assume that fatigue will occur when
 the dynamical work multiplied by its rate, together with the statical
 work multiplied by its rate, shall be constant ; or if WE represent the
 total work of all kinds, and rate of both works, then
                     WE    = W.I^ + W.R, = constant                                            (3)
 This is equivalent to assuming the total rate of work to                       be

followed is this : — Let any value of /3 be assumed, and substituted in
equations (2) and (5) for all the values of t ; the resulting values of A
will differ more or less from each other : let 2A be the greatest differ
ence between any two values, and let /u be the number of observations,

                                              l-l3t   =  0,
and the point of inflexion of the curve N occurs at double the preceding value
                                                                                             of/-

 principal results    Ihave obtained, reserving the details until they are
 ready to be brought forward in a more complete form.
    In the early days of this research, when it was found that no move
 ment took place until the vacuum was so good as to be almost beyond
 the powers of an ordinary air-pump to produce, and that as the vacuum
 got more and more nearly absolute, so the force increased in power, it
 was justifiable to assume that the action would still take place when
 the minute trace of residual gas which theoretical reasoning proved to be
present was removed.      The first and most obvious explanation therefore
was that the repulsive force was directly due to radiation.           Further
consideration, however, showed that the very best vacuum which            I
                                                                          had
succeeded in producing might contain enough matter to offer considerable
resistance to motion.           I
                            have already pointed out that in some experi
ments, where the rarefaction was pushed to a very high point, the torsion-
beam appeared to be swinging in a viscous fluid (194) ; and this at once
led me to think that the repulsion caused by radiation was indirectly due
to a difference of thermometric heat between the black and white sur
faces of the moving body (195), and that it might be due to a secondary
action on the residual gas.
    On April 5, 1876,       I
                          exhibited at the Soiree of the Boyal Society an
instrument which proved the presence of residual gas in a radiometer
which had been exhausted to a very high point of sensitiveness.       A small
piece  of  pith was suspended   to one end  of a  cocoon fibre, the other end
being attached to a fragment of steel.       An external magnet held the
steel to the inner side of the glass globe, the pith then hanging down
like a pendulum, about a millimetre from the rotating vanes of the
radiometer.      By placing a candle at different distances off, any desired
velocity, up to several hundreds per minute, could be imparted to the fly
of the radiometer.     Scarcely any movement of the pendulum was pro
duced when the rotation was very rapid ; but on removing the candle, and
letting the rotation die out, at one particular velocity the pendulum set
up a considerable movement.       Professor Stokes suggested (and, in fact,
tried the experiment at the time) that the distance of the candle should
be so adjusted that the permanent rate of rotation should be the critical
one for synchronism corresponding to the rate at which one arm of the
fly passed for each complete oscillation.  In this way the pendulum was
kept for some time swinging with regularity through     large arc.

 paniment of the phenomena was rendered probable by the observations of
 Dr. Schuster, as well as by my own experiments on the movement of the
floating glass case of a radiometer when the arms are fixed by a magnet*.
    My first endeavour was to get      some    experimental means of discrimi
nating between the viscosity of the minute quantity of residual gas and
the other retarding forces, such as the friction of the needle-point on the
glass cup when working with a radiometer, or the torsion of the glass fibre
when a torsion-apparatus      was used.     A glass bulb is blown on the end of
a glass tube, to the upper       part of which a glass stopper is accurately
fitted by grinding.     To the lower part of the stopper a fine glass fibre is
cemented, and to the end of this is attached a thin oblong plate of pith,
which hangs suspended in the centre of the globe ; a mirror is attached
to the pith bar, which enables its movement to be observed on a
graduated scale.      The stopper is well lubricated with the burnt india-
rubber which     I  have already found so useful in similar cases (207).
The instrument is held upright by clamps, and is connected to the pump
by a long spiral tube. The stopper is fixed rigidly in respect to space,
and an arrangement is made by which the bulb can be rotated through a
 small  angle.   The pith plate, with mirror, being suspended from the
 stopper, the rotation of the bulb can only cause a motion of the pith
 through the intervention of the enclosed air. Were there no viscosity
of the air, the pith would not move ; but if there be viscosity, the pith will
 turn in the same direction as the bulb, though not to the same extent,
and, after stopping the vessel, will oscillate backwards and forwards in
decreasing arcs, presently setting in its old position relatively to space.
    It was suggested by Prof. Stokes that it would be desirable to register
not merely the amplitude of the first swing, but the readings of the first
five swings or so.      This would afford a good value of the logarithmic
decrement (the decrement per swing of the logarithm of the amplitude of
the arcs), which is the constant most desirable to know.                 The loga
rithmic decrement will involve the viscosity of the glass fibre ; but glass
is so nearly perfectly elastic, and the fibre so very thin, that this will be
practically insensible.
    According to Professor Clerk Maxwell, the viscosity of a gas should be
independent of its density ; and the experiments with this apparatus
have shown that this is practically correct, as the logarithmic decrement
of the arc of the oscillation (a constant which may be taken as defining
the viscosity of the gas) only slightly diminishes up to as high an
exhaustion as   I  can conveniently attain- — higher, indeed, than is necessary
to produce repulsion by radiation.
    I next endeavoured to measure, simultaneously with the logarithmic
decrement of the arc of oscillation, the repulsive force produced hv a
candle at high degrees of exhaustion.             The motion produced bv the
rotation of the bulb alone    has the advantage of       exhibiting palpably to the

  eye  that there is a viscosity between the suspended body and the vessel ;
  but once having ascertained that, and admitting that the logarithmic
  decrement of the arc of oscillation (when no candle is shining on the
  plate) is a measure of the viscosity, there is no further necessity to
 complicate the apparatus by having the ground and lubricated stopper.
 A movement of the whole vessel bodily through a small arc is equally
 effective for getting this logarithmic decrement ; and the absence of the
 stopper enables me to have the whole apparatus sealed up in glass, and
 I can   therefore experiment at higher rarefactions     than would be possible
 when a lubricated stopper is present.
     The apparatus, which is too complicated to describe without a drawing,
 has attached to it : — a, a Sprengel pump ; b, an arrangement for producing
 a chemical     vacuum ; c, a lamp with scale, on which to observe the
 luminous index reflected from the mirror ; d, a standard candle at a fixed
 distance ; and e, a small vacuum-tube, with the internal ends of the
 platinum wires close together.      I  can therefore take observations of :—
     1. The logarithmic decrement of the arc of oscillation when under no
influence of radiation ;
     2. The successive swings and final deflection when a candle shines on
 one end of the blackened bar ;
    3. The appearance of the induction-spark between the platinum wires.
     1 measures the viscosity ; 2 enables me to calculate the force of
radiation of the candle ; and 3 enables me to form an idea of the pro
gress of the vacuum according as the interior of the tube becomes uni
 formly luminous, striated, luminous at the poles only, or black and non
conducting.
     The apparatus is also arranged so that       I can try similar experiments
 with any vapour or gas.
     The following are some of the most important results which this
apparatus has as yet yielded.
     Up to an exhaustion at which the gauge and barometer are sensibly
 level, there is not much variation in the viscosity of the internal gas
 (drv atmospheric air). Upon now continuing to exhaust, the force of
 radiation commences to be apparent, the viscosity remaining about the
 same. The viscosity next commences to diminish, the force of radiation
 increasing.     After long-continued exhaustion the force of radiation ap
 proaches a maximum ; but the viscosity measured by the logarithmic
 decrement begins to fall off, the decrease being rather sudden after it has
once commenced.
    Lastly, some time after the logarithmic decrement has commenced to
fail off, and when it is about one fourth of what it was at the com
mencement, the force of radiation diminishes.         At the highest exhaustion
I   have yet   been  able to work  at, the logarithmic  decrement is about one
twentieth of its original amount, and the force of repulsion has sunk to a
little less than one half of the maximum.            The attenuation   has now

become    so excessive that we are no longer at   liberty to treat the number
of gaseous molecules present in the apparatus as practically infinite and,
according to Professor Clerk Maxwell's theory, the mean length of path
of the molecules between their collisions is no longer very small com
pared with the dimensions of the apparatus.
   The degree of exhaustion at which an induction-current          will not pass
is far below the extreme exhaustions at which the logarithmic         decrement
falls rapidly.
   The force of radiation does not act suddenly, but takes an appreciable
time to attain its maximum — thus proving, as Prof. Stokes has pointed
out, that the force is not due to radiation directly but indirectly.
   In a radiometer exhausted to a very high degree of sensitiveness, the
viscosity of the residual gas is almost as great as if it were at the atmo
spheric pressure.
   With other gases      than   air the phenomena are different in degree,
                             —
although similar in kind aqueous vapour, for instance, retarding the
force of repulsion to a great extent, and carbonic acid acting in a similar
though less degree.
   The evidence afforded by the experiments of which this is a brief
abstract is to my mind so strong as almost to amount to conviction that the
repulsion resulting from radiation is due to an action of thermometric
heat between the surface of the moving body and the case of the instru
ment, through the intervention of the residual gas.        This explanation of
its action is in accordance with recent speculations as to the ultimate
constitution of matter and the dynamical theory of gases.
XI. "Note       on certain unusual Coagulation-appearances             found in
      Mucus and other Albuminoid Fluids."              By CHARLES CREIGH
      TON,   M.B., M.A. Communicated by Prof. HUXLEY, Sec. R.S.
       Received June 9, 1876.
   The following observations were made in the course of re-examining
a number of microscopic preparations that had been originally made for
other purposes.     They relate to certain unusual coagulation-forms that
mucous or colloid or other albuminoid fluids assume when they are
treated in a particular way.
   In an early investigation of Virchow's (' Ueber die Form des geronnenen
Faserstoffs ') the production of the fibrinous threads of a coagulum was
attributed to the contraction of the clot towards particular points, and
was compared to the process of crystallization. " We may consider,"
says Virchow,
                " this process to be a kind of
                                               organic crystallization, wherein
each separate fibril must be viewed as a complex of smaller crystalline
particles.    As in crystallization, so likewise in this case the separate
molecules arrange themselves in particular directions to form delicate

 columns,    in which, however, no characteristic         surfaces or angles can be
 discovered    even with the highest magnifying-powers                 In the case of
 mucus we have an appearance quite similar.                  The solidified jelly-like
 mucus is entirely homogeneous and hyaline ; and only in the direction
 in which it is stretched, dragged, or torn does it show folds and markings,
 and, according      to circumstances, even a network— an actual division into
 filaments or bundles.         But if it is brought to coagulate by means of
 water, still better by means of alcohol or acids, the coagulation is fol
 lowed by a shrinking, through which actual fibrils may result"*. The
 coagulation-appearances now to be described will be found to favour the
 analogy with crystallization.          These exceptional coagulation-forms         are
 also interesting as having recently been mistaken for something quite
 different.    This mistake, which has greatly contributed to the spread of
 a  reactionary and superficial      pathology, will be referred to at the end of
 the note.
     The mucus on which the observations have been made occurred in the
 acini and ducts of mammary glands of the bitch and cat, in the alveoli
 of the thyroid body, and in the alveolar spaces of two extensive colloid
 or myxomatous tumours that grew from bone or periosteum ; the mam
 mary gland is known to produce mucus as a normal secretion under
 certain circumstances t. The same appearances have been found also
 among the coagulated plasma with which the veins of a lymphatic gland
 were filled.     The appearances found in these cases seem to depend on
 the mode of preparation, which was essentially the same in them all.
 The portions of gland or other mucus-containing tissue were immersed
in the hardening fluid as soon as they were removed from the body and
while they were still warm.          The hardening fluid was either a £ per cent,
solution of chromic acid, or the same solution mixed with an equal quan
tity of methylated spirit.
    The preparations of the thyroid body are the best adapted to show the
whole series of coagulation-forms           and the gradations between them.         A
large   number of the alveoli are filled with perfectly homogeneous or
jelly-like coagulum, which has coloured purple with the logwood staining-
fluid. The edge of the coagulum is very often vesiculated in such a
manner that it seems to be attached to the wall of the alveolus by the
points of crescent-shaped indentations.             The same dentate edge of the
coagulum is often seen within the veins in chromic-acid preparations.
The form of coagulation in the thyroid that comes nearest to the homo
geneous is where a number of fine granules appear to be imbedded in
the jelly-like mucus; this produces a cloudy or spawn-like effect.                Side
by side with these alveoli occur others, in which the coagulum is nothing
but a closely packed mass of granules without connecting substance ; and

142        Mr. C. Creighton      on Coagulation-appearances            [June   15,
these granules vary much in size in different alveoli.   In some the co
agulated mucus   becomes finely divided, while in others  it is broken up
into only a few rounded masses of relatively large size.     Perhaps the
commonest size of the globules or granules of mucus is about one third
the diameter of the red blood-corpuscle, while the largest masses may
be twice its diameter. All the other coagulation effects can be shown to
be modifications      of the granular condition; they range from not very
 complex groups      of  granules or spherules to a close meshwork, and to
 long branching filaments like the threads of ordinary fibrin.             Many
 alveoli of the thyroid body show the simpler         reticular arrangements of
 the coagulated mucus ; the more complex reticular appearances are best
 seen in two preparations of the mammary gland with mucus in the
 ducts ; and the filamentous appearance is best seen in the large colloid
 collections that occur throughout the two myxomatous tumours.               The
 mucus in the mammary ducts has the following singular appearance : —
 Along both sides of the duct there is a strip of homogeneous mucus which
 adheres to the wall by means of the dentate points already mentioned ;
 further towards the centre of the duct the mucus is broken up into a
 mass of granules ; and the broad central space is owrupied by a network,
the meshes of which become larger towards the middle. The appearance
looks as if it had been produced by a shrinking of the mucus towards the
 sides of the duct.     The fibres of this reticulum are short and thick, and
there arise from them numerous knob-like projections, chiefly at the
points where the fibres seem to branch ; and where the fibres seem in the
 section to end, their free extremities are found to be capped with the
same knob-like enlargements.          These round processes are of the same
diameter as the threads or cords on which they are seated. The substance
of the whole reticulum is uniform, and is coloured throughout with the
staining-fluid.
    The plan of this singular arrangement becomes clear by studying the
simpler forms of    it,  as seen in the alveoli of the thyroid body.     Several
 granules   or spherules  of mucus  are found  to have arranged  themselves  like
a  group of crystals.     Eound a central spherule three or four others (as     it
appears    in  the  section) are regularly grouped to form    a    small rosette.
'When several of these rosettes are placed in apposition, the optical effect
is  that of branching cords or fibres with knob-like projections arising
from them at short and equal intervals.         The appearance of  a  nodulated
fibre is  best seen where the elements composing    it   are small. The smaller
the granules or spherules are, the longer do the intervals seem between
the upright knob-like projections  but
                                   ;      the focus
                                            if        altered, there come

into view other projections arising along the course of the apparent fibre
at other angles or in other planes.
   The common starting-point of the various coagulation-forms that have
been described appears to be that, under the influence of certain re
agents, the warm albuminoid fluid    deposited in the form of larger or
                                       is

1876.]        found in Mucus and other Albuminoid Fluids.                 143
smaller droplets or granules.   These droplets, which are analogous to the
crystals deposited    from a crystallizing solution, are sometimes found of
considerable size among the homogeneous mucus : in many cases the
whole coagulum is granular, the granules remaining closely packed toge
ther; but they sometimes group themselves at certain points in the field,
leaving  free spaces between the groups, and these groups have each
something of the regularity of a rosette of crystals. The clusters of gra
nules further assume more of a reticular arrangement or more of a linear,
according to circumstances.
   The plasma of the blood is found sometimes, in chromic-acid prepara
tions, to assume the same coagulation-forms as those just described and
explained for mucus ; the necklace-like or nodulated fibres are obviously
a modificationof the ordinary fibrinous filaments of blood-clot.
  The   appearance described above of a reticulum of structureless or
jointed filaments with knob-like projections arising at short intervals
along their course and at their free extremities is precisely the same
appearance    as   Dr. E. Klein found within the vesicles and pustules,    as
well as in the lymphatics, lymphatic spaces, and veins in the skin of
sheep infected with variola (Transactions of the Eoyal Society, vol. clxv.
pt. 1, p. 233 et seq."). The figures 11, 17, 18, and 19 of Dr. Klein's paper
represent appearances      that cannot     be distinguishedin any point from
the  particular coagulation-appearances       that were found in the ducts of
the mamma above described.        The figs. 10 and 16, showing the more
attenuated filaments with the knob-like projections at wider intervals,
correspond to the coagulation-forms that were found chiefly in the colloid
tumours.    There can also be no doubt that the granular masses repre
sented in figs. 7, 8, 9, and 13 of Dr. Klein's paper are the same forms of
granular coagulation as those described in this note ; Dr. Klein has him
self noted the occurrence of the granular substance side by side with and
passing gradually into the filamentous (p. 241).     While there    is,
                                                                     on the
one hand, a remarkable resemblance as regards     form between  the various
appearances  figured by Dr. Klein and the various coagulation-appearances
herein described, there     on the other hand, an essential similarity in
                             is,
the circumstances under which they occurred in the respective cases.
In the case of the sheep-pox preparations, the appearances were found
either in vesicles that contained   coagulable fluid, or in lymphatics and
                                      a
interfascicular spaces that were distended by oedema, or in veins.      The
portions of  skin were immersed,  while still warm,  in the hardening fluid,
which was sometimes      aweak solution of chromic acid and sometimes
methylated spirit (p. 219).    Chromic-acid preparations alone seem to
have been used for studying that stage of the disease in which the vesicles
and pustules are completely        formed (pp. 219, 230).
   Now, although     Dr. Klein     considered that he had before him in these

144                             Mr.   J.   E. H. Gordon          on the                  [June 15,
preparations the various conditions of a fungus, to which he gave a
generic and a specific name, and although he professed to find the vari
ous conditions of spore, mycelium, and fructification occurring in their
natural sequence, and that natural sequence to correspond                                  with the
regular advance of the pathological process, there is no doubt that this
circumstantial account rests on erroneous observation and on defective
evidence, and that the appearances found in the skin of the sheep are
none other than those resulting from the coagulation of albuminoid                            fluids
under particular circumstances.

                                                                      a
examination    of the subject,  and  his first result (published 'Ann. de Chimie
et de Phys.'       serie,
                    3      tom,  xli.) was that, for any given magnet and
medium, " the ratio between the strength of the magnet and the amount
of rotation      constant"*.

   In order   that  the  measurements may be expressed in absolute units,                         it
is necessary to modify M. Verdet's mode of proceeding in several respects.
In particular, an electromagnet with an iron core               unsuitable for this

investigation, for both the amount and the distribution of the magnetic
force between the poles depend on the properties of the iron core, and
cannot be deduced from the strength of the current in the helix.             Fara
day's heavy glass and other media having the highest power of rotating
the plane of polarization were also unsuitable to be used as standard
media, on account of the difficulty of procuring specimens exactly alike.
The following method was therefore adopted —                     :

   The strength of the current in the helix was deduced from the deflec

bore to the tangent of the deflection of the suspended needle.

    The paper now offered to the Society forms the fifteenth and last of a
series of papers printed in the Philosophical              Transactions, entitled
" Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism." The whole fifteen numbers
are related to each other as
                                 " Contributions to the Magnetic Survey of
the Globe."     Four of them, viz. XI., XIII., XIV. and the present paper,
contain the complete statement of this survey in the double form of
"Catalogue" or "Tables" and of "Magnetic Maps;" of these maps
there are twelve, one for each of the three magnetic elements in each of
the four papers.     The present paper consists (as did its last predecessor,
No. XIV.) of four zones, each 10° in breadth : —
             Zone 1, comprehending       from the equator to 10° S.
             Zone 2,       „         „        lat. 10° S. „ 20° S.
             Zone 3,       „         „         lat. 20° S.    „ 30° S.
             Zone 4,       „         „        lat. 30° S.     „ 40° S.
    In  the Tables the observations     are entered in each zone in the suc
cession of their longitudes, beginning with the meridian of Greenwich.
 The statements in the introduction to No.         XIII.  regarding the different
magnetic elements apply to the present paper, as they did also to the
preceding paper, No. XIV.
    The question of correction      for secular change next presents itself.
 Happily   the greater part   of the   observations were made within, or very
 near to, the  " mean epoch," viz. 1840-1845.          Sea-observations were not
 generally  corrected  for differences   of epoch   in  the previous papers ; but
 in the present paper such corrections have been introduced for observa
 tions within the range of places (land stations) where the rate of secular
change has been sufficiently established.
    Nos. XI. & XIII., published earlier, comprise the northern and southern
portions of the globe from either pole to lat. 40°. These are the regions
which have long      been recognized as offering to the magnetician at once
the most arduous       and the most important field of research.            In the
middle or equatorial portions of the globe, comprised in the last and
present papers, the magnetic relations are simpler, and the laying down
of the lines representing them derives much aid from the adjacent por
tions of the north and south polar maps ; therefore, both as regards
observations and treatment, less abundant as well as less exact evidence,
it is hoped, may suffice.

      Fermentation, and of the conditions favouring Archebiosis in
      previously Boiled Fluids." — No. I. By H. CHARLTON BASTIAN,
      M.A., M.D., F.R.S., Professor of Pathological Anatomy in
      University College, London, and Physician to University
      College Hospital.        Received May 25, 1876.
                                     (Abstract.)
   The author first calls attention to the fact that no previous investi
gator has professed to have seen well-marked fermentation set up in
urine that had been boiled for a few minutes, if it has thereafter been
guarded from contamination.           The previous invariable barrenness of this
fluid after  boiling  has  been  ascribed    by germ-theorists to the fact that
any organisms or germs of organisms which it may have contained were
killed by raising it to the temperature of 212° F. (100° C.).
   In executing some of the experiments with urine described in this com
munication, two chemical agents have been brought into operation under
novel  conditions,   and an ordinary physical influence has been employed
to an entirely new extent.          In several respects, therefore, these new
experiments    differ   much, as   regards    the conditions made use of, from
those hitherto devised for throwing light upon the much-vexed questions
as to the possible origin of fermentations              independently  of living
organisms or germs, and as to the present occurrence or non-occurrence
of Archebiosis.
   The chemical agents employed under new conditions in these experi
ments were liquor potassce and oxyyen — both of them being well known
as stimulants, if not as promoters, of many fermentative processes.
   It has been recognized by several investigators of late years that
neutral or slightly alkaline organic fluids are rather more prone to undergo
fermentation than slightly acid fluids.         This fact may be easily demon
strated.    As the author pointed out in 1870, if two portions of an acid
infusion are exposed side by side at a temperature of 77° F. (25° C.)
fermentation may be made to appear earlier and to make more rapid
progress in either of them by the simple addition of a few drops of
liquor potassae ; on the other hand, if a neutral infusion be taken and
similarly divided into two portions placed under the same conditions,
fermentation may be retarded or rendered slower in either of them at
will by the simple addition to it of a few drops of acetic or some other
acid.
   A neutral or faintly      alkaline organic solution can in this way be
demonstrated     to possess a higher degree of fermentability than an other
wise similar acid organic solution.        It seems, therefore, obvious that the
changes capable      of taking place     in   boiled acid and neutral solutions
respectively  should    also vary considerably.       Numerous experiments     by

   150                       Dr. H. C. Bastian on the                [June 15,
   different observers have demonstrated the correctness of this inference.
   Boiled acid infusions guarded from contamination mostly remain pure
  and barren if kept at temperatures below 77° F. (25° C.), though other
  infusions similarly treated and similar in themselves, except that they
  have been rendered neutral by an alkali, \rill oftentimes become corrupt
  and swarm with organisms.          The latter result follows still more fre
  quently with neutral infusions when they are exposed to a higher
  generating temperature in the warm-air chamber ; and under this
  stronger stimulus a small number of boiled acid fluids will also ferment.
      On the other hand, the influence of oxygen in promoting fermentation
  has been fully appreciated since the early part of the present century.
  Formerly an influence was assigned to it as an initiator of fermentation
  as all-important as some chemists assign to living germs at the present
  day.    But this was a very exaggerated view. In some fluids, as the
  author has shown, fermentation may be initiated just as freely, or even
  rather more so, in closed vessels from which the air has been expelled
  by boiling, as in others in which atmospheric air, and consequently oxy
 gen, is present.      The explanation of this fact is probably to be found in
 the supposition that, in starting the fermentation of these fluids, diminu
 tion of pressure may be of as much, or even of more, importance than
 contact with free oxygen.        In respect to other organic fluids, however,
 the influence of oxygen seems decidedly more potent as a co-initiater of
 fermentation than that diminution of pressure which is brought about
  by hermetically sealing the vessel before the fluid within has ceased to
  boil.   Urine will be found to be an example of this latter class of fluids.
     The physical influence which has been employed in unusual intensity
 in the present researches is heat.
     Previous experimenters have never designedly had recourse to a gene
 rating or developing temperature above 100° F. (38° C.). The heat em
 ployed has frequently been below 77° F. (25° C.), though a temperature
 between this and 95° F. (85° C.) has been regarded both by chemists and
 biologists as most favourable to the occurrence and progress of fermenta
tive changes generally.
     Early in the month of August 1875 the author ascertained the fact
that some boiled fluids      which remained    barren when kept at a tempe
rature     of  77°-86°   F. (25°-30° C.) would rapidly become turbid and
 swarm with organisms if maintained at a temperature of 115° F.
(46° C.). More recently he has discovered the surprising fact that a
generating temperature as high as 122° F. (50° C.) may be had recourse
to with advantage in dealing with some fermentable solutions.           Fluids
which would otherwise have remained barren and free from all signs of
fermentation     have under the influence    of this high temperature rapidly
become      turbid and corrupt.    This discovery is regarded as of great im
portance in reference to the questions now under discussion, and it is
one which was quite unexpected.         The author had previously shared in

the generally received opinion that temperatures above 100°           F.   (38° C.)
were likely to impede rather than promote fermentation.
  In maintaining   the experimental fluids at the high temperature above
named,  the vessels  containing them were placed in the hot-air chamber
of an incubator such as physiologists employ, to which one of the very
ingenious gas-regulators of Mr. F.       J.
                                      Page had been fitted (see Journal of
the Chemical Society, January, 1876).   In this way the fluids may be kept
at a known and practically constant temperature for an indefinite time.
       Liquor   Potassce as a promoter   of Fermentation in Boiled Urine.
  In  the autumn of 1875 the author instituted some experiments to
ascertain whether the fermentability of boiled urine, like that of many
other fluids, could be increased       by previously mixing with it a quantity
of liquor potassae  sufficient   for its neutralization.
   The experiments answered this question in the affirmative.          It was
found that  urine  to which    the above-named amount of liquor potassae had
been added   would constantly ferment and swarm with organisms within
a few days after it had been boiled, though some of the same stock of
urine in the acid state (that is, without the addition of any alkali) would
when similarly treated in other respects remain barren.          The fact of the
production   of  an  increased   fermentability   in  boiled urine  by previous
neutralization was thus established.
   Further experiments were then instituted to throw light upon the
cause of such increased fermentability.         It was desirable to ascertain
whether (1) it was due to survival of germs in the boiled neutralized
fluid, or (2) to the chemical influence of potash in initiating or helping
to initiate the molecular      changes leading to fermentation in a fluid
devoid of germs or other living matter.
   The mode of testing the relative validity of these rival interpretations
seemed easy.     It was only necessary to ascertain what the effect would
be of adding  boiled  liquor potassae, in proper quantity, after the acid urine
had been rendered barren by boiling           it,
                                             instead of adding   it   previous to
the process   of  ebullition.   If  fermentation    occurred  in  the  fluid thus
neutralized without extraneous contamination, the first interpretation
would obviously be negatived.
   This crucial experiment was at first tried with flasks plugged with
cotton-wool, the plug in each of them being penetrated         by  a closed glass
tube containing the measured amount of liquor potassae.                The tubes
having been drawn out to     a   capillary portion at the loner end, and bent
at an obtuse angle, they could be easily broken by        slight downward pres
sure against the bottom   of the flask whenever    was desired to mix the
                                                     it
liquor potassae with  the  boiled urine.  This apparatus was very similar
to that first made use of by Dr. William Eoberts in some experiments
with hay-infusion (Phil. Trans. vol. clxiv. p. 474), in which he obtained
 opposite results from those now about to be recorded with urine.     The

  152                         Dr. H. C. Bastian on the                        [June    15,
 latter fluid, however, is for several reasons more suitable than hay-
 infusion for trying such experiments.
     Several trials made with urine in this apparatus showed that its fer-
 mentability was just as much increased by adding boiled liquor potassae
 after the urine had been boiled in the acid state, as by adding the alkali
 previous to the process of ebullition. Such a result was therefore quite
 opposed to the first interpretation as to the cause of the increased
 fermentability of neutralized urine.
    The definite overthrow or establishment of this interpretation was so
 important that it seemed desirable to try such experiments again by some
 more rigid and certain method.             The author, therefore, devised a new
 mode of experimentation          in which sealed retorts replaced the flasks
 plugged    with    cotton-wool,   and in which the contents of the enclosed
liquor-potassae tubes could be more effectually heated.
    It was first of all ascertained that accurately neutralized             urine boiled
in a retort and sealed whilst boiling would ferment in a day or two if
                                          *
 kept at a temperature of 122° F.
    This fact having been established, other retorts were charged with a
measured amount of urine, and also with a small glass tube containing
liquor potassae in quantity almost sufficient to neutralize the urine
employed t. The glass tubes containing the liquor potassae had been
drawn out at one end, sealed and then immersed in boiling water for
different periods before introducing them into the retorts.                  After each
retort had     been charged with urine and a liquor-potassae tube, its neck
was drawn out to a capillary point, the urine was boiled, and the retort
was hermetically sealed before ebullition had ceased.                Thus closed, the
   * Though the boiled urine will ferment in retorts from which the air has been
expelled by boiling, it will undergo this change more quickly if it is in the presence of
purified or sterilized air. In the experiments now about to be described, however, it
was much more convenient to use airless retorts.
   t As a slight excess in the amount of liquor potassae has been proved to have a most
restrictive influence when dealing with urine, it was found safer in these experiments
not to provide liquor potnssce sufficient for full neutralization.  Many details on thi«
subject are given in the memoir itself.

  vessel  was at once immersed with its neck downwards in a can of boiling
  water for from four to fifteen minutes, so as to expose it and its con
  tents for an additional period to a temperature of 212° F. (100° C.).
     The urine was thus boiled in its unaltered acid state and sterilized.
  After the retorts had cooled the liquor potassae was liberated from its
  tube in all but one of the batch, which was kept as a control experiment.
 The liberation was easily effected.       It was only necessarv to give the
 retort a sudden shake so as to drive the capillary neck of the enclosed
 tube against its side.    The tube was thus broken and immediately (owing
 to the comparative vacuum within the retort) the liquor potassre was
 sucked out and mixed with the fluid which it was destined to neutralize.
     The result of these experiments was similar to those executed with the
 plugged flasks and liquor-potassae tubes.         The boiled caustic potash
 added afterwards    within the  sealed retorts  caused the previously barren
 fluids to ferment and swarm with Bacteria.          The fluid in the control
 experiment remained pure, though after several days, or longer, it also
 could be made to ferment by breaking the liquor-potassoe tube and
 replacing the retort in the warm chamber.

                                                                            —
 A few other experiments were made with retorts to which platinum
electrodes had been fitted. These contained, as before, measured amounts
 of urine, together with liquor-potassae tubes.     All the preliminary stages
 were similar to   those  of the experiments  above recorded ; but just before
breaking the liquor-potassae tubes in these further experiments, oxygen
and hvdrogen were liberated from the boiled urine by electrolysis.
    The result in the few experiments made was very remarkable. Under
the combined influence of liquor potassce, oxygen, and the high tempe
rature of 1 22° F . (50° C.), the sterilized urine fermented and swarmed
with Bacteria within the closed retorts in from 7-12 hours — that is, in a
much shorter time than would sufllce for the occurrence of similar changes
in unboiled urine freely exposed to the air.
Behaviour of some specimens of unaltered Acid Urine under the influence     of
             the Hvjh Generating Temperature of 122° F. (50° C.).
    In the  course of the previous experiments it was found that occasion
ally a specimen of boiled urine would ferment at a temperature of 122° F.
without the addition of liquor potassae.      This was afterwards ascertained
to occur invariably (with the urine experimented upon) when the acidity
of the fluid was not higher than would be represented by six minims of
liquor potassae to the ounce (or about 1 £ per cent.). Urines slightly moro
acid  than this sometimes did and sometimes did not ferment without liquor
potassae ; but when the acidity exceeded what would be equivalent to
two per cent, of liquor potassce, the fluid did not ferment under the
influence of the high generating temperature alone.             Urines of all
degrees of acidity, however, were found to ferment under the combined

influence    of heat and liquor           potassae   added afterwards,          in the manner
already detailed *.
   It was further ascertained that the acidity of some specimens of urine
was lessened during the process of ebullition (owing to the deposition of
acid phosphates) ; and such urines boiled for six minutes were found to
ferment in a much shorter time than when they were only boiled for
three minutes.   The prolongation to this extent of the germ-destroying
temperature actually hastened the subsequent process of fermentation.
                                  Interpretation     of Results.
    The generally received belief that all Bacteria and their germs are
killed by exposing them even for a minute or two to the temperature of
212° F. (100° C.) has of late been strongly reinforced by Professor
Tyndall. The fact, therefore, of the fermentation of some specimens of
boiled acid urine, with the appearance of swarms of Bacteria, under the
influence of the high generating temperature of 122° F. (50° C.), is
inexplicable except upon the supposition that fermentation has in these
 instances been initiated without the aid of living germs, and that the
 organisms first appearing in such fluids have been evolved therein.
    If the author's further position (Proceedings of Eoyal Society, Nos.
143 and 145, 1873), that Bacteria and their germs are killed in fluids
whether acid or alkaline at a temperature of 158° F. (70° C.), is correct,
then the occurrence of fermentation in the previously neutralized boiled
urine would similarly disprove the exclusive germ-theory of fermentation
and establish the occurrence of Archebiosis.
   Any difficulty which might have been felt by others in accepting the
above interpretation of the results of these latter experiments — in face of
the view held by M. Pasteur that some Bacteria-germs are able in
neutral fluids to survive an exposure to a heat of 212° F. (100° C.) — has
been fairly met and nullified by the experiments (devised for the pur
pose) in which the urine was boiled in the acid state and subsequently
fertilized by the addition of boiled liquor polassae.
  If  we look at these latter experiments from an independent point of
view, it will be found that this fertilization of a previously barren fluid
by boiled liquor potassae must be explained by one or other of three
hypotheses : —
   1st Hypothesis. The boiled liquor potassce may act as a fertilizing agent
because  it contains living germs. — However improbable this hypothesis
                                                                                    by

the experiments       recorded in this memoir.               These experiments show that
boiled liquor potassae will only act as            a    fertilizing agent when    added
                                                                                    it   is
in certain proportions. If      acted as
                                     it              a   mere germ-containing        medium, a

neutralization.

 single drop of it would suffice to infect many ounces, a gallon, or more
 of the sterilized fluid. This, however, is nnver the case ; it only
fertilizes the barren urine when it is added in n proportion dependent
upon the precise       acidity and quantity of the fluid with which experiment
is being made.
    '2nd   Hypothesis.     The fertilizing agent may act by reviving germs hitherto
presumed to      have been      killed in the boiled acid urine. — The acceptance of
this   hypothesis     would involve a general recantation of the previously
received conclusion         that Bacteria and their germs are killed by boiling
them     in acid fluids.      But such a recantation would        be scarcely justif1able
or acceptable unless based upon good independent evidence.
    The possibility, however, of accepting this second hypothesis                 is still
 further closed by the results of experiments in which a slight excess
 of liquor potassac was added to the boiled urine.              Such fluids invariably
remained barren.          Yet it can be easily shown that the mere develop
 ment and       growth of Bacteria-germs may take place both quickly and
 freely in boiled urine containing a very large excess of liquor potassae *.
It would seem that this agent mixed with boiled urine in quantity
slightly more than is needed for neutralization, prevents the origination
of living matter therein, although even when in considerable excess the
 same agent affords no obstacle to the development, growth, and multi
plication of germs purposely added thereto.
    In the face of these facts it would seem impossible to accept this
second hypothesis, even if it had not been independently negatived by
the great mass of evidence (lately reinforced by the experiments of
Professor Tyndall) to the effect that Bacteria and their germs are really
killed in fluids raised for a few minutes to the boiling-point (212° F.).
    3rd Hypothesis.        The fertilizing agent acts by helping to initiate chemical
<7w«/7«    of a fermentative character        in a fluid devoid of living organisms or
liring germs. —     If the cause of the fermentation of the fluids in question
does not exist       in   the form of living organisms or germs either in the
fertilizing agent itself or in the medium fertilized, then it must be found
in some chemical reactions set up between the boiled liquor potassae and
the boiled    urine.
    The experiments in which liquor potassse is added to urine in definite
proportions before and after it has been boiled with the result of inducing
fermentation in the otherwise barren fluids, as well as those in which
unaltered urine ferments             under the influence of the high generating
temperature       of 122° F. (50° C.), all alike, therefore, point to the same
conclusion.       They show, as other experiments have done, that an exclusive
germ-theory of fermentation is untenable ; and they further show that

XV. " On      the Variations of the Daily Range of Atmospheric Tem
       perature as recorded at the Kew Observatory." By BAXFOUR
       STEWART, LL.D., F.R.S., Professor of Natural Philosophy at
       Owens College, Manchester.          Received May 25, 1876.
                                   (Abstract.)
   The daily temperature-range was selected as an element which affords
a good indication of the varying meteorological activity of the place, and
the observations of which can be easily made and reduced.
   The records of the Kew Observatory were chosen because there the at
mospheric temperature has been very carefully observed during a long
series of years.     The writer desires to thank the Kew Committee for
giving him access to the records of the maximum and minimum tempera
tures taken at the   Kew Observatory.
   Twenty-one years of these records have been reduced, beginning with
the year 1855 and ending with 1875.          Two complete sun-spot periods
are embraced in these observations.
   The first Table exhibits (a point already well known) the annual variation
of the temperature-range, which is greatest in summer and least in winter.
   The same Table shows that the yearly means of this element exhibit con
siderable fluctuations amongst themselves.      Thus we have corresponding
to the years 1856, 1866, and 1875 the values 12°-69, 13°-61, and 13°-25
respectively, while corresponding to the years 1859 and 1870 we have the
values 14°-52 and 15°-63.
   Inasmuch as the three former are years of minimum, and the two latter
years of maximum sun-spots, this would seem to show that the daily tem
perature-range   is least for minimum and greatest for maximum sun-spot
years.

   But, on the other hand, and against this evidence, there is a temperature-
fluctuation bet-ween 1859 and 1866 as great, or nearly as great, as any
which apparently corresponds to sun-spot period.         This temperature-
oscillatinn     may perhaps be identified with a subsidiary sun-spot fluctuation
as      exhibited in the curves of Messrs. DeLa Rue, Stewart, and Loewy, but
it is out         of proportion to it in relative magnitude.
        If   we   still regard it as most likely, though not proven, both from the
evidence of the paper and from collateral considerations, that there is some
connexion between the daily temperature-range and the state of the sun
with regard to spots, then we may perhaps suppose that this redundant
temperature-oscillation is a local phenomenon. There is, however, another
possible explanation which will be afterwards alluded to.
     It      is then endeavoured to ascertain whether the temperature-range                                           has
any reference to the relative position  of the sun and moon.       For this
purpose   the whole  period of 21 years has been portioned out into luna
tions, each lunation being divided into 8 parts : — (0), (1), (2), (3), (4),
(5), (6), (7) — (0) corresponding to new and (4) to full moon.
   From the whole series of lunations the following result is obtained : —
         Phase        of lunation      (0)       (1)      (2)         (3)         (4)       (5)       (6)       (7)

which presents the appearanceof a curve of double period superposed
upon one of single period. The range, however, is not great.
 If we now make use of the lunations corresponding to the six winter
months (October to March), we obtain : —
         Phase of lunation             (0)       (1)      (2)         (3)         (4)       (5)       (6)       (7)

     Treating           in   the same way the lunations for the six summer months, we
obtain        :   —

     It      is then noticed how large and persistent                            the winter lunar variation
is,     and how the series               of observations may                be   split into two parts, each of
which represents                it.      Thus we obtain —        :

 similar to that obtained by Mr. J. A. Broun in the case of terrestrial
magnetism), it is argued that even if there be a connexion between mean

 both periods to march together in the same way, inasmuch as the first is
 due entirely to the sun, while the latter appears to depend upon the
 moon as well.

                                        (Abstract.)
     Pursuing the study of leaf-arrangement, the author finds that the
  crowberry of our moors (Empetnim nigrum) habitually exhibits a peculiar
  mo le of variation in the arrangement of the leaves on different parts of
  the same twig. Out of fifty crowberry-twigs taken at random, only four
  (and these fragments) preserved the same arrangement throughout.                      In
  the remaining forty-six the leaf-arrangement was found to undergo a pro
  gressive change in ascending from the base of the twig to the summit —
  a change     from  a simpler order to others more complex.             In  general the
  basal order was that denoted by the fraction £ ;          and this was found to pass
  most frequently into ^, which in turn was found               to pass into    J, with or
  without an intermediate         set of whorls of 4 : $ generally passed into
  whorls of 5, sometimes into -^y, which was the most complex arrange
  ment that was met with in this plant. The following is a list of the
  transitions found in the fifty specimens : —

     In all these instances the striking peculiarity to                       be observed is that
the arrangement     passes from an order belonging to one phyllotactic
series (e.g.  from the order $ in the primary series |, ^, §, &c.) to an

   In order to examine the mode in which the above transitions were
effected, the author constructed an instrument (described below) by
means of which he obtained diagrams, pricked on paper, of the leaf-
arrangement of the fifty specimens.     On comparison of these diagrams                         it
was found that, in every case where the details could be traced,      gradual             a
dislocation (so to speak) took place between two adjacent spirals belong
ing to one of the two sets of spirals with least angular divergence, whereby
the other set became deranged and gave rise to new sets having different
numbers.     Thus the transition from the arrangement        (in which the       £
spirals of least angular divergence are     in one direction and2     in the              3
other)  to the arrangement   (in which those
                                           ?- spirals are  in  one direction   3

                                     an apparent slip between two of the
3    spirals, whereby the          2      spirals    became     deranged and helped to form      a
new       of
        set     spirals, which with the old persistent set of

spirals of least angular divergence in the new arrangement               while           £,      a
new primary spiral arose, turning in an opposite direction to the old.

                 is                                In all these transitions the
change of order      brought about not by any agency affecting all parts of
                        is
the system uniformly all round the axis, but by a disturbance of the
relative position of leaves along one special spiral tract.
   The variations described by the Eev. G. Henslow (Trans. Linn. Soc.
vol. xxvi. p. 647) as occurring in the leaf -arrangement of Hellanthus
tufxrosus appear to be similar in character to those of Empetrum nigrum
bat much more limited in range.        The author has met with         few other      a
instances of the same kind in other plants.

turning in the opposite direction, which, again,           replaced by another

 (Proceedings of the Royal Society, 1874, vol. xxii. p. 298, &c), and in a

    Having there drawn attention      to two ways in which modification of
 leaf -arrangement appears mainly to have been brought about — namely,
(1) direct variation of number of vertical leaf-ranks, producing the funda
mental orders of different phyllotactic    series, and (2) subsequent variation
of degree of uniform   condensation,  effecting transition between different
                            —
orders of the same series he now shows (3), from examination of the
crowberry, that transition between different orders of different series is
brought about apparent ly by means of unequal condensation resulting in
spiral dislocation between adjacent secondary ranks.
    The instrument ( " taxigrapli ") used in this research consists of a
twig-holder which rotates in fixed bearings, the twig being held in the
axis of rotation under a framed lens which slides on fixed guides parallel
to the twig. Thus the angular position of any leaf is observed by aid of the
rotation of the twig-holder, and the vertical position by aid of the sliding
motion of the lens.    The sliding motion of the lens is conveyed by cords
and pulleys to a light frame carrying a strip of paper beneath the plat
form, which is the base of the instrument ; and the rotary motion of the
twig-holder is made, by aid of cords and pulleys, to draw a sliding pin-
holder to and fro along a slit in the platform at right angles to the
direction of motion of the strip of paper below.      The pin, in any position
of the slider along the slit, is made to pierce the strip of paper on press
ing a lever. Every leaf on the twig is thus observed, and a correspond
ing pin-prick made in the paper. The longitudinal position of any pin
prick shows the vertical position of the leaf, and the lateral position of
the pin-prick shows the angular position of the leaf. The whole figure
represents the leaf-arrangement      of the twig in radial projection, and ia
bounded laterally by two vertical lines corresponding to one and the same
vertical line on the twig.    By enlargement of the lateral dimension the
arrangement is shown relatively foreshortened.
    The author suggests modifications of this instrument     by which it could
be adapted to other forms     of stem or twig; e.g. by causing the paper to
 rotate under the sliding pin-holder, and by giving the lens a quadrantal
 motion, it would be adapted to flat or conical systems such as the heads
of Coinposita".

XVII. " Preliminary          Note on the Use of the Piezometer in Deep-
        Sea Sounding."       By J. Y. BUCHANAN, Chemist to the ' Chal
       lenger' Expedition. Communicated by Professor WILLIAMSON,
       Foreign Secretary R.S. Received June 14, 1876.
    In order to determine the depth of the sea independently of the length
of sounding-line used, piezometers filled with distilled water were fre
quently attached to the line along with the deep-sea thermometers.        The
combined effects of change of temperature and change of pressure were
registered by a steel index of ordinary 1'orm.       The temperature of the
bottom-water being given by the deep-sea thermometer, the effect of
temperature on the apparent volume of water in the piezometer could
easily be calculated ; and from the residual effect, the pressure, and
therefore the height, of the column of water to which the instrument
had been subjected could be deduced.
    The piezometer did not differ materially from     the ordinary ones used
for the determination of the compressibility of liquids. A minute descrip
tion of the fittings necessary for their safe use on the sounding-line
cannot be given without reference to a drawing or model, and must there
fore be postponed.
    It is manifest that if the apparent compressibility of water is accu
rately known, we shall be in a position to determine, by means of our
instrument and a deep-sea thermometer, the depth to which it has been
sunk, independently of the lengths of sounding-line used; for the indica
tions of the instrument depend solely on the temperature of the water at
the depth in question, and on its vertical distance from the surface.
    The determination of the effect of change of temperature on such an
instrument does not demand explanation. It is, however, otherwise with
the effects of pressure.    In submitting an instrument of the kind to high
pressures   in  an  hydraulic machine, we encounter difficulty in accurately
determining the pressure to which it is exposed, and also, although in a
minor degree, in making our observations at the low temperature usually
obtaining in deep ocean waters.       I have therefore taken as basis for the
determination of the apparent compressibility of water the results ob
tained when the instrument has been sent down on the sounding-line,
either to the bottom or to intermediate depths, in positions where there
 has been no apparent disturbance from currents, and where the amounts
 of compression produced have been proportional to the depths recorded
by the sounding-lines. Where currents are absent, and their presence is
at once detected by the behaviour of the sounding-line, the depth, as
 determined according to the method of sounding adopted on board the
 '
   Challenger,'  gives an excellent measure of the pressure exercised on the
 instruments.     As the variations in the temperature, the salinity, and the
 compressibility of sea-water with the depth have been thoroughly inves

tigated for the soundings in question, the weight of a column of sea-
water in any of these localities can be calculated with great accuracy.
    The observations which have been taken as a basis for determinations
of depth were made in the latter part of the year 1875 in the South-
Pacific Ocean. They were twenty in number, and were made at depths
varying from 500 to 2300 fathoms, and at temperatures varying from 1°'4
to 4°'03 C. The mean compressibility of water determined from these
observations was 0-0008986 por 100 fathoms of sea-water, the extreme
values being Q'000915 and 0-0008S2.             Observations made at greater
depths in the North Pacific gave as a mean of six observations at depths
varying from 2740 to 3125 fathoms the value 0'000878, indicating a
slight diminution in the coefficient       of compression at very high pres
sures.
   The effect of pressure      being thus known, we are in a position, by
comparing    the indications  of the instrument with those of a trustworthy
deep-sea thermometer, to determine the absolute depth to which it has
been sunk beneath the surface      ;  and assuming the depth as indicated by
the sounding-line to be correct, we should be able to determine the tem
perature at the depth in question from the indications of our instrument,
and without the use of a thermometer.         For the latter purpose, however,
the instrument,    as above described, is useless, because    the dilatability of
water at the low temperatures obtaining in deep water is so small as to
be negligible compared with its elasticity.
    The application, however, of the principle above indicated would mani
festly present   some very great advantages      in the determination   of deep-
sea temperatures.
    In the open ocean, where, as a rule, the temperature diminishes con
stantly as the depth increases, the Millar-Casella thermometer gives
sufficiently accurate results.       In the case of enclosed seas, or in the
neighbourhood of ice, however, this is not always the case.        In the Med1
terranean, the Eed Sea, and many of the seas of the Eastern archipelago,
besides, possibly, large tracts both of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the
temperature decreases regularly down to a certain depth, which is different
for different seas ; and at all greater depths the Millar-Casella thermo
meter gives identical readings, indicating that the water is either at the
same temperature or some higher one. In the neighbourhood of ice, layers
of water are frequently met with at various depths whose temperature,
being higher than that of the surface, is indicated by the maximum index of
the Millar-Casella thermometer.         Besides these layers there may be, and
there probably are, others whose temperature is higher than that of the
water immediately above them without reaching that of the surface, and
their temperature would remain unrecorded.            It would therefore be of
great advantage if the piezometer       could be  adapted for the determination
of temperatures at known depths. An efficient instrument for this pur
pose has been obtained by filling the bulb of the piezometer with mercury

1876.]               the Piezometer in Deep-Sea Sounding.                       163
instead of water.         The portion of the ste1n iu which the index movea is
filled with water, and, as in the other, the open end dips into a cup of
 mercury.      'We have thus an instrument filled with a very large quantity
of mercury and a very small quantity of water ; and after immersion the
position of the index shows the apparent volume assumed by this mix
ture under the combined influence of temperature and pressure. As far
 as the effects of temperature are concerned, the amount of water in the
 instrument is almost wholly negligible ; but when the effect of pressure is
 considered, the apparent compressibility of mercury is so small, being
 little more than one fiftieth of that of water, that the pressure of even so
 small a quantity of water as can be contained in the graduated tube in
 creases very materially the amount of contraction produced by pressure.
 The instrument, which has been in use since the beginning of November
 last year, and which is designated XVII. a, contains 256-61 grammes of
 mercury in the bulb and stem immediately above it; the volume of the
 part of the stem filled with water is O1935 c. c. The apparent contrac
 tion of this mass of mercury and water is 0-000581 cubic centimetres per
  100 fathoms, and 0-0025 c. c. per degree respectively.          A fall therefore
 of one degree in temperature produces the same effect as an increase of
 pressure equal to 430 fathoms of sea-water.             Hence (and this forms the
 important peculiarity of the instrument) as long as the temperature of
 the sea does not increase with the depth at a greater rate than 1° C. per
 430 fathoms, the instrument will record the temperature correctly.             The
  ratio subsisting between the amount of temperature and the column of
  water, which produce the same effect on the .apparent volume, is a con
 stant for every instrument ; in our one it is T^s. By altering only very
  slightly the amount of water, the sensibility to pressure is greatly in
 creased or diminished, while that to temperature remains practically
  unchanged.       As the instrument XVII. a was intended principally for
 bottom-waters, the above ratio (3-3-57) was considered sufficient, and it has
 proved practically useful.         It must be remembered that the greater the
  value of this ratio is made, the greater is the error introduced into the
 determination      of the temperature by any inaccuracy in the measurement
  of the depth.
     By attaching a combination of one, or better of two, of each of these
  instruments close to the weight at the end of the sounding-line, the
  depth of the sea and the temperature of the water at the bottom at any
  locality can be accurately determined, provided that sufficient evidence is
  afforded, either by the presence of a sample of bottom in the sounding-
  tube, or by thw rate at which the line runs out, that the instruments have
  been at the bottom         ; otherwise  the depth which they have attained and
  the temperature      at  that  depth  will be correctly given.  For this purpose
  it is necessary first to let the line run out until, from observations on its
  velocity, it  is evident that the weight has reached the bottom       ; the length

  of line which has so run out will give the depth approximately, but more
  or less in excess of the truth according to circumstances.    Allowing for
  the contraction which would be produced by this depth in the case of
  the mercury piezometer, a first approximation to the temperature of the
  bottom-water is at once obtained ; and it is sufficiently accurate for the
  purpose of correctly determining the contraction produced on the water
  piezometer by the change of temperature, and consequently for deducing
  the depth to which the instrument has been sunk.       By now applying the
 more correct depth to the reading of the mercury instrument, we obtain
 the correct temperature,     and if necessary the approximation     might be
 carried still closer.
     As an example of the use of the combined instruments, the observa
 tions made on the 29th February, 1870, may be taken.         The position of
 the sounding was lat. 36° 9' 8., long. 4S° 22' W., and the depth by line
 was 2800 fathoms.       The sea was quite calm, but there was a strong  cur
 rent setting to the south-east, rendering   it probable that the depth, as
 determined by line, was considerably in    excess  of the true depth.    The
 mercury instrument (XVII. a) registered 166-2 millims. In order to
 clear this reading for a depth of 2800 fathoms, we have to subtract 16
 millims., and we obtain 150-2 millims. as the corrected reading, from which
 we determine the temperature to be + 0°-2 C.       The reading of the water
 instrument was 283-8 millims.      Assuming the temperature to have been
 0o,2 C, this would indicate that the water had suffered an apparent con
traction, owing to pressure alone, of 0-1923 c. c, which would be pro
duced by a column of 24S0 fathoms of sea-water.         Assuming now 2480
fathoms to be the true depth, we find the corrected reading of the mer
cury instrument (XVII. a) to be 152-1 millims., which indicates a tem
perature of — 0°-5 C. The Millar-Casella thermometers gave the tempera
ture as — 0°-4.     Assuming this  as the correct   bottom temperature, and
reducing the reading of the water instrument      (C. No. 1) accordingly, we
find the contraction produced by pressure to be 0-1924     c.c, which agrees
sensibly with that found on the assumption       of the higher  bottom-tem
perature of + 0°-2 C.
    It will thus be seen that the two instruments fulfil the conditions re
quired of them; namely, that the one which is to indicate the temperature
of the water shall be independent of great accuracy in the determination
of the depth, and the one which is to indicate the depth shall be equally
independent of accurate determination of the temperature ; whilst by
combining the results obtained by the. two, an accurate determination is
obtained both of the depth and of the temperature of the water at that
depth.

                   D.C.L., F.R.S.              Received       June   14, 1876.
   In a former communication to the Royal Society* described the action  I
of zincethyl and zincmethyl upon boric ethylate, and showed that these
orgauo-metallic bodies displace the ethoxyl(Eto=CaH30) of the ethylate
by the     organic radical which they contain.                     Thus the action of zinc-
methyl upon boric ethylate is expressed by the following equation : —
             BEto3        +     3ZnMea           =     Bile,       +      3ZnMeEto.
          Boric ethylate.        Zincmethyl.        Boric methide.      Zincic methoethylate.
   It  was also shown that spontaneously inflammable boric ethide (BEt,),
when      cautiously exposed to a slow current, first of air and then of
oxygen, combines with two atoms of oxygen forming boric ethodiethylate
(BEtEto2) — a liquid boiling with partial decomposition between 95° and
125=    C,    but capable of being distilled without change in vacuo.                               By
contact with water, this compound was instantly transformed into boric
ethodihydrate, thus : —
                BEtEto,         +      OH2       =      BEtHo2        +       2EtHo.
           Boric ethodiethylate.       Water.      Boric ethodihydrate.        Alcohol.
   I   have recently resumed the investigation of these compounds, and
have obtained results of which the following is a preliminary description.
                                           Boric Ethide.
   Instead of using boric ethylate and zincethyl for the preparation of
this compound, it may be obtained by passing a current of the vapour of
boric chloride through zincethyl.                   The reaction appears to take place
according to the following equation : —
                 BC13       +      3ZnEt„        =      BEt3       +     3ZnEtCl.
            Boric chloride.        Zincethyl.        Boric ethide.    Zincic t-thochlonde.
                                     Diboric Ethopentethylate.
   When equal molecules of boric ethylate and zincethyl are digested at
about 100° C. for four or five hours, and then submitted to distillation,
there is obtained a liquid distillate, which yields, on rectification, a con
siderable fraction boiling at 110° to 113° C, whilst zincic ethoethylate is
left in the retort. On analysis this liquid was found to consist of equal
molecules of boric ethylate and boric ethodiethylate.                               The following
equation explains the reaction              : —
        2BEto,        +      ZnEt2        =     BEtEto,, BEto,             +      ZnEtEto.
     Boric ethylate.        Zincethyl.         Diboric ethopentethylate.       Zincic ethoethylate.
   The new compound                 is a colourless       mobile liquid         boiling at about
112°   C,   and condensing again unchanged.                     It possesses a slight ethereal
odour and a sweetish taste.               The specific gravity of its vapour, taken at
 114° and 120° C, is 69 (H=l), which agrees exactly with the calculated
                                  * Phil. Trans, vol. clii. p. 107.

 density, on the assumption that, in passing from the liquid to the gaseous
 condition, the compound is broken up into its two constituent molecules —
 boric ethodiethylate and boric ethylate.                 On volatilisation, therefore, it
 behaves    exactly like ammonia boric methide (NHa, BMe,) described in
 my former paper ; and this deportment suggests the possibility of a
 pentadic condition of the boron atom corresponding to that of nitrogen,

   Brought into contact with water, diboric ethopentethylate                        is instantly
 decomposed, forming boric acid and boric ethodihydrate : —

Diboric ethopentethylate.        Water.      Boric ethodihydrate.     Boric acid.           Alcohol.
   If  the quantity of water used for this decomposition be small, the boric
acid separates, almost completely, in minute crystals, whilst the boric
ethodihydrate remains in solution, and may be obtained in the crystalline
form by simple evaporation over sulphuric acid in                   vacuo.
                                    Boric Dieihethylate.
   Intermediate          between   boric ethide and boric ethodiethylate, theory
indicates the existence of a compound containing an atom of boron com

                                           BEtaEto.
   I  find that this body is produced in large quantity when boiling boric
ethylate is digested for several hours with twice as much zincethyl as
that which was employed to form diboric ethopentethylate : —
           BEto,          +   2ZnEt2        =    BEt2Eto          +      2ZnEtEto.

   After rectification in an atmosphere of carbonic anhydride, the product
boiled at 102° to 104° C. : but analysis showed that it persistently retained
a small    quantity of boric ethylate, or diboric ethopentethylate, from
which it could not be freed by repeated rectification.                       When, however,

 ethyl, there was obtained, by distillation in an atmosphere of carbonic
 anhydride, a liquid product, which, on rectification, yielded a considerable
 fraction boiling between 102° and 103° C. This fraction gave, on analysis,
numbers for carbon, hydrogen, and boron closely corresponding to those
required by the above formula.                  Boric diethethylate is produced from
diboric ethopentethylate by the following reaction : —
     BEtEto2, BEto3            +     3ZnEt2          =     2BEt2Eto           +    3ZnEtEto.
    Boric ethopentethylate.          Zincethyl.         Boric diethethylate.      Zincio ethcthylate.
    Boric diethethylate is a colourless, transparent, mobile, and neutral
liquid, of ethereal odour and pungent taste.                        It boils at 102° C, and
distils unchanged.           Its vapour-density, taken at 135°-5 C, is 56-5, the
theoretical specific gravity for a two-volume vapour of the above formula
being 57 (11 = 1). In air, boric diethethylate is spontaneously inflam
mable,    burning with a green and slightly luminous flame.                         Exposed to a
slow current, first of dry air and then of oxygen, it is converted into
boric ethodiethylate        : —
                           BEt2Eto         +     O      =     BEtEto2.

                                    Boric Diethohydrate.
    When boric diethethylate is shaken up with water and then allowed to
stand, a spontaneously inflammable ethereal liquid, similar in appearance
to boric ethide, rises to the surface of the water.                         This liquid cannot
be distilled without decomposition ; ftut on being submitted to analysis,
after drying over calcic chloride, it gave numbers for carbon, hydrogen,
and boron closely approximating to those required by the formula
                                             BEt2Ho.
    Boric diethohydrate has an ethereal odour and a pungent taste, very
unlike the intense sweetness of boric ethodihydrate.                           It is produced by
the substitution of one semimolecule of hydroxyl for one of ethoxyl,
according    to the following equation           : —
                BEt2Eto          +    OH2       =       BEt2Ho         +      EtHo.

                                 Boric Ethethylate-hydrate.
   Submitted       to  a slow current of dry air, boric diethohydrate                       absorbs
orrgen; and       if the vessel in which the reaction is conducted be kept cool,
colourless    crystals gradually make their appearance.                      These crystals are
soluble   in the diethohydrate; but when the oxidation of the latter is
completed, the entire liquid solidifies at a temperature slightly below
8" C, but immediately liquefies again when that temperature is                           exceeded.
Submitted to analysis, the new body gave numbers lor carbon, hydrogen,
and boron, closely agreeing with the formula

 This compound            is therefore     obviously    produced      by the following       re
 action    : —

                         Boric diethohydmte.           Bor1o ethethylate-hydrate.
    Boric ethethylate-hydrate is a transparent and mobile liquid at ordi
 nary temperatures, but below 8° C. it is a white crystalline solid, which
 has an odour like that of boric ethide and a strong pungent taste.                        It is
neutral to test-papers, and is rapidly decomposed by water, exchanging
 its semimolecule of ethoxyl for hydroxyl, and forming boric ethodi-
hydrate and alcohol           ; thus, —
                BEtEtoHo            +    OHa     =     BEtHo,         +     EtHo.
          Boric ethethylato-hydrate.    Water.    Boric cthodihjdraU.       Alcohol.
    Unlike boric diethethylate            and boric diethohydrate, this body is not
 spontaneously inflammable ; but, like the latter, it cannot be distilled at
the ordinary atmospheric pressure without undergoing decomposition.
    I  am now engaged in submitting the organo-boron compounds and
their derivatives to a thorough investigation, and hope shortly to have
the honour of laying before the Eoyal Society further details respecting
this family of organic compounds.

    In   this paper the author records the results of a series of observations
for the "Magnetic Dip" taken during the voyages of H.M.S. 'Iron Duke'
in the eastern         seas,    visiting China, Japan, and adjacent places, in the
years 1871-75.
    The dip-circle        employed was furnished with two needles, and the con
cluded       dip recorded is the mean result of the observations by both
needles.
    The observations           are sixty-six in number, taken at forty-two places,
opportunities having been frequently afforded of repeating them on suc
cessive visits to the same station.              In some instances the observations
were repeated after an interval of from twelve to fourteen years, at sta
tions formerly visited by the author on a previous visit to China and
Japan (1857-59), thus affording data for the deduction of the approxi
mate values of the secular change of this element.                       Moreover some of
the observations having been taken at off-lying stations to the eastward
of the coast-line of the Asiatic continent, data have been obtained for

determining to a certain extent the general direction of the isoclinal lines

    The observations are arranged in two tables — Table I. recording those
taken during the outward and homeward voyages to and from Singapore,
and Table II. containing those made in the eastern seas from Singapore
up to Nicolaevsk on the Eiver Amur. They are arranged in order of the
latitudes of the places visited ; but in all cases where the observations
have been subsequently repeated at the same station, all those taken at
the same place are noted in the Table in succession.
    Finally, the author has added a few remarks suggested by a comparison
 of these observations with those formerly taken by him during his pre
 vious visits to China and Japan, 1857-59.

    It was observed that when a plate of copper was lifted from a plate of
glass the copper was electrified, and also that when a plate of glass was
lifted from a plate of wax the glass was electrified, care being taken to
have as little friction as possible ; it was afterwards found that the former
                                                                         '
experiment had already been made by-Fechner (see Wiedemann's               Gal-
vanismus,' page 21), who also tried lifting copper from sulphur and got
the same effect ; although the plates were lifted as carefully as possible,
yet it was not certain that friction had been entirely got rid of, so the
following experiments were made to show that there is an electrical dis
placement when two non-conductors or a conductor and a non-conductor
are put in contact without friction.
    The arrangement used was as follows : —
    Glass rods, AB, CD, EF, GH, were fixed in a wooden frame ACGE ;
round these rods silk threads, BF, DH, were wound ; an aluminium needle
carrying a mirror, M, was hung by a silk thread from a brass rod, T,
fastened in the wooden frame ; a wire from the needle dipped into a glass
vessel,  N, containing sulphuric acid     ; a small magnet was fastened to the
hack of   the  mirror,  and  a glass case  was placed over the whole; outside
the glass case were magnets, by means of which the position of the
needle was regulated ; a wire also from the outside dipped into the
vessel   N, and was used to charge the needle with electricity       ; positive
electricity was got from an ordinary electrophorus, negative from an
electrophorus in which the resin was replaced by a plate of glass which
was excited by silk. If wax and glass were the substances experimented
on, a cake, OQRP, was made, one half of which, OSQ, was glass, the
other half, EPS, being wax ; the junction of the wax and glass was parallel

to OQ, the wax sticking fast to the glass : this cake was then placed on
the silk threads under the needle, and it was found possible to bring the
 needle into such a position that when it was charged with positive elec
 tricity it was deflected from the glass part of the cake, when charged with
negative it was attracted towards it. In order to get rid of any electricity
 which might have got on the cake in the making, the cake was made the
 day before it was placed on the threads, and the experiment was made at
least a day, sometimes a week, after putting the cake on the threads ;
 pieces of glass and sulphur which had been treated in as nearly as possible
the same way as those of which the cakes were made were taken and
 placed separately on the threads, but no electricity could be detected on
them.

seems to suggest that the electrical displacement which takes place when
two non-conductors are put in contact acts as a predisposing cause, in

  virtue of   which the work done by rubbing them together is converted into
  electrical   separation.
      The following experiment, suggested by Dr. Schuster, was also tried :
  the needle was taken out of a Thomson's quadrant electrometer and
  replaced    by a needle, half of which was sealing-wax   and the other half
 glass   ; the quadrants C and D were connected with the earth ; aud it was
 found possible, after the needle had stood undisturbed for ten days, to
 set the needle in such a position that when the quadrants A, B were
 charged     with negative and positive electricity respectively, the needle
 rotated    in the direction of the hands of a watch, and when A and B were
 charged     with positive and negative electricity   respectively,  the needle
 rotated in the opposite direction.
    When two non-conductors, A, B, are placed in contact, the electricity
will not be distributed through the whole of A and B ; and if the dis
placement is from B to A and parallel to the sides of the cake, the only
parts electrified will be the middle and ends of the cake ; the A end of the
cake    will be positively and the B end negatively electrified ; and if A has
a greater specific inductive capacity than B the middle will be negatively
electrified ; if it has a less specific inductive capacity than B it will be
positively electrified.
    I  intend to examine more substances, and to endeavour to make some
quantitative measurements.          The above experiments were made in the
Physical      Laboratory   of Owens  College, Manchester ; and    I have much
pleasure in thanking Dr. Stewart, Dr. Schuster, and Mr. Kingdon for
the assistance they have given me.

XXI.      "Physiological Action of the Bark of Erythrophleum guinense
        (Casca, Cassa, or Sassy Bark)." By T. Lauder Brunton, M.D.,
        F.R.S., and Walter Pye, M.R.C.S. Received June 15, 1876.
                                      (Abstract.)
    1. It diminishes oxidation, and thus prevents fresh vegetable tissues
from communicating a blue colour to tincture of guaiac.
    2. It does not hinder the development of the yeast-fungus           nor the
germination     of  seeds.
    Penicillium grows freely in a solution of it.
    3. A watery solution of the alcoholic extract prevents the develop
ment of Bacteria, but one of the watery extract does not do so.
    4. It does not destroy the life of Bacteria or Infusoria.       The motion
of cilia is not arrested by it.
    5.  It arrests  amoeboid movement in leucocytes.
    6.  It has no   action on fresh muscular fibre ; but muscular tissue, when
kept in a solution of the alcoholic extract for some days, undergoes
extensive fatty metamorphosis, but does not become putrid.
    It does not alter the sensibility of muscle to electrical stimuli, nor does
it diminish its lifting power.
    7.  It has little,  if any, poisonous action on the Invertebrate.
    8.  It  has  a   comparatively slight action on fishes and frogs.       The
symptoms produced by its administration are failure of muscular power,
preceded by irregular muscular movement.
    9.   On birds     a small dose produces violent vomiting and irregular
muscular     movements, with difficult respiration.        These symptoms are
followed by loss of muscular power and death.
    10. In cats and dogs the symptoms are restlessness, nausea succeeded
by violent     vomiting,    spasmodic jerks of the limbs during locomotion,
quickened      respiration, staggering gait, inability to stand, and death
generally during a convulsion of an emprosthotonic character, apparently
connected with an attempt to vomit.             Consciousness seems to be pre
served to the last.
    When injected subcutaneously, although it produces violent vomiting,
it never purges      ; division of the vagi before its administration lessens or
prevents the vomiting usually observed, as well as the other symptoms of
 distress ; and in one instance a dose which would ordinarily have been
 speedily fatal produced no apparent effect in an animal thus operated on.
     11. When injected into the stomach of a cat it produces violent
 vomiting and purging.         Sometimes this is followed by recovery, in other
 cases by loss of muscular power and death.
     12. Injection of atropia does not prevent death ; and although in one
 case it prolonged life for two hours, in other instances it seemed rather
 to accelerate a fatal issue.
     13.  It causes the heart    in frogs to pulsate more slowly ; the ventricle

1876.]          Action of the Bark of Erythrophleum guinense.                173
becomes      irregularly contracted,    leaving pouches over the surface, and
finally is arrested in systole    ; the auricles contract for some time longer.
    14.  In    cats the ventricle   also becomes irregularly contracted   before
finally stopping.
    15. In frogs it causes no rise of the blood-pressure in the aorta, but
raises the oscillation of the mercurial column connected with the vessel
to three times its previous height.
     16.  In   cats and dogs moderate doses injected into the jugular vein
 first raise the blood-pressure without altering the rate of cardiac pulsa
 tion or the extent of oscillation at each beat ; they then slow the heart
 by stimulating the roots of the vagus. The tension rises, notwith
 standing the slowness of the heart's beats. An additional dose paralyzes
 the ends of the vagus in the heart, and quickens its pulsations; the
 pressure rises slightly.      A further dose again slows the heart by acting
 on its ganglionic apparatus, and the beats sometimes fall as low as three
 per minute, three or four respirations occurring during each cardiac
 diastole.     Notwithstanding the very slow action of the heart, the pres
 sure may remain as high as 165 millimetres of mercury, a fact which
 indicates that the arterioles are in a state of extreme contraction.      After
 the heart has ceased, the pressure falls very slowly. Slight pulsations of
 the ventricle occasionally occur when the thorax is opened.
     17. Small doses do not seem to increase the excitability of the peri
 pheral ends of the vagi to electrical stimuli ; moderate and large doses
 paralyze these nerves.
     18. After injection of casca into the veins of an animal completely
 narcotized by chloroform, electrical irritation of the central end of the
 divided vagus of one side, the other remaining intact, is followed after a
  short interval by marked slowing of the pulse, fall of blood-pressure, and
 increased oscillation.
     19. When injected into the veins of a cat after division of the spinal
 cord opposite the second cervical vertebra, the blood-pressure rises to a
  greater height than is attained under other conditions.
     20. When in the rabbit the sympathetic has been divided in the neck
  on one side, subsequent injection of casca into the jugular vein produces
  pallor of the recently congested ear of the side on which the division had
  been made.
     21. When locally applied to the web of a frog's foot temporary slowing
  of the circulation was observed, but no alteration in the diameter of the
  blood-vessels.
     When injected beneath the skin of the back of a frog it produces no
  visible effect on the vessels of the web.
      22. It does not appear to possess any special action on reflex excitability.
     23. In moderate doses it increases the secretion of urine at the same
  time that it raises the blood-pressure.        Further doses diminish the se
  cretion, while they raise the pressure yet more ; and at the time when
  the pressure reaches its maximum the secretion of urine is entirely

 arrested.     When the pressure begins to fall the secretion of urine again
 commences.        The urine collected after the recommencement of the se
 cretion was not albuminous.
    24. When injected into a loop of intestine it does not increase the
 secretion, nor does it produce any distinct congestion.
    25. When applied to the eye it has no action on the pupil, nor does it
cause congestion of the conjunctiva or lachrymation.
    26. When administered to a pregnant cat it did not produce abortion.
    27. The temperature of the body is not affected by administration of the
 drug.
 XXII. " Note        on Independent          Pulsation of the Pulmonary Veins
       and Vena Cava."            By T. LAUDER BRUNTON, M.D., F.R.S., and
       Sir   J.  FAYRER,     M.D., K.C.S.I.            Received    June     15, 1876.
    In  a former     communication* we incidentally mentioned                    that in  a
rabbit killed by the injection of cobra-poison into the jugular vein we had
observed the pulmonary vein pulsating after all motion had ceased in the
cavities of the heart.         We have since observed the             same phenomenon
three or four times under conditions which show that this pulsation is
not due to the action of the cobra-poison with which the animal in
which we first observed it had been killed. The following example will
show the changes in rhythm observed in these pulsations.
   A cat was chloroformed, and the vagi exposed and irritated by an
interrupted current.         Artificial respiration was kept up by air containing
chloroform vapour, and the thorax was then opened, and a solution of
atropia injected directly into the heart by means of a Wood's syringe.
The vagi were again irritated, but without any effect being produced on
the heart, the inhibitory apparatus in it being evidently paralyzed by the
atropia.     A solution of glycerine extract of physostigma was now in
jected into the heart in a similar way.                 The vagi were now irritated
again, and the heart stood still, the effect of the atropia having been
counteracted by the physostigma.             After the irritation ceased the heart
again commenced to pulsate.
    Artificial respiration was now discontinued,            but all the cavities of the
heart continued to beat for a considerable                time.    The ventricles then
stopped, but the auricles continued to beat.                 It was then noticed that
the pulmonary       veins in the right lung, which was exposed to view, were
pulsating.       The  veins, as well as both auricles, pulsated at the rate of
119 per minute, but the contractions of the veins were not synchronous
with those of the auricles.            Both auricles next ceased to beat, but the
pulmonary veins in both lungs continued to pulsate.                  The ventricles now
began to beat again, while the auricles remained still.                     The ventricles
pulsated    at  the rate  of  8 per   minute,  while    the  pulmonary veins pulsated
at the rate of 46 per minute ; and no motion was perceptible in any part
of the auricles.

 1876.]            of the Pulmonary Veins and Vena Cava.                           175
   One hour and twenty minutes after the thorax had been opened, and
about an hour and ten minutes after artificial respiration had been dis
continued, the ventricle was still pulsating. Its rhythm was very irre
gular.     After one beat a pause of half a miuute followed, and then 37
pulsations all together.         One hour aud forty minutes after opening the
thorax the inferior vena cava was noticed to be pulsating close to its
entrance     into the auricle.       A contraction spread like a wave from the
tena    cava   over the right auricle, and the appendix contracted after the
auricle itself.       The superior vena cava also pulsated close to the heart.
The left auricle had ceased to pulsate a considerable time previously, and
the ventricles had also stopped.            After the auricles had pulsated for a
while the ventricles again began. At one hour and fifty minutes after
opening the thorax the inferior vena cava was still pulsating.                  In ten
minutes more all movement had nearly ceased, and the observation was
discontinued.
   At one hour and fifty minutes after opening the thorax slight con
tractions of the diaphragm were noticed.
   The striking points in this experiment are the contractions of the
pulmonary veins and the vena cava independently of the heart, the long
time   during which they retained their irritability, and the continuance of
their   pulsations after the other parts of the heart had ceased.                  The
pulsation of the pulmonary veins and of the ventricles at the same time,
while the auricles were motionless, is also deserving of attention.
   In another experiment we found the pulmonary veins pulsating in a
cat killed by a blow on the head.                We have also seen pulsation in
animals killed in other ways ; but the proportion of cases in which we
have seen it to those in which we have not seen it is very small.                   On
looking through several modern text-books of physiology, we have failed
to find any mention of the rhythmical contractile power of the pulmonary
reins and vena cava; but the earlier anatomists were well acquainted
with it; and Haller* states that he has seen the pulmonary veins con
tinue to pulsate for two hours, and that others had seen the vena cava
pulsate for three hours while all motion in the other cavities of the heart
had already ceased.         Johannes Miillert has also observed contractions of
the vena cava and pulmonary veins ; and in young animals the contrac
tions of the pulmonary veins extend as far as they can be followed into
the  lungs.
   The importance of contraction         of the vena cava and pulmonary veins in
preventing reflux of blood into them during the contraction of the auricle,
under circumstances when any hindrance is opposed to the free flow of
its contents into the ventricle, is self-evident.               Indeed Haller   J says
that it was supposed to exist by Senac, although he had not seen it.

 Especially in cases of valvular disease of the heart is it likely to be of
 great service ; and we think it advisable to bring again before the notice
 of physiologists and physicians this power of the veins, which, although
 so long       known, appears of late years to have              been overlooked.

    On this occasion    I propose to adopt the same course that was taken in
presenting    to the  Eoyal Society the Preliminary Eeport of the scientific
                                                                             '

years 1869 and 1870, in both of which expeditions           I took a part.
                                    NARRATIVE.
    1. The Government having, at the instance of the Society and other
scientific bodies, determined to equip and send out last year two ships (the
'Alert' and 'Discovery') on a North-Polar Expedition, and with these
                           '
vessels the ' Valorous frigate as a store-ship to accompany them as far
as Disco in Davis Strait, it was considered desirable to make the last-
named vessel available for sounding and dredging on her return voyage.
Accordingly the following correspondence with the Admiralty took place,
and vrill serve to explain the circumstances under which the scientific
results now about to be noticed were obtained : —
                          " Council Minutes, April      15.

                                                     April 14, 1875.
                                         I
     " DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, — Since wrote to you on the subject of the
Arctic Expedition, the Admiralty has decided upon sending as a store-
ship, not the merchant-vessel then contemplated, but a man-of-war of
considerable tonnage.        Although there will be no opportunity on the
voyage to Disco for any scientific observation that would delay the pro
gress of the Expedition, yet such opportunity will be available both while
 the ship remains at Disco and on the return voyage, which will be made
 at a time of the year most likely to be favourable.           And   I have reason
to believe that the Admiralty authorities are quite willing that advan
 tage should be taken of this opportunity, to such an extent as circum
 stances may permit, if the Council of the Eoyal Society should be of
 opinion that valuable results are likely to be obtained by the utilization
 of it.
     "I   have already pointed out to you that a Temperature-Section            across
 the North Atlantic to Cape Farewell and Temperature-Sections,                  trans
 verse and longitudinal, in Baffin's Bay are just what are needed to com
  plete the survey of the thermal condition of the great oceanic areas that
  is being so admirably carried out by the ' Challenger.' — The same remark
 applies also to the zoological inquiry, the animal life of great depths in
 the   North Atlantic and Arctic     Seas being    still very imperfectly known.

 So strongly does Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys feel interested in carrying out this
inquiry, that he has volunteered his services for the purpose ; and can    I
 not but believe that the Council will cordially recommend the acceptance
 of his offer by the Admiralty.
    " In the event of this arrangement being carried out, it will,     I  believe,
 be better that the Council should not ask the Government for more than
 accommodation and rations for Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys and for a Junior As
 sistant whom he wishes to take with him ; and that the Council should
 provide out of the Donation Fund the sum which will be required for the
payment of the Assistant, and for providing the requisite supply of jars,
                                  I
 spirit, &c. Mr. Jeffreys and estimate this amount at £120.
      I
    " would venture to suggest, therefore, that the Council should repre
sent to the Admiralty the importance of taking advantage of this oppor
tunity of carrying out a Physical and Biological exploration of the
Deep Sea between the British Isles and Cape Farewell, and also in Baffin's
 Bay ; and that the Admiralty be requested to institute a systematic series
 of Temperature Soundings, and to give such facilities as they may be able
for deep dredging.       Also that they provide accommodation and mess for
Mr. Jeffreys and his Assistant.

     2. The '  Valorous    '
                              is a paddle-wheel steamer of 1257 tons and 400
  horse-power, commanded by Capt. Loftus F. Jones, and having a crew of
  248, including officers, seamen, and marines.            She carried six guns ; but
  these had been taken out to make room for extra cabin accommodation
  and stores.     We had         a donkey-engine    and a good supply of ropes,
  dredges, with nets, accumulators (or indicators),          and various other appa
  ratus for sounding, dredging, and collecting specimens.              I was fortunate
 in being able to secure the services of Mr. Herbert P. Carpenter as my
 assistant.    He is   a son    of Dr. Carpenter, and accompanied his father in
                                                                     '

 the short    deep-sea exploration of H.M.S.
 was of the greatest assistance to me, and showed such scientific abilities
 of a high order, that       I  shall not be wrong in predicting for him a most
 successful and distinguished career as a naturalist.            I   would here also
 take the  opportunity of acknowledging my sincere obligations to Capt.
 Jones, not only for his personal attentions, but for the highly satisfactory
manner in which he carried out the scientific operations in the face of
considerable difficulties.        The other officers also deserve my best thanks
for the unvaried kindness of their companionship.
    3. On Saturday, the 29th of May, at 4 P.M., we left Spithead in com
pany with the
                    '
                      Alert ' and ' Discovery.'      Our vessel was deeply laden
with coal and provisions for the other vessels ; and while sailing we had
some difficulty in keeping up with them. After touching at Cork to post
letters for the squadron and take in more coal, and my going on board
             '
the 'Alert at the entrance of Bantry Bay to greet my friends, Capt.
Xares, Commander Markham, and Capt. Feilden (the naturalist), and to
make the acquaintance of the other officers, we parted company with the
Arctic ships on the 5th of June, and did not again rejoin them until we
met at Disco on the 6th of July.             On our passage we encountered very
heavy weather,        with     strong persistent north-westerly winds, which
greatly retarded our course, and made every one extremely uncomfort
able. One day we gained 6 miles only, and another day lost 8. We had,
in nautical phrase,     " a regular dusting."
    4. The only natural-history work we could do on the outward voyage
was,   during the intervals between storms, to use the towing-net.                 In
latitude 58° 59'      N., longitude 34°     13' W. (between 200 and 300 miles
east of Cape    Farewell),      we  caught some  floating masses of pulpy greenish
matter, which at first looked like an oceanic sponge, but has since been
                                                                         o2

180                       Dr. J.   Gwyn Jeffreys on the               [June 15,
made out by Professor Dickie to be an undescribed Diatom, and named by
him Synedra Jeffreysi. An account of this remarkable organism will be ap
pended to the Eeport.        We afterwards found it covering to a considerable
extent all that part of the North-Atlantic Ocean.           It contained within
its meshes numerous living Globigerinee in different stages of growth,
proving that Globigerina inhabits the surface of the sea. During one
of the gales a wave larger than usual broke over the bow and washed
on board     a   young cuttlefish of the same species (Leachia borealis,
Steenstrup) as that which     I   had taken with the tow- net in the first cruise
                        '
of the ' Porcupine off the western coast of Ireland.           Occasionally two
tow-nets were put out at the same time, each at the end of a spar,
with a guide-line.        One of these spars was lashed to the cat-head of
the bow anchor, and the other to the starboard           paddle-box.    The nets
were thus kept clear of the ship's refuse and of the wash of the paddle.
Attached to the stalk of a floating Laminaria was a cluster of the egg-
 capsules of Buccinmn Gwnlandicwn, with the spawn of a Nudibranch
(probably Doris repanda), Spirorlis borealis, and a sessile calcareous Poly-
zoon, besides countless numbers of a microscopic mite, which swarmed
everywhere and appeared to be busily engaged in eating the outer layer
of the seaweed as well as the spawn of the Nudibranch and the poly-
paries of the Polyzoon.        This very curious parasitic mite could only be
 detected by the aid of a microscope.         The oceanic Fauna and Flora offer
 a vast and inexhaustible field for scientific investigation.
    5. Having entered Davis Strait and approached the " Borae finiti-
mum latus," we met with several icebergs and a quantity of loose pack-
ice, which must have been brought from East Greenland, if not from
 Spitzbergen, round Cape Farewell.         We were obliged to give the pack-
 ice a wide berth; and, notwithstanding the greatest care, our paddles
 did not escape some damage.            But  I  will not diverge from my bio
 logical text, nor say any thing about glacial phenomena ; although              I
 must confess that the beautiful and impressive spectacles of this
 nature which      I  witnessed in my voyage to the arctic regions both at
 sea and on    land cannot     be effaced   from my memory.      We had several
 showers of hail and snow       ;  and on the night of the 3rd July the tem
 perature   of the air fell to 29 J° Fahr. or 2£° below freezing-point. We
 reached Godhavu        in Disco Island on the 4th of July, after a run of
 37 days.
    6.  At Godhavn     the rocks on the shore were covered with a stunted
 variety  of   Littorina rudit, closely resembling a variety       of the same
 species  which    I  found in brackish water on the banks         of the river
 Debeu near Sutton.         The periodical melting of the ice      and snow in
 Greenland would cause an admixture of fresh and salt              water similar
 to that of the river-water and the sea on the coast of Suffolk.              The
 arctic form has been considered a distinct species and named Grcen-
 landica by Menke, Moller, and Morch, Davidi by Bolten, and castanea

is the " Gronlandische Mondschneeken

                                             of Chemnitz.    During our stay
at Godhavn we dredged now and then in one of the ship's cutters at
depths of from one to eighty fathoms.         The results were to me very
interesting ; for opportunities were thus afforded me of observing in
their native habitat the same arctic Mollusca which       I had long studied
at home in our posttertiary and glacial deposits.       Cardium Islandicum,
 C, Grcenlandicum, and Tellina calcaria were the most common species at
Godhavn and occurred at all depths.          On the laud     I found Vitrina
pellucida of Miiller ( V. angelicce, Beck), not at the roots of Arclianr/elica
officinalis, but among moss and various water plants at the sides of
small streams formed by the melting of ice. The pursuit of this branch
of science was very disagreeable, by reason of the swarms of stinging
gnats or mosquitoes which infested the low grounds.         The weather was
rainy and foggy, with occasional sunshine ; the land was treeless and had
a gloomy aspect.     On the 13th of July the thermometer showed 78° in the
eun ; one day at Eitenbenk Kulbrud it was 81° in the midst of icebergs.
    7. No time was lost at Godhavn in transferring the stores of coal
and provisions to the Arctic ships ; and we had also to give them some
of our boats to replace those which had been lost in the gales on the out
ward voyage. All the ships left northward on the 15th of July ; and
after touching at the Danish settlement of Ritenbenk in Waigat Strait,
we reached the Kulbrud, where we had to procure by digging a supply of
coal, being a kind of lignite, from the Miocene strata which composed
the cliffs. By dint of hard and continuous work 105 tons of this
coal were got in the course of four days.     We had a little boat-dredging
in from 15 to 25 fathoms near the cliffs, among melting icebergs and
the mud brought down by glacier-streams.         There was no diminution of
life. The Arctic ships here left us for their destination, and parting
 signals were exchanged.    Mr. Clements Markham (who went out in the
 'Alert' with his cousin, Commander Markham) came on board the
 '
   Valorous ' and made the return voyage with us. He was an agreeable
accession to our small party in the Captain's cabin.      Our position was at
this time critical, in consequence of the narrowness of the Strait and the
 passage of numerous large icebergs.     Some of these had been aground ;
 but as they melted and became lighter they floated and whirled about the
 ship so as to endanger the paddles.    We left at midnight on the 21st,
 and resumed our voyage northward, so as to get out of the Strait at the
 upper end of Disco Island.
    8. On leaving the Strait we got our first dredging from the ship iu
lat. 70° 30' N., long. 54° 41' W., at a depth of 175 fathoms. The tangles
 or swabs brought up several beautiful specimens of Asterophyton evcnemis
 (Asterias caput- Medusce of Fabricius), besides other starfishes ; and the
 dredge had a goodly cargo of mud.       The dredge weighed 78 lbs. When
 it was lowered a small guide-rope with a running noose or "guy" was

the fore deck behind the capstan was enclosed by a sail and ropes for our
 sifting and examination of the mud ; three large tubs made for this
purpose, and nested or packed one within another for the convenience of
 stowage, were filled with sea-water ; a tarpaulin was spread out, a seat
 and rough table provided, and our sieves (a nested set of five and a
 globe-sieve) were at once used to sift the mud. An array of basins, soup-
 plates, jam-pots, and glass bottles with other apparatus were in order
 on the table.                                                   I
                 Mr. Carpenter undertook the sifting, and examined the
 results and reserved some of the animals for more leisurely description.
 The only Mollusca worth special notice were Terebratella Spitzbergensis
 and fragments of Fusus Sabini of Gray. At 4 P.M. we sounded and
 dredged again in 85 fathoms.          The dredge came up empty; but on
 one of the swabs was a fine specimen of Antedon EseJ1ncl1ti.
    9. Steamed slowly down the eastern coast of Davis Strait, and dredged
 on the 28th in 100 fathoms, with no particular result as regards the
 Mollusca. The next day we dredged twice on the Upper Torske Piank
 (lat. 67° 50' N., long. 55° 27' W.) in 20 fathoms, where a great many of
 the usual Arctic Mollusca were obtained.           On the 26th dredged twice
in CO fathoms. These last two hauls were very productive, and yielded
 among other Mollusca the following species : — Montacuta               Dawsoni,
 Tellina inflata, Pilitlium racliatum, and several species of Pleurotoma,
 including P. clcclivis and a remarkable variety of P. Trevelyana, which
 I  propose to name SmitJdi, after Mr. Edgar Smith of the British
 Museum.
     10. My narrative must now allude, although briefly, to an anxious state
 of things which took place on the 27th of July, when we were about to
 enter the natural harbour of Holsteinborg for ballast.         The weather was
 foggy, and we were therefore going slowly and cautiously under steam.
 Without our having any suspicion of danger we suddenly found ourselves
 stranded on a sunken reef of rocks about ten miles from Holsteinborg,
 which had not been laid down on the chart.           The wind was freshening,
 and the ship was continually bumping and straining ; but most provi
 dentially the tide was rising. After a suspense that lasted several hours
 the bow became     free, and soon afterwards the ship floated and was got
 safe to Holsteiuborg.       I  cannot sufficiently express my admiration of
 the prompt and skilful manner in which the Captain behaved in this
 trying emergency.      My feelings at the time were those of intense dis
 appointment   ; because   I feared  that, even  if  we escaped with our lives,

 the scientific object for which          I   had undertaken such a long and un
 comfortable voyage would probably be frustrated.
      11. While the divers were at work under water examining the keel
 and timbers of the ship and fixing iron plates, and the carpenters were
 building a bulkhead at the bow, where the most dangerous leak existed,
 some of the officers went on shore trout-fishing ; and Mr. Broad
 (the Navigating Lieutenant) most obligingly brought mo specimens of
 two very curious kinds of Crustacea from a pool of fresh water in a
 neighbouring island, viz. Apus glacinlis and Branchipus paludosns ; tho
 Aput is allied to the king crab or Limulus, and consequently to the
 extinct Trilobites.         Mr. Carpenter and          I   had some boat-dredging in
 shallow water.        Bhynchonella psittacea and Pecten Islantlicus
                                                                                 * were here
 the most common Mollusca ; and a living specimen of a new species of
 Pleurotoma (P. rubescens, J.) was discovered in 10 fathoms.                       This last-
 named species is described          in the footnotef.
     We left Holsteinborg on Sunday the 8th of August, and did not again
 touch land until we returned to Plymouth.                   I  cannot omit here publicly
 thanking Inspector Krarup Smith, and Governors Fencke and Lassen,
 for the great kindness and hospitality shown by them, at Godhavn, Riten-
 benk, and Holsteinborg.
     12. The variation of the compass is so great in these paits that the
 ship was steered in a north-westerly direction, although she was actually
 going south.      We recrossed the arctic circle in 66° 32' N. lat. 10th August.

going day and night.            If
                           a small brig had been in the first instance
despatched to Disco with a supply of coal for the Polar Expedition we
need not have entered Waigat Strait, and lost so much time in digging
fuel of an inferior quality on an exposed and dangerous coast, nor
have thus unnecessarily consumed our own provisions ; and as ballast
could have been taken in at Godhavn, the unfortunate accident which
crippled the ship might have been avoided. In that case the instructions
of the Admiralty, in compliance with the request of the Society for
scientific investigations, could have been completely and satisfactorily
carried out.
    14.Sounded and dredged on the 14th of August in 1750 fathoms, at
the entrance of Davis Strait. The dredge brought up nearly 3 cwt. of
soft yellowish-brown mud.    The Mollusca comprised SipJ1onodentalium

wise fragments of a volcanic or igneous rock (which, according to
 Mr. Etheridge, came probably from Iceland) as well as stones in the
 dredgings from 1750 and 1450 fathoms.                  The great difference of
 depth in the same track between the last and next sounding (1450 :
 690 : 1230) was very striking ; and we almost fancied that we had
                                                                   '
 got on the sunken land of Buss.            (See Dr. Wallich's       North-Atlantic

 and shallowest depth represents a submarine ridge corresponding with
 that discovered in the 'Bulldog' (viz. 1168:748 : 1260) between 59°
 and 60°     N. lat. The fauna appeared to be the same on each side of the
 ridge.     We sounded the next two days in 1230 and 1485 fathoms.

 in 1785 fathoms. The sifting of a good load of ooze did not yield much.
 More fragments of Atretia gnomon, Malletia          excisa,  Axlnus Croulinensis,
 A. ferrugino1us, and the fry of Isocardia cor, with a few of the ' Porcu

 pine deep-water species, were the principal results in the Mollusca.
 Mr. Norman reports some undescribed Echinodermata,                     Isopoda, and
 Ostracoda ; and Dr. M'Intosh a second species of his genus Tachytry-
 pane under the name arctica.          The following day another Atlantic gale
 came on, with violent squalls ; the water in the dam increased from
 3 feet 10 inches to 8 feet ; and we were battened down.                 This stopped
  all  further  scientific exploration   ; but eleven  out   of twenty stations in
  the Admiralty programme had been examined, and we had nearly joined

 returned home safely on the 29th of August, after a rather eventful
  crnise of three months.

  able, and that it may in some measure serve to supplement the far
  greater exploration of the Challenger,' which did not extend north of

our meridian.      We have had a mere glimpse of that " wonderland
which underlies the vast ocean ; and our curiosity is very far from being
satisfied, especially as regards the arctic seas.   It is a new world, full
of interest not only to naturalists -but to every man of science.
    Although we have of late years done a great deal to promote sub
marine researches, as shown by the expeditions of H.M.SS. ' Lightning,'
'
  Porcupine,' ' Shearwater,' ' Challenger,' and ' Valorous,' our compara
tively poor neighbours in Scandinavia have been earlier in the field and
not less energetic.    From the ' Notices sur la Suede,' published on the
occasion of the International Congress of Geographical Sciences in 1875
at Paris, it appears that between the years 1837 and 1875 seventeen
scientific expeditions were made from Sweden, of which fifteen explored
the arctic regions.    Professors Loven, Torell, and Nordenskiold, with
other distinguished naturalists, took an active part in these expeditions.
The sister kingdom of Norway has now engaged in the same course of
discovery ; and a well-equipped Government expedition has within the
last few days set out from Bergen, with the view of examining the region
of sea surface and bottom bounded by Norway, the Shetlands, Faroes,
Iceland, East Greenland, Jan Mayen, and Spitzbergen.           This will be
done during the present and the next year or two.      Dr. G. O. Sars (son
of the late Professor Sars and a zoologist of great reputation) is the
naturalist in charge of the Norwegian expedition ; and the harvest is
sure to be abundant and valuable.
   But after all it must be borne    in mind that if every civilized nation
in the world were every year during the next century to send out similar
expeditions, with improved appliances for exploring the sea-bed, the
field would be far from being exhausted.       Every such expedition must
be more or less tentative, and can only form the basis for a more com
plete investigation of
                         " the deep bosom of the ocean." The area of this
must be measured by many millions of square leagues ; whereas all that
has hitherto been effected has been to scrape in an imperfect manner the
surface of a few scores of acres.
    My attention has been directed exclusively to the Mollusca.      Indeed
I could   not have prepared this Eeport but for the valuable assistance
which has been kindly given me by naturalists who have specially
studied other groups of the marine Invertebrata.   Mr. Norman has worked
out the Crustacea, Tunicata, Polyzoa, Echinodermata, Actinozoa, Forami-
nifera, Polycystina, and Sponges, Dr. M'Intosh the Annelida, Professor
Allman the Hydrozoa, Professor Duncan the Corals, and Professor Dickie
the Diatoms.      Dr. Carpenter has undertaken the report of the physical
results, and to complete the examination of the Foraminifera.

   The total number of marine species procured during the ' Valorous
cruise was 181, viz. 122 in Davis Strait, and 59 in the North Atlantic,
besides fragments of several undetermined species. The most complete
and modern list of Greenlandic species is that which Dr. Moreh, the
eminent conchologist of Copenhagen, prepared for the Manual of ' The
Natural History, Geology, and Physics of the Arctic Eegions, 1875.'
This Manual was published by authority of the Lords Commissioners of
the Admiralty for the use of the North-Polar Expedition.             Dr. Morch's
list gives 155 marine species from Greenland,          after  deducting doubtful
species and varieties.     I  am now enabled to add to that list 33 species,
viz, 21 already described, and 12 undescribed or new.             These last, with
one exception (Pleurotoma rubescens), were from depths exceeding 1000
fathoms.     I obtained altogether from Davis Strait and the North Atlantic
no   fewer than  37 undescribed species (Brachiopoda 2, Conchifera 16, Sole-
noconchia 7, Gastropoda 11, Pteropoda 1, Cephalopoda 0), all except the
Pleurotoma from great depths.         The only land-shell which occurred to me
in Greenland was Vitrina pellucida, Miiller,= V. angelicce (Beck), Moller,
which is a native of all the four old quarters of the globe. Several species

from deep water were familiar to me from my dredgings in the Porcu
       '
pine off the west of Ireland and in the Bay of Biscay, as well as from
the newer tertiary deposits in Sicily — thus showing a range of distribu
tion from 56° to 38° N. lat., or between 1200 and 1300 miles. One of
the most remarkable instances of such distribution, both in space and
time, consisted in the rediscovery in comparatively high latitudes of two
exquisite and peculiar species which cannot be referred to any known
genus, and for which     I  will propose the name of Segutnzia, in- honour of
my friend Signer Seguenza, Professor of Geology and Palaeontology at
Messina. The genus evidently belongs to the Solarium family, but is
distinguished by having a broad and deep open furrow (rather than a
cleft) in the upper part of the last whorl.           I  have three species, all
undescribed (S.formosa,       S.  elegant, and S.  earinata), the first of which
has no umbilicus, the other two being deeply umbilicated.              The newer
Tertiaries of Sicily   also  contain   several other  species  of  northern Mol
luscs in a fossil state which do not appear to inhabit the Mediterranean.
Some of these (e.g. My a truncata, Saxkava Norver/ica, and Buccinum
undatum) are comparatively shallow-water species ; and as their trans
port or migration southwards cannot be accounted for by the action of
deep submarine currents, it is difficult to conceive how they could have
lived in that part of the Mediterranean where Sicily now stands, unless
the climate of that region had changed in the same way as must have been
 at one time the case in Great Britain.           Possibly the North Pole may

    The consideration of the Mollusca in Davis Strait gives rise to

188                        Dr. J. Gwyn Jeffreys on the                [June 15,
a   curious   and     interesting question as to whether the Green]andic
fauna is European or American.              According to the learned Presi
dent of the Eoyal Society, the flora of Greenland is European (see
                   '
page 198 of          The Natural History, Geology, and Physics of the
Arctic Eegious, 1875').         My examination of the Mollusca in the North
Atlantic, from Norway and Spitzbergen to the United States, as
well as in Davis Strait, induces me to extend Dr. Hooker's opinion
to the marine Invertebrate fauna ; and Dr. M'Intosh concurs with me
in this as to the Annelida. Another of my colleagues, the Eev. A.
M. Norman, believes, on the other hand, that the fauna of Davis Strait
is American and not European, because out of 30 species of Ecbi-
                                                           '
nodermata procured          during the cruise of the         Valorous,' 27 are
American    and   21   only are European, and  out of  15 stalk-eyed Crustacea
13 are American         and 11 only are European.      In the other classes of
the Crustacea, as well as in all the remaining orders of Invertebrata
examined by him, the percentage is largely in favour of the fauna
being European.          The Mollusca on the eastern coasts of the United
States have been most assiduously and carefully worked out by a host of
able conchologists during more than half a century, and especially of late
years by Professors Stimpson and Verrill and Mr. 'VVhiteaves ; so that        I
do not imagine that many more species remain to be gleaned on those
coasts. Now the accompanying lists which           I have prepared show that
there are 116 North- American species which have not occurred on the
coasts of Greenland nor in the European seas ; that 52 other species
are Greenlandic and European, not American ; that 39 others are Ameri
can and European, not Greenlandic ; that only 3 others are American,
and Greeulandic, not European ; and that 5 others are exclusively Green
landic, and not American nor European. The total number of species
from the north-eastern coasts of America is about 400. The result there
fore shows very decidedly that the Mollusca of Greenland are more
European than American, and implies that the course of migration has
been in a westerly and not easterly direction.
   Besides the examination of the shells of Mollusca          I had an opportu
nity of examining and describing the "animals" or soft parts of 58
 species, including such rare and peculiar forms as Atretin gnomon, Dis-
cina Atluntica, Menestho (not Manoptygma) allula, and Pilidium radia-
tum.     I may here mention that     I watched for a long time and on different
occasions living specimens of Rhynchonella psittMea, with their valves
 opening and opened ; but       I could never detect any cilia (much less the
arms) protruding.         Butcinum Qraenlandioum takes in Davis Strait the
place of our common B. undatum; its odontophore is very different, and,
according to Mr. Jabez Hogg, the formula of B. Greenland icum, var.
sericata, is 3 . 4 . 3, that of B. undatum being 4.7.4.
   I  will add diagnoses of three new genera, Atretia, Glomus, and Se-
yuenzia.    The new species will be described elsewhere.

 prominent and pointed, but not incurved : byssal foramen elongated :
 hinge-line narrow : skeleton composed of two funnel-shaped processes,
which diverge from the beak in the upper or larger valve, and of two
 blade-like processes, besides an upright, plate (like the hand or index of
 a sundial) in the upper part of the lower or smaller valve.
     Its nearest ally is W1ynthonella, from which it appears to be dis

that subgenus or section of the genus Solarium which the late Dr. J. E.

Seguenzia differs, however, from Solarium and from every other genus
of that family in the last whorl having a deep and wide groove, which
is placed in the upper part, instead of a narrow slit placed in the middle

            Note on the Odontophore of Buccinwm Qrasnlandicum.
                              By JABEZ HOGG, F.L.S.
    The odontophore of B. Gromlandicum differs from that of B. undatum
 both in the lateral and central teeth.          In B. Qrcenlandicvm the lateral
 portion of the ribbon contains about sixty rows of bold translucent
 teeth, arranged in series of three set on the same shaft ; the superior
 of which is recurved and much prolonged, while the central one is small
 and subdued, and the third or last is of medium size and slightly
 recurved.     The median (rachidian) portion of the ribbon bears upon its
 more central part a series of symmetrically arranged rows of four teeth,
 all of which are of the same length, short and more suppressed than
 the smaller of the laterals, but far more developed than those of B.
 undatum.
    I  have noticed, in my former examinations of the odontophores of
 Bncrina, that in the early condition (embryonic state) there are three

 centres of silication, and that the ribbons when fully developed are en
 closed in a kind of muscular and membranous sheath.            This sheath can
 be stripped off and allow    of an easy separation of the three bands.
    In  B. undatum the odontophore is said to be longer than the whole
 length of the body of the animal.          I
                                        This should think is a mistake ; at all
 events that of B. Grcenlandicum, when stretched out, is somewhat less
 than half the length of the body.

    Four hundred      and   seven Invertebrata brought home by H.M.S.
 '
   Valorous,' and belonging to the above classes have been examined. Con
 sidering the very short time allowed for dredging, the state of the weather,
 and other circumstances, the results of the Expedition are surprising and
 reflect great credit on all concerned.   Moreover, if a proof were needed, it
 is here found how little is yet known of the fauna of the deep waters
 within the Arctic Circle, or even of the inhabitants of the shallower parts
of these northern seas. It is necessary to bear in mind that the in
                       '           '
 vestigations of the Valorous        were chiefly confined to those portions
of the coast which had been previously most carefully worked bv the
 Scandinavian naturalists. Each time that the dredge was let down in the
deeper parts of Davis Strait, it brought up animals of high interest
altogether new to science ; and it is not a little remarkable that among
these were representatives of genera which had until lately been re
garded as exclusively confined to tropical or subtropical seas.             The
results of  this Expedition    show  how desirable it is  that really systematic
dredging should be carried out in Davis Strait, and still more that the
wholly unexamined fauna of Baffin's Bay and Smith's Sound should be
investigated.     It is to be hoped that the Arctic Expedition may be
enabled to carry out successful researches with respect to the fauna of
these high latitudes.     The determination of the character of the animals
living in the abyss of the Arctic seas is a matter of no small importance
whether regarded from a zoological or from a geological standpoint.
    Of the 407 species, 339 were procured in Davis Strait, and 128 in the
North Atlantic, many animals, especially among the Foraminifera, having
been brought home from both areas.
    I have made a careful examination of all that has been written on the
animals belonging to those classes on w7hich it is my duty to report
which had been brought by previous British Arctic expeditions from Davis
             I
Strait, and find that the total aggregate of these Invertebrata of earlier
expeditions is at the most 166 species as against 339 brought home by
the ' Valorous,' — a convincing proof of the results which can be obtained
by the use of modern appliances when in skilful hands.
    Of the 113 Greenland Crustacea, 43 are known as North-American,

82 as European, 49 as British ; but one only, the Amphipod Anonyx
ffutosus, Krbyer, has as yet been found living in the Mediterranean.
     Of the 66 Polyzoa, 33 are American, 59 European, 35 British, 1
 Mediterranean.       This Polyzoon is Lepralia hyalina, the range of which
 oeema to be cosmopolitan.
     Of the 30 Echinodermata, 27 are American,          21 European, and 9 British,
 but   not any Mediterranean.
     Of the 103 Foraminifera, 46 are known as American, 54 as European,
 52 as British, and many Mediterranean.
     Taking these four classes together, therefore, we find that of 312 Green
 land species, 149 (or 47 per cent.) are North-American, 216 (or 69 per
 cent.) are European (including Spitzbergen under that term), and 145 (or
 46 per cent.) are British.         We might thus be led to infer that the
 Greenland Marine Invertebraf a approached much more nearly in character
 to the European than to the American fauna.              Closer examination, how
 ever, of the facts seems to prove that such a conclusion would be erroneous ;
for while the Marine Invertebrata of Europe have been very carefully
worked out, very much remains to be done among all the less conspicuous
animals of the North-American coasts*. Thus, as regards the great class
of the Crustacea, comparatively little is known of any orders except
those which contain the large stalk-eyed forms.
     If, then, disregarding all other classes and orders, we confine our per
centages to the Echinodermata and Stalk-eyed Crustacea, which we know
to have been well worked up on the North- American coast, we find the
results altogether changed ; for of the 30 Greenland Echinodermata 27 (or
90 per cent.) are American, 21 (or 70 per cent.) are European, and 9 (or
30 per cent.) are British ; and of the 15 Stalk-eyed Crustacea, 13 (or 86
per cent.) are American, 11 (or 73 per cent.) are European, and 6 (or 40
per cent.) are British ; and we cannot but conclude that when the American
marine fauna shall have been as fully known as that of European seas,
the fauna of Davis Strait will be found to possess an American rather
than a European character, though the contrary might at first sight be
inferred from our present unequal knowledge of the several faunae.
    The following Tables will show at a glance : — (1st) the number of
animals belonging to the several classes, (2nd) to the orders of the Crustacea,
                                                                            '

206                         Dr.  J. Gwyn Jeffreys on the                 [June 15,
                                         Tow-net.
    In   the tow-net in       Lat. 52° 33' N., Long. 26° 44' W., in the North
Atlantic, the very rare Pasiphaxt tarda, Kroyer, was taken. The same
mode of collecting also produced Nautilograpsus pelagicus, Rous, Idotea
robusta, Kroyer, Themisto libellula (Mandt), Parathemisto eompressa (Goes),
and Tauria medusarum (Kroyer), together with many Copepoda, a Cam-
panularian, Lepralia hyalina, many Diotomacea, &c. In Davis Strait
were similarly taken Themisto libellula (Mandt), Themisto bispinosa,
Boeck, Tauria medusarum (Kroyer), and Onesimus littoralis (Kroyer),
together with the beautifully spinose Copepod recently figured by Buchholz,
in the Keport of the German North-Pole Expedition, under the name
" Cleta minuticvrnis, Miiller"*. It is, however, most certainly not the
species described by Miiller or Baird ; and             I would therefore propose
for this very distinct Arctic form the name Cleta horrida.
                          Holsteinborg Harbour, 7-35 fathoms.
    Holsteinborg Harbour produced            a rich harvest  of Arctic forms.    The
Crustacea included         the great spider crab of the Greenland seas, Chione-
eetes  opilio (Fabr.),     the fine northern shrimps Crangon bore<is (Phipps)
and Argis        Lar (Owen), the rare Amphipods Onchomene minuta (Kroyer),
Byblis      Gaimardi     (Kroyer), (Ediceros lynceus, M. Sars, and borealis, A.
Boeck, Protogeneia incrmis (Kroyer), Antonoe macronyx, Bruzelius, and
Photis Rtinhardtii, Kroyer, together with many species familiar to us off
the British coasts. The Ostracode Bradyeinetus Brenda (Baird) was in
extraordinary abundance, along with Cytheridea papillosa, Bosquet, Sclero-
ehilus contortus (Norman), Xestoleberis depressa, G. O. Sars, Cytheruru
undata, Sars, Cythere tuberculata, emarginata, lutea, and other species.
Most of the specially Greenlandic Echinodermata occurred here. The
Holothurians Orcula Barthii, Trosch. (? or new), Cucumaria minuta,
Fabr., and calcigera, Agassiz, Psolus Fabricii, Dub. and Koren, Chirodota
lame, Fabr., and Afyriotrochus Minkii, Steenstrup, the Ophiuridan Ophio-
glypha nodosa, Liitken, and the Asteridan Asterias albula, Stimpson, were
associated with forms which are also European. Here, too, were such
interesting       Polyzoa as  : —Leieschara   subgracile (D'Orb.) ; Celleporaria in-
erassata,     Lamk.    ; Bugula Murrayana, Bean, both the typical form and
that named by Packard from the coast of Labrador (B. fruticosa) and
by Loven from Finmark (B. quadridentata).                    Our common Lepralia
ventrkosa, Hassall, seems to be also the most abundant Greenland
Lepralian; it was found here and in all the other inshore dredg-
ings.      A new Cellepora in Holsteinborg Harbour and other Greenland
localities had been previously sent to me by Mr. Whiteaves from the
Biver St. Lawrence, where it was procured in the dredgings of the

Canadian      Government    ;  it may fitly bear the name of that naturalist,
CMepora WTiiteavesi. The Shetland Membranipora sacculata, Norman,
furnished here another link between our fauna and that of the Green
land seas.       The more remarkable Foraminifera in the locality were
 Trochammina gordialis, Parker and Jones, Lituola Canariensis, D'Orb.,
 Tertularia biformis, Parker and Jones, and Bolivina punctata, D'Orb.
                     Godhavn Harbour, Disco, 5-20 fathoms.
    There are     certain common British Invertebrata which are              equally
 abundant on the Greenland coast.           These animals are for the most part
 also circumpolar      in their distribution    ; conspicuous    amongst these are
 Hyas aranea     (Linn.)   and   coarctata, Leach    (of gigantic  size), Eupagurus
pulescens (Krciyer), Solaster papposus (Linn.), Ophiopholis aculeata (Mull.).
 With these in Godhavn Harbour were associated Chionecetes opilio
 (Fabr.),    Argis  Lar (Owen), Hippolyte Fabricii, Kroyer, and turgida,
Kriiyer, Ampelisea Esehrichtii, Kr., and Haploops tubicolv, Lilljeborg, these
two Amphipods being in great abundance.               Among many Ostracoda were
the rare Cytl1ere borealis,      G.  8. Brady, canadensis, G. S. Brady, and an
undeseribed species of the same genus ; and Cytheruragranulata, G. S.
Brady, and cristata, G. S. Brady, the two latter species being only pre
viously known as fossil in the Posttertiary deposits of Canada.                  The
great sea-cucumber,       Cucumaria frondosa (Gunn), was living in company
with     C.   e<deigera, Agas.,     Chirodota      lane (Fabr.), Asterias albula,
Stirapson, Ophiacantha bidentata (Eetz.), and Ophioglypha robusta (Ayr).
 Of the Polyzoa may be named : —Scrupocellaria scabra, var. elongata, Smitt ;
Bugula Mvrrayana, var. fruticosa, Packard ; Lepralia cruenta, sinuata,
•ansata,  acutirostris  ; Cellepora plicata, Smitt ; and Hippothoa divaricata,
Lamx.. — the true form, and not my H. expansa, which is mnch more
abundant in the Arctic seas, and has probably been frequently recorded
under the former name.           Among thirty-six Foraminifera identified from
this locality are Dentalina consobrina, D'Orb. (or the form figured under
this name by Parker and Jones), Polymorphina                 Burdigalensis, D'Orb.,
Pidlenia sphceroide1, D'Orb., Verneuilina polystropha, Eeuss, Cassidulina

    A small quantity of material examined from the harbour con
sists of a ferruginous mud, which contained large quantities of the
tubes of Pectinaria and of another more delicate Annelid.                  The Fora
minifera among this mud were specially interesting, as exhibiting a
 marked parallelism with those recorded by Mr. G. M. Dawson from
 Gaspe Bay in the Gulf of St. Lawrence*.               Of the twenty-eight Lievely-
Bay species, twenty-two are also in Mr. Dawson's Gaspe-Bay list ; and

       Station No. 6.      Lot.  64° 5'  N., Long. 56° 47' W. ; 410 fathoms.
    Only    a very small   quantity came     up in the dredge   ; but every scrap was
a treasure, and showed that we as           yet knew nothing whatever of the rich
fauna which lies hid in the depths          of the sea in the Arctic regions. Two
actinozoans of the highest interest          occurred here.     Of these the first is a
remarkably fine Gorgonian belonging to the genus Mopsea.                       It differs
entirely from the recently described Mopsea borealis, M. Sars*, the only
previously known northern form, and approaches much more nearly to the
character of species from tropical seas.           It grows in the form of a thick
little bush, 6 inches high (probably, at least, 9 inches when perfect).
The main stem continuously divides with verticils of three or four
branches each, and the branches thus formed similarly subdivide.                      The
polyps, instead       of being  short  as  is the ease  in Mopsea    borealis,  are  very
long, longer even than in Mopsea Mediterranea, Kisso t. The form may
be named Mopsea arbiiscula.            In floating the sharp sand of this dredging
to separate the Foraminifera and Ostracoda, a tip of a branch of Anti-
pathes arctica, Liitken, was procured.            Although this fragment was not
more than a quarter of an inch long, there can be no doubt of its belong
                                                         J
ing to the species described by Dr. Liitken ; and we thus obtain a
habitat for this Arctic form of what is otherwise known only as a marked
tropical genus, if we except an as yet undescribed species found in the
'Porcupine' Expedition of 1869. The type and only known specimen
of Antipathes arctica, described by Dr. Liitken, was found in the stomach
of a shark (Scymnus microcephalus), in Eodebay, about two miles north
of Jakobshavn in Greenland, by M. K. Fleischer.                       The Spatangoid

      This was the last deep-water dredging in Davis Strait. A remarkable
 new genus of Echinoidea occurred here. In general outline it is almost
 cylindrical, the length being to the breadth as 5 to 2; and the height,
 which is greatest in the centre, exceeds the breadth. Viewed laterally
 the cylindrical form is interrupted anteally by two fifths of the length of
 the      animal being sloped away anteriorly above.                 This sloped-away
 portion of the Spatangoid is surrounded by a well-marked fascicle, con
 taining within it the ambulacral system, which is thus excentric and con
 fined to the anterior portion of the animal ; the four lateral ambulacra
are remarkably short, consisting of only four or five pairs of pores each :
 the anterior odd ambulacrum is much larger, and consists of nine pairs
of pores, which are of much larger size than those of the lateral ambu
lacra ; it is situated in a broad but very shallow depression.                   The ten
tacles of the upper portion of the odd ambulacrum are very large and
remarkable, of umbrella-like form, supported on flexible columns, which
are densely studded and strengthened with fusiform nodulous spicula.
The spines are of two forms, battledoor-shaped and of the more usual
form. Pedicellariae of two if not of three kinds. Mouth inferior, at one
third the length of the animal from the anterior extremity, not situated
in a groove (as is the case in Pourtalesia). Anal aperture dorsal, at about
one fourth the length of the animal from the posterior extremity, nearly
flush with the surface, neither in a deep depression (as in Pourtalesia)
nor in an anal groove.
     In its elongated form this genus shows an approach to Pourtalesia,
but in mouth, anal aperture, and the condition of the ambulacral system
it is altogether different.        The nearest approach        I know to the general
outline of this genus in found in the Chalk fossil Archiacia sandalina,
Ag. ; but in Archiacia the anal aperture is inferior. Indeed the condi
tions of this organ are altogether exceptional ; for in those known genera

and most interesting form will be named Aerope rostrata by Sir Wyville
Thomson*.           In this dredging were also procured a specimen of Leueon

                                        '

Diastylis (D. armata), and five undescribed Isopoda.                       This dredging was
also by far the most important as regards the Foraminifera.                                  The
 Globigerinav here presented an entirely different aspect from that of
those usually met with — so much so that they might have been taken to
belong to a different species              ; the segments have a comparatively              com
 pactly   compressed         appearance, very       different   from    the  rounded,     swollen
 outline so characteristic usually of the chambers of Globigerina bulloides.
 The    ooze, moreover, has a reddish tinge, and contains a large number                       of
 remarkable       arenaceous Foraminifera, and more                    Polycystina than are
 usually met with in North-Atlantic                      dredgings.       From the peculiar
 appearance of the Globigerince and the character altogether of this
 dredging, it would seem that we have here the commencement of that
 transition state of the sea-bed between the ' Globigeriru1-ooze' and the
 'Eed Clayf which has been termed by Sir Wyville Thomson "Grey
                                                                  '

 the bottom at depths of about 2500 fathoms in the South Atlantic.                               I
 am thus led to infer that the peculiar form of the Globigerince is dependent
 partially or wholly upon incipient decomposition.                      The arenaceous Fora
 minifera are an extraordinary assemblage. They embrace no less than
 eighteen distinct and well-marked forms, most of the more conspicuous

 (pieces of shell, sand, and other materials) roughly cemented together,
 apparently without any selective power being exercised in the choice of
 the materials.      From the edge of the disk proceed numerous spoke-like
 radii, giving the whole animal a stellate appearance ; pseudopodia are
 extruded from the end of these radii ; and Bessels has shown that in its
 most perfect state a number of these disks are attached to each other bv
 their radii, so as to form a flat network animal, of which each disk will
 represent a chamber.          This remarkble animal, which I have frequently
taken off the British coast, was called by Sandahl Astrorhiza limicola.
In   the ' Porcupine Expedition of 1869 a Rhizopod was dredged between
                         '
 Shetland and Faroe which had a much less regular outline, being sometimes
 stellate and sometimes cervicorn, and the test was composed entirely of
fine sand-grains cemented together ; to this Dr. Carpenter has given the
MS. name Astrorhiza arenaria*.             At   station No. 8 a beautiful form was
found which must also be referred to this genus; the chambers are more
or less ovoid, not flattened as in the previously known forms, but equally
rounded on the sides and above and below ; the spoke-like pseudopodian
processes, instead of being all in one plane, as in A. limicola, radiate in
all directions. Several specimens occurred in which two chambers were
united together, a fresh chamber being developed at the end of one of the
radiating processes ; and it is probable that in its most perfect state the
animal would consist not only of a series of chambers extended on all
sides, as in A. limicola, but of other chambers superimposed on these, so
that the whole animal would be of a most complex type. The arenaceous
investiture consists of fine sand-grains and sponge-spicules firmly (not
loosely as in A. arenaria) cemented together, and is of a ruddy hue, but
not ferruginous.           Astrorhiza catenata, n. sp., may be the name to dis
tinguish    this  animal.     Together with several more new arenaceous forms
are two calcareous Foraminifera, which though known as fossils are now
for the first time met with in a living state ; the one is Cristellaria oovelata,

tentacle-scales.    Of this section it belongs to the subsection* which has
the arm-spines simple (that is, not hatchet-formed as in A.Jilifornns and
its allies) ; and it may be distinguished among other characters from A.

by having only three instead of six aru1-spines.      The present form may
be named   Amphiura    abyssorum, n. sp.
  Two young Asteroidea       which occurredhere, although they unques
tionably have not attained their mature form, have characters so distinct
that we cannot refer them to any described starfish.  Though differing in
all details they are alike in general outline, which resembles that of our
well-known Porania pulvillus.     In one case each angle of the disk ter
minates in a large calcareous plate bearing a large central spine flanked
on each side by smaller spines ; in the other case each angle bears three
spines which project upwards from the dorsal surface.    In the organs of
the mouth and those of the ambulacra            these two Asteridans are far
removed from each other.       Like station No.   this dredging produced

   The Annelida collected during this expedition were kindly placed in my
hands by Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys on his return. They resembled in many
respects those recently examined from the Gulf of St. Lawrence, though
the series was in neither the same.
  Besides the Annelids mentioned        in the following list, one Nemertean
is abundant.    The colour    is brownish purple on the dorsum, whitish
beneath.    The short body and large proboscis distinguish it from Nt-
mertes Neesii; but it may be related to the Amphiporus Grcenlandicus
of Orsted. The empty tubes of some of the Annelids are interesting ;
thus the Globigerina-tubes are bristled with sponge-spicules,     and the
latter are also used by the Terebellce     in  forming the processes at
the anterior apertures.      A remarkable one occurred at a depth of

bathymetrical and geographical aspects will be appended.
    The Euphrosynidae are represented by fine examples of Euphrosyne
lorealis, Orst. While no example of the Amphinomidae or Aphroditidae
 occurs, the Polynoidae, on the other hand, are common.              The most
abundant of the family, perhaps, is Nychia cirrosa, Pallas, the size of the
 specimens somewhat exceeding those from Shetland and Canada.              One
 has its skin studded throughout with small, firm, whitish tubercles,
 caused by subcutaneous masses composed of a vast number of minute
 ovoid bodies with a firm external wall, differentiated from the slightly
 granular central region.       No change was produced by the addition of
 acetic acid, but sulphurift ether shrivelled them considerably.           The
 structures seemed to be of parasitic origin. Nychia Amondseni, Mgrn.,
occurs likewise in fine condition.       Eunoa Oerstedi, Mgrn., is represented
 by specimens an inch and three quarters long, and therefore considerably
 larger than those from Canada.         The ubiquitous Harmothoe imbricata, L.,
 is abundant, and there is nothing peculiar in size or coloration; in
 deed much larger examples exist in my collection from Exeter Bay,
 Greenland.      Some varieties approached Evarne impar, Johnst. (a species
 also present) ; but they could always be recognized by the position of the
 eyes, the structure of the bristles, and other points.       Many had parasitic
 Infusoria on the bristles.       A fragment of Eupolynoe octidentalis, M'Int.,
 with scales, demonstrates that the latter become in spirit of wine of a
 ferruginous brown hue and smooth.            They have rather numerous, long,
 slender cilia on their outer border, and the tips of these processes are very
 slightly dilated.    The Lepidonotus sublevis of Prof. Verrill* may be this
 or an allied form ; but his description is unfortunately too lax for deter
 mination.     The specimen had several parasitic Pedicellinae.
    The Sigalionidee are represented by a fragmentary Leanira from 1785
 fathoms (station 16), and by excellent examples of Pl1oloe minuta,
 Tabr.
    Two species of the family Nephthydidae occur, viz. Nephthys c<eea,
 Fabr., and N. incisa, Mgrn., the former having many parasitic Infusoria
 on its bristles.
    Of the Phyllodocidce are Pl1yllcdoce Grcenlandica, Orsted (large speci
 mens), Eulalia viridis, O. F. Miiller, Eteone pusilla, Orst., and Et«tnt
fldva, Fabr., besides a fragmentary and minute Phyllodoce.

    There is no example of the Hesionidae or Syllidae. Good specimens
of Nereis pelagica, L., and Nereis sonata, Mgrn., represent the Nereidae.
The latter shows fine reddish-brown bars in the preparations.             Under
the family of the Lumbrinereidae is Lumbriconereis fragilis, O. F.
Miiller, a species tolerably plentiful and of all sizes, though none are
                                                      '
so large as those procured in the ' Porcupine off the Spanish coast.
The Eunicidae and Onuphididae are each represented by a single species,
viz. the former by the Eunice limosa, Ehlers, and the latter by very
large examples of Nothria eowhylega, Sars, in tubes of small pebbles.
    In the Glyceridae are Glycera capitata, Orst., and Glycwa setota, Orst.,
the latter having been procured at the surface of the sea in Waigat
 Strait.
    Four forms belonging to the Ariciidae occur, viz. a new species allied
 to Aritia Kupfferl, Ehlers, two small fragments pertaining to different
 species, and Scoloplos armiger, O. F. Miiller. In the first-mentioned
 species the bristles are much more developed than in Aricia Latreillii,
 while no pectinate rows of papillae exist on the ventral surface, as in
 the latter,  Aricia Cvvieri, Aud. & Ed., and Aricia Kupfferi, Ehlers. In
 this respect it agrees with A: Norvegica, Sars, a form which extends to
 the Atlantic, but differs in the structure of the process at the summit of
 the pectinate rows of the anterior feet. The bifid bristles in the superior
 division of the foot appear to be characteristic ; but as previous authors
 seem to have overlooked them (they are present in all the species ex
 amined), the value of this test is at present not fully available.          The
 specimen     is imperfect,   and  measures   about  |  of  an inch    in length.
 The snout is elongated and pointed, and has traces of blackish pig
 ment near the posterior border, dorsally.          The mouth opens on the
 ventral surface between the posterior border of the head and the first
 bristle-bearing segment ; and on each side it has two large curved lobes,
 which pass backward to the commencement of the second bristle-beariug
  segment.     There 'are sixteen lateral rows bearing hooks anteriorly (2nd to
 the 17th), and then the form of the foot alters.        These rows are for the
 most part furnished with pectinate papillae, the superior being in each
 case longer than the others.       The branchiae commence on the fifth seg
 ment. There is no trace of pectinate rows of papiE1c on the ventral
  surface. The forked bristles of the dorsal division of the foot have one
 of the limbs considerably longer than the other, and peculiarly curved.
     The Opheliidae are represented by good specimens of Ammotrypane
  aulogaster, H. Eathke, numerous examples of Ophelia limacina, H. B.,
  a Travisia-l1ke Annelid with no other appendage than minute bristles,
  and two interesting new forms.        For the latter and several allied species
  the name Tachytrypane may be given, from their active boring move
  ments through sand and mud.          Though in external appearance the new
  forms somewhat resemble Ammotrypane, the structure of the body-wall
  and other points clearly separate them both from the latter and Ophelia.

 218                    Dr.  J.  Gwyn Jeffreys on the                   [June 15,
 The first species (Tachytrypane Jeffrey si) comes from station No. 9, at a
 depth of 1750 fathoms. The body is elongate, being upwards of two inches
 in spirit, and about one tenth of an inch in breadth, rounded in front, but
 marked by the usual ventral ridges throughout the rest of ita extent.
 There are about thirty segments besides the head and tail, the anterior
 being short, those in the middle very long.             The head forms a short
 cone, with a minute filiform process      at  the tip.     No bristles are visible
 under a lens, the body being smooth and iridescent, like that of Linotry
pane apogon, for the fine transverse lines are not conspicuous.              Very
 minute simple bristles are, however, present : there are no cirri.            The
 caudal process is separated by a well- marked furrow from the rest of
 the body, and terminates in a slender recurved process bent downward
 and forward.
    In  the structure   of the body-wall Tachytrypane Jeffreysi forms an
 intermediate link between Linotrypane* and the other forms connecting
both with Ammotrypane and Ophelia.             The cuticle is greatly thickened
(as in Linotrypane), and a special process passes inward from the median
line on the ventral surface towards the nerve-cord.            From each side of
 the latter the oblique muscle slants to the body-wall, cutting off a seg
ment of the longitudinal muscular layer ; but the projection of the sepa
rated region is much less than in the Connemara specimen figured in the
Ann. & Mag. Nat. Hist. 1875, xvi. p. 369, and therefore more closely allied
to the condition in Linotrypane.       In the latter the slender oblique muscle
passes   on  each side  from  the  ventral  raphe upward and outward to the
body-wall, and the band causes no separation of the comparatively large
 segment included between it and the ventral raphe.            The oblique muscle
is much shorter and more powerful in Tachytrypane, and the condition
leads to that in allied forms which more nearly approach Ammotrypane.
 In the latter the change is much greater, for a single deep narrow muscle
(apparently representing the coalesced oblique muscles) occurs at the
ventral border, with the nerve-cord beneath ; aud the two segments,
 which in Tachylrypane     only bulge to a slight degree, are here separated
from the body by the whole breadth of the deep transverse muscle just
mentioned, so that in cross-section each forms a prominent pear-
 shaped lobe attached by a narrow pedicle.          A further differentiation is
apparent in Ophelia ; for the great transverse ventral muscle splits, and
a division passes into the ventral pedicle on each side, while the nerve-
cord occupies the median line superiorly.
    The other species, Tachytrypane arctiea, is minute, more slender than
a young Ammotrypane aulogaster of the same length, and is devoid of
cirri, but the bristles are prominent and curve backward.             The cephalic
lobe is less pointed, a pigment-speck exists on each side at the base, and
the form of the caudal process is characteristic, being funnel-shaped and
terminating in a smooth rim.       The cuticle is dense, though less developed

 fathoms. Both species had the intestinal canal filled with fine Globige-
 rtno-mud ; so that in all probability they live in this easily penetrated
  medium, after the manner of their congeners in the sand.
     There is a single example of the Scalibregmidae, viz. Scalibregma in-
fiatwn, H. Eathke; while two forms represent the Chloramidae, viz.
  Trophonia plumosa, O. F. Miiller, and Flabelligera affinis, Sars. The
  specimens of the latter are large.
     Scoleeolepis cirrata, Sars, Prionospio Steenstrupi, Mgrn., and a frag
 mentary Spio from station No. 3 typify the Spionidae.
     There is an example of the Cirratulidae (Cirratulus cirratus, O. F.
 MiiEer), and one of the Halelminthidae, viz. Capitella capitata, Fabr.

     The family Aunnocharidae is represented by OweniajHiformis, D. Ch., the
 tubes of which closely resemble the stalks of Alcyonidium growing in the
 vicinity.
     Amongst the Amphictenidae are Cystenides granulata, L., and C. hyper-
 borea, Mgrn., the examples in both cases being characteristically          fine.
 The sole specimen of the Ampharetidae is Ainpharete arctica, Mgrn. The

    Among the Hydroids of the 'Valorous' dredgings which                     I  have as
yet examined are many new species, and some which                   I  believe   I must
place in new generic groups.           The   curious   organism dredged        in  1450
fathoms, lat. 56° 11' N., long. 37° 41' W., is especially interesting ; for
though it retains none of its soft parts,       I   have little doubt of its being a
second species of Stephanoscyphus, found hitherto only in the Mediter
ranean, unless some dried specimens from the North Atlantic, which                    I
had formerly received from Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, should be referable to the
same genus, a fact by no means improbable.
    There is also a little Campanularian in which        I can find no point which
will specifically distinguish it from a species obtained at Kerguelen
                                                                '
Island by Mr. Eaton, the naturalist of the ' Transit Expedition to that

The work     is   necessarily slow where every specimen is to be submitted to
microscopic examination, and careful drawing made of such as may turn
out to be new.

    1. A small Caryaphyllia ; a young individual.            The species can hardly
be determined, but      I  believe that it is not a new form.

    The calcareous-shelled Foraminifera collected during this cruise did not
present any novelty either as regards type or distribution, except that
the beautiful deep-sea form of Orbitolites which              I   noticed in the first
 '              '
   Porcupine Report (1869, § 36),          and   which   I  subsequently met with
 in the Mediterranean, occurred abundantly in the Baffin's-Bay and North-
 Atlantic dredgings — attaining the same large size in the far north as it
 does off the west coast of Ireland and in the Mediterranean, and showing
 here, as elsewhere, a true spiroloculine centre, which indicates the close
 relation of its cyclical to the spiral plan of growth. The Nodosarine type
 is peculiarly conspicuous in the size of individual specimens, especially
 smooth-shelled Nodnsarinns, as also in the number and beauty of its
 more delicate and beautifully sculptured forms.
     But the arenaceous Foraminifera furnish a most interesting addition
 to those collected in the 'Porcupine' Expeditions, and show, by their
 extraordinary size and relative abundance, that this type is preeminently

  loid Lituola canariensis, and peculiarly large and regular specimens of
  the    " spirilline "  Trochammina irregularis, the surface of which is finished

  posed of sand-grains firmly cemented together by phosphate of iron, and
  imitating more or less closely the forms of calcareous-shelled genera,
  I   may specially notice the following as among its most conspicuous
  types    : —
      a.  A large " nodosarine " Lituola,      composed of a series of globular seg
  ments arranged        in linear succession —the   axis of growth being sometimes
  nearly straight,       sometimes regularly curved, sometimes irregular, and
  the segments having no other connexion           with each other than that which
  is afforded by the small tubular neck which projects from each to be
.received into the next.         The wall of each segment, which is of very uni
 form thickness, is composed of extremely fine sand-grains, laid together
 so as to constitute a beautifully smoothed surface both interiorly and
 exteriorly ; and the tubular neck has a perfectly circular orifice, sur
 rounded by a ring of somewhat deeper colour, which indicates that the
  ferruginous cement is here present in greater quantity. The number and
 size of the chambers varies in different specimens.              The largest I  have
 met with, which is about 0-45 inch in length, has only four chambers —
  the first having a diameter of about 0-08 inch, the second of 0-10 inch,
 the third of 0'12 inch, and the fourth of 0'15 inch.          Another, whose total
 length would be about the same if the chambers were arranged in regular
 linear series, has nine chambers —the diameter of the last or largest
 chamber being somewhat less than that of the first or smallest in the pre
 ceding, whilst that of the first is only about 0-02 inch.
     6. Another "nodosarine," composed of segments of an ovoid shape,
 the small end of each being prolonged into a tubular neck with a circular
 orifice which is received into the next segment, and the prolonged neck
 of the last segment forming the mouth.             The total length of this usually
 ranges      between  0-4  and 0-7  inch, and the number   of segments is commonly
 from seven to ten ; its general form closely resembling that of the calcareous-
 shelled Dentalina guttifera, D'Orb., of which unusually large specimens,
 attaining a length of O45 inch, occur in the same 1750 fathoms dredging.
 But a series of small and very delicate forms, exactly similar in type,
 also presents itself in this dredging, their total length ranging down
 wards from 0'25 to 0'15 inch.            And in another series, distinguished by
 the excess of the breadth over the length of the segments, most perfect
 forms, composed of excessively minute sand-grains, present as many as

 twelve segments in a total length of about 0-12 inch. On the other hand,
in the 1450 fathoms dredging (No. 12) are fragments which appear to
belong to the same type, except that the small end of each segment is
elongated into a tubular neck which intervenes between each segment and
its successor, so that the whole test would present the aspect of a tube
with egg-shaped enlargements at intervals.              The length of a single flask-
shaped segment with its neck is sometimes as much as O16 inch.
    e. Another series, which      I  may distinguish as the
                                                                " orthocerine," con
 sists of arenaceous tubes, sometimes attaining a length of 0-8 or even
 0-9 inch, having an average diameter of about 0-1 inch ; they usually
 vary but little in diameter from one end to the other, but are slightly
 constricted at somewhat irregular intervals, so as to show an imperfect
 division into about ten or twelve segments. When perfect, these tubes
are usually closed and rounded at one end, which encloses a globose or
ovoid chamber, commonly marked off from the rest either by an external
constriction or by an internal thickening of the wall. At the other ex
tremity the tube, which is there often somewhat conical, has a circular
mouth; but the finish of this mouth, as of the entire tube, is not nearly
so perfect as in the types already described.            The incomplete segmenta
tion of each tube pretty obviously              marks   successive   additions to its
length ; and these additions are far less uniform in length than they are
in transverse diameter; so that while the latter is pretty constant
throughout, the length of a segment may be much less than its breadth,
or may be as much as twice as great. —The special interest of this ortho
cerine test, therefore, consists in its combination of inconstancy of detail
with great constancy of general form and proportion, and in the transi
tional stage it presents between the monothalamous and the polythala-
mous types.       For the whole cavity may in one sense be said to consist
of but single chamber ; whilst in another it may be said to be com -
          a
posed of a series of freely communicating chambers. And the component
sand-grains are much less firmly cemented together than they are in the
preceding types — some specimens approaching, in the looseness of their
aggregation, the Astrorhizce and the large polythalamous orthocerine
LituolcR of the 'Lightning' collection*, as also the monothaTamous
Lituoke collected in the ' Porcupine' t, whose claim to relationship to the
preceding mainly consists in the possession of a slightly projecting
circular mouth, along the border of which the sand-grains are united by
the ferruginous cement which is almost entirely wanting in the "test"
generally.
    The sarcodic contents of these Lituofa have the dark olive-green hue
         I
which have previously noticed as prevalent among the large arenaceous
deep-sea Foraminifera.         But it is a curious circumstance that many of

Protozoon of the Gregarina type. The most careful examination has failed
to detect in this any higher organization than that of ordinary Gregarince ;
and its parasitic character may be inferred from the fact that                  I often
found it coexisting in the same tube with the ordinary sarcodic body of
the Lituolci), which was then more or less reduced in bulk, indicating that
the latter had been partially preyed on by the former.                     Moreover,  I
found a precisely similar body coiled up in the midst of a mass of sand
that occupied the interior of a large detached and partly broken spherical
                 "
segment of a nodosarine."

                                                                      great interest as
conducting us towards what seems at first sight an entirely distinct type,
the Khabdammina of Sars.           These are straight tubular cylindrical rods,
nearly uniform in diameter, and distinguished from the preceding by
their extreme slenderness.         Some of them are nearly an inch in length,
while their diameter never exceeds 0'03 inch, being often not half that
amount.      The larger of these specimens presented themselves in great
abundance in the 410 fathoms dredging (No. 6, Davis Strait) ; the
smaller and less numerous examples in the 1750 fathoms dredging
(No. 9).      Sometimes they are nearly uniform in size from end to
end ; in other cases there are constrictions at irregular intervals,
forming an imperfect segmentation ; while sometimes the tube nar
rows for part of its length, and then enlarges again.                 The sand-grains,
usually   rather   coarse, of  which   these  tubes   are  composed are very firmly
united by ferruginous cement ; and the non-segmented rods bear so exact
a resemblance to those which form the extensions of the triradiate
Rhabdammina (Sars), that they might easily be supposed to be detached
arms of that very curious form*.            In fact, when we met with similar
rods in dredgings containing also large numbers of Rhabdammince, this
was the light in which my colleague was accustomed to regard them. A
 careful examination of the varietal forms of Ithabdammina, however, had
led me to the conclusion that the typical triradiate form might graduate
into a single long rod ; for when, as often happens, cue of the three rays
is imperfectly developed, the others are not only longer than usual, but
 diverge' at an angle greater than 120°, this divergence increasing in propor
tion to the suppression of a third ray, until it reaches 170°, so that the
 two rays come so nearly into the same straight line, that a single very
long straight rod may be considered as the representative of two of the
three rays of the typical triradiate Eh:ildammina. And used to enforceI
this view by a comparison of the large number of single straight rods
 which often came up in one dredging, with the small number of tri
radiate centra from which they could be supposed to be detached — the
former being often six or eight times as numerous as the other, whilst
they ought not to have exceeded three times.             Now in the two ' Valorous '
 dredgings which furnished these straight rods in the greatest abundance

only two or three triradiate RhaMammina centra presented themselves ;
 so that I  feel justified in concluding that the long straight rods are not
rays  of Rhabdammina       broken off from their centra, but that each repre
 sents two elongated and straightened-out arms of a Rhabdammina whose
third arm is abortive.      The gradation towards the orthocerine Lituofa,
marked by their occasional imperfect segmentation, is only another
case of that general doctrine of intimate mutual relationship which            I
 have on several occasions pointed out as existing in each of the two
groups of perforate and imperforate Calcareous-shelled             Foraminifera,
and which, when all the new deep-sea Arenaceous types shall have been
carefully worked out, will be found,        I feel confident, to be completely
applicable to that third series which is now coming to rival the other two
in the variety of its forms.
    What is the relation      between the Arenaceous and the Calcareous-
shelled Foraminifera (whether the former are the elder, and the latter the
derived forms), is a question on which         I shall at present only suggest,
reserving what    I have to say upon    it to some  future opportunity.

                     By Professor GEORGE DICEIE, F.L.8.
    Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, during     the voyage of the ' Valorous,' collected by
means of the towing-net, in lat. 58° 55' N., long. 34° 18' W., a peculiar
organism having the appearance of a small sponge. It was found to
have a very wide range, extending over some thousands of square miles.
    The general aspect of a specimen preserved in spirit is such that it
might   be readily mistaken for a sponge.
    Specimens were submitted to Dr. Bowerbank and Mr. Carter.              They
both reported it not to have the character of a sponge. The latter was
more specific in his opinion, and pronounced it be a Diatom, probably a
Synedra. Before receiving Mr. Carter's report         I had arrived at the same
conclusion.
    The organism is a new species of the genus Synedra, and remarkable
on account of the large proportion of colloid matter which seems to
connect the frustules in masses. The former may be compared to the
sarcode, the latter to the spicules of a sponge ; but there is mere re
semblance only.      It is further notable on account of the great length
of the frnstules as contrasted with their breadth.
    The countless multitudes of this Diatom and of others of the same
family, and the extent of sea over which they extend, are points of much
interest, contributing directly as they do to the support of various smaller
marine animals, and these in turn to larger forms, adding also to deposits
taking place at various depths.       I  add a brief description of Synedra

     From Mr. Jeffreys           also received specimens of an organism found by
 Mr. Hart, the naturalist of the ' Discovery,' drifting on the surface in
  lat. 59° 36' N., long. 39° 10' "W.            The same was also found by Mr.
  Jeffreys in 59° 16' N, long. 37° 16' W. It consists of dense fleece-like
 tufts of a species of Podosphenia.            It agrees very well with the charac
 ters of P. elongata, Ktz. The latter species is not uncommon on Euro
  pean coasts growing upon various Algae. The specimens collected by
 Mr. Hart are attached to fragments of Algae, in one case, apparently,
 to a piece of a species of Focus, and therefore probably drifted from some
 coast-line.     I  have compared Mr. Hart's specimens with a Scotch example
                          I
 of P. elongata, and find they agree. The f rustules in the latter vary in
 length and breadth ; specimens from the North Atlantic have, for the
 most part, shorter and broader frustules.

  Society, and approved by the Admiralty. Dr. Gwyn Jeffreys having
  undertaken the general charge of the work, named as his assistant my
  Son, Mr. P. Herbert Carpenter, who had accompanied me in the ' Light
             '                            '
  ning and ' Porcupine Expeditions ; and it was arranged that, while
  aiding Dr. Jeffreys in the Biological work, he should take special charge
  of the Physical.
     A grant from the Donation Fund having been made to Dr. Jeffreys
  and myself for the expenses of the inquiry,                       I
                                                  endeavoured to make such
  provision for the conduct of the Physical observations as should render
 them capable of accurate correlation with those of the ' Challenger.'
 With this view,               I
                       obtained two water-bottles, on the construction de
 vised by Mr. Buchanan (the Physicist of the ' Challenger     from Messrs.              '),
 Milne, of Edinburgh,                     by
                               whom they had been supplied to him      and                         ;
 also two Hydrometers, on Mr. Buchanan's construction, from Messrs.
 Kemp, who had previously made them under Mr. B.'s direction.
    Unfortunately, however, my Son was unable to utilize the water-bottles
 thus provided     for as Captain Nares had not been supplied with any
                          :
 water-bottle,     was deemed right to comply with his pressing request
                      it
 that one of these bottles should be transferred to him and the other               ;
 bottle failed in its work, in consequence of some defect in its construc
 tion which the armourer of the 'Valorous' was unable to remedy*.
 No Specific-Gravity observations could                       be   made, therefore,            on any but
 surface-water        ;       these, however, were very systematically                        carried out
                                                                                                        ;
and      Mr. Buchanan has kindly undertaken to compare our Hydrometers
with his own, and to furnish the formula for the exact correction of the
'Valorous observations, so that results may be worked out which shall be
                 '
strictly comparable with those obtained in the Challenger Expedition.'                  '
   Having been supplied by my Son with the entire series of Deep-Sea
Temperature-observations,   the results of which have been embodied in
Sections prepared at the Hydrographic Office of the Admiralty,       now                         I

                                was taken
towards the middle of Davis Strait : for there was hero (Plate 3.
No. YD.) a surface-stratum of 45°, but of such extremely small thickness,
that the isotherm of 40° was reached in about 15 fathoms ; from 40° to
38° the interval was nearly the same as in the previous sounding ; but
below 38° the descent was so slow that 37° was not reached until nearly
800 fathoms, and on the bottom at 1100 fathoms the temperature was still
36°-4. At the next station (Plate 2. Station 8), Lat. 62° 6'.N., Long. 55° 5G'

             another degree further south, and at about the same distance

but the bottom-temperature at 1750 fathoms had sunk to 33°-4. Finally,
a set of serial soundings (Plate 2. Station 10, Plate No. X.) was taken
                                                                     4.
before rounding Cape Farewell, about degree further south and degrees

       :                                                but the isotherm  ;
of 40° was reached at about 50 fathoms, that of 39° at about 90 fathoms,
and that of 38° at about 160 fathoms   whilst below this the descent of
                                                        ;
the thermometers was extremely slow down to the isotherm of 37°, which
lay at about 1050 fathoms — becoming more rapid, however, beneath this,
so that 36° was reached at about 1400 fathoms, 35° at about 1500, and
34°-3 on the bottom at 1660 fathoms.
    Now      these     phenomena to me to point very distinctly to the
                                          seem
existence (1) of    superheated layer, which

                                                slowly moving up Davis
Strait, and gradually losing its excess of temperature as       proceeds           it
north, as shown by the gradual approach of the isotherms to the surface                         ;
(2) of   neutral intermediate layer, 1000 fathoms or more in thickness,
            a
marked out            by
                the extreme uniformity of its temperature, which indicates
its stationary condition  and (3) of
                                  ;    deep cold layer, which as clearly
                                                        a
derives its low temperature from      northern source, as the uppermost
                                                    a
stratum         does       from a southern,         and     which must,       therefore,   be   in
movement.
   The Temperatures at Station VI. (Plate 3.) seem at first sight rather
anomalous when compared with those of Stations VII.-X. — the iso
therm of 37° here coming up within 200 fathoms of the surface, whilst
at only     degree further south
             a                      lies at nearly 800 fathoms; and a
                                                   it
bottom-temperature of 340,6 being found at 410 fathoms at Station VI.
whilst at Station VIII.     only reached at 1350 fathoms.
                                   it   is                 But the ano
maly disappears when the rapidly increasing depth and the tendency of
the coldest water to gravitate to the bottom are taken into account
                                                                    for                    :

severe cold of Baffin's Bay is here flowing down the slope of Davis
Strait.     .Again,   it is at first sight an anomaly to find at Station                 VIII.   a
bottom-temperature    of 34°-6 at 1350 fathoms, while the bottom-tempe
ratures both to the north and to the south of it are 34°'6 ; but this only
shows that the coldest Polar water is flowing south through some deeper
channel, perhaps in the western half of Davis Strait*.        And the same
explanation applies  to the yet more   remarkable   fact that a bottom-tem
perature of 33°- 4 was met with near the mouth of Davis Strait, when no
such water was met with further north.          But that even this does
not carry down the coldest water of the Arctic basin, is obvious from
                                     '            '
the fact brought to light by the        Porcupine temperature- soundings
in the " Lightning Channel (between the north of Scotland and the
                              "
Faroe Islands), over a large part of whose bottom we found the tempe
rature to range two degrees, or even more, below 32°.
   The next temperature-sounding (Plate 2. Station 11, Plate 4. No. XL),
taken on the 17th of August almost exactly in the meridian of Cape
Farewell, and not quite two degrees to the south of               gave, like it,
No. IX.,     bottom- temperature of 33°-4 at 1860 fathoms; so that
             a                                                                                   it
seemed pretty clear that this     the temperature of the coldest water
                                        is
that can find its way into the North Atlantic along either the west or
the east coast of Greenland.     And from the depth at which the isotherm
35° was found to lie in the 1660 fathoms serial sounding,          obvious     it   is
that the stratum between     35° and 330'4 must be  here   very thin onea                        ;

    in Lat. 59° 35' N., Long. 9° 11' W. we had found the isotherm of
    45° lying below 500 fathoms, while the bottom at 767 fathoms was
    still 410,4. It is obvious moreover, from the regularity of the descent of
    the isotherm of 40° in this part of the North Atlantic, that easting has
    more influence on the rate of that descent than southing — thus confirming
    the view formerly expressed as to the tendency of the warm upper flow
    towards the eastern side of the basin*. The isotherms of 39° and 38° slope
    downwards towards         the east at about the same rate  but those of 37° ;
    and 36° still nearly keep their parallelism to the surface, confirming the
                                " neutrality " of the deep stratum which they
    previous suggestion of the
    underlie.
       Between the last station and the next (Plate 2. Station 13), taken in
    Lat. 56° 1' N. and Long. 34° 42' W., in the line of the channel between
    Iceland and Greenland, but considerably to the south of      the sea-bed        it,
    was fouud to have    shallowed most remarkably (Plate 4. No. XIII.),
    bottom being struck at 690 fathoms, and the bottom-temperature rising
    again to 38°-2. This elevation may be regarded with great probability
    asa  continuation of that which was encountered     Sir L. McClintock  by

   The course being now again kept nearly due east, another temperature-
sounding (Plate 2. Station 14, Plate 4. No. XIV.) was obtained in Lat. 55°
58' N., Long. 31° 41' W., which, on        bottom of 1230 fathoms, gave a

degrees further east, and on the same parallel (PI. 2. Station 15), another
set of serial temperatures was taken (Plate 4. No. XV.) which indicated
a further increase in the upper warm stratum, the isotherm of 40° de
scending to about 380 fathoms       but the depths of the isotherms of 39°,

further to the east (Plate   Station 16, Plate 4. No. XVI.), in Lat. 55° 10'

ridge the thermometer fell to more than three degrees lower.

Section the most remarkable contrast yet brought out between the ther
mal condition of the eastern and the western sides of the North Atlantic                         :
for the descent of all the isotherms as they pass from west to east,
which has been already pointed out in the Valorous portion of the     '          '
 section, continues at an even more rapid rate      so that the isotherm of
                                                                       ;

at the first of these stations lay at 80 fathoms from the surface, lay in
 the second at 640 fathoms.     This difference in the thickness of the whole
stratum              above the isotherm          of 40°     is     much more remarkable    than the
difference of surface-temperature, the increase of which between the first
and the second station was only from 55° to 59°-6.
  It clear, therefore, that the heating power of the warm flow which
               is
comes up from the S.W. towards the western shores of the British Isles,
and which proceeds onwards to the N.E., BO as to ameliorate the climate
of the Orkneys and Shetland Islands, but still more markedly to affect
that of the coast of Norway (as has been shown by Prof. Mohn), depends
upon its great depth. Any such superheated film as the Gulf-stream has
been found to be when last recognizable as     current (as was long since
                                                                     a

observations)  must  lose its excess of warmth    long before   reaches our           it
shores. Hence, as have urged on former occasion (Proc.Eoy. Soc. vol. xx.

pp..621, 637. §§ 137, 163), the prolonged heating power of the N.E. flow
depends much more upon the thickness of its moderately warm stratum
than upon its bringing with                  it
                                   high surface-temperature.

 can possibly produce this result, is a point on which it is for Hydro-
 graphers to decide. For myself,                 I
                                      cannot regard it as probable that a
 spent stream of 50 fathoms thickness can give motion to a vast layer of
 900 fathoms depth.
    On the other hand, the doctrine                  I
                                        advocate that a thick upper stratum
 of the North Atlantic is slowly moving Polewards, to fill up the void left
 by the gravitation-underflow of the coldest water towards the equator, au                         J
 that this stratum will also have an Easterly tendency in virtue of the excess
 of easterly momentum which it brings with it from a lower latitude, seems
 adequately to account for the facts now brought to light.          The pro
 gressive closing in of the boundaries of this poleward upper flow will
obviously tend to deepen so as to giveit,  more persistent heating
                                                              it   a
power*. In the South Atlantic and Southern Indian Oceans, on the
 other hand, the progressive opening-out of the ocean-boundaries, as we
 pass Southwards from the Equator, will tend in the same measure to
reduce the thickness of the Poleward upper flow, thus diminishing the
persistence of its heating power. And in this, as    seems to me, we            it
have the true explanation    of the marked difference between the climate
of Kergueleu's    Land (Lat. 50° S.), for example, or that of Heard Island
 (Lat. 53° 8.), and that of Ireland (lying between the parallels of 51£°
 aud 54£° N. Lat.), the summer temperature of the former being but
little above the winter temperature of the latter.
    The 'Challenger' temperature-sections have most conclusively shown
 that the entire warm upper stratum in the South Atlantic            very much       is
 thinner than that of the North Atlantic       and while ;   fully admit that
                                                                            I                      a

of the isotherm of 40° in Lat. 56° N. to depth of 900 fathoms.

freedom of its communication              with the Antarctic, would have a colder
bottom, and that the influence of the Antarctic underflow would probably
extend to the north of the Equator.                  By Sir Wyville Thomson, on the
other hand,   it was argued from the commencement that the whole cooling
of the deep stratum of the North Atlantic is due to the Antarctic under
flow ; and this conviction he repeats in his last utterance on the subject,
on the ground of the continuity of the isotherms from the South into the
North Atlantic*. The question arises, however, why the deep stratum

it to be, than the deep stratum of the North Atlantic ; and this question
appears to me to find an entirely satisfactory answer in the indication fur
nished by the Second Section (Plate 4), that the Arctic Basin is for the most
part separated from that of the North Atlantic by an intervening ridge,
which (like many similar ridges discovered by the ' Challenger') allows
water of about 36°, but not colder water, to pass from the former into the
latter. The limited contributions of colder water furnished by Baffin's

   During      Bome investigations        into the nature of the sclerenchyma of the
Stony Corals (Madreporaria)               I  was impressed with the importance of
examining the method            of entry, growth, and distribution of the minute
unicellular parasite which so constantly penetrates and ramifies in minute
tubular excavations in the solid structures.
    The interest of the subject struck Qnekett in 1851 ; for he described
the minute tubules of a parasite in his Lectures, which he subsequently
published in 1854.            He wrote as follows : — " Confervoid growths are
also very frequently met with in the skeleton of corals, as all those bodies
possess animal matter, which, decomposing after death, becomes a nidus
for the development of Confervae ; and hardly a section can be examined
without exhibiting such an appearance as shown in fig. 78 "t. This
figure exhibits almost straight canals, of great tenuity and of different
lengths, cutting across the normal structures at different angles.
    Before this time, Carpenter              J  and Bowerbank§ had shown that
 molluscous       shells  contained       tubular structures ; and Quekett, in his
work, agreed with them as regards their facts ; but he believed (as,
 indeed, Carpenter did also at that time) that, whilst some of the tubules

 were   normal  to the shells, others were the product of "Confervae,
 Spongida, or of minute boring animals."
   In 1851 Mr. C. B. Hose, F.G.S., found minute tubular borings in
fossil and recent fish-scales     ; and he published his admirable and short
 researches   in   1855, illustrating them with great care and truthfulness.
He noticed that it required a magnifying-power of a ^-inch-focus object-
glass to trace the course of the tubes with any degree of distinctness ;
and he pointed out that their minute diameter of
                                                       2oVo t° foVo ^nch
distinguished them from the results of boring sponges.      Mr. Eose did
not attribute the tubes to Confervae, but to the operation of " infusorial
parasites"*.
   In 1858, C. Wed! t contributed a paper on the subject of these canals
in shells. He described and delineated them ; and some of his drawings
agree remarkably with those of Mr. Eose.      He carried the examination
of his specimens much further. He investigated the parasitic canals in
recent shells and in fossil Gasteropoda, Bivalves, and Brachiopoda, dis
covering them even in a Leptcena from the Devonian formation.      T\lore-
over he exposed a recent shell to the action of dilute hydrochloric acid,
and by dissolving the carbonate of lime exposed the vegetable organism.
He considered that the parasite was Saproleynia ferax, Kiitz., which he
termed a confervan.   He did not examine any corals.
   About the same time, Kcilliker         J
                                       contributed a paper to the Eoyal
Society,  which contained notices of his having seen the parasitic tubes in
a great many shells, Sponges, Foraminifera, and recent Corals ; but he
did not advance further than C. Wedl in their description.     He noticed,
however, that the parasite was unicellular in its construction, and
              I
wrote : — " may further add that the frequent anastomoses of the para
sitic tubes remind one of the anastomoses observed in the mycelium of
some unicellular fungi ; whereas such connexions have not yet, so far as
I  know, been observed amongst the Confervae." He stated that the
sporangia were quite of the same kind as those of unicellular fungi, and
that it seemed probable " that the parasites dissolve the carbonate of lime
of the hard structures into which they penetrate, by means of exudation
of carbonic acid, which secretion would seem to take place only at the
growing ends of the fungial tubes, as they never lie in larger cavities, but
are always closely surrounded by the calcareous mass." He considers it
possible for the parasite to bore its canal by mechanical force in the
horny fibres of sponges, in the way that similar parasites make their way
through the cell-membranes of Confervae and other plants.
   Finally, this short history would be incomplete without the interesting
notice by Mr. H. N. Moseley which was contributed to the Eoyal Society

"  Vegetable Parasites. The corallum of both Millepora and Pocilloptra is
permeated by fine ramified canals, formed by parasitic vegetable organisms
of the   same nature as those described by      Dr. Carpenter and Prof. Kolliker
as occurring   in  the  shells of mollusks   &c.    The organisms were found in
 abundant fructification; they were green, but otherwise appear to be
fungi, as are the parasites of shells &c. Similar parasites are to be found
in various coralla from widely distant parts of the world."
    The paper communicated by me to the Geological Society " On some
 Unicellular Algae parasitic within Silurian and Tertiary Corals, with a
Notice of their Presence in Calceola sandalina aud other Fossils/' was
read Jan. 19, 1876 (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. vol. xxxii. p. 205).

organisms.

 Straits, at a depth of 380 fathoms, and in Balanophyllia verrucaria, Pallas,
from the Mediterranean, at different but not great depths, the previously
known range may be thus increased. All the deep-sea corals examined
 from the bed of the North Atlantic are more or less affected by the
parasite, and the littoral forms also. Thus in Caryophyllia clavus, var.
borealis, from a depth of 1 to 30 fathoms, in Lophohelia prolifera, from
 422 fathoms, aud in Solenosmilia variabilis (nobis), from 1095 fathoms,
the tubes were found in greater or less abundance.
    The specimens examined by Kdlliker and Mr. Moseley were mostly from
 seas with a high temperature ; and the specie* of coral to which reference
will be made in this communication were located during their lifetime in
 temperatures from 39°-7 to 55° Fahr.            The bathymetrical range of the
unicellular parasite is therefore from low-water mark to 1095 fathoms
in the northern seas ; and the temperature to which it is subject varies
 from 39°-7 to that of the surface water. But it is evident that it is the
most destructive when the pressure is least and the warmth of the sea is
greatest ; and therefore corals of g'enera such as Caryophyllia and Bala-
nophyllia, which are grown in aquaria, exhibit the parasite in per
fection.
    The range of the coral-parasites      in time, whilst admitting that there
may be and may have been more than one species, is very great.                 They
may   be  found  in  Upper-Silurian corals and in those of later date down to
the Tertiary times; and tubular excavations corresponding                   in their
appearance     may be found in        some    calcareous    fossils   of the Lower

     The parasitic growths which occur in the dense sclerenehyma of the
 Madreporaria are best seen by examining thin transverse and longitudinal
 sections of recently dead corals, and also by submitting whole or parts of
 specimens to the action of very dilute hydrochloric acid and thus obtaining
the remains of the organisms.               The upper parts of the corals, which are
covered with the soft tissues just before death, are comparatively free
from the ravages of the destructive tube-matters ; but the lower portions
of the corallum (which have, especially in species with endotheca, been long
uncovered by living tissue) are usually crowded with the borings of the
parasites.        Age and the length of time which has elapsed since the
removal of the corals from the sea have no influence on the preservation
of the canals bored within ; for they may be traced in fossil specimens,
and also in recent forms which have been half a century or more out of
the sea.       Moreover,     so lasting is the peculiar      organic basis on which the
parasite depends and in           and about which the granules and spicula of car
bonate of lime are deposited during coral-growth, that it may be extracted
more or less perfectly by weak acids from the oldest corallites which have
not undergone fossilization ; and in the instances of some mid-Tertiary
reef-building forms          I  found it to be distinguishable.         The most com
plete organic films are to be obtained from corals recently dead.                      The
continued       preservation of the vegetable cell-wall and its cytioplasm
appears to depend upon the same causes which determine that of
the organic film.            Sometimes the delicate tubular cell-wall may be
traced,    in old specimens decalcified, amidst the organic matter                 ; and  I
have noted its preservation in a Miocene coral If as a transparent                     and
probably mineralized structure ; but usually age appears to affect                      the
cell-wall, which is commonly found in a very indifferent condition                     and
more or less imperfect in old and dry specimens.                    In some fossils    the
spores, either oospores         or  conidia,   are found   in  a wonderful state of   pre-

serration ; their shape is perfect and they have been carbonized.                  More
over, the cytioplasm, so transparent or minutely granular in most recent
specimens, is to be recognized in old corals after they have been decalci
fied, and in fossil corals also, in the form of dark linear masses *.
    The method of entry of the parasites may be studied by examining the
outside of the coral, and then making thin sections, both transverse and
longitudinal and radial and perpendicular to the surface. In doing this the
nature of the minute thread-like green filaments in and on the coral should
be noted, and some specimens should be decalcified with them attached.
Perfect septa of recent corals, which have not become dry or which have
been lately soaked, may often be examined satisfactorily without sections
being made, and the network of ramifying tubes may be readily observed
in them     ;  for  a coral structure   well permeated by its natural medium is
much more transparent than the dry section which may be made from it.
     The sections of the hard structures may be examined after being placed
on slides (a small quantity of Canada balsam being used to cause them to
adhere) without any covering ; and the decalcified specimens, after being
washed in water, may be mounted in cells with glycerine.
    Eeflected light may be used satisfactorily with a low magnifying-power
in examining the dry section ; for it exhibits the remarkable silvery appear
ance of the bundles of minute filaments as they enter the theca of the
 coral, each filament being tubular and refractive.
    A magnifying-power of 400 diameters and an achromatic condenser are
the most useful appliances in examining transparent specimens and the
decalcified structures by transmitted light ; and the ability to see the long
tubes of very different calibres perfectly and well-defined, and distinguish
able from the spicula and their intermediate dark edges, is only possible
under a well-corrected object-glass.
     The following order of examination should be followed : — (1) The ex
amination       of the canals on the inside and in the septa of corals          ; (2) the
examination        of corresponding decalcified specimens ; (3) the examination
of the outer      structures,  so as to determine the mode of entry of the para
 sites, hard and decalcified specimens being used ; (4) observations should
be made       in and about those parts of corals where there is much organic
basis amidst the sclerenchyma and between the two laminae of a septum,
and the large size of the associated filaments noticed in solid and decal
cified specimens.
              IV.   The usual appearances    of Typical Parasitic Canals.
     On examining a thin dry section of a coral, made at a little distance
from the outside, or on looking through a transparent septum, the para-
    * The  process of carbonization in these delicate filaments and spores may be imitated
very significantly by placing some of them under the influence of slight heat and pres
sure.   A thin glass cover being put over a mass, and a spirit-lamp flame being held
beneath,  it will be found that blackening of some of the vegetable structures will ensue,
 without the application of much or continuous heat.

                  parasitic within recent Madreporaria.                    248
sitic borings, when present, usually resemble long dark lines with a lon
gitudinal and central transparent space.      The lines may branch here and
there, and usually at a considerable angle, and they often dip out of and
come within the focus of the microscope in their more or less long course.
They are singularly persistent as regards their calibre, which, always small,
is unchanged even in the branches and branchlets.        The commonest tubes
 (for such are these linear and longitudinally luminous appearances) are
about from 3^5- to g^Q inch in diameter.         They are simple excavations,
tubular in shape, and they have no special hard tubular wall. Each con
tains a vegetable filament, consisting of a tubular cell-wall and contents.
 They are cylindrical, and the breadth of the longitud1nal light line depends
upon the amount of vegetable material within the tube, upon the shape
of the perforation, and the nature of the surrounding hard structures.
When the cytioplasm of the filament which is within the continuous cell-
wall is simply glairy matter, the tubes are often difficult to distinguish, as
their whole lumen is transparent; but when the tubular cell-wall is
crowded with granules, the light does not pass at all, and the whole tube
appears as a dark line.      Between these conditions are many, and which
refer to the amounts of granular cytioplasm here and there in the same
tube.   The aggregation of granules determines the clearness of the lon
gitudinal light line, its loss here and there and its replacement by a kind of
monilifonn appearance of alternate light and shade (Plate 6. figs. 11-17).
    The parasitic canals, although they often branch out and ramify widely,
rarely inosculate with others.
    Another very common kind of canal is seen in the same situations, and
also throughout the whole coral ; it rarely pursues a straight course, but
bends and curves first on one side and then on the other, and branches,
either perfect or stunted, come off from the convexity of the curves,
usually directly tangential to them. The stunted branches are short and
linear, and give a very marked appearance to the canals, especially when
they terminate in a spherical end with or without a branch from it. One
of the numerous appearances is that of a straight canal bifurcating at right
angles, and the continuation of the original canal assuming the form of a
short stunted end just beyond the branching.          Sometimes this abrupt
termination is enlarged and, moreover, less globular in shape (Plate 6.
figs. 16-19).
    Swellings or enlargements of the calibre of the canals are not infre
quent, and they are usually impervious to light. It will be noticed in
most specimens of long canals that there is a peculiar wavy outline of
their path, the excavations not being absolutely in a right line but in a
series of minute and continuous curves.
   In some specimens the canals are very long ; in others they are short,
and every variety may be seen in the same section.         The direction which
they take, and often then• length, depend upon the minute structure of the
hard parts of the coral.

244                Prof. P. M. Duncan on Thallophytes
    The number of the canals varies also in different specimens, age and
bathymetrical range regulating the parasitic growth more or less ; they
are more common in the corals with lax textures like the Perforate than
in the Aporosa.
    In some of the inner parts of the hard deep-sea corals the canals are
few in number and are very long and narrow.             These interior canals
often give off, either from their whole surface, from parts of it, or only
from the swollen parts, long and very delicate tubes of from 1Q ^00 to
 —1 — inch in diameter ; but this appearance, which is very common in
such species as Ealanophyllia verrucaria and Caryaphyllia r/cnm, var.
borealis, is extremely rare in others (Plate 6. figs. 20-28).1
    When parts of corals corresponding to these interior sections and septa
are decalcified, a repetition of the appearances of the canals is seen in the
arrangement of their contents.       Each canal contains and has its interior
lined by a homogeneous transparent tubular cell-wall, and this contains
fluid and more or less solid contents here and there.
    The cell-wall is continuous through all the ramif1cations, and ends
abruptly in the stunted branches, and it lines the globular ends and all
the swellings.      It can be traced to give off the extremely delicate
tubules    to  the  minutest   ramifications  just noticed.     The cell-wall
 structure appears to lie against the sclerenchyma of the coral, but
not in a perfectly smooth canal ; for there are minute pits and rough
nesses on the inside of the canal, into which the tube itself does not fit
 (Plate 5. fig. 7, and Plate 7. figs. 56 & 57).
     Cross partitions in these tubular cells are very rarely seen ; and even
 in the majority of instances in which one might feel disposed to admit
 their occurrence, it is possible that the dissepiments are more apparent
 than real, being the result of light passing up between two closely
 approximated masses of granules (Plate 7. figs. 58-60).
     This coalescing of granules in masses, with spaces between them, is
 commonly seen ; and a moniliform appearance is also given to some
 minute tubes by a corresponding arrangement of the cytioplasm (figs.
 36 & 40).
     No starch can  be detected  with the usual tests ; but in many filaments
 there is evidently a bright sap-green tint, which is increased when light
 is transmitted through the refractive cytioplasm.
     Throughout, the resemblance of the canals and their filaments to a
 mycelium is very striking.
     Occasionally a long and wide canal, crammed with granular cytioplasm,
 passes far into the substance of the coral and may be seen with those just
 described.    It can be traced outwards to the surface of the coral, whence
 all the others come— some entering from without
                                                          directly, and others
 being branches of canals situated close to the outside or offshoots of what
 appear to be cavities filled with oospores
                                             (Plate 5. figs. 2-5).

  V.    The Parasitic Canals near the exterior and tl1eir Methods of entry :
                           Reproduetive Elements.
   The finer canals and those of all diameters except the very smallest may
be occasionally traced to the outside of the hard coral-structure, so that
the method of entry of the parasite can be determined.        This is greatly
assisted by decalcifying, after noting the character of the vegetation, which
is inseparable, except by tearing, from the wall of the specimen.
   Methods of entry. — 1. Earely a long typical canal may be seen opening
out through the coral-wall without any increase of calibre.
   2. Dark globular or short cylindrical-shaped cavities exist in the very
outside of the theca, and usually in such positions where the external
ornamentation or where the intercostal spaces admit of substances resting
readily. The cavities are large, and vary from -j-^y to 101U() inch in dia
meter ; their contents give a dark and opaque appearance to them, and
they give off many very fine short canals, canals of larger calibre which
pass more or less inwards, and the common long ramifying and non-
inosculating canals, there being one or many of these (Plate 5. figs. 1-7
& 10).
   3. Long, straight, and also curved canals of large calibre, -j-J-j- to ^-thi,
inch, usually constricted here and there, and in some instances having
hemispherical projections.    They sometimes pass far inwards (Plate 5.
fig. 8), and then their contents  are usually not so crowded as to prevent
light being transmitted ; and, indeed, in one specimen long portions of the
canal were deficient in granular, and were filled with homogeneous and
clear cytioplasm.    Sometimes the wide canal ends in a cul-de-sac ; but in
most instances smaller canals pass off irregularly from         it,   and even some
of the minutest.
   4. Irregular excavations occur on the surface of the coral of no great
depth, into which shallow cup-shaped depressions enter       and these are
                                                                 ;
either with sharp edges and give entry to typical tube or to many fine
                                             a
and short tubes in addition (fig. 10).
   There    in specimen of Flabellum laciniatum
            is   a                                     a tunnel reaching in
wards from one of these irregular excavations which has three more or
less globular enlargements on     it,
                                    the last being continuous with        very
                                                                            a
 short prolongation of the tube.
   5. Great numbers of very branching canals form        aclose network and
extend into the coral-structure, usually from the top of      costal or septal
                                                                a
ornament, in Balanopliyllia verrucaria for instance.    These glomeruli arise
from    depression
        a           in the outside   of the  coral, or from     decided large
                                                                 a
penetration, and     appears as
                     it          if a mass of oospores had collected therein
and germinated (Plate 5. jig. 1).
   Transverse sections, of necessity, cut through these masses of branching
 and anastomosing tubes at different angles and;      it   is
                                                    possible, therefore,
 by comparing numbers from the same coral to estimate the length of               a
 mass   and to recognize the typical canals which eventually arise from it.

246                     Prof. P. M. Duncan on Thallophytes
Longitudinal sections made parallel with the septal ends often exhibit
these glomeruli to perfection ; and under a low power they may be seen as
bright refractive tube-masses entering the coral at stated intervals. This
appearance is also presented in old corals in transverse sections (fig. 29).
   Observations                          of the Outer Parts. — After sub
                       on Decalcified Specimens
mitting sections or pieces of corals known to present the appearances just
enumerated and described to dilute hydrochloric acid until the hard parts
are destroyed and the organic basis-structure remains free, they should be
washed in distilled water ; and portions of the remaining matter may be
put up in thin cells with glycerine slightly diluted.
   The organic tissue is usually preserved in films, but occasionally, and
especially in the semiperf orate Balanophyllios, masses of it may be obtained**
conforming to the widely reticulate structure of the exterior of the coral.
It is transparent, almost homogeneous, and only granular here and there ;
but the paths of many fine parasitic filaments may be traced in it. Usually
the occurrence of larger canals determines the raggedness and breaking-
up of the organic film as a whole, as they have drilled through and along
it in all directions.
   Surrounding this tissue, and usually inseparable from            it,
                                                                are the vege
table parasites, now freed from their calcareous covering.
  Reproductive Elements. — Oospores, zoospores (non-ciliated), separate or
in masses, and the latter often within filaments, large confervoid-looking
filaments, large unicellular tubules crowded with dark cytioplasm, and
filaments of different lengths and diameters and with numerous or few
branches (all bearing   definite relation in point of size to the canals
                               a
whence they came) are readily seen and distinguished.
   The extremely fine canals,        - inch, do not

ments after decalcifying has been even very carefully done but        ;    I      have
been able to draw    few, which are all the more interesting because
                         a                                          they
are evidently extremely delicate utricles arising from the fusiform or
roundish zoospores which in this parasite, as in Saprolegnio?, germinate
before expulsion and before having reached their true zoospore or mobile
condition.        In   Plate   7.   fig. 55, zoospores are seen with filaments,   and
in fig.   61 separate spores are delineated.
   It   is   evident, after the examination of these filaments and their asso
ciated zoospores, that the cause       of the furry appearance of some larger
canals (Plate 6. figs. 21, 22, 23)      due to the development of correspond
                                          is
ing growths   from germinating cells within and their penetration of the
hard parts after having perforated the parent cell- wall and the dense struc
ture surrounding.
   Earely    minute tube may be seen passing off at right angles from one
              a
of the largest kind they are usually short, and do not appear to come
                         ;
from within, but to be offshoots of the parent cell-wall.
   Oospores are to be found closely adherent to the organic basis-structure
and amidst the branching thread-like tubes which are inseparably attached

                      parasitic within recent Madreporaria.                       247
  to the outside of the corals. They are also to be distinguished in fossils,
  crowding the cavities on the outside of the coral and some of the dissepi-
  mental spaces ; but      I  have failed to see them in corresponding       numbers
  and positions in recent forms.
       The oospores are large, and reach tlsloj inch in diameter. They are
   usually globular, but sometimes slightly lobular ; and in the latter case
   there is an evident internal grouping of granules which makes the mass
   look like a tetraspore.       They are dark in colour, and there is an external
   cell-wall.     Becoming fixed to the coral-wall, they sometimes flatten out
   and remain as circular black spots, a long filament being continuous with
   them and passing into the hard structure ; but as yet           I have not seen a
•
  'satisfactory    tubular prolongation    of a globular spore, except in the Silu
   rian Goniophyllwn, where they present beautiful tubes.
        VI.   The large confervoid-looking Filaments within      the Organic Basis.
        The septa of all Corals are in two longitudinal parts, which are sepa
    rated more or less perfectly in the median line. Hence transverse sec
    tions show in the septa of recent corals two cut'surfaces, each representing
    the top of a plate or lamina separated by a linear space or by a corre
    sponding organic tissue. In some species this intermediate structure
    reaches the surface at either the calicular or the costal edge of the septum.
    It is the relic of an involution of the dermal structures in and around
    which the sclerenchyma was deposited.           Moreover the organic structure
    thus intermediate really passes into the septal lamin1o in all directions,
    as can be proved by decalcifying them.        It would appear that the younger
    the coral is, the more distinct are these intermediate structures, and that
    with age they become more or less filled up with carbonate of lime, and
    may finally thus become obliterated.         Certain genera of rapidly growing
     forms appear to have the spaces more distinctly developed than others.
        These organic structures, coming to the surface of the coral, of course
     are, under favourable circumstances, soon attacked by penetrating para
     sites ; and the possibility of entry and of growth is so great in some instances,
    that wide layers of very confervoid-looking growths flourish, and present
     a very peculiar appearance under the microscope (Plate 7. figs. 33-35).
     The filaments forming one or more layers are nearly parallel, are large
     (from T^ffTj to -f1foy inch), rarely branched, and exhibit transverse mark
     ings, which are not true articulations, although the filament frequently
     breaks off at them.     The filaments are tubular, and have a distinct cell-
     wall, which is swollen out here and there ; and their cytioplasm is aggre
     gated more or less regularly, and in some places resembles conidia. Little
      processes project from the wall of the filament here and there, and
      are of about half the calibre of the parent tube.        In some filaments the
      cytioplasm is well separated from the wall, but usually it fills the whole
      tube.
         The jointed or articulate appearance is particularly visible when the    fila

  ments are only in the organic substance or are only surrounded by very thin
  films of carbonate of lime ; for when these large tubes penetrate the solid
  parts of the septa their diameter appears to be slightly less, their cell-wall
  ceases to be distinguishable,    and their contents are usually undiv1ded.
  But occasionally it appears that some burrow very successfully, and a
  long and wide tube results, which, in the majority of instances, is full of
  granular cytioplasm and rarely sufficiently empty to exhibit a central
  bright band of transmitted light.
      T/K Minute Filaments from the large Jcinds. — Although the broad fila
 ments found within the septa (especially of Caryophyllia claws, var.
 borealis, of Flabellum laciniatum, Edw. & H., and of Balanophyllia verru-
 caria) do not often bifurcate or ramify, yet they now and then give off
  long ramifying but not often anastomosing filaments of extreme tenuity.
  They are found in crowds iu some spots of the septa, and their diameter
 is about 20.000 inch, their general distribution and method of branching
 being a very exact counterpart of some of the larger growths already
  noticed as occurring so frequently in the other hard structures of corals.
     Usually these very fine canals retain the same diameter throughout
 their length.    In some corals they do not run a long course, but bend
 soon or even ramify abruptly, and in both cases pass into irregularly
 shaped cavities, emerging from them at the opposite end or absolutely
 terminating in them. These cavities are not unlike ill-developed bone-
 lacunae in appearance, and are frequently found in series on the periphery
 of masses of long, radiating, spicular structures.      Usually of very small
 size, and more or less irregular in shape or elongate, they sometimes are
 the cut ends or tubes of irregularly shaped parasitic borings which have
 been formed by another and larger filament.
     The resemblance of these fine canals to those which pass off so fre
 quently from the larger parasitic tubules in the thick wall or columella
 of the same or other species of coral is very exact, and probably they
have the same cause of origin.

                                                       obliquely. These rows
are formed of numbers of
                               large tubes placed side by side and in one or
more layers, and they occur in

the cytioplasm and partly to the existence in the canal-wall of minute
more or less perfect perforations. It is evident that the canals of these
large parasitic filaments may be correctly compared with the larger long
and short penetrations on the outside of the corals, which are the means
of entry of the bulk of the parasitic growths.
              VII.  MetJ1od  of Entry and Growth of the Parasite.
   It is evident from the examination of the sections of the outside of
corals that the parasite obtains entry below the living dermoid tissues of
the coral at spots where there is usually a crowd of competitors for
attachment, shelter, and also for boring.       Some minute cavities on the
outside, either the result of the operations of other organisms or the
product of the ornamentation of the coral, evidently and constantly con
tain masses like large conidia or oospores or shapeless masses of granules.
The boundaries of these cavities often relate to the intermediate spaces
between columns of spicula peculiar to the coral sclerenchyma ; the
organic basis of the hard structures comes in abundance close to the
outside of the theca in such positions, and it is the particular food of the
mycelium about to enter.       The tubule of the ingrowing parasite comes
from a conidium, oospore, or from a granular mass which probably is a
zoospore ; and the entry can only be by growth-force, and by the assimi
lation and removal of the organic basis, together with the dissolution
of the carbonate of lime of the coral by the development of carbonic
acid from the end of the tubule.          The existence of movement in the
cytioplasm   and possibly   in the cell-wall may be reasonably inferred ; and
this would tend to drive out fluid between the hard walls and the soft
internal tube. The solution appears, however, to be only active at the
growing end of the tubule ; and this growth is clearly often stopped by a
hard and solid mass of spicula, there being an insufficient quantity of the
organic film there for the nutrition and vis viva of the parasite. It is
evident that the entry must be made during the life of the corallite or
very shortly after death.
   There is one manner in which the parasite reaches the outside of the
coral and becomes fixed so as to penetrate, which is very remarkable and
also suggestive of the group of Thallophytes to which it belongs.
   Species of Bryopsis and Cladophora were living in the aquarium with
the Balanophyllice which were afterwards cut and, in some instances,
decalcified.   These reticulate and dark green forms grew upon the lower
parts of the corals, where the bright orange animal matter was no longer
existing ; and, as the corals grew weak in their nutrition and the tentacles
rarely expanded, there was an evident struggle between the vigorous plants
 and the dying Ccelenterate.     At last extremely fine filaments of Bryopsis
 appeared on the septa, and, as the thin films of living tissue grew smaller,
 they encroached more and more.
    I thought at first that the penetrating   parasite was either a
                                                                    " rootlet "

modified form of         it,
                   especially as  noted instances where the filaments of
                                         I
this plant had penetrated and perforated through projecting nodules and
ridges of the hard parts of the coral.
   The adhesion of the Bryopsis would give the delicate filament about
to penetrate     point tfappui.
                 a                 But on placing some tubes of Bryopsis
which had short filaments on their outsides, like those obtained by decal
cifying, in glycerine, this liquid speedily entered what appeared to be the
tubular structure of the plant, filled with dark green granules and
cytioplasm.    It filled the tube and made the cell-wall sufficiently trans
parent to show that there were no cell-contents, but numerous filaments
of an Achlyan-looking parasite. These had penetrated the Bryopsis, had
grown at the expense of its cytioplasm, and, finally, they were making
their way out through the wall and coming in contact with the coral.
I    have not been able to trace the mobile zoospores of the Achlyan or
the origin of parasitic filaments from them     but       evident that the

parasite exists on the outside as well as within the coral, and in the
tubular or vegetative form, and that the external filaments contain imma
ture zoospores which develop tubules which penetrate the parent wall,
impinge against the coral, and penetrate (Plate                  7.   fig. 55).
  VIII.     Structure      of   Reproductive Elements and Classijicatory            Position.
  The parasites, whether enclosed within their tubular perforations, which
assimilate to their shape, or rendered visible by the action of dilute acid,
or when free on the outside of the corals, present the appearance of the
mycelium of fungi of such orders as the Hyphomycetes and Physomycetes.
The filaments, whatever may be their diameter, are furnished with                               a
continuous cell-wall, and dissepiments are extremely rare, being only
recognized once or twice in hundreds of specimens.    The filaments rarely
inosculate, but branch either rarely or with great frequency.   There are
often secondary and other branchlets              ;    and the width of the calibre of the
whole tube    usually maintained.
                is
  It    very usual for branching to take place at right angles to the
       is
parent filament, and for  small rounded continuation of the last to form
                                  a
beyond the ramification.
   More or less globular or hemispherical swellings occur on the side 'of
the filament, and occasionally     swollen out into one or
                                        it   is               succession of     a
spherical enlargements.   The filaments terminate in culs-de-sac usually of
the same diameter as the rest of the tube
                                      but globular or irregular-shaped
                                                       ;
enlargements are by no means uncommon at their ends.     In all this the
parasite resembles many fungi. It  towards  the ends
                                                  is  of  some smaller
filaments    that   cell-dissepiment occurs, separating
                     a                                         terminal portion,
                                                                           a
only filled with  dark   cytioplasm, from the rest of the filament,  which often
contains    arefractive fluid with large granules here and there (Plate                         7.
figs. 49-61).

                  parasitic within recent Madreporaria.                         251
    The cell-contents of the filaments are : —
    1. Glairy transparent fluid ; this renders the canals often difficult of
distinction, and staining with carmine renders them usually visible.
    When removed from their canals the filaments, without any other cell-
contents than this glairy matter, usually show a very distinct cell-wall
with occasional refractive granules close to it in a few places. Usually
there is no colour present, but in some specimens the glairy fluid is
tinted a faint yet bright sap-green.
    2. Dark-coloured, brown or black, cytioplasm collects here and there
in the filaments, with interspaces where the clear fluid mentioned above
is present ; or the whole tube may be crammed with the structureless
and dark mass. This cytioplasm often aggregates in regular and consecu
tive portions of the tube, and the intervening colourless fluid gives the
appearance of cell-dissepiments.
    In most tubes the dark eytioplasm, small in amount, is situated close to
the cell-wall, and, there being some structureless clear fluid in the axis,
the filaments are refractive.
    Granules, excessively minute, form in the coloured cytioplasm, and
conidia gradually develop here and there by their aggregation in all parts
 of the filaments.     Small ovoid bodies with two or three minute dark
 molecules within them, besides a refractive fluid, are formed out of this
 cytioplasm within the filaments, and in the enlargements, and on them,
 and at their ends.
     No special terminal      cell  containing       these reproductive conidia and
 sporidia (zoospores imperfectly developed) appears to exist ; but probably
 the rounded and elongated ends of some filaments are the analogues of
 the terminal fructification-cells     of their congeners.
     The passage of extremely minute tubes from larger filaments, through
 whose walls they penetrate, and the presence of small ovoid bodies
 giving out minute filaments within the parent cell-tube, are very sug
 gestive phenomena.        They coincide remarkably with some parts of the
 life-cycle of the Saprolegnvn* ; and this resemblance is enhanced by the
 presence in the coral parasites of the terminal filaments cut off by a cell-
 diaphragm from the rest.          Moreover the globular endings to many of
 the filaments, or the spherical offshoots of many, greatly resemble some
 of the parts of species of Saprolegnice t. But whether a cell-wall cuts off
  the globular cell in the coral parasite,       I have not been able to determine ;
  and all the evidence   I  have is against this being the case.
     Outside the coral are long, branching, inosculating filaments, very
  rarely divided by partitions, and crammed here and there with zoospores,
  which often produce filaments when still within the cell-wall. Finally
  the oospores are large, spherical, and apparently arise from compound
  masses   or oogonia.      All these details connect the parasite with the

  Saprolegnice ; but a specific identity with S. ferax, Ktz., is wanting.          As
  in another work     I  have absorbed Saprolegnia in Achlya*,         I  propose   to
  classify this parasite in that genus, and to name it Achlya penetrans.
     But in thus provisionally classifying these parasites, their resemblance
  to the filamentous rootlets of Codium and to very delicate specimens of
  Bryopsis must not be forgotten.         The large confervoid-looking      filaments
 found within the interlaminar structure of the septa closely resemble
 those of the Bryopses which cling in a close reticulation to the outside of
 many corals.      -Bryopsis-filaments do penetrate projecting parts of the
 coral.    The tint of the clear cytioplasm of the parasite is often pale sap-
 green ; but there is no other evidence of the existence of chlorophyl in the
 contents of any of its very variously shaped filaments.           The Bryopsis is,
 of course, crowded with green granules, and doubtless chlorophyl is
 present.    The reticulate rootlets of Codium are often colourless, the
 larger and upright portions of the plant being green.           The probability of
 the presence of chlorophyl being determined by the action of light upon
 colourless or dark brown cytioplasm should therefore be considered
 before an arbitrary line is drawn between the Achlya and such very
 remarkable forms as those included in the genera mentioned above.
    From the results of my examination of Upper-Silurian corals and of
 Lower-Silurian arenaceous I'oraminifera, it is evident that a parasite
 closely resembling Achlya penetrans lived within them during those
remote ages.      Corresponding in shape with the Silurian form of parasite
 are others which are fossil within the corals of later ages.             The main
differences between the ancient and the modern forms consist in the
larger calibre of some of the filaments of the first, their long, often
 unbranching course, and the frequent development of C'onirfia-looking
bodies within them, and the spherical shape of the spores ; but it is quite
possible that these are not distinctions which are of a specific value.
    The modern coral-parasite is evidently the descendant, with slight or,
possibly, no modification, of those which flourished during successive world
wide changes in floras and external conditions.            Hence it would, in all
probability,   have  had  its life-cycle made   complicated, and a metamorphosis
involving vegetative and mobile stages has been superadded.                It is not
an assiniilator of putrescent or rotten animal matter, but of the nitro
genous and undecomposed organic basis of the coral; and in this it
resembles the organisms which destroy some living Diptera and other
aerial insecta.    Moreover this resemblance in function is possibly caused
by continuance     of  individuality ; and if this be true, it adds vastly to the
difficulty of placing the parasite in a philosophical scheme of classification.
Empusina (the fly-killer) certainly is an aerial form of Achlya ; and
Empusina muscce turns into Achlya prolifera.             It is, then, quite within
the range of possibility,      and,  indeed, it  is extremely probable, that the

   coral  Aehlya is the aquatic form of some aerial " fungus       which, like it,
   devours and increases upon organic matter.
      Some of the most perfectly developed Achlyee parasitic within corals
   were   obtained   from specimens of Balanophyllia verrucaria which came
   from the     Mediterranean, and which      I  kept for many mouths in an-
   aquarium.      The vegetation in the aquarium consisted of species of Cla-
   dophora and Bryopsis, and they grew not only on the rockwork, but also
   on the bases and sides of the corals which had been left uncovered during
   growth by the orange-coloured ectoderm.         As some of the corals became
   weak, their colours becoming pale, the organic or living tissue being
  thinner and the tentacles less expanded, the weed encroached and, finally,
   in one or two instances appeared on the septa, the living ectoderm having
   become abraded or dead on those spots.
      After a while a bulky " mould " spread over the whole calice of tha
   coral, and decomposition soon set in. This mould consisted of extremely
   crowded filaments with occasional dissepiments, and resembled a Botrytis.
   It lived in the water, and grew with great rapidity.
      This fact renders Berkeley's statement that Aehlya may be an aquatic
   form of Botrytis very probable ; and certainly the filaments of many of
   the internal parasites of the corals greatly resemble those of Peroiwspora.
   If, then, the coral-parasite follows the life-cycle of its congeners, it may
   live under different conditions in various organisms, and receive as many
   generic titles and specific names.
      Doubtless there is a motile stage as a freely swimming zoospore in one'
  of the life-cycles ; and in this this feeder on organic matter relates to its
  remote ancestry amongst the Amopboids.
      If  the arbitrary nature of all the classifications    of organisms which
  assume different shapes and habits under different external conditions be
  admitted, the position     I have assigned to the parasite as Aehlya penetrans
  appears    to be correct.    But it may be more philosophical to state that it
  belongs to a group of interchangeable forms, and that it is the marine and
  parasitic expression of the arbitrarily separated genera Aehlya, Snpro-
  Iegnia, Botrytit, Peronospora, and probably Bryopsis.

     There   is an interesting point about this Achlyan from the English
littoral zone, and that is its resemblance in tint to those of the deeper
sea.      The delicate sap-green of the homogeneous viscid granuleless
refractive cytioplasm is evident enough.            Many filaments, however, are
 colourless.
                                     X.  Summary.
      Quekett, Eose,      Wedl, Kolliker, and Moseley have noticed and
 described the borings of vegetable parasites in inolluscan shells, fish-
 scales, and corals ; but no special attention has been paid to the filaments
  penetrating the last-mentioned organisms.
   .  Corals from the littoral zone down to 1095 fathoms are frequently the
  seat  of the parasitic growth of two kinds of Acldya, whose horizontal
  range is from Davis Straits to the tropics and 15° S. lat.
      Fossil corals of Silurian age were also affected by closely allied,     if not
  specifically identical, growths.
      The method of investigation      is by making thin sections of the scleren-
  chyma,    and also  by  dissolving  out the carbonate of lime.
      The parasites are filamentous, and fill up the canals which they form ;
  they resemble a mycelium, and penetrate the coral, living upon the
  organic basis, and having their length, breadth, and straightness, or
  branchings, dependent on the peculiar nature of the arrangement of the
  spicula in the different species of the Madreporaria.          The entry is made
  from oospores, zoospores, and by the accidental contact of the parasites
  whilst perforating algfe situated on the wall of the coral ; and the pene
  tration and growth appear to be the combined results of the formation of
  a soluble bicarbonate of lime by the action of carbonic-acid gas evolved
  from the growing end of the tubular filament, of the pressure incident to
  growth, and of the movements of the cytioplasm and the cell-wall.
      The vegetative life of the parasites is accompanied by reproductive
  efforts within the corallite ; for the aggregation of granules within the
  viscid transparent cytioplasm can be detected, and their formation into
  large conidia and into small unciliated zoospores also.
      Following the peculiar physiological habit of the Saprolegnian group of
  Aehlycf, the reproductive elements germinate and produce either large or
   very small tubes which, after penetrating the parent cell-wall, get through
  the solid investment, and become indistinguishable            from the filaments
  derived from spores attached to the outside.
      The diameter of the largest canals containing filaments in which there
   is occasionally a doubtful dissepiment, and which flourish in the organic
   matter between the lamina) of a septum, is        t^   inch ; that of the typical
  and ordinary tubes is from -j-^ to              inch   and   the finest tubes are

    The canals and included filaments in some instances increase in calibre
 at certain spots, and even form globular expansions, but usually the same
 diameter is retained; the enlarged portions relate to the reproductive
 process.       The cell-wall of the filament is in close contact with the scleren-
 chyma of its canal.
    In a littoral species (Caryophyllia Smithi) the parasite is identical with
 Saprolegnia ferax, Ktz. ; but there is a manifest distinction between it
 and those of the other forms.                 The parasite of the littoral coral greatly
 resembles those of the shells of Mollusca and of the scales of fish.
 Although it is quite possible that all the parasites of the corals described
 may be referred to one species, their type being altered by the peculiar
 conditions surrounding them, still it is thought advisable to regard
them as members of two species. The classificatory position of the
parasites is in the midst of a group of forms which have complicated life-
cycles, such as the Achlyans (proper), the Saprolegnice, and Empusince
and Botritidae, and the filamentous false-root bearing genera Codium and
Bryopsis — forms which are more or less the expressions of one organism
under different conditions and age.

Appendix to a Communication on Thallophytes in Recent Corals.
     By Professor DUNCAN, P.R.S. &c. Received May 11, 1876.
    Since my essay on the Thallophytes            in Recent Corals has been sent to
the   Soyal Society,      I  have bsco1ne   aware, after the examination of so1n,
deep-sea corals (depth 363 fathoms), that thread-like dark green organ
isms of a vegetable nature ramify on thoir surface and penetrate it.
These filiform organisms are visible to the naked eye, and, when examined
under the microscope, are shown to be unicellular and to contain green
colouring-matter. They leave linear depressions on the surface of the
coral which correspond with them in diameter and outliue, and they
penetrate and dip under the surface sometimes to reappaar above.                   Their
course may often be traced in Amphihelia oculata just below the surface
without a high magnifying-power being used. From the stain which is
often seen on the coral on either side of these superficial filamentous
organisms, it would appear that they are sometimes broad; but the
excavating filaments do not appear to have been broader than they were
when they first penetrated or covered the corallum.                  I  have traced the
ramifications of these large filaments within the coral by dissolving in
weak hydrochloric acid, and they resemble those described by me.                    They
appear to be the same as those which are found in the interlamellar
 tissue of the septa, and the difference is only in size.
    Having had the opportunity of examining some large Foraminifera
 from the Indian Ocean,           I can testify to the presence in them of multi
 tudes of small Saprolegnia-lookiag filaments, but which, like those
 described by     Mr. Moseley, have green contents.
     Finally,   I have lately discovered that, besides the penetrating planta
  and spongida of corals, there are long tubular organisms which end in
  bag-like terminations          so greatly resembling      some of the calycles of
  Hydroida that they demand careful investigation.                      These filaments
  penetrate and also exist in the previous channels of Cliona.

XXVI. " On Volta's       Experiment of the Electricity produced by the
       contact and separation of different Metals."            By WARREN
      DE LA RUE, M.A., D.C.L., F.R.S., and HUGO W. MULLER,
       Ph.D., F.R.S.      Received   June  7, 1876.
    A short   time since Prof. Tyndall asked one of us to lend him our
Thomson-Becker quadrant electrometer for a lecture illustration of the
electricity developed by metallic    contact ; as the bifilar electrometer in
question had been purposely rendered much less sensitive than usual by
the wide separation of the suspension-threads, it was thought advisable
to test the instrument before sending it. This was done with a disk of
copper and a plate of zinc, each fastened to a stick of sealing-wax ; the
action even with this rough appliance was so great that it seemed desirable
to pursue the experiment further.
    With this object we had constructed a simple piece of mechanism by
Messrs. Elliott Brothers, which enables us to bring together and to
separate two disks, one of copper and the other of zinc, each 6 inches in
diameter, 400 times in a minute, and after each separation to make the
 zinc plate touch a spring attached to an insulated conductor ; moreover,
by meaus of cams, to make earth-connexion with either disk, or with both,
 previous to their being brought again into contact.
    20 cells of a rod of chloride-of-silver battery charged up on May 27
(part of the 8040 cells now in work) and in perfect action were connected
with the quadrant electrometer, so that the silver pole was in metallic con
tact with the quadrants to be charged, while the zinc pole and the other
two quadrants were connected to earth. The deflection (say to the left),
 three times repeated, was each time 95 divisions of the scale.
    When the contact-apparatus was now substituted for the battery, and
the insulated conductor of the zinc disk was connected with the same
 quadrant of the electrometer with which the silver pole of the battery had
 been connected, and the apparatus worked steadily so as to make 320 makes
and breaks of contact in a minute, then to make earth-connexion with
 the copper disk after each separation of the plates and during the time
 that the zinc was in metallic connexion with the electrometer, the deviation
 was to the left as before, and amounted to
                                         150 divisions of the scale.

   The copper disk, after its separation from the zinc, acts as a condenser
to the latter ; and as soon as the copper disk is connected automatically
with earth the bound electricity of the zinc is set free, and the needle of
the electrometer makes a sudden jump.         To observe this effect it is
necessary  to  work the apparatus slowly.
   When earth-connexion was made with the copper disk, and also sub
sequently with the zinc disk after the charge had been given off from                              it,
and before      new contact, no sensible difference was observed in the
                a
deflection of the electrometer.
    With an ordinary Elliott tangent-galvanometer,                      and indeed with one
twice as sensitive as those generally made, not the slightest deflection of
the needle was manifested       with, however,

deviation of the needle was obtained of 35 divisions in one direction and
35 divisions in the other, according as the zinc conductor was connected
with one or other end of the galvanometer and the other end with earth.

XXVIII. " On the Forms assumed by            Drops of Liquids falling ver-
       ticaDy on a horizontal Plate."          By A. M. WORTHINGTON.
       Communicated by 11. B. CLIFTON, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of
       Experimental Philosophy in the University of Oxford.              Re
       ceived May 17,    1876.
    My attention was first drawn to the subject of this paper    last spring,
bv Mr. H. F. Newall, of the Eugby School Natural-History        Society, who
sl1owed me the mark made by drops of water and mercury falling on a
smoked glass plate, the lampblack being swept away in concentric circles
and radial striae.   The patterns thus left were generally symmetrical and
beautiful, and varied with the height        of fall of the drop.     I  have
 since sought to investigate the cause of these appearances in Prof. Helm-
 holtz's laboratory in Berlin.
                                                  I
     My first care was to obtain a series of what will call " patterns " left
 by drops of various liquids, of various and measured diameters, falling
 from various and measured heights on horizontal smoked glass plates.
     I experimented with water and mercury as types of liquids which do
 not wet the lampblack, and with alcohol as a type of those which do.
 Drops of a constant size were obtained with water and alcohol by allow
 ing the liquid to fall, drop by drop, from the end of a vertical capillary
 tube.    In the case of mercury, a narrow vertical glass tube was provided
 at its upper end with a closed caoutchouc tube ; the pressure of the hand
 on this expelled the air, and a column of mercury, about 60 raillims. in
 length, was drawn up by suction to be expelled when required, drop by
 drop. The caoutchouc tube was found preferable to a hollow caoutchouc
 ball, as by wrapping it round the finger the internal volume could be
  diminished more gradually and regularly than with the ball, and thus the
 danger of expelling more than the normal-sized drops, whose diameter
  should depend only on the internal diameter of the tube, was diminished.
  This danger was, however, only completely avoided in later experiments
  by using an inclined glass tube, to the lower end of which an open caout
  chouc tube was attached, whose npper end could be raised or lowered at
  pleasure, and the mercury in the u-shaped tube thus formed brought to
  the level of the mouth of the glass tube, and made to fall over drop by
  drop. The drops thus obtained were found to be very constant in mag
  nitude. The diameters of the drops were calculated from the weight of
   10, 15, 20, or 30. The height of fall was taken as the distance between
  the plate and the bottom of the vertical or the lower edge of the inclined
   tube. The glass plates were smoked in the flame of a stearine candle : in
   cases where the height of fall was great, the adhesion of the smoke was
   increased by dipping the plate in petroleum or turpentine, and gently
   wiping before smoking.      I thus obtained a large number of patterns ;
   and examination of them showed the extreme difficulty of explaining

262                   Mr. A. M. Worthington        on the          [June 15,
from them alone the movements of the liquid which gave rise to them,
and the probable uselessness of seeking, while ignorant of these move
ments, a quantitative connexion in the case of any given liquid between
the size or number of rings of the pattern and the constants at my dis
posal, viz. the height of fall and diameter of the drop.
   I  preferred to endeavour, by means of the electric spark, to see the
forms through which the drop passed in the act of making its pattern.
In  this I have been   tolerably successful.
   The principle of the method was to make the drop fall in comparative
darkness on the plate, and at the moment of incidence itself to break an
electrical circuit, by which means a spark was produced in its neighbour
hood sufficiently bright to illuminate the drop and enable it to be seen in
the form which it had at that instant ; to see the consecutive stages it
was necessary to postpone the appearance of the spark for excessively
short but increasing intervals of time after the first contact of the drop.
The accompanying sketch of the apparatus will explain the details of the
method.
   A.  B (fig. 1) is a light wand of cedar wood with      a forked  end ;  it is
 13£  milluns.   long, 1 milliln, wide, 4 millims. deep.    The end B     bears
the glass plate on which the drop falls, the plate being kept in its place
 by a spring C, as shown in fig. 2. This wand is fixed on a horizontal

1876.]            Forms assumed by Drops of Liquids.                      263
axis  D D, made of a fine sewing-needle working in small triangular holes
cut  in the copper plates E, E ; underneath the wand and along it is bound
to it a platinum wire, one end of which is bent vertically under the axis,
and dips into mercury contained in a hollow in the deal board in which
E, E are fixed. The other end of the platinum wire rests, when the wand
is horizontal, on a strip of platinum foil F, wound round a copper wire
G G. A Bunsen's element (H) sends       a current through the coils K, K of
a relay, along the wire  LL   to the mercury in the little trough, along the
platinum wire, platinum foil, and wire G G back to H.
    The current which passes through the relay comes from 1 or 2 Bun-
sen's elements,  M, through the inducing spiral of a Euhmkorff's coil, N,
into the relay at 0, down the platinum wire P, which, when the iron bar
g<j   is held down by the magnet, dips into mercury contained in the
 U tube E E', so that the current passes out of the mercury at E' up a
thick immersed copper wire and back to the pile M.
    The plate of thin glass having been placed on B, the balance of the
wand is so adjusted, with a small counterpoise at the other end A, that
the slightest downward pressure, even the breath of the observer, is suf
ficient to raise the end A, and to break the connexion between the
platinum wire and foil. Accordingly the moment the drop touches the
plate, the current of the pile H is broken at F, the core of K K ceases
to be a magnet, and the point of the platinum wire P is pulled out of the
mercury at E by the force of the spring 8, and the strong primary spark
obtained at the surface of the mercury is sufficient to illuminate the drop
on the plate. The stage at which it was required to see the drop could
be altered at pleasure by altering the depth of immersion of the platinum
wire at E, which was done by plunging the connecting wire at E' more
or less deeply into the mercury in that branch of the U tube. This gave
a rough adjustment ; a finer was obtained by regulating by means of the
screw T the tension of the spring S, and so changing the rate of with
drawal of the platinum point.
    To secure the complete illumination of the drop and plate, the end E
of the U tube and the plate were surrounded with a white cardboard
box, with slits to allow of the motion of the wand, the wire P, and the
 admission of the drop, and open in front, so that the plate could be seen.
 Complete darkness was found by no means necessary for the experiments ;
light just sufficient to allow the plate to be seen and the eye easily di
 rected on it was found the most convenient.    The results   I have obtained
 have been with mercury     and   milk.  Mercury,  from   its  high reflecting
 power, is easy to see ; water, from its transparency, even when coloured
 with indigo, very difficult to see; and     I substituted milk, which has
 the advantages of appearing white on a black ground, of being semi-
 transparent, and of showing blue or darkish where it is spread thinly
over the black plate, and thus allowing an estimate to be made of the
relative thickness of the drop in various places, aud especially the advan

  264                    Mr. A. M. Worthiugton       on the           [June    15,
  tage of diffusing light through its mass. The mercury, o1l the contrary,
  allows no light to penetrate its interior, and for this reason the form of
  the drop is less easy to ascertain ; for the contrast between the brightly
  illuminated raised or convex parts and the parts that are hollowed or in
  shadow is so great that it is often uncertain whether the dark portion of
  the figure is black plate or unilluminated mercury.        'This was at first a
  serious cause of error, as in some earlier arrangements which      I tried, the
  light of the spark was reflected laterally from some distance by means of
 a concave     mirror, when the deception was very great, as will be seen by
  reference to fig. lla, Set 6.        By means of the cardboard box, how
 ever, from the surface of which light was diffused from all directions
 on the plate, and by having the spark close to the plate,       I became quite
 certain of the figures. Owing to the appreciable amount of time required
 for the demagnetization of the electromagnet,        I was not able to obtain
 figures of the first portion of the spreading out of the drop.
      Owing also to accidental causes difficult of control, such as the varia
 tions of the contact at F, the variations of the pressure with which the
 iron bar of the relay was initially pressed down by hand on the ends of
 the electromagnet, and to the oxidation and irregularities of the surface
 of the mercury at E, the time of appearance of the spark after the first
 contact of the drop varied slightly, so that the stages seen with a given
 depth of immersion of the wire P and a given tension of the spring were
 not always the same, but varied between narrow limits. But a little
judgment enables the observer to tell whether the stage seen is before or
after the mean stage most frequently seen with that arrangement of
level of mercury and velocity of withdrawal of the platinum wire.
      Sets 1, 2, and 4 are figures of milk ;
      Sets 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 of mercury.
     Explanatory notes are attached where necessary.
      The figures suggest a few general observations.
      The existence of the radial arms is a deviation from perfect symmetry
of figure round the vertical axis ; and some slight initial disturbance of
symmetry must be required to determine the formation of arms.
      Such a disturbing cause is always at hand in the irregularities of the
surface of the glass or of the layer of smoke, which allow the drop to
spread with less frictional resistance in one direction than in another,
and also in the oscillations of the drop about its mean figure while it
falls through the air. The occurrence of such a figure as            III,  Set 6,
confirms     this view,  as it is an approximation to perfect symmetry when
the disturbing cause has been probably very small.
     The fact, too, that a very slight dirtiness of the plate was sufficient to
cause great irregularities of figure is confirmative of this, as is also the
fact that the tendency to form radial arms increases with the height
of fall.
     In  seeking the explanation     of the fact that the arms which are first

                        '
    M. Plateau, in his    Statique expeYimentale des Liquides,' has shown
that a cylinder of mercury lying on a horizontal plate breaks into drops,
whose number depends on the friction between the liquid and the plate.
    The pressure of the convex surface at the end of the cylinder will tend
to drive the liquid into' the cylinder and diminish its length while in
creasing its thickness, but only so long as the sum of the reciprocals of
the principal radii of curvature at any point of the convexity are greater
than the reciprocal of the radius of the cylinder.
                                    SET 4.
   This may, however, always be the case, for the thickness and radius
of the cylinder is continually increased by the
                                                   supply of liquid from the

   Thus   as the centre contracts the arm increases in length.
   This increase in length causes, after a certain point, a tendency to
split into drops. This tendency is counteracted by the thickening of
the cylinder from the injection of liquid at the inner end.

When the thickening does not keep pace with the lengthening of the
cylinder, drops will split off. That in such case the arras split at the

  It   perhaps worthy of remark that the earliest stage
       is                                               was able to

see was nearly the maximum spread for every height of fall, for both
milk and mercury.   As my adjustment for seeing the first stage was
nearly the same in all cases,    I   have reason to assume that the time which
elapsed between the contact of the drop and the appearance of the spark
was nearly the same.    Hence the conclusion that the drop requires the
same time to reach its maximum spread whatever the diameter of the
spread   ;                                     follows the law of

elastic force.   The limits of error are, however,  here wide.
   The difficulty of counting the arms was considerable. Most frequently
there were      sometimes
               6,            or 12, sometimes more and am inclined to

think their number was always even.
   The number of the drops left from the first spreading out in the case
of higher falls was hard to count. In the case of mercury on unsmoked
glass, these were left on the plate in    more or less complete circle

                                                  SET 4.
  Milk on      smoked    glass.    Diara. of drop 6'012 millims.    Height of fall 200 millims.
      I.   Very much spread out ; arms bended, tending to split into rows of drops.
    II«    is an alternative phase sometimes seen instead of          II ; the centre having been
                torn, the arms contract into the ring thus formed.
                    Falling from a height of 280 millims. on a smoked glass plate, the same
                sized drop of milk went through phases similar to those of mercury from
                 150 millims. (see Set 8).
                    The succeeding figures represent the forms assumed by a drop of mer
                cury 4'05 millims. in diameter falling on smoked (sometimes on unsu1oked)
                glass from the heights staled.
                    The first height of fall was 34 millims.
                    The phases in this case were very similar to those of milk falling from
                50 millims. (Set 2), the main difference being that the arms were not so
                long and did not split off into drops, while the centre was deeply hollowed
                as in fig. IV. Set 2 ; after which the central part filled up and rose before
                the arms oatue in, as in the case of milk.
                    From a height of CO millims. on unsmoked glass the consecutive phases
                were very similar to those of 34 millims. fall.        On smoked glass, however,
                the arms were longer, and the resemblance to the forms seen in the case of
                milk was closer than on unsmoked glass.
                    An alternative course was often taken by the drop, of which the phases
                are given on
                                                  SET5.
       I.  The thickness of the central portion is very slight.
     II.   The thickness diminishes, till the central membrane of liquid tears in the centre
                 and flows to the circumference ; or more frequently the tearing takes
                 place under the edge of the outer band, leaving such forms as        III, IV, & y
                 where the white represents the mercury and the black the plate. After
                 this the succeeding stages were as in VI and
  VII,     where the arms contract into the ring, which splits into drops, as in              VIII
                 These run together. The final stages are like those of milk.

       I.  Slight waves on the central patch.
     II.   This, when illuminated by reflection from a concave mirror at the side, looked
                 like two concentric circles of drops, showing probably that the raised cir
                 cular band A A seen in the section II« was lobed where the arms joined it.
  III.     Sometimes the contour was almost circular, being very slightly lobed.
                    If the plate was in the least dirty, irregular forms were seen, as in IV«
                 IV/3, & V« ; otherwise the final stages were very similar to those of milk
                such deviations as V and VI being seen.

                  plate, indicating that the arms from which the small drops split, split a
                  second time, while the rest did not.   The figures were of much the same
                  type as when the fall was 100 millims.

                    From 255 millims. on unsmoked glass the forms were much the same as

                                      Smoked glass.    250 millims.
                    The phases were generally the same as from 150 millims. (Set 8), with
                 the variations of figs.I  &II.
                    Later, the whole mass of central arms, or thin layer of liquid, split up
                 into fine drops, which rose in a splutter from the plate.
 It is  to be observed that while on unsmoked glass the type of forms hardly changes
while the  fall increases from 100 to 250 millims., the eame increase of fall on smoked
glass is accompanied by very marked alterations in the behaviour of the drop, and that
generally the wider spreading out of the drop on smoked glass indicates much less
friction than on unsmoked.

 "On      the Effect of Heat on the Chloride, Bromide, and Iodide
       of Silver."      By G. F. Rodwell, F.R.A.S., F.C.S., Science
       Master in Marlborough College.            Communicated by Professor
       Tyndall, F.R.S. Received March 10, 1876*.
    In  a  former paper 1 1 endeavoured to prove that the iodide of silver is
capable of existing in three allotropic modifications, that it possesses a
point of maximum density at or about 116° C, and that if a mass of the
molten iodide be allowed to cool the following effects may be observed : —
(a)   At   the moment of solidification a very considerable contraction takes
place ; (/3) the solid on further cooling undergoes slight and regular con
traction, after the manner of solid bodies in general, until (y) at or about

               the Chloride, Bromide, and Iodide          of Silver.            281
116° C.  it undergoes sudden and violent expansion, passing from the amor
phous into the crystalline condition ; (<i) after undergoing this expansion
the mass, on further cooling, undergoes slight expansion, and (e) the
coefficient of contraction diminishes as the temperature decreases (or
otherwise expressed, the coefficient of contraction augments with the
temperature).       The following experiments were made in order to examine
these effects more minutely, to determine the coefficients of contraction
and expansion of the iodide, and to determine the coefficients of expan
sion of the chloride and bromide of silver between as great extremes of
temperature     as should be    found practicable.
    1. Apparatus employed      for the determination  of cocfficients of expansion
                                     or contraction.
     As mercury attacks the iodide of silver at      a temperature     far below its
 boiling-point, and as the beautiful optical method of Fizeau does not
 seem to be capable of application at high temperatures (his own experi
 ments in no case embracing a higher temperature than 100° C.), it was
 considered advisable to seek for some special method by means of which
 the degree of expansion and contraction of the iodide could be accurately
 determined.      I  finally decided to enormously multiply a small motion by
 a system of levers, to cause short bars of the iodide, chloride, and
 bromide to act on these levers while being heated between various tem
 peratures, and to measure the dilatation by a micrometer-screw.
     The following apparatus was devised in order to carry out this idea.
 The box A, fig. 1, p. 282 (drawn to scale), contains the levers, shown
 in plan and section in figs. 2 and 3 ; B is an index attached to the
 axis X, which is in connexion with the final lever, B moving through
 180° of arc over the graduated half-circle C. D is a sliding bar, one
 end of which bears upon the .first lever, while the other is in
 contact with a short rod of glass E, which moves freely, but water
  tight, in a metal stuffing-box.         The rod of glass thus enters a brass
 trough F, which can be filled with water or melted paraffine, and which
 can be heated by means of a Bunsen's burner.            The water or paraffine is
  allowed to run off at the end of an experiment by the tap G.                H is a
 rod of glass similar to E, which moves freely but water-tight in the
  metal stuffing-box I. Between E and H is placed the rod of substance
  the expansion or contraction of which we desire to determine.              The end
  of H external to the trough F rests against the end of the micrometer-
  screw K, which is tipped with agate, and which moves steadily in the
  support L firmly clamped to the iron bar M, which is screwed to the
  base of the instrument N.           The head of the micrometer-screw, O, is
  graduated into 250 divisions, and is figured to 500 ; the graduations are
  read off against the cross arm P. A plan of the levers is shown in fig. 2,
   where D (the end of which is seen in fig. 1) is the movable bar, sliding
  in a socket E and bearing against the first lever S, which is pivoted at T.

  282           Mr. G. F. Rodwell         on the Effect of Heat on
  The lever 8    bears   against a second lever U, pivoted at V.       From the
  opposite extremity of U a very fine steel chain W, such as is employed
 in watches,   passes to a   vertical axis X, which carries the needle B. The
 needle is brought back to zero by the pressure of the spring T against
 the lever U, and also by a fine steel mainspring Z, which is fixed to the
 vertical  axis X.     a is a small pin to stop the lever U as soon as the
 needle   has passed   the  zero-point by a few degrees.
    The levers are shown in section in fig. 3 ; the lettering is the same
throughout.      The framework       6 is of brass, as are also the levers ;  the
pivots are    of steel.    Pieces of glass, cc, are let into the levers at the
bearing points to diminish the friction. The micrometer has threads -i-J^
of an inch apart ; hence one turn of the micrometer-head is equal to
-i^ of an     1nch, and the movement of the head through one division is
equal   to 3-3-^5- of an inch ; but it is quite easy to read to half a division,
and hence to j^,^^ of an inch.           The rods inserted between the micro
meter and the lever are six inches long, and from one quarter to half an
inch in diameter ; they rest on light glass rollers placed in the trough F.
A rod of the substance to be examined is inserted between E and H ;

               the Chloride, Bromide, and Iodide       of Silver,          283
perfect continuity of the parts is established, and the micrometer-head is
turned until the needle stands at zero ; the reading on the micrometer ia
registered, and the head is then turned until the index B has passed to
180° of arc ; by again reading the micrometer, the relation between the
micrometric divisions and the divisions on the scale of C is established.
By this means it was found that          a movement of '0035 inch in the
micrometer moves the index through 180° of arc.          Now since the index
is six inches long, in moving through half a circle its extremity passes
over 18-84 inches, and this motion is produced by a movement of '0035
inch ; hence the levers multiply any motion communicated to them 5382
times.    The precise value of this index-scale having been ascertained, the
determination of the expansion of a body by heat becomes an easy matter,
provided that we are careful to secure perfect rigidity in all the fixed
parts of the apparatus (by no means an easy task), and are further
careful to prevent the conduction of heat from the short glass rods (E and
H) to the interior of the apparatus. The coefficient of expansion of E
and H must also be ascertained, and allowed for in all determinations.
If, on the other hand, we wish to determine the contraction of a body,
the index is pushed up to 180° of arc by means of the micrometer-screw,
and is pushed back to zero as the bar contracts by the spring T and the
helical mainspring Z.     The precise value of the return movement must
be, of course, ascertained by means of the micrometer-head.       It is obvious
that in moving from 0° to 180° of arc the spring T acts against the
motion of the expanding body ; while in moving from 180° to 0° it moves
with the motion of the contracting body.
    A bar of fine homogeneous silver was used in order to test the delicacy
of the apparatus.    It was placed between the short glass rods (E and H),
and   cold  water  was  poured into the trough.     The temperature was in
dicated by two thermometers reading well together, placed near the
opposite extremities of the silver bar, and the needle was brought to zero.
The water was then heated, being constantly stirred to produce uni
 formity of temperature throughout the whole mass, until the needle had
 been forced round to 180° of arc. The number of degrees of heat being
 read off, showed the heat necessary to produce a certain known expansion,
 and from this the coefficient of expansion was easily ascertained.          Six
 results gave 10°C., 10°, 9°, 10°, 10°, 9°-5.   The coefficient deduced from
 the mean of the determinations     was for 1° C.
                                 '0000193083.
 Now Lavoisier gives it   as -00001910  ; Daniell -00001951 ; Fizeau (deter
 mined bv the same method as that    which  he applied to the iodide, chloride,
 and bromide of silver) gives -00001921 ; and more recently Matthiessen
 (Phil. Trans. I866) found it to be -000019436.

   'Rods of other metals gave the following results        : —

   It is thus abundantly evident that the apparatus is capable of very con
siderable accuracy, especially when we remember that we are dealing
with rods of metal only six inches long.        I venture to think that such an
apparatus would prove a useful adjunct to a Physical Laboratory ; for it
would not only afford a means of determining coeff1cients of expansion
with rapidity and accuracy, but it might be used for determining thick
nesses in thousandths and ten-thousandths              of an inch.        For if the
substance were introduced between the agate face of the micrometer-
screw and the glass rod H, and if the index were then driven round to a
certain point (say 20° of arc), and BO with the other substances tested, an
exact uniformity of pressure of the face of the screw on the substance
would be secured, and minute thicknesses might thus be measured with
accuracy.
   In  constructing such an apparatus, extreme rigidity of the fixed parts
is a main necessity ; the base should be of thick marble, and the micro
meter-screw support should be deeply let into it and firmly secured.
Massive supports, apparently fixed with the utmost firmness, sometimes
yield with surprising readiness to the extent of one five-hundredth of an
inch. The elasticity of the metal sometimes causes great inconveniences.
The levers must be firm and strong, but not unnecessarily heavy ; they
should work very smoothly.         Agate should be let into the brass at the
points  of  contact.   Care   should    be taken to avoid any transference of
heat from the hot trough to other parts of the apparatus.             By the use of
a paraffine  of  high boiling-point, the temperature of a bar submitted to
heat iu the trough (F) can be raised to 300° C. Under such circum
stances great care is requisite to avoid heat from being radiated or other
wise communicated to other parts of the apparatus.
   2. Means   enjoyed   to determine    the expansion   in passing from    the solid
                             to the  liquid condition.
    The determination   of the amount of expansion which iodide, chloride,
and bromide undergo in passing from the solid to the liquid condition
was effected in the following manner: — A conical tube of platinum
 weighing    44-844 grammes was carefully filled with mercury at a
 known temperature.        It contained 105-43 grammes of mercury. It
 was then filled with the substance under examination at its melting

                  the Chloride, Bromide, and           Iodide of Silver.          285
point ; the substance was allowed to solidify, and the whole was weighed-
The cavity due to the contraction of the mass in solidifying was
then filled with mercury to the level of the mouth of the conical tube,
and was weighed.           Then, knowing the capacity of the tube, the specific
gravity     of  mercury and of the substance under examination, the tem
perature of the fusing-point, and the coefficient of expansion of the
platinum cone, we have all the data requisite for the determination.
The real difficulty is the determination of temperatures above the boiling-
point of mercury ; and until a trustworthy method of general application
has been devised, such determinations                must be regarded as approxi
mations.       The expressions " below        a red heat,"
                                                             " a dull red heat," &c.
are   still common in text-books and in memoirs ; but the very definitions
of what is meant by a " dull red heat " vary, as also do the temperatures
assigned to it by different writers.
                      3. Effects  of Heat  on the   Iodide of Silver.
    Iodide of silver, carefully prepared by precipitating the nitrate by
means of iodide of potassium and subsequent drying*, was fused in a
porcelain crucible and cast in warm tubes of glass.               The cylinders thus
cast were from | to | an inch diameter ; they were levelled at the end
by a fine steel saw, and were reduced to 6 inches in length.              Every pre
caution was adopted in order to secure homogeneity ; but the rifts, both
longitudinal and horizontal, produced during the sudden expansion of
the substance in passing from the amorphous to the crystalline condition
sometimes rendered the bar so weak and brittle that it had to be recast.
I have before      pointed out that as a bar of molten iodide cools it contracts
regularly to its point of maximum density, then expands considerably
just below the temperature of maximum density, passing simultaneously
into its crystalline condition, and finally continues to slightly expand as
the temperature falls. Its behaviour in the expansion-apparatus                   may
consequently be readily inferred ; and experiment justified the inference.
    A bar of the iodide was placed between the movable glass rods (E H,
fig. 1), resting on glass rollers; water was placed in the trough, and the
thermometers were put in their places. The index was placed up to 180°
of arc, and the water was heated. As the temperature rose the needle
gradually returned towards zero as the bar contracted ; and the amount
of contraction was measured and compared with the range of tempera
ture. When the needle reached zero, the bar was allowed to cool, and
the needle now moved forward,              indicating expansion.      The water was
now replaced by a paraffine of high boiling-point, and the heating was
recommenced.           The index (at 180° of arc) began to retreat as before,
showing that the bar was contracting              ;  as 140° C. was approached     the

quantity    of the  iodide, bromide, and chloride prepared at South Kensington, and lo

286            Mr. G. F. Rodwell                     on the   Effect of Heat on
contraction   became           more rapid; and between 142° and 145°-5 C. very
rapid contraction         took    place, and  the temperature was maintained as
steady as possible.              A slight fall of the temperature below 142° C.
caused the needle to stop, and the contraction was resumed as soon as
the temperature again rose above that point. When the temperature
was   kept steadily between 142° and 145°'5 C., the contraction after
a while ceased at the latter temperature ; and on raising the temperature
the mass now expanded slowly up to 300° C., the limit of the apparatus,
as beyond this the paraffine ignited.  In cooling these effects were
exactly reversed : the index moved from 180° of arc to zero between 300°
and 142° C., that        is,
                      the mass contracted like an ordinary solid then at            ;
142° a considerable expansion occurred, after which the mass slowly ex
panded as the temperature fell.

cubical contraction of iodide of silver between   70° C. and — 10° C.,
                                                                     -f-

expansion-apparatus were higher than  this   but as M .Fizeau's

undoubtedly one of great accuracy, and as, moreover, the determinations
of the expansion of silver, copper, lead, zinc, and of the chloride and
bromide of silver made     means of the expansion-apparatus agree
                                    by                                                      very

ferred to adopt his coefficient for temperatures between — 10° C.                            and
+   70° C.   Between 70° C. and 142° C., at which temperature the           con
siderable expansion        occurs, the coefficient was found to be '00001749;
the determination        is apt to be vitiated by the sudden increase in the co
efficient as the temperature of rapid contraction  approached.   Between
                                                                   is
142° C. and 145°-5 C. the mass contracts to the extent of -004500                             ;
probably this contraction occurs at one precise temperature within even s
less range than 3°-5 C.         ;   but   it   is   practically impossible to ensure an abso
lutely uniform temperature in       bar of iodide in

under the conditions of the experiment.   Between 145°'5 C. and 300° C.
the coefficient was found to be -00002844.     The iodide fuses at   tem                a
perature which    Iestimate at 450° C. By fusion in the platinum cone,
and the application of the method described above, the volume in the
liquid state at 450° C. was found to exceed the volume at 450° C. in the
solid state to the extent of -046331 on volume at 450° C. in the solid
state = 1-008659.     On raising the temperature of the platinum cone
and its contents to a temperature estimated at 750° C.          cherry-red     (a
heat visible in broad daylight), the molten iodide did not appear to
expand more than the platinum       the coefficient between 450° C. and
                                                    ;
750° C. has been hence taken as that of platinum as an approxi
mation.    As no method could be devised for determining the coefficient
of expansion between 300° C. and 450° C., the same coefficient as that

                     the Chloride, Bromide, and        Iodide of Silver.              287
   determined        for the range between 145°-5 C. and 300° C. has been
   adopted.        Finally, as to the coefficient of contraction between — 10° C.
   and   —    60° C.      Fizeau asserts that he believes the point of maximum
   volume or minimum density of the solid iodide to be at — 60° C.                     He
   does not give the coefficient below — 10° C., and presumably could not
   apply his method to so low a temperature as — 60° C.                     Neither did
   an attempt         with solid carbonic acid and ether prove satisfactory in
   the expansion-apparatus.               Hence, as an approximation,        the coeffi
  cient      has   been taken      as   -00000104,  calculated   on the presumption
   that    the    coefficient   between —60° and —10°            C. decreases     in the
   same    ratio    as   the coefficient between + 70° C. and 142° C. increases,
  in reference in each case to the coefficient for temperatures                       be
  tween — 10° C. and + 70° C. Summarizing the above results, we obtain
  the following as an approximate statement of the changes in volume
  undergone by a mass of iodide of silver in cooling down from 750° C. to
   —60° C.        More than this we fear we cannot say until high temperatures
  can be satisfactorily measured, and until certain experimental difficulties
  in connexion with the determinations can be overcome.

     In   my former paper         I  mentioned 116° C. as the temperature at or
 about    which the iodide undergoes its sudden change of volume, and at
 which it possesses its maximum density.             But this assertion was founded
 on the fact that a rod of iodide in cooling in a glass tube breaks the tube
at or about that temperature.               It is obvious, however, that the tube
would yield before breaking ; and the expansion-apparatus clearly proved
that the change takes place at a higher temperature — a temperature at
or very near to 142° C.            At this temperature, both in cooling and heat
ing,    the     index reversed       its motion.   Wernicke      (Pogg. Ann. cxliii.
p. 560) mentions the fact that prisms of fused iodide of silver when
cooled to 138° C. exhibit a sudden alteration of colour and transparency.
    Molten iodide solidifies to a perfectly transparent, very flexible claret-
coloured solid         ; as it cools it becomes    amber-coloured, and just above
142° C.      it becomes pale yellow ; at 142° C. the change from the amorphous
to the     crystalline condition takes place, the body simultaneously becom
ing crystalline and opaque and undergoing considerable expansion.                     It
now exists as a brittle pale green solid.             On heating this to a tempe
 rature of 300° C. it recovers some of its plasticity, and may again be
                                                                       x2

288            Mr. G. F. Rod-well    on tfte Effect of Heal on
bent, but it cannot be made transparent without re-fusing. By rapidly
casting a bar and introducing it into the trough of the expansion-ap
paratus filled with paraffine above 200° C., the expansion of the trans
parent amorphous iodide was determined, and this gave -00001206.
Wernicke considers that at a high temperature "part of the iodine is
separated from its combination with the silver, and is absorbed by the
remaining substance in the liquid state, for the spectrum, like that of
solid and liquid iodine, contains no blue or violet light. In the normal
state, below 138° C., silver iodide gives a spectrum less bright, but twice
as long, and particularly developed in the blue-violet portion."
    It is well known that red, transparent, plastic sulphur in becoming
yellow, opaque, and crystalline gives out a good deal of heat. Trans
parent plastic iodide of silver was examined at the moment of change,
and was found to give out heat.      A mass of the plastic iodide at 200° C.
was placed   in paraffine at 200° C., and the cooling was observed.    When
the iodide began to change from the amorphous to the crystalline con
dition the rate of cooling (previously determined) was far less rapid,
proving clearly that heat was given out.
    The iodide appeared to become more brittle with successive fusions ;
but this did not seem to materially affect its specific gravity. Thus a
specimen which had been many times fused gave a sp. gr. of 5*675,
while another specimen after a single fusion gave 5*66.           Taking the
former as the true sp. gr., we find that the sp. gr. at the maximum
density (142° C.) will be 5-771, and at the minimum density (— 60° C.)
5-673 ; while the sp. gr. of the molten iodide at 450° C. will be 5-522.
    It was noticed that the platinum cone was altered in capacity when
fused iodide of silver was allowed to cool in it ; in fact it became more
 or less deformed.    This was found to be due to the considerable expan
sive force exercised by the iodide in expanding.       We did not succeed in
breaking an iron bottle by this means, but a thick porcelain tube was
easily broken by the passage of the iodide from the amorphous to the
 crystalline condition.
    An attempt to determine the relative conductivities of the iodide,
 bromide, and chloride of silver was made in the following manner : —
 Homogeneous rods of each of these substances were taken in weights
 corresponding to their specific heats. Any one rod whose conductivity
 was to be determined was fixed in the bottom of a copper trough, the
 projecting end dipped into a small reservoir of mercury in contact with a
 delicate thermopile and galvanometer.        Great care was taken to sur
 round every thing with non-conductors of heat, and to insulate the rod
 from contact with the copper trough.        Paraffine at 300° C. was poured
 into the trough, and thus came into contact with the exposed end of the
 bar. The time which elapsed before the movement of the galvanometer
 took place was noted in seconds. The results were not satisfactorv ; but
 they appeared to prove that the bromide of silver conducts heat better

                  the Chloride, Bromide, and        Iodide of Silver.           289
   than the chloride, and more than twice as well as the iodide.        We should
   naturally expect the iodide from its comparatively loose crystalline nature
   to conduct heat less well than either the bromide or chloride.
                   4. Effects  of Heat  on the Bromide  of Silver.
      Precipitated bromide of silver was fused, and cast in warm glass
   tubes.   The mass when warm was found to be somewhat tenacious ; the
   surface of the fused rod was smooth and brilliant, the fracture crystal
  line. Eepeated fusion seemed to render the substance more crystalline.
  Although crystalline the substance was very compact, and altogether un
  like the crystalline condition of the iodide ; the rod contracted a good
  deal in cooling, and easily came out of the tube in which it was fused.
  Bods 6 inches long by | inch diameter had their ends levelled by means
  of a fine steel saw, and were placed in the expansion-apparatus, and
  tested as described in the case of the iodide bars.            The coefficient of
 cubical expansion for 1° C. was found to be
                                       '00010500.
     Fizeau by his optical method found the coefficient to be '000104061.
 The coefficient increases with the temperature, at least to the extent of
 '000004 for each 100° C. increase of range. The expansion is very con
 siderable in passing from the solid to the liquid condition, and between
                I
 380° (which believe to be near its melting-point) and a temperature esti
 mated at 750° C.        The volume at — 60° C. has been taken as unity in
 order for better comparison with the iodide in the accompanying Curve
 Table (p. 290), and an addition of -000004 to the coefficient has been made
 for each 100°C. of temperature.           Then if we suppose a molten mass of
 bromide of silver to be cooling down from 750° C. to — 60° C., the fol
lowing is an approximation to the volumes of the mass at the various
temperatures      indicated  : —
             Volume at 750 C                               = 1-167940

    The specific gravity at 7° C. was found to be 6-245 in the case of a
specimen which had been often fused, and 6-293 in the case of a speci
men which had been only once fused.               This would give 5-595 as the
sp. gr. of  the  molten    bromide  at  the fusing-point.

Table showing approximately the Action of Heat on the Chloride, Bromide,
               and Iodide of Silver, between — 60° C. and 750° C.
                                    Temperatures.
    The bromide fuses to a reddish brown liquid, not unlike bromine, and
it solidifies to a bright yellow transparent solid when seen in thin layers.
In thick layers it appears to be brownish yellow. It is brittle even before
it is quite cold. During the process of cooling loud cracking noises, like
the cracking of a piece of porcelain or thick glass, are produced.             The
solidified    solid produces a metallic ring when struck        ;  but this is less
marked than in the case of the chloride of silver.
                    5. Effects of Heat on tlie Chloride of Silver.
     Precipitated chloride of silver was fused and cast in warm glass tubes.
 It had been very carefully prepared in the dark, and the fused mass in
 thin layers was colourless and quite transparent.         When warm, a rod of
 the chloride was very flexible, and to some extent malleable ; when cold
 the bar did not bend without fracture, and repeated fusings seemed to
 render it more liable to fracture.         The rod contracted a good deal ou
 cooling, and easily came out of the tube in which it was cast. Rods of
  G inches long by
                       | inch in diameter had their ends levelled by means of
  a fine steel saw, and were placed in the expansion-apparatus       and tested as

               t he Chloride, Bromide, and Iodide             of Silver.        291
described    in the     case   of the iodide     bars.    The coefficient of cubical
expansion    for  1° C. was found to be
                                       '000095454.
   Fizeau by his optical method found the coefficient to be -000098814.
The coefficient increases with the temperature, at least to the extent of
'000003 for each 100° C. increase of range. The expansion is considerable
in passing from the solid to the liquid condition, and between 350° C.
and a temperature estimated at 750° C.             I  believe 350° C. to be near the
melting-point of the chloride.           (Can  the 260°   C. which we see in books
be a misprint for 360° C. ?          The chloride may be kept for any length of
time   in  a paraffine-bath      at 300° C. without showing signs of fusion.)
The volume at      —   60° C. has been taken as unity, in order that a better
comparison     between     the chloride and the iodide may be made in the
curve table, and an addition of -000003 to the coefficient has been
made for each 100° C. of temperature.                Then, if we suppose a molten
mass of chloride of silver to be cooling from 750° C. to — 60° C., the fol
lowing is an approximation to the volumes of the mass at the various
temperatures     indicated   : —
            Volume at      750°  C                            =   1-177135
                        „ 350         (liquid)                =   1-116427
                        „ 350         (solid)                 =   1-040302
                        ,,300                                 =   1-035082
                        ,,200                                 =   1-024937
                         + 100                                =   1-015092
                               0                              =   1-005547
                        ,,-60                                 = 1-000000
   The specific gravity was found to be 5-505 in the case of a specimen
which had been often fused, and 5-405 in the case of a specimen which
had been once fused.           This (former) would give 4-957 as the sp. gr. of
the molten chloride at the fusing-point.
   The chloride fuses to a dull light-red liquid, and becomes faintly
yellow when solidified, in thin layers colourless and quite transparent.
When cold it forms a pale dirty greenish-yellow solid, transparent in
thin layers.     No sounds were emitted during cooling. The fracture is
crystalline.     In   thin layers the chloride is very flexible when cold ; and
when hot thick masses of it are very flexible.                 When cold it has a
decided   metallic   ring  when    struck.

  In   a recent communication                     to the Society       I have given the approximate
coefficients of expansions of the chloride and bromide of silver, and the
coefficients of contraction and expansion of the iodide of silver. It was
thought that some interesting results might be obtained by alloying
these bodies together, and thus forming various chloro-brom-iodides  of
silver, and by investigating the physical properties of such bodies and
the effects of heat upon them.  Accordingly these bodies were fused
together in the proportions requisite to form the following com

iodide of silver in one another.           Such bodies are found native : embolite
(tp(36\1ov) is a chloro-bromide          of silver in which the ratio of the chloride
to the bromide varies indefinitely.                  Minerals having respectively the
composition Ag, Br Cl,, Ag, Br, Cl,, Ag4 Br, Cl, Ag, Br4 C16, and Ag4 Br
C1, have been           analyzed by Domeyko, Field, Miiller, Eichter, and
others.       They occur chiefly in Chili, and constitute the principal ore of
the silver-mines       of Chafiarcillo. They are described as possessing specific
gravities which vary between 5-75 and 6-2 ; and according to Dana the
colour is " greyish green, and asparagus-green to pistachio or yellowish
green, and yellow ; often dark, becoming darker externally on exposure."
 Dana further states that an iodobromide of silver is found native in
Chili    ; but of this   I am unable    to find any description.
     In examining the following results, we must bear in mind that we are
 dealing with bodies which are very differently affected by heat. For
while the chloride and bromide of silver have higher coefficients of ex
 pansion than the most expansible metals (such as zinc), the iodide of silver
 contracts slightly when heated to a temperature of 142° C., while between
 142° and 145°-5 C. it undergoes considerable contraction ; then expands
 to the melting-point, undergoes considerable increase of volume in pass
 ing from the solid to the liquid condition, and expands slightly beyond
 this temperature and the melting-point.                   Moreover the iodide passes
 into an amorphous condition between              142°   C. and 145a5 C., and possesses
 a point of maximum density at 142° C.                      The following volumes are
 given for comparison with those of the alloys (the coefficients for both
 the bromide and chloride are not given because they are practically the
 same, and one serves for both) : —

294            Mr. G. F. Rodwell          on the Effects    of Heat
figured in the above-mentioned paper.          The measurements were made by
means of a micrometer-screw.          The expansions above the point of fusion
were determined by the method of the platinum cone described in the
previous paper.
   The alloys were made by fusing together in a porcelain crucible weighed
quantities of the iodide, bromide, and chloride of silver in such propor
tions as furnished the five compounds described below.

Specific gravity 6-152, when fused and cast into rods which were
allowed to cool in the air ; but when the rods were allowed to cool slowly
in hot paraffine, the specific gravity was found to be 6-066. The specific
gravity, calculated on the assumption that no change of volume takes
place, was found to be 5-836, showing a condensation equal to -0513 on
the calculated volume.          Fusing-point 330° C. Specific gravity at the
fusing-point = 5-5118        ; at 750°C. = 5-057. The mass fused to a claret-
red liquid, which became brick -red, dull orange, and yellow as it cooled,
and when cold had a brownish-yellow colour, a good deal resembling
bromide of silver.       The mass contracted on solidifying, and formed a
substance with crystalline fracture,          not perfectly homogeneous.         A
small central core of less dense matter appeared near the upper end
of the rod, and was formed during the contraction of the mass. The
alloy gave a bright yellow powder, which turned green on exposure
to light. Loud harsh sounds were sometimes emitted during the cooling
of the mass. The substance was somewhat brittle, and broke as easily as
a rod of bromide of silver of the same dimensions.            Heated in paraffine
to 250° C., it was found to be incapable of bending, and was as brittle
as when cold.    In    fracture    and general characteristics   it closely resem
bled the bromide of silver.
   Placed in the expansion-apparatus         the bar expanded regularly up to
125°-5C.,   and more rapidly than the chloride or bromide of silver;
between 125°-5 C. and 131°-5 C. a slight contraction took place ; at 13P-5
the mass began to expand again, and it expanded more rapidly than- the
chloride or bromide; at the melting-point and at 750° C., however, the
volume   was nearly the same          as that  of the bromide.      The following
tesults were obtained : —

If we   take the volume at 0° C. as unity we have—

   The alloy clearly       possesses     two points of similar density at different
temperatures,      the one at 131°-5       C,  the other at or about 123° C.

Specific   gravity 6-1197.         Calculated specific gravity on the assumption
that no condensation takes place = 5-80 1 , showing a condensation equal
to -0519 on the calculated volume. Fusing-point 295° C. Specific gravity
of the liquid at the fusing-point = 55673; at 750° C. = 5-118. The
mass fuses to a dark bromine-red liquid, becoming a solid of the same
colour, which changes to a pink, dull opaque brick-red, and finally
when the mass is cold to a dull orange. The powder is bright orange,
becoming bright green on exposure to light. The fused moss on expo
sure to light becomes of a dark steel-grey colour.                 The mass is compact,
hard, and homogeneous ; it is semitransparent in thin layers.                       Semi*
crystalline   fracture.       Somewhat      lustrous   at  the  surface.   Gives  a  clear
metallic ring when allowed to fall on an anvil, or when short rods of
the alloy are shaken together.               It is difficult to break, and has more
tenacity than any one of its constituents.                It does not bend when cold;
and taken from the paraffine-bath             at 250°   C.  it bends slightly, but breaks
easily.

  296             Mr. G. F. Rodwell           on the Effects  of Heat
     In  the expansion-apparatus          the bar expanded as regularly but not
 quite so rapidly as the alloy No. 1. Up to 124° C. the coefficient of ex
 pansion is nearly the same as that of the bromide of Bilver.              Between
 124° C. and 133° C.      it contracted more than the preceding; at 133° C.
 the rod began to expand again, and it expanded now both more than the
 bromide and more than alloy No. 1 during the same ranges of tempera
 ture. At the melting-point the volume is less than that of the bromide,
 however, and at 750° C. it is nearly the same.
     The following results were obtained : —
                      Coefficient   of cubical expansion for  1o C.
                   ° 0.        ° 0.

                100 and 124                                         = -00010451
                124 and 133 (contraction)                           = -00060000
                133 and fusing-point (295° C.)                      = -00020250
     Expansion in passing from the solid to the liquid state = -05084000
     Between 295° C. and 750° C                                     = -00016130
    It is  curious and anomalous that the coefficient of expansion of the
 liquid   between   295° C. and 750° C. should be less than that of the solid
between 133° C. and 295° C. ; but the results were concordant, and it
must be noted that the expansion between 133° C. and 295° C. is nearly
 double that of the most expansible of metals.            The coefficient between
these limits appeared to decrease as the temperature rose ; but as the mass,
or at least one of its constituents, undergoes at 133° C. a molecular
change, passing into an amorphous plastic condition, and as of necessity
there is some strain on the rod, it was thought that this decrease of the
coefficient might be due to increase of plasticity and consequent slight
yielding of the bar ; and the first determination (that is to say at the
lowest temperature possible above 133° C.) was taken, and the above
coefficient, which may consequently be somewhat too high, was deduced
from it.
    If we   take the volume at 0° C. as unity we have—

at the fusing-point = 5-6971 ; at 750° C. = 5-3749.                     Fused to a dark
 bromine-red liquid, which, after passing through the different changes of
 colour as No. 2 alloy, finally cooled to a dark orange-coloured opaque
solid.    Both the exterior         of the fused     mass and the bright orange-
coloured powdered substance            turned  green on exposure to diffused light.
The mass contracted on cooling.             Taken from the paraffine-bath at 250°
C. it was found to be flexible, and it could be bent through an angle of
40° before     breaking ; when somewhat cooler it was brittle and easily
broken, but when cold it was tenacious and difficult to break.                     It was
compact and homogeneous, and gave a clear metallic ring when allowed
to fall on an anvil.          In the expansion-apparatus the bar expanded
regularly,    but   much     less    rapidly than Nos. 1 and 2, up to 124° C.

in mass and in powder on exposure               to light. It expands in solidifying,

                   on some Chloro-brom-iodides          of Silver.             301
    GENTBAL CONCLUSIONS. — There are several questions connected with
the chloro-bromo-iodides         of silver which require to be discussed, and it
may   be  well to take  them     under separate headings.
    Comparison of the alloys with their constituents. — For all purposes of
these comparisons we may take the bromide and chloride of silver to
gether, since their coefficients of expansion and certain other relations
to heat are very much the same. It will be noticed that the first alloy
contains only 26 per cent, iodide of silver, while the four succeeding alloys
contain respectively 41, 58, 68, and 74 per cent. If we compare the
percentage of silver we find :— No. 1, 60 per cent. ; No. 2, 57 ; No. 3, 54 ;
No. 4, 52 ; and No. 5, 51 : or, again, in No. 1 we have 14 per cent, of
                                                    I
iodine to 25 of Br and Cl ; in No. 2, 21 of to 20 of Br and Cl ; in No.
3, 31 of   I                                           I
             to 14 of Br and Cl ; in No. 4, 36 of to 11 of Br and Cl ; and
                   I
in No. 5, 40 of to 8 of Br and Cl. The first alloy is scarcely affected
at all as regards its coefficients of expansion by the presence of the iodide.
and, in fact, resembles bromide of silver in all its properties ; on the
other hand, the alloys Nos. 4 and 5 are very much affected by the pre
sence of the large amount of iodide of silver they contain, and in many
respects resemble the iodide.           The greatest divergence from the proper
ties of the constituents    is  to  be found in the alloys Nos. 2 and 3, in which
the iodide varies between 40 and 60 per cent. Perhaps this is due to
the fact that the iodide only dissolves to a certain extent in the fused
bromide and chloride ; for we notice that certain properties of the iodide
are masked so long as the iodide does not exceed a certain percentage,
while they become very apparent as the amount of iodide is increased.
    Of the point of maximum density of the alloys. — While the bromide and
chloride of silver expand regularly like any ordinary solid, it has been
shown that the iodide contracts slightly up to 142° C., considerably be
tween 142° C. and ! I .",-.-, C., and that it possesses its point of maximum
density at the latter temperature.           Now nothing could possibly be more
definite  or decided  than    the  behaviour   of the alloys at the critical tem
perature at which contraction commences during the heating of the mass.
In the case of the alloys Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5, this contraction invariably
commenced at 124° C., and invariably finished at 133° C. In the case of
No. 1 alloy, in which the percentage of iodide of silver was smallest, the
contraction began at 125°-5 C. (l^S C. higher than the others). The action
took place with great precision in every instance. Here, then, we have the
curious fact that while the iodide of silver commences its considerable con
traction (which occurs simultaneously with its passage from the brittle
crystalline state into the plastic amorphous state) at 142° C. and finishes it
at 1450,5 C., the chloro-brom-iodide alloys commence their contraction 18°
 C. lower, and end it 120-5 C. lower.         Thus in the iodide it is effected in
the heating    through 30-5 C., while in the alloy it requires 9° C.           We
must remember      that  in  the    alloy the iodide  passes  into the amorphous
condition while it is disseminated through the mass of the bromide and
   VOL. XXT.                                                           T

 302             Mr. G. F. Rodwell       on the Effects  of Heat
chloride  ;  and perhaps the same cause as that which lowers the fusing-
poiat lowers also the point of maximum density.
   Pusiny-point. — While the fusing-point of iodide of silver has been esti
mated at 450° C., of bromide at 380° C., and of chloride at 350° C., that
of the alloys is lower than any of the constituents (except No. 5, which is
the same as that of the lowest of its constituents, while it contains 74
per cent, of the constituent with the highest fusing-poiut, viz. 450° C.).
Thus No. 1 melts at 330° C., No. 2 at 295° C., No. 3 at 320° C., No. 4
at 330° C., and No. 5 at 350° C. The most distinctive alloy, No. 2, melts
at a temperature which is 155° C. below that of the iodide which consti
tutes 41-5 per cent, of the weight of the alloy, 85° C. below that of the
bromide which constitutes 33 per cent, of the alloy, and 55° C. below that
of the chloride which constitutes 25 per cent, of the alloy. Now it is well
known that in the case of numerous alloys the fusing-point is lower than
that of the mean fusing-points of the components ; further, it is known
that a mixture of the fused chlorides of sodium and potassium has a
lower fusing-point than the         mean of the constituent   salts.   Dr. Mat-
thiessen says,   " It is generally admitted that matter in the solid state
exhibits excess of attraction over repulsion, whilst in the liquid state
these forces are balanced ; and in the gaseous state repulsion predomi
nates over attraction." Let us assume that similar particles of matter
attract each other more powerfully than dissimilar ones. It will then
follow that the attraction subsisting between the particles of a mixture
will  be sooner overcome by      repulsion than in the case of a homogeneous
body : hence    mixtures   should   fuse more readily than their constituents.
 We are at least reminded of the fact that certain perfectly inert bodies,
when mixed with substances which decompose at a certain temperature,
lower the temperature of decomposition.
                                                                       —
   Of the contraction of the alloys between 124° C. and 133° C. It is a
curious fact that until the percentage of iodide of silver in the alloy be
comes considerable, the chief influence of the iodide seems to be exerted
between that narrow range of temperature ; and more than this, that so
soon as the contraction is over, the mass undergoes far more rapid ex
pansion than do any of its constituents when heated through the same
range of temperature.        It is further noticeable that the amount of con
traction   in some  of the  alloys exceeds that of the iodide itself, while we
know that the other constituents possess high coeff1cients of expansion.
This is all dependent, without doubt, upon the manner in which the
iodide changes its condition within the mass of the alloy.           Let us take
the case of one of the intermediate alloys, say No. 3 ; in every 100 mole
cules between the temperatures of 124° C. and 133° C. we have 58
molecules undergoing somewhat rapid contraction, while 42 are under
going expansion ; at the same time other events are taking place within
the mass, heat is disappearing as internal work, and is changing the
crystalline into the amorphous iodide, converting an opaque, brittle,

                  on some Chloro-brom-iodides         of Silver.             303
highly crystalline body (I speak of the iodide alone, not of the alloy) into
a transparent, plastic, denser hotly.      What the precise function of the
molecular motion which disappears can be it is difficult to assume, since in
this case it not only changes the state of the body, but approximates its
molecules.
   Of  the texture, specific gravity, ffc. of the alloys. — It is noticeable that
when the percentage of iodide of silver is small, the alloy is brittle while hot,
and only slightly more tenacious than its constituents when cold (No. 1 ) ;
as the percentage of iodide increases, the alloy becomes somewhat less
brittle while hot, and considerably more tenacious, hard, and compact,
than any of its constituents (Nos. 2 & 3) ; while, when the percentage of
iodide becomes considerable (Nos. 4 & 5), the mass becomes extremely
plastic while hot, perhaps more so than the iodide itself, and very brittle
when cold. The specific gravity is in all cases above the mean of that
of the constituents ; it may be because the intercrystalline spaces of the
iodide are now filled with bromide and chloride.          Thus, while the sp. gr.
                                                   I
of Ag Cl is 5-505, of Ag Br 6-245, and of Ag 5-675, that of the alloys is
as follows :— No. 1, 6-152 • No. 2, 6-1197 ; No. 3, 6-503 ; No. 4, 5-9717 ;
and No. 5, 5-907 : while the percentage of the bromide, which alone has a
higher specific gravity than that of the alloys, in uo case exceeds 42.
   In the accompanying curve table (p. 300) the expansion-curves of the
iodide and bromide of silver have been added for comparison with those
of the alloys ; the curve of chloride of silver has been omitted, because it is
almost precisely the same as that of the bromide.
   I  have preferred to call these results " approximate
                                                                 "

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    GEORGE POIJLETT SCHOPE.          It is scarcely possible at the present day
 to realize the   conditions   of that .intellectual "reign of terror" which
 prevailed at the commencement of the present century, as the consequence
of the unreasoning prejudice and wild alarm excited by the early progress
of geological inquiry.     At that period, every attempt to explain the past
history of the earth by a reference to the causes still in operation upon
it  was met,  not by argument, but by charges of atheism against its pro-
                                                                '
pounder ; and thus Button's masterly fragment of a                Theory of the
                                 '
Earth,' Playfair's persuasive Illustrations,' and Hall's records of accurate
observation and ingenious experiment had come to be inscribed in a social
Index Erpurgatorius, and for a while, indeed, might have seemed to be
consigned to total oblivion.       Equally injurious suspicions were aroused
against the geologist who dared to make allusion to the important part
which igneous forces have undoubtedly played in the formation of certain
rocks ; for the authority of Werner had acquired an almost sacred cha
racter ; and " Vulcanists       and " Huttonians
                             "                       "
                                                       were equally objects of
 aversion and contempt.
    To two men who have very recently — and within a few months of one
another — passed away from our midst, science is indebted for boldly en
countering and successfully overcoming this storm of prejudice.          Huttou
and his friends lived a generation too soon ; and thus it was reserved for
 Lyell and Scrope to carry out the task which the great Scotch philosopher
had failed to accomplish, namely, the removal of geology from the domain
of speculation to that of inductive science.
    Born in the year 1 797, and educated successively at Harrow and Cam
bridge, George Poulett Thomson enjoyed the advantage of a considerable
amount of foreign travel during his earlier years.          By the advice of his
university friends, Sedgwick and Dr. E. D. Clarke, he soon began to devote
much of his attention to the phenomena of volcanos, and between the
years 1818 and 1821 carefully studied the principal volcanic districts of
Italy.     He married in 1822 the heiress of the Scropo family, and
 having adopted her name, set out on a series of geological explorations in
Auvergne, Southern Italy, the Ponza Islands, the Euganean Hills, and
 subsequently in the Siebengebirge and the Eifel, which occupied him till
the close of the year 1823.        So marked an effect would appear to have
 been produced upon his mind by the great Vesuvian eruption of 1822 —
 which he was so fortunate as to witness, and which, indeed, inspired his
 first contribution to geological literature — that from this time forward he
 seems to have been confirmed in his devotion to that branch of geological
    TOL. xiv.                                                        a

inquiry which, throughout his after life, he so successfully pursued. The
result of 8crope's studies and investigations, thus carried on independently
and almost unaided, was to make him an enthusiastic supporter of the
Huttonian doctrine, that causes similar in kind to those now in operation
were quite competent to have produced all past geological changes, aud
at the same time a most determined opponent of Werner's teaching con
                                                                      "
cerning the aqueous origin of basalt, and of Yon Buch's theory of eleva
tion-craters."
    In 1824 Scrope was elected a Fellow of the Geological Society ; and
having returned to England, he sought the society of those engaged in
similar inquiries with himself, and in Charles Lyell found an earnest
fellow-student who was able to understand and sympathize with his geolo
gical convictions.    Most of the members of the infant Geological Society
seem at that time to have come to a tacit agreement to lay aside all con
sideration of those questions relating to the philosophy of their science,
which had, in the case of the generation then passing away, been the
means of provoking so much heated and embittered controversy. To three
of their number, however, such practical abnegation of their responsibili
ties was impossible ; and it is to the boldness and sagacity of Lyell,
Scrope, and De la Beche that geology is indebted for the initiation of its
modern advance and development.          At the period when Scrope returned
from the continent Lyell had long been engaged in that patient collection
of facts illustrating the changes produced on the earth's surface by the
operations of existing causes, which at a subsequent date enabled him to
                             '                        '
produce his incomparable       Principles of Geology ; and between the two
thinkers the closest friendship soon became established, attended with a
freedom of intercourse which was doubtless of great advantage to both of
them in preparing for their joint attack upon the prevailing geolo
gical errors.
   Scrope wrote     several memoirs relating to the geology of the coun
tries he had visited, and in 1825 published his ' Considerations on Vol-
canos.'   The dominant idea in this remarkable work is well illustrated
in the passage which follows an enumeration of the effects of atmospheric
agencies, of the circulation of water on the earth's surface, and of volcanos
and earthquakes in causing the destruction aud reproduction of rocks,
changes of level, and the transference of new rocks from the earth's
interior to its surface. These the author declared to be " changes which
in their general characters bear     so strong an analogy to those which are
suspected   to  have occurred in the earlier stages of the world's history,
that, until the processes which give rise to them have been maturely
studied under every shape, and then applied with strict impartiality to
explain the appearances in question, and until after a long investigation
and with the most liberal allowance for all possible variations, and an
unlimited series of ages, they have been found wholly inadequate to the
purpose, it would be the height        of absurdity  to have recourse to any

                                             Ill
  gratuitous and unexampled hypothesis for the solution of these analogous
  facts."
      It is interesting to notice, too, in this work, published now more than
  half a century ago, many striking anticipations of later geological disco
  veries — such as the action of water in producing volcanic eruptions, and
  in causing the liquidity of lavas ; the presence of the same agent in
  deep-seated rocks, and its influence in the formation of those of granitic
  character ; the effects of pressure in producing cleavage and foliation ;
  and the necessarily more or less local character of all geological " forma
  tions."
      It  must be confessed, however, that the ' Considerations      on Volcanos
  was a     work little calculated to promote the cause which the author and
  his   friend had so much at heart, namely, the removal of the prejudices
 which hindered the progress of geological inquiry. Its bold and vigorous
 attacks on the positions of the " Cataclysmists
                                                        " roused their most deter
 mined opposition, while the numerous and sometimes rather crude specu
 lations into which the author allowed himself to be drawn, in his attempt
 at    " the establishment of    a new theory of the earth," afforded only too
 many opportunities       for  telling retorts, which were eagerly taken advan
 tage of.
      In   December    1826 Scrope was elected a Fellow of the Eoyal Society.
 That      he knew how to profit alike from the judicious criticism of
 friends and the unsparing ridicule of opponents, was clearly enough shown
 when in 1827 his second work, ' On the Geology and Extinct Volcanos of
 Central France,' made its appearance.              In this essay, which is still
everywhere recognized as one of the classics of geological literature, the
author succeeded in demonstrating, even to the most incredulous, the
power of rivers to excavate the valleys in which they flow ; and his friend
Lyell pronounced a just eulogium on it when he said : — We consider
                                                                   "
Mr. Scrope's work the most able that has appeared since Playfair's
'
   Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory,' in support of the doctrine that
   valleys have been shaped out progressively by the action of rivers, or of
'
                                                                   "
such floods as may occur in the ordinary course of nature.'
     It was now the turn of Lyell to take the field in the controversy with
the Catastrophists, and to bring to the support of the Huttonian doctrines
that vast mass of patiently collected facts, that moderation in statement
and candour in argument, and that calm, persuasive style — occasionally,
but involuntarily, flashing into eloquence — which gave such charm and
                   '
power to the Principles of Geology,' and which still recall so vividly to
all who knew him the deep enthusiasm, curbed by sound judgment, which
distinguished its author.
     During the composition of this great work the two friends were in
constant correspondence.           Lyell had wisely determined to undermine the
positions of his adversaries, rather than to arouse their opposition           by

                                       iv
direct attacks  ; and to his more ardent friend was committed the congenial
                                                            '           '
task of applying and driving home the arguments of the Principles ill a
series of reviews of the work.     The first and second volumes were intro
duced    to the   public by appreciative and discriminative notices in the
'
   Quarterly,' which were written by Scrope ; and the completion of the
third edition in 1835 was made the occasion of a final article from the
same pen.
    In these able reviews, which are admitted to have produced a very great
effect at the time they were written, and which may be still read with
much profit, Scrope took up certain positions somewhat in advance of his
friend in geological theory.    Thus we find him, even at this early date,
demurring to the too absolutely uniformitarian doctrines of Hutton and
Lyell, and maintaining views very similar to those developed by Prof.
Huxley in his Anniversary Address to the Geological Society in 1869.
 On the question, too, of the relative influence of subaerial and marine
denudation in originating the forms of the earth's surface, Scrope at this
early date maintained views which his friend was not prepared to accept
 till some years later.
     Unfortunately,   however, for geological science, Scrope had by this
 time almost forsaken scientific for political labours ; but of his useful
and honourable public career this is not the place to speak. Nevertheless
when, in 1858, he found his friend Lyell again engaged in a controversy
with the supporters of the " Theory of Elevation-Craters," he determined
once more to bear his part in meeting the new arguments of their old oppo
nents ; and the publication of his able memoir " On the formation of Cones
              "
and Craters     was the consequence of this resolve. As he now began gra
dually to withdraw himself from the sphere of politics, Scrope found time
to revisit his former haunts, and to prepare new and greatly improved
editions of his earlier works ; and these have been translated into the prin
cipal European languages.      During his declining years, which decaving
strength and increasing blindness compelled him to spend in almost com
plete retirement, he followed with interest the progress of thought in
 connexion with his favourite science, and watched with jealousy its
excentric development, contributing from time to time many a suggestive
 essay or trenchant criticism to the scientific periodicals.      Not a few
 of the younger students of that branch of the science which he had him
 self so successfully cultivated were indebted to him, during these years
 of increasing feebleness, when he could no longer take the field, not only
 for counsel, sympathy, and encouragement, but for friendly aid in pursuing
 their researches. But the death of Lyell, his early friend and fellow-
 labourer, with whom to the last he maintained an affectionate corre
 spondence, produced a great shock to his weakened frame        ; and within
 a few months thereafter    he passed peacefully away.

    PETEB ANDREAS HANSEN, born at Tondern in Schleswig, on the 8th
of December, 1795, was the son of Nikolai Hansen, a prosperous gold-
and silversmith of that town. Young Hansen attended the town school,
where he learnt the elements of Latin and French, and showed special
aptitude for mathematics and physics.
    After his confirmation he chose watch-making for his calling, and
went to Flensburg to serve his apprenticeship in that business. He soon
distinguished himself by his skill and ingenuity in mechanical con
struction, and then set to work on his own account at mathematical
studies.    His circumstances, and also his father's wishes, were opposed
to his ardent desire to study at a University ; and he therefore at the
end of his apprenticeship returned home to his parents, and in the
year 1818 began his wanderings.           He first passed some months in
Berlin, where he found some occupation under a master who was one
of a French colony settled there, and in whose family he acquired some
familiarity with the French language.
    At the end of the year 1819 he returned to Tondern, and settled
down in his father's house as a watchmaker.        But as early as the spring
of 1820 the influence of a physician, Dr.     Dirks, who was interested in
matters appertaining to mathematics and physics, and who recognized
Hanson's talents, gave a decided turn to his course of life. Dirks suc
ceeded in gaining the consent of the father for the young man to go to
Altona to join Professor Schumacher, who was there entrusted with the
management      of the Danish measurement of an arc of a meridian.
Schumacher received Hansen very kindly, and exerted himself to obtain
for him an appointment in the measurement. He was, however, in
the first instance unsuccessful ; and Hansen, who had meanwhile begun to
work at Astronomy in the Eound Tower, then the Copenhagen Ob
servatory, was thinking of going to Gottingen to study under Gauss.
Finding that Gauss was prevented by the measuring of an arc of the
 meridian in Hanover from lecturing, he was at last induced by Schuma
 cher, and with the royal consent, to go at his own expense to Altona (in
 1820) to take part in the measurement in Holstein.
    After the completion of this task he returned to Tondern, from which
 place he was recalled to Copenhagen by Schumacher in January 1821.
 He was employed regularly on the survey.
    Before long, through the influence of Schumacher, the king became
 interested in Hansen, and from that time forth the latter received many
 personal proofs of appreciation and recognition of his services, of which
 he always cherished a grateful   recollection.
    In  the summer of 1822 Schumacher        sent Hansen to Heligoland to
 assist in some astronomical    observations for the determination of geo
 graphical positions in conjunction with some English savants.
     Schumacher became more and more intimate with Hansen,              and a
 friendship grew up between them which was only to      be dissolved by death.

                                        VI
 Before long Hanson's eminent services to science attracted the notice of
 the astronomical world ; and in the year 1825, when Encke left the
  Seeberg at Gotha to take the superintendence of the Observatory of the
 Berlin Academy, Hansen was selected to conduct the Observatory on
 the Seeberg, with the title of Professor, a post which he retained for
 nearly half a century, namely, to the end of his life. The small salary
 (of 600 Thalers) attached to this appointment obliged him for a number
 of years to undertake calculations for Ephemerides for the Danish and
 English Governments.
    He lived in the Observatory itself from the year 1825 to 1839; but
 as  the arrangements and fittings were no longer adapted to the re
 quirements of science, and besides the building itself was too much out
 of repair to bear much longer the wear and tear of weather, Hansen,
 with the consent of the Duke, removed to the town of Gotha, and in the
 southern suburb built himself a house with a little private observatory,
 in which the meridian circle was set up. Here he worked from the
 year 1842 to 1857, until the new Ducal Observatory was established,
 which was fitted up under his superintendence in such a perfect manner,
 though on a very modest scale, that it has since served as a model to
 several larger institutions.
    The work Hansen accomplished at Gotha embraces almost every branch
 of practical and theoretical astronomy ; and if no regular and compfce-
hensive series of observations has been made under him, the cause of
this deficiency lies in the insufficient funds at his disposal, which neither
admitted of the payment of assistants nor of the purchase of large
instruments.      But though Gotha could not in these respects rival other
great observatories, it possessed an astronomer who was enabled by his
mechanical genius to do much in improving the art of observation by
ingenious improvements in the arrangements and use of his instruments.
The apparatus and methods which he invented for the investigation of
errors of division, for the prevention of flexure, for the registration of
observations, for the parallactic motion of telescopes mounted hori
zontally, as well as numerous original contrivances, such as those which
were applied in the building of the present observatory, obtained the
general approbation of astronomers.        His works on the use of the Fraun-
hofer Heliometer, the Transit-instrument, and the Equatorial have be
come classical in spherical astronomy.
    But it was especially Hansen's rare mathematical ability that enabled
him to carry out the great works which make an epoch in the department
of physical astronomy known as the Theory of Perturbations. As early
as the   first years of his residence on the Seeberg, he published in the
'                                '
   Astronomische Nachriehten the main principles of his new theory of
perturbations, which in the course of years he employed in the accurate
investigation and calculation of the motion of the moon, of the sun, of
the greater and lesser planets, and of the comets.

                                          Vll
    Aided by his remarkable facility in calculation (for four-figure logarithms
he scarcely required the aid of the tables), he in 1853, conjointly with
Olufsen and with pecuniary assistance from Denmark, at the request of
the Society of Sciences at Copenhagen, completed his solar tables ; and
likewise in 1857 the lunar tables printed by the English Admiralty, for
which the Parliament of Great Britain voted him the sum of £1000.
    In 1838 he published the theory of the moon's motion in a special
work, ' Funda1nenta nova investigationis orbitae verae quam Luna per-
lustrat ;' the exposition of the theoretical calculation of the perturba
tions employed in the lunar tables appeared in 1862-64, in two elaborate
treatises published in the Transactions of the Eoyal Society of Sciences in
Saxony.     An appendix treats of the verification of chronological eclipses.
He wrote a series of treatises on the theory of the absolute Perturbations
of the Asteroids, to which he appended tables of Egeria.
    The comet disturbances he treated in two special works — the one
entitled " Ermittelung der absoluten Storungen in Ellipsen von beliebiger
Excentricitat und Neigung," 1843 (which was translated into French by
                                                                      '
Mauvais) ; the other a prize treatise of the French Academy,            Me1noire
sur le calcul des Perturbations qu'eprouvent les cometes.' As examples,
he gives the disturbances of Encke's comet by the Earth and Saturn.
               '
    For his      Untersuchungen       iiber die gegenseitigen Storungen      des
                           '
Jupiters und Saturns he had received in 1830 the prize offered by the
Berlin Academy.         A further posthumous memoir, "Ueber die Storungen
der grossen Planeten, insbesondere des Jupiters," has just been published
in the Transactions of the Saxon Society.         In the same Transactions he
published, amongst other things, very elaborate memoirs on the "Theorie
des Aequatoreals
                     "
                         (1855), on
                                     " Theorie der Sonnenfinsternisse und ver-
wandten Erscheinungen

                                 (1858), on the

                                                                   "
parallaxe   durch Venusvoriibergange vor der Sonnenseheibe            (1870), in
relation to the Transit of 1874, two memoirs connected with dioptrical
researches (1871 and 1874), besides a long series of memoirs on the
Calculus of Probabilities and the higher Geodesy (1865-1869), to which
he was led by his taking part in the European measurement of an arc of
a meridian.
    One of his latest memoirs treats of the determination of errors in the
division of a graduated rectilinear scale, and was written with a view to
the expected photographic measures of the Transit of Venus.
    Among the memoirs of the London Astronomical Society we may
mention two important papers on the Inequalities of long period in the
Moon's motion (1847), and on the Figure of the Moon (1854).              In the
former he examines the influence of Venus on the mean longitude of the
 moon, and in the latter he endeavours to show that the centre of the figure
 of the moon does not coincide with her centre of gravity, but that the
 latter is about 59 kilometres further from us than the former.
    After the death of Schumacher, Hansen shared for some time the
             '         '
 editorship of the Astronomische Nachrichten' which Schumacher had

                                        Vlll
founded.      Petersen was for a time his companion in this editorial work
at Altona.      Of the numerous contributions he made to this periodical
we need only mention, in addition to those already spoken of on the
theory of perturbations, those of early date on the transit-instrument
and on the meridian circle, on eclipses and occupations of Stars, on re
fraction of light, on the determination of the latitude, on the calculus
of probabilities     and the method of least squares, on different geodetic
problems,    on  the  disturbances of Encke's comet by a resisting medium,
&c. ; and at a later period especially the papers on the calculation of special
perturbations by mechanical quadratures and the reduction of places to
the ecliptic of the date. An immense number of essays on various sub
jects of interest have appeared in the Reports of the Transactions of the
Mathematical and Physical Class of the Saxon Society ; of these we need
merely allude to the papers on the solution of a system of linear equa
tions  ;  on spherical harmonics ; on ideal coordinates ; on Keppler's
problem ; the ecliptic tables, &c., together with the analysis of the same ;
on the arrangements of the new Ducal Observatory at Gotha ; on the
determination      of the orbit of a heavenly body from three observa
tions ; on the secular variation of the mean longitude of the Moon, and
the alteration of the day's length by the gradual decrease of the rate of
rotation of the Earth (April 1863) ; on the computation of triangu-
lations ; on the centre of gravity of spherical triangles ; on a new
 telescope-stand   ;  on the application of photography for observing the
Transit of Venus, &c.
    Hansen published papers in various other periodicals, as, for instance,
                              '
 in the ' Comptes Eendus of the Paris Academy, in the Monthly Keports
 of the Berlin Academy, in the Monthly Notices of the London Astro
 nomical Society, in the Eesults of the Magnetic Society, in Schumacher's
 Astronomical Jahrbuch, the Mathematical Works of Jacobi, the Mathe-
 maticalJournal of Gutten in Wilna (iiber das Eepsold'sche Aequatoreal),
 the Memoirs of the Naturforschenden Gesellschaft in Danzig (which
 latter Society awarded him the prize for his treatise, " Theorie der Pendel-
 bewegung mit Eiicksicht auf die Gestalt und TJmdrehung der Erde," 1 853) ,
 and so on. In conclusion we may add to this short summary the Memoir
  on the Fraunhofer Heliometer, 1 827, and the ' Commentatio de gradus
 praecisionis computatione,' written on occasion of Olbers's Jubilee in 1830.
    Hansen did not escape controversy. Some of his works and their results
 have been attacked by German, Erench, English, and American astro
 nomers ; to these attacks such men as Pontecoulant, Lubbock, Encke,
 Briinnow, Peters, Baeyer, Weingarten, Newcomb, and Dclaunay have lent
 their names. No one more than Hansen regretted the bitterness which
 is more or less inseparable from such discussions, though he felt it a
 duty to science to give distinct expression to his convictions.
    He received various honorary       titles and decorations,  and numerous
  recognitions of his scientific position.    Most of the learned societies of
 Germany and other countries elected him a member. The Royal Society,

                                       IX
of which he was a foreign member, conferred upon him the Copley
Medal in 1850.      In 1842, and again in 1860, he received the Medal of
the Eoyal Astronomical Society.
    A great number of his contemporaries     in astronomy and mathematics
enjoyed the privilege of his acquaintance and instruction.         His pupils
retained a grateful sense of the amiability     and  patience with which he
laboured to make them worthy disciples of his science.
    Hansen had many offers of other honourable and advantageous ap
pointments ; amongst others one at Dorpat as successor to Struve in
1839, one as successor to Bessel in Konigsberg in 1847, one at Copen
hagen ; and in the year 1866 he was offered that of Astronomer to the
Berlin Academy.
    In the year 1828 he married the eldest daughter of the Oberforst-
meister Braun.       He retained his vigour of body and mind to a con
siderable age, and his facility of writing never left him. At times he
almost lived at his writing-table, not seeming to feel the need of recre
ation either of body or mind. Healthy sleep was sufficient for the
restoration of his powers.     He did not take bodily exercise ; and in his
latter years was seldom willing to make any excursion or journey. He
twice visited England, mainly to promote the publication of his Lunar
Tables ; and he deeply gratified the Director of the Chief Eussian Obser
vatory, Pulkova, by his presence at the 25th anniversary of the founding
of that great institution.
    His last years were saddened by a disease of the eyes which altogether
 prevented him from reading, and even rendered writing very difficult.
 In the last months of his life he had the additional suffering of a liver com
 plaint. His death took place on the 28th of March, 1874. He had in
 the beginning of that month completed the manuscript paper " On the
 Determination of errors in the Division of a Eectilinear Scale," and sent
 it to the printer. The post mortem examination of the head showed a
 finely formed brain with a remarkably thin skull.
     The main feature of his character was an ardent love of truth ; what
 he had once recognized as true he maintained with all the energy of con
 viction, caring little whether others were convinced or not; and he
 sometimes found it difficult to understand how an opinion contrary to
 his own could be honestly held. Thus he sometimes considered himself
 aggrieved when he was opposed in things which he had made his own by
 conscientious study.      But when convinced of the excellence of another
 view, he would at once give his unqualified adhesion to it.
     As Hansen had not studied either at a Gymnasium or a University,
 and had thus been compelled to forego the systematic training of any
  high school, he owed all the many-sided learning which he acquired
 to his own untiring diligence and thirst for knowledge.                He im
  proved   his  acquaintance  with  the  French   and  Latin  languages which
  he had begun at school, as his French and Latin papers sufficiently
  show.     He had also a fair knowledge of English, and even made some
     TOT,, xxv.                                                     fi

progress in Bussian.      In his latter years he often recited from memory
passages from Homer and Horace.          Hansen's personal appearance was
noble and imposing ; his tall and stately form with his early grey hair
gave   him a venerable appearance.      His whole demeanour,     as well as  his
                                                                    one whose
expression of countenance, announced a man of intellect, and
opinions were the result of matured thought. He took little interest
                                                                         in the
commonplaces of society, and thereby gave many people the impression of
being reserved, but he was gladly and freely communicative in intercourse
with those who took     a real interest in scientific questions.  He willingly
acknowledged any suggestion offered to him on such subjects, and enjoyed
on this account especially his personal intercourse with the celebrated
mathematician Jacobi, during the stay of the latter at Gotha, and felt
deeply the loss caused by his early death.
    He had great taste for music, and played both on the piano and the
harmonium.        Another recreation to which he occasionally resorted was
chess. He had not much appreciation of the beauties of nature, owing
probably to shortsightedness and the peculiarity of his eyes, he being to a
considerable extent colour-blind. Accustomed in early youth to a flat sea
shore, he felt rather oppressed than attracted by the romantic scenery of
the Thuringian forest.
    He was an affectionate     and devoted husband and father, and       in his
 old age took the greatest delight in the society of his little grandchildren.
    His predilection for mechanical contrivances, which was one of his
 chief sources of recreation after any continuous mental labour, continued
in later years ; and when his eyesight began to fail him, he with his own
 hands introduced improvements in a most ingenious and artistic watch,
 which he had contrived during his residence on the Seeberg, and which,
 besides other things, indicated the mean time, the apparent solar time,
 and the sidereal time.     He also took a steady interest in the machine
 factory which his son had erected in Gotha.
     For nearly forty years Hansen conducted the Detail Survey of the
 Gotha domains with untiring zeal and care, and had the satisfaction of
 completing it before his death.      Hansen held the appointment of Com
 missioner of the Ducal Government, and was for a long period President
 of the " Permanent Commission," which post he only relinquished at last
 on account of his health. He was also an efficient President of the Com
 mission appointed by the German Empire for the preparation for observing
 the Transit of Venus.      Both these scientific undertakings gave him an
 opportunity of making elaborate and valuable theoretical investigations.
     His collection of scientific books has been, by the enlightened care of
 the Grand Ducal Government and with the consent of the Landtag, pur
 chased for the Library of the Observatory.            With the most praise
 worthy liberality his family have delivered up to the Astronomical Society

  a transparent, plastic, denser body. What the precise function of the

  this  case  it not only changes the state of the body, but approximates its
  molecules.
     Of   the texture, specific gravity, Sfc. of the alloys. — It is noticeable that
  when the percentage of iodide of silver is small, the alloy is brittle while hot,
  and only slightly more tenacious than its constituents when cold (No. 1);
 as the percentage of iodide increases, the alloy becomes somewhat less
 brittle while hot, and considerably more tenacious, hard, and compact,
 than any of its constituents (Nos. 2 & 3) ; while when the percentage of
 iodide becomes considerable (Nos. 4 & 5), the mass becomes extremely
 plastic while hot, perhaps more so than the iodide itself, and very brittle
 when cold. The specific gravity is in all cases above the mean of that
 of the constituents ; it may be because the intercrystalline spaces of the
 iodide are now f1lled with bromide and chloride.            Thus, while the sp. gr.

 as follows :— No. 1, 6-152 ; No. 2, 6-1197 ; No. 3, 6-503 ; No. 4, 5-9717 ;
and No. 5, 5-907 : while the percentage of the bromide, which alone has a
higher specific gravity than that of the alloys, in no case exceeds 42.
    In the accompanying curve table (p. 300) the expansion-curves of the
iodide and bromide of silver have been added for comparison with those
of the alloys ; the curve of chloride of silver has been omitted, because it is
almost precisely the same as that of the bromide.

       &c.    Received November       15, 1876.
    Instead of bringing another preliminary notice before the Society,       I
should have preferred reserving the announcement of my new results on
the Eepulsion resulting from Eadiation until they were fit to be offered
in a more complete form ; but the radiometer is now so much occupying
the attention of scientific men, and results of experiments with this and
allied instruments are appearing so frequently in the scientific journals
at home and abroad, that were     I not to adopt this method of bringing the
results of my more recent experiments before men of science,          I might
find myself anticipated in some or all of the conclusions at which      I have
arrived.
    On June 15th last      I mentioned to the Society that the repulsion
resulting from radiation increases up to a certain point as         I exhaust
the air from the torsion-apparatus.      After long-continued exhaustion the
force of radiation approaches a maximum, and then begins to fall off.        I
have since succeeded in experimenting at still higher exhaustions, and
with different gases in the apparatus ; and by means of a McLeod gauge
atl ached to the mercury pump       I  have been able to measure the atmo
spheric pressure at any desired stage of exhaustion.         I have not only
measured the force of repulsion, but also the viscosity of the residual
gas ; and from the results      I have plotted the observations iu curves
which accompany this paper, and which show how the viscosity of the
residual gas is related to the force of repulsion exerted by radiation.
These curves must not, however, be considered as representing more than
the broad facts, for 1 have not included in them my final observations,
which in all probability will introduce modifications in them.
    In plotting these curves    I have supposed my scale to be 1000 metres
long,   and to  represent one atmosphere.     Halfway up the scale therefore,
or 500 metres, represents half an atmosphere ; 999 metres up the scale
represents an exhaustion of yjj^nj of an atmosphere : each millimetre,
therefore, stands for the millionth of an atmosphere.
    My results have principally teen obtained at the top of the scale ; and
it is the last quarter of a metre which supplies the diagrams accompanying
this paper.

  1876.]            Mr. W. Crookes        on the Radiometer.                 305
    When the residual     gas is air, the viscosity (measured by the logarithmic
 decrement     of the arc of oscillation) is practically constant up to an
 exhaustion of 250 millionths of an atmosphere, or 0-19 millim. of mercury,
 having only diminished from 0-126 at the normal pressure of the atmo
 sphere to 0-112.    It now begins to fall off : at 200 millionths it is 0-110,
 at 100 millionths it is 0-096, at 50 millionths it is 0-078, at 20 millionths
it is 0-052, at   10 milliouths it is 0-035, and at    0-1 of a millionth of an
 atmosphere the log. dec. has fallen to about 0'Ol . Simultaneously with this
 decrease in the viscosity, the force of repulsion exerted on a black surface
 by a standard light varies. It increases very slowly till the exhaustion has
 risen to about 70 millionths of an atmosphere ; at about 40 millionths the
 force is at its maximum ; and it then sinks very rapidly, till at 0-1 millionth
 of an atmosphere it is less than one tenth of its maximum. On continuing
 the curves of the log. dec. and the force of radiation, and assuming that
 the torsion-fibre of glass has no viscosity, it is most probable that
                                                                    z2

they both would come to zero when the last traces of an atmosphere
had been taken out of the apparatus.
    The oxygen diagram differs from that of air. The log. dec. is
0-126 at the atmospheric pressure; it falls to 0-111 at a pressure of 250
millionths of an atmosphere ; at 100 millionths it is 0-105, at 50 mil-
lionths it is 0-093, at 20 millionths it is 0-008, and at 2 millionths it is
 0-02. The force of repulsion in oxygen increases very steadily up to an
 exhaustion of about 40 millionths of an atmosphere ; it is at its maximum
 at about 30 millionths, and thence declines very rapidly.
     Hydrogen gives a remarkable diagram.             The viscosity at the normal
                                                             250 millionths of an
 pressure is measured by a log. dec. of 0-003 ; at
 atmosphere it is 0-057, at 100 millionths        it  is 0-052,  at 50 millionths it
 is 0-046, whence it rapidly sinks.           The force of repulsion increases
 slowly up to an exhaustion of 250 millionths, then quickly until it
 attains its maximum at about 50 millionths, and it then rapidly declines.
 The force of repulsion is very great in a hydrogen vacuum, being in
 comparison with the maximum in an air vacuum as 70 to 41. Neither is
 it necessary to get so high an exhaustion with hydrogen as with other
  gases to obtain considerable repulsion.           This shows that in the con
  struction of radiometers it is advantageous to fill them with hydrogen
  before exhausting.
     Carbonic acid has a viscosity of about -01 at the normal pressure,
  being between air and hydrogen, but nearer the former.                On approach
  ing a vacuum, the force of repulsion does not rise very high, and soon
  falls off.
      Before working with this apparatus           I  thought that monohydrated
   sulphuric acid evolved      no  vapour,   and   I  therefore   freely used it for
  cleaning out the pump and for drying the gases.            I  can even now detect
  no vapour-tension;      but   a comparison    of  the  curves,   with and without
   sulphuric acid, shows that the presence of this body modifies the results.
   One of my curves represents the action of the residual sulphuric an
   hydride gas. The experience thus gained has led me to adopt phosphoric
   anhydride for drying the gases.         I  can detect no ill effects from the
   presence   of  this agent ; and  I have been   able in consequence to push the
   rarefaction   to higher points than before.
      The McLeod gauge will not show the presence of mercury vapour.
                                      I
   It is therefore possible that have a greater pressure in the apparatus
   than is here stated.        I  have, however, entirely failed to detect the
   presence of mercury vapour at any great distance from the mercury in
   the pump ; and the tube packed with gold-leaf, which                  I  frequently
   interpose between the pump and the apparatus, shows no trace of
   bleaching, and exerts no appreciable effect one way or the other on the
   results.

difficult to exhaust a radiometer to such a point that it will not move to
a candle    placed a few inches off; but                        I
                                              have not jet succeeded in
stopping the movement of the beam in the torsion-apparatus.
     Along series of observations have been taken, at different degrees of
exhaustion, on the conductivity of the residual gas to the spark from an
                                                       I
induction-coil. Working with air, find that at a pressure of about 40
millionths of an atmosphere, when the repulsive force is near its maxi
mum, a spark, whose striking distance at the normal pressure is half an
inch, will illuminate a tube having aluminium terminals 3 millimetres
apart.               I
         When push the exhaustion further, the |-inch spark ceases to
pass ; but a 1-inch spark will still illuminate the tube.  As get nearer                I
to a vacuum more power is required to drive the spark through the tube ;
but at the highest exhaustions                    I
                                can still get indications of conductivity
when an induction-coil actuated with five Grove's cells, and capable
of giving a 6-inch spark, is used.
   When so powerful a spark       employed there
                                            .is      great danger of peris

increases to its maximum, and then slowly diminishes to zero, the log.
dec.     continuing to rise         till   it   shows that the internal and external pres
sures     are identical.        With       a     fine perforation several days are occu
pied in going through these phases, and they take place with such slow
ness  and regularity as to afford opportunities    for getting valuable
observations.
     The improvements           now added             by   Mr. Gimingham to the pump render
it so easy to obtain high exhaustions that, in preparing experimental
radiometers,  prefer to exhaust direct to one or two millionths of an
                 I
atmosphere.   By keeping the apparatus during this exhaustion in hot-                          a
air bath heated to about 300° C. for some hours, the occluded gases are
driven off from the interior surface of the glass and the fly of the radio
meter.   The whole     then allowed to cool, and attenuated air from the

In this manner, employing hydrogen instead of air for the gaseous resi

erroneous.   My most sensitive torsion-balance will, however, move easily

that    it
        expresses  the truth.  According   to  this the repulsion  due to     is
the internal movements of the molecules of the residual gas. When the
mean length of path between successive collisions of the molecules                     is
small compared with the dimensions of the vessel, the molecules re
bounding from the heated surface, and therefore moving with an extra
velocity, help to keep back the more slowly moving molecules which are
advancing towards the heated surface       thus happens that though the
                                                    ;   it
individual kicks against the heated surface are increased in strength in
consequence of the heating, yet the number of molecules struck                         is
diminished in the same proportion, so that there     equilibrium on the

two sides of the disk, even though the temperatures of the faces are un
equal.   But when the exhaustion     carried to so high

successive collisions    comparable with the dimensions of the vessel, the
                               is
swiftly moving, rebounding molecules spend their force, in part or in
whole,  on the sides of the vessel, and the onward crowding, more
slowly moving molecules are not kept back as before, so that the number
which strike the Banner face approaches to, and in the limit equals, the
number which strike the back, cooler face and as the individual impacts

causing the warmer face to retreat.
 I   have tried many experiments with the view of putting this theory to
a decisive test.  The repulsive force being due to reaction between the

This cannot well be tested with two different radiometers, as the weight

the bulbs is a small four-armed fly with roasted mica disks blacked on
one side.     The fly can be balanced on either cup. In the smaller bulb
there is about a quarter of an inch between the vanes and the glass,
whilst in the larger cup there is a space of half an inch. The mean of
several experiments shows that in the small bulb the fly rotates about 50
per cent, faster than in the large bulb, when exposed to the same source
of light.
     One of the arms of another radiometer was furnished with roasted
mica disks blacked on alternate sides. The other arm was furnished with
clear mica disks.       The two arms were pivoted independently of each
other, and one of them was furnished with a minute fragment of iron,
 so that by means of a magnet        I  could bring the arms in contact, the
 black surface of the mica then having a clear plate of mica in front of
it. On bringing a lighted candle near the instrument, and allowing it
 to shine through the clear plate on the blackened mica, the clear plate
 is at once driven away till the arm sets at right angles to the other.
     Two currents of force, acting in opposite directions, can exist in the
 same bulb.      I have prepared a double radiometer in which two flies are
 pivoted one over the other, and having their blackened sides turned in
 opposite directions.     On bringing a lighted candle near, the flies rapidly
 rotate in opposite directions.
     Experiment shows that the force can be reflected from a plane surface in
 such a manner as to change its direction.        If an ordinary radiometer is
  exposed to light the black surface is repelled, owing to the excess of
  pressure acting between it and the glass. If, however, a plate of mica
  were to arrest this force and reflect it back again, the motion should be
  reversed.     Experiment shows that this is the case. A two-disk radio
  meter was made, having flat opaque mica disks blacked on one side. In
  front of the black surface of the mica, about a millimetre off, is fixed a
  large disk of thin clear mica. On bringing a candle near, the molecular
  pressure streaming from the black surface is caught by the clear plate
  and thrown back again, causing pressure behind instead of in front ; and
  the result is rapid rotation in the negative direction, the black side now
  moving towards the light.
                                                     I
      To still further test this view of the action, made another radiometer,
   similar to the above, but having a clear mica disk on each side of the
   ordinary mica vane. This prevents the reflection of the pressure back
   wards, and causes it to expend itself in a vertical plane, the result being
   an almost total loss of sensitiveness.
      The above actions can be explained on the " evaporation and conden
   sation

            theory, as well as by that of molecular movement ; and     I  there
   fore devised the following test to decide between these two theories.

 were issuing from this surface, and keeps on moving as long as the

          is     This could not happen on the evaporation and condensa

the black surface in order to keep up continuous movement.

 1876.]               Mr. W. Crookcs        on the Radiometer.                      311
 and 107.      A   large series of observations have been taken with this
 apparatus, with the result not only of supplying important data for future
 consideration, but of clearing up many anomalies which were noticed, and
 of correcting many errors into which          I  was led at earlier stages of this
 research.     Among    the latter  may   be  mentioned     the speculations in which
 I  indulged as to the pressure of sunlight on the earth.
     Hitherto most of my experiments had been carried on with bad con
 ductors of heat. To get the maximum action of a radiometer it appeared
 necessary that no heat should pass through to the back surface, but that
 all should    be kept as much as possible on the surface on which the light
 fell*. At first     I  used pith, but since learning the advantage of raising
 the whole apparatus to a high temperature during exhaustion,               I have used
 roasted mica lamphlaeked on one side for the vanes ; for this purpose it is
almost perfect, being a good absorber on one face, a good reflector on the
other, a bad conductor for heat, extremely light, and able to stand high
temperatures.       Many experiments have been tried with metal radiometers,
some of the results being recorded in previous papers which                I  have read
before the Society; but being less sensitive than pith or mica instruments,
I    had not hitherto worked much with them.                     I  now tried similar
experiments to the above, using the best conductors of heat instead of the
worst ; and for this purpose thick gold-leaf was selected for the surface on
which to try the action of radiation.
     An apparatus was constructed resembling a radiometer with an opening
at the top, capable of being closed with a plate of glass. Through this                 I
could introduce disks of any substance            I  liked, mounted in pairs on an
aluminium      arm  rotating  on a needle-point.     The  first disks were of gold-leaf,
blacked on alternate sides. After exhaustion, a candle repelled the black
 surface of one of the disks, but, to my surprise, it strongly attracted the
black surface of the other disk.        I  noticed that the disk which moved the
negative way was somewhat crumpled, and had the outer edge curved so as
to present a slightly concave black surface to the candle.               I  soon found
that the curvature of the disk was the cause of the anomaly observed,
and experiments were then tried with disks of gold and aluminium — the
latter being chiefly used as being lighter and stiffer, whilst it acted in
other respects as gold.
    A radiometer the fly of which is made of perfectly flat aluminium plates,
lampblacked on one side, is much less sensitive to light than one of
mica or pith, but, as     I proved in my earlier papers, it is more sensitive to
dark heat. Exposed to light, the black face of a metal radiometer moves
away as if it were black pith.            When, however, it is exposed to dark
   *  I  have already shown that when a ray of light from any part of the spectrum falls
on a black surface the ray is absorbed and degraded in refrangibility, warming the black
surface and being emitted as radiant heat.         In this sense only can the repulsion
 resulting from radiation be called an effect of heat.

beat, either by grasping the bulb with the warm hand, dipping it into hot
water, or covering it with a hot glass shade, it rapidly rotates in a nega
tive direction, the black advancing, and continuing to do so until the tem
perature has become uniform throughout.                 On now removing the source
of heat, the fly commences to revolve with rapidity the positive way,
the black this time retreating as it would if light shone on it. Pith or mica
radiometers act differently to this, dark heat causing them to revolve in
the same direction as light does.
     The outer corners of the aluminium plates, which were mounted dia
mond-wise, were now turned up at an angle of 45°, 1 he lampblacked surface
being concave and the bright convex.                  On being exposed to a candle,
 scarcely any       movement    was  produced ;   when    one vane was shaded off the
 other was repelled slightly, but the turned-up corner seemed to have almost
 entirely neutralized the action of the black surface. A greater amount of the
 same corner was now turned up, the fold going through the centres of ad
 jacent sides. Decided rotation was now produced by a candle, but the black
 surface was attracted * instead of repelled.              Dark heat still caused the
 opposite rotation to light, repelling the black surface.
      The plates were now folded across the vertical diagonal, the black sur
 face being still inside and the bright metal outside.              The actions with a
  candle and hot glass shade were similar to the last, but more decided.
      The plates were now flattened, and put on the arms at an angle, still
  being in the vertical plane. When the bright surface was outside, scarcely
  any action was produced by a candle ; but when the lampblacked surface
  was outside, strong repulsion of the black was produced, both with a candle
  and with a hot shade.
      The square aluminium plates were mounted in the experimental appa
  ratus, one being attached to the arm by the centre of one of the sides, and
  the other by an angle.          The opposite corner of the one mounted diamond-
  wise was turned up at an angle. The outer convex surface of the diamond
  plate was blacked, and the side of the square plate facing the same way
   was also blacked, so that either two black or two bright surfaces were
   always exposed to the light, instead of a black and a white surface, as is
   usual in radiometers.        As might have been expected, both these black sur
   faces were repelled ; but the turned-up corner of the diamond-mounted
   plate proved so powerful an auxiliary to its black surface, that strong
   rotation was kept up, the square plate being dragged round against the
   action of light.
       Folding the plates with the angle horizontal has not so decided an action
   as when the fold is vertical.

have the black outside, and consequently more facing the side of the bulb,
greatly increases its sensitiveness.
     The above experiments show that shape has even a stronger influence
than colour. A convex bright surface is strongly repelled, whilst a con
cave black surface is not only not repelled by radiation but is actually
attracted.
     I  have also tried carefully shaped cups of gold, aluminium, and other
metals, as well as cones of the same materials.       I will briefly describe the
behaviour of a few typical radiometers made with metal cups, which              I

 of curvature is 14 millims.
      Exposed to a standard candle 3'5 inches off, the fly rotates continu
 ously at the rate of one revolution in 3'37 seconds. A screen placed in
 front of the concave side so as to let the light shine only on the convex
 surface, repels the latter, causing continuous rotation at the rate of one
 revolution in 7'5 seconds. When the convex side is screened off so as
 to let the light shine only on the concave side, continuous rotation is
 produced at the rate of one revolution in 6'95 seconds, the concave side
 being attracted.
      These experiments show that the repulsive action of radiation on the
 convex side is about equal to the attractive action of radiation on the
 concave side, and that the double speed with which the fly moves when
  no screen is interposed is the sum of the attractive and repulsive actions.
      No. 1037. A two-disk, cup-shaped aluminium radiometer, as above,
  lampblacked on the concave surfaces.
      In this instrument the action of light is reversed, rotation taking place,
  the bright convex side being repelled, and the black concave attracted.
      That this attraction is not apparent only, is proved by shading off the
   sides one after the other. When the light shines only on the bright convex
   side no movement is produced, but when       it shines on the black concave
   side, this is attracted, producing rotation.
      No. 1038.     A  cup-shaped radiometer similar to the above, but having
   the convex surfaces black and the concave bright.
       Light shining on this instrument causes it to rotate rapidly, the convex
   black being repelled. No movement is produced on letting the light shine
   on the bright concave surface, but good rotation is produced when only
   the black convex surface is illuminated.
       No. 1039. A cup-shaped radiometer like the above, but blacked on
   both sides.
       With this a candle causes rapid rotation, the convex side being repelled.
   On shading off the light from the concave side the rotation continues, but
    much more slowly ; on shading off the convex side the concave is strongly
    attracted, causing rotation.

   When either of these four radiometers is heated by a hot shade or
plunged into hot water, rotation is always produced in the opposite
direction to that caused by the light. On removing the source of heat the
motion rapidly stops, and then commences in the opposite direction (». e.
as it would rotate under the influence of light), the rotation continuing
as long as the fly is cooling. Chilling one of these radiometers with ether
has the opposite action to exposing it to dark heat.
   The vanes of radiometers have also been formed of metal cones, and
of cups and cones of plain mica, roasted mica, pith, paper, &c. ; and they
have been used either plain or blacked on one or both surfaces.       These
have also been balanced against each other, and against metal plates, cups,
and cones. The results are of considerable interest, but too complicated to
explain without great expenditure of time and numerous diagrams.        The
broad facts are contained in the above selections from my experiments.
    The action of light on the cup-shaped vanes of a radiometer probably
requires more experimental investigation before it can be properly under
stood.    Some of the phenomena may be explained on the assumption that
the molecular pressure acts chiefly in a direction normal to the surface
of the vanes. A convex surface would therefore cause greater pressure
to be exerted between itself and the bounding surface of glass than would
a concave surface.     In this way the behaviour of the cup-shaped radio
meter with both surfaces bright, No. 1035, can be understood, and per
haps also that of Nos. 1038 and 1039. It would not be difficult to test
this view experimentally, by placing a small mica screen in the focus of a
 concave cup where the molecular force should be concentrated.     But it is
 not easy to see how such an hypothesis can explain the behaviour of
No. 1037, where the action of the bright convex surface more than over
 comes the superior absorptive and radiating power of the concave black
 surface ; and the explanation entirely fails to account for the powerful
 attraction which a lighted candle is seen to exert on the concave surfaces
 in Nos. 1035, 1037, and 1039.
 II.  "Magnetic Observations made at Stonyhurst College Obser
       vatory from April 1870 to March 1876."             By the Rev. S.
       3. PERRY,   S J.,  F.R.S.    Received July 31, 1876.
    A  double series of magnetic observations are being carried on conti
 nuously at this Observatory. The monthly determinations of the absolute
 elements date from the year 1863, but the uninterrupted photographic
 record of the variations of the Declination and of the components of the
 Intensity was only commenced in 1867. The photographic curves of the
  Declination and Horizontal Force have all been measured,and are in course
 of reduction ; and the Vertical-Force curves will soon be taken in hand.
  The results of the first seven years' observations of the Dip and Hori
  zontal Force appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1871, and the

1876.]           Observations made at Stonyhurst College.                      315
present paper contains a precisely similar, and therefore comparable, reduc
tion for the following six years of all the elements of terrestrial magnetism.
In the former paper the general result was somewhat at variance with the
conclusions    arrived    at by Sir Edward Sabine from a discussion of the
Kew observations       ; and hence the necessity for this second paper, to dis
cover whether local influences or mere accidental errors would account
for the discrepancies.       The change of the station of observation during
the period from 1863 to 1870 introduced a probable source of error into
the first Stonyhurst series ; but that uncertainty is now removed, as all
the observations since 1868 have been taken in the fixed magnetic hut.
It will be unnecessary here to repeat what was said in Jthe former paper
on the subject of the instruments used in the observations, as these have
remained unchanged since 1863. The only alteration in the observations
themselves has been the substitution of weekly in lieu of monthly read
ings of the Declination from the beginning of the year 1872.

    Comparing this with results of previous years, we find the secular
acceleration to be on the increase, having been only 0-0042 for October
1st, 1866, and 0-0047 for January 1st, 1870.
    The above value of the secular acceleration is almost identical with
that found by Mr. Whipple from a similar discussion of the Kew obser

 greater when the sun is nearer the earth, which bears out the conclusion

 almost double the above number.                       The previous series of Stonyhurst

 attached to those observations on account of the correction for change o[

      This Table gives the winter period an excess of 1' 1" over that of
   summer, which agrees well with the mean of the values l'*31 and 0,-80
   found by Gen. Sabine and by Mr. Whipple from the Kew observations.
   The value obtained by Dr. Stewart for the period 1863 to 1869 is
   less than any of the above, and the result from the Stonyhurst observa
   tions taken during the same period is considerably below that of Dr.
   Stewart; but still every series makes the winter number greater than
   that for the summer.

  to Table I., we find for the summer periods the                   mean  Horizontal Force
   =   3-6321, and the mean Dip = 69° 30' 8" ; whilst for the winter periods
  we get 3-6362 and 69° 29' 35". If, then, we apply to the winter epoch
  the necessary corrections for secular variation,               we obtain for the common

   Contrary to the results of the former paper, these figures show a very
large excess in the intensity for the winter months, thus strongly con
firming the conclusion of the increase of the earth's magnetic force with
the nearer approach of the sun.    The late Kew reductions lead to the
same conclusion, but the difference for the seasons is not so large.
                                        The Magnetic Declination.
  To complete the reduction    of the absolute magnetic elements,       will                                                     I
now subjoin a discussion of the Declination observations, although the
Dip and Datensity were alone included in the former paper. It has been
thonght advisable not to apply any correction to the observed Declinations,
either for disturbances or for diurnal range, especially as the readings
were always taken within a short interval from 9 a.m.

                                                     §     1. Introduction.
      In presenting this communication to the Royal Society        wish to                              I
   state that      only an abstract of

                                                                     a
   subject which    hope to publish shortly, and which contains an account
                           I
   of experiments   with nearly seventy substances, most of which were
   never used before for such an investigation.       tried also nearly all             I
   the liquefied gases, and     considerable time was spent in preparing
                                                    a
   them for this kind of research, that was often interrupted by fearful
   explosions.   The invaluable opportunity which Mr. Warren De La Rue,
   F.R.S. granted me some time ago to try the same compounds with his
            ,
   very powerful battery, led to results which   hope the Society will not    I
   consider devoid of interest.
   I    entered on these experiments with the purpose of establishing,                                                   if
   possible,      a    relation between electrical                       conductivity and chemical consti

  1876.]            and Electrolysis in Chemical Compounds.                     323
  tution, and to ascertain       if the presence of hydrogen in the compound
 (and hydrogen can easily be replaced by other substances, especially
 metals) is connected with the liability to electrolysis.
    Though in former years some experiments were made in this way in
 Germany,    I  have now had the opportunity of extending them very much,
 as  I used the compounds which modern organic chemistry has taught us
 since to prepare.                                                 I
                          It is also important to remark that only tried sub
 stances which are in a fluid condition, or can be reduced to it without
 requiring a solvent. It is sufficiently known that the solvent generally is
 electrolyzed at the same time, and the results become very complicated ;
therefore the gases in their liquefied state were especially fit for exami
nation, the more so because several of them are very often used in che
mistry as powerful agents.           The gases were liquefied by the method first
 proposed by Faraday, in strong glass tubes, which had platinum wires
fused   in at their extremities ; these ends were brought close together, at
 a distance of 2, 3, or 4 millims., in the closed end of the tube ; this part
was, after the liquefaction took place, filled with the liquid gas.           With
 substances    liquid at the ordinary temperature and pressure, the same
arrangement was made, but of course there was then no difficulty.                 I
successively caused a current of 10, 20, 40, and 80 galvanic cells (greatest
size of   Bunsen's) to pass through the liquids, and connected them at the
same time with a very delicate galvanometer.               I also used the spark of
an induction-coil, the length of which exceeded 75 millhns.              With this
apparatus the condensed gases generally exploded, and the other sub
stances were decomposed by the thermal effect of the spark : it was a
case of dissociation.         As to the galvanic current, even the strongest
did not     pass in a perceptible way through the following compounds
(amongst others) : — liquid carbonic acid, liquid hydrochloric acid (nor any
other hydrogenated acid, as BrH, IH, with exception of CNH), liquid
cyanogen, bisulphide of carbon, benzine, tin tetrachloride, zinc-ethyl.
    Liquefied ammonia forms a remarkable exception ; it conducts the
galvanic current even of a moderate battery very well, and it is at the same
time electrolyzed ; with a battery of 80 cells apparently a new body is
separated, because the liquid becomes of an intense blue colour, and much
gas is evolved.        I shall communicate more particulars on this subject in
my aforesaid paper.
    Now, though it may be worthy of remark that a compound like hydro
chloric acid, when in the liquid condition, opposes a formidable resistance
 to a galvanic current,      which may be called very strong in comparison with

 been produced      :  it is the current of the chloride-of-silver battery of Mr.

  carry  on this   investigation,    he  not  only most willingly consented to my

§ 2. Effects of the Current of a Battery of 8040 cells on strongly insulating
   liquids.   By Dr. L. BLEEKBODE, aided by WARREN DE LA. RUE, F.R.S.
     At the time of these experiments, the battery, which has been already
the subject of some communications to the Eoyal Society, had attained
a number of 8040 cells, which could be separately used in different series,
so as to obtain currents of various intensity ; the longest spark produced
between a point positive and a disk negative in free air had a length of
8'5 millims. (0'348 inch). We tried only the liquids named above; though
few in number, yet they are interesting from their constitution and their
 importance as chemical compounds.
     The following notes wjre made as we experimented on the substances
 ready for examination.
                                 I. Ammonia (H, N).
     The current of 3240 cells confirmed the results obtained already on a
former occasion, when the ordinary galvanic battery of 80 cells was used,
 only the effect was stronger now.          Streams of a deep blue colour arose
 in the liquid gas, and the positive electrode assumed a black colour, much
 gas being evolved at the same time.           When the current ceases, the blue
 colour rapidly disappears, and the liquid becomes bright again.
                           II. Bisulphide of Carbon (CS,).
      We first tried the current from 3240 cells ; the negative electrode,
 some inches in length, was seen to be repelled from the surface of the liquid
 till it came in contact with the glass of the tube ; and it appeared from
 some floating particles that internal motions took place, probably caused by
 heat, though the hand did not detect any elevation of temperature.                The
 current from 5640 cells was too strong ; then the spark jumped between
 the electrodes, and these were covered with a brown tint (from a deposit of
 carbon).      We tried afterwards if a polarization current could be detected
 on a Thomson galvanometer; but this failed, yet the instrument was very
  sensible.    If    two fingers were placed on the ends of the connecting
  wires, the current which was excited by this contact was strong enough
 to cause the luminous index to fly away off the whole scale.
                                 in.  Benzine   (CJlt).
      With 3240 cells a strong vibratory motion was observed in the liquid.
      With 5640 cells this motion increased and became more apparent, also
  a  ringing sound (very similar to that emitted by the contact-breaker of             a

 his chemical laboratory in the Science Schools, South Kensington, and to his assistant,
 Mr. Cameron, for his valuable aid in preparing these substances.

moderate induction-coil when active) was heard. This was caused by one
of the electrodes, the longest, that passed through the whole tube, and
therefore was somewhat free in its movement ; the passage of the current
into the liquid set it in   a vibratorycondition, and the benzine presented
an undulating surface.    The effect was the strongest when the wire was
negative, and the surface of the liquid was then depressed ; when the
long wire was positive the contrary was observed, the vibrations were
less and the fluid ran up the wire. 'VVe did not find any sign of a polariza
tion current.
   The peculiar phenomenon of vibrations seems to be connected with a
beautiful experiment which Mr. Warren De La Eue discovered before.
'When one of the terminal wires of the battery of 8040 cells ended in a
flat horizontal copper disk, and the other in a very fine platinum wire
('002 inch) placed above     it,
                               little further than the striking distance, the
                                  a
platinum electrode being negative, the electricity streamed out of the
wire with luminous appearance but the wire was at the same time in
             a                         ;

                             it        luminous circle (sometimes chang
                                           a
ing into an ellipse).    When the platinum wire was positive the vibra
tions were not so strong, and therefore the radius of the circle described
was less.
                          IV. Tin
                              telrachloride (SnCl4).
   The current from 8040 cells passing through the liquid caused strong
vibrations when the long wire (electrode) was negative, otherwise the
vibrations were less when       was positive.
                                  it           We could not detect any
current caused       by
                  polarization,  nor any sign of decomposition.
                             V. Carbonic acid (C0,).
    We tried liquid carbonic acid gas at once with the current from
5640 cells.      This was too much for the small       space   between theelee-
trodes  the spark jumped between them, and the heat developed caused
         ;
the tube to explode with great violence. Notwithstanding we may con
clude that this liquid gas also must be  very bad conductor, as sparks
                                               a
never appear in conducting substances.
                          VI.   Hydrochloric   acid (HC1).
   The liquid hydrochloric acid gas was prepared from chloride of am
monium and concentrated sulphuric acid, which had been previously
put into the tube and brought gradually into contact the gas evolved
                                                               ;
had to pass through the acid, and was in this way deprived of moisture.
At first series of 216O cells was used, but without result, no action
             a
being visible    ;  afterwards we tried the current from 3240 cells, and
the  vibrations   in  the liquid were then very apparent       by
                                                             the undulating
surface  ;  at last 5640 cells were applied, when the ringing sound became
audible from the vibrating electrode.      We did not use the whole series
for fear of an explosion possibly occurring by the spark jumping yet the
                                                                       ;

326          Dr. L. Bleekrode on Electrical Conductivity                [Nov. 6,
experiment was sufficient to conclude that the liquid gas (which, dissolved
in water, belongs to the best conductors) opposes a formidable resistance
even to an extraordinarily strong galvanic current, and is not decomposed
in   a perceptible way.
                              VII.  Cyanogen    (C,N J.
    The current from 3240 cells did not produce any effect on the liquid
 gas. With 5G40 cells the vibrations were very apparent ; and again we
observed the same difference between the negative and the positive elec
 trode as with the benzine, the liquid running up the wire when it was
 positive.    No polarization was detected.
                           VHI.   Zinc-ethyl  (Zn(C2 Hs)2).
     With   3240  cells vibratory  motions   were observed in this liquid. They
 were very beautiful when the battery was increased to 5640 cells ; the
 temperature of the liquid augmented now sensibly.               Afterwards we
 detected a current caused by polarization of the electrodes, which pro
 duced a deflection of five divisions on the scale. We have therefore
 reason to conclude       that electrolytic action took place, which may be
 accompanied     therefore   by vibratory motions in the liquid, though a very
 strong galvanic current is required.
                                IX.  Benzine (C, He).
     The experiment     III.  with benzine was repeated in order to ascertain,
 if possible, whether     a current  could pass through a compound without
 electrolysis.   The whole series of 8040 cells was now applied, and the
  spark jumped between the electrodes.             A large deposit of carbona
  ceous matter was observed throughout the liquid, and was undoubtedly
  separated by the heat of the sparks.             We had another tube with
  electrodes at a somewhat greater distance, and the current was kept
  passing during two minutes. No sparks jumped, and the liquid was in a
  strong vibratory condition, showing that the electricity was transmitted,
  yet we could not afterwards detect the slightest deflection caused by
  polarization.    We observed also that the electrodes after the experiment
  were still very clean.     Now it must be remarked that with liquids which
  proved   themselves    extremely bad conductors, the absence of a polariza
  tion current, when tested with the galvanometer, cannot lead to the con
  clusion that no electrolysis at all took place ; for the great resistance
  which the current of the whole battery of 8040 cells had to overcome in
  the case of benzine was so much weakened, that it caused only a deflec
  tion of about 55 divisions on the scale of the sensitive Thomson galva
  nometer placed in the circuit ; the same resistance in the liquid was
  obviously opposed to the feeble current that might result from polari
  zation, which must therefore be unable to act on the galvanometer.         The
  polarization current can then be no longer applied as a test for electro
  lysis in all cases.

 1876.]            and Electrolysis in Chemical Compounds.                         327
    If  the same current was conducted             through pure water, immediately
a copious     quantity of gas was evolved, but nothing of a vibratory motion
in  the liquid was visible.        This seems only to occur in the case of highly
insulating liquids, and illustrates the conduction of electricity in the way
which was called by Faraday " the carrying discharge ; " this acts me
chanically; and it appears that the greater part of electricity is then trans
ported by the molecules without their splitting up, as in the case of
electrolysis.
    The results of the experiments carried             on in this investigation,  with
regard to electrolysis, may thus be stated            :—
    1.   A general connexion       between definite chemical characters and lia
bility to electrolysis     seems not to exist.        The character that a compound
 contains hydrogen, which is easily replaced by a metal or radicals, or
that it contains a metal for which another may be easily substituted, is
not always accompanied with the conductive power that is required for
 electrolysis.    With liquid ammonia this is the case, but with zinc-ethyle
 (which     in  contact  with air bursts into flames, and is destroyed from its
Zn changing into ZnO), benzine (which is easily transformed in different
 compounds by substitution), and tetrachloride of tin an enormous resist
 ance is offered to the most powerful galvanic current ever used.
    2. Sometimes a very bad conductive power is accompanied by a great
 difficulty in getting the hydrogen replaced in the compound.                    A re
 markable      example of this fact is offered by liquid hydrochloric acid ;
 this compound was kept for months, even years, in contact with strips of
 zinc, and up to the present time very little action is perceptible.
 Gore* has communicated several experiments of this kind with similar
 results.
    3. It appears that it is not the nature of the actual constituents in the
 compound which renders it proper to conduct electricity ; but that this
 is more dependent on the inner arrangement of the molecules.
     4. Although in the case of very bad conductors, as liquid carbonic acid
 and liquid hydrochloric acid, no test for electrolysis can be applied,
 yet it must not be concluded that they may not be decomposed by elec
 trical agency. By using spirals of zinc and platinumf twisted together
 for   a considerable space of time, they were actually split up           ;  this fact
 shall be further elucidated in the paper mentioned in § 1.

lieres that it has not hitherto been treated at much length.    The paper,
of which the following is an abstract, is an attempt to investigate the
results of the supposition that the earth is slowly changing its shape,
with especial reference to the effects on the obliquity of the ecliptic and
on the geographical position of the earth's axis of figure.
   1. This part of the paper is devoted to the consideration of the pre
cession and nutations of an ellipsoid of revolution which is slowly and
uniformly changing its shape.   The change is supposed to proceed from
causes internal to the earth, and only to continue so long as the total
changes in the principal moments of inertia C and A remain small
compared to their difference, C— A.
   The problem is treated by means of M. Liouville's extension of Euler's
equations of motion of a rigid body about a point *.  By an approximate
method        these equations          may         be       treated as          linear,   and the solution
divided into two parts.
   Let 0 be the obliquity of the ecliptic ; II cosec 6 the precession of the
equinoxes ; — n the angular velocity of rotation of the ellipsoid ; A -f at,
A + Af, C+ct the principal moments of inertia at the time t. Then it
is shown that the secular effect on the obliquity of the ecliptic, as result
ing from the motion of the principal axes in the body (which constitutes
the first part of the solution), is given by the equation
                                    dd      -      -    n a+!i-2c           .

and as resulting from the change in the impressed forces, due to the
change of shape of the body (which constitutes the second part), is given

   The former part may be neglected compared with the latter.         But
from such geological changes as we are entitled to assume in the case of
the earth, the total change in the obliquity of the ecliptic must be
exceedingly small.    Even gigantic polar ice-caps during the Glacial
period could not have altered the position of the arctic circle  so much                        by
as   inches
     3        and this
                ;         the most favourable redistribution of matter on
                               is
the earth's surface for producing that effect.  Thus the obliquity of the
ecliptic has remained sensibly constant throughout geological history.
   It also shown that, during any gradual deformation of the ellipsoid,
         is
the instantaneous axis of rotation will always remain sensibly coincident
with the principal axis of figure.

velocity, and is coincident with the axis of figure every 306th day (in
the earth).     This circle touches the meridian along which the axis of
figure   is travelling in consequence of the deformation of the earth's
shape. The diameter of the circle is shown in a particular case (not un
favourable to produce a large effect) to be less than -y^-g".     But although
this inequality appears to be so small, it is of interest and is discussed
at some length.       It is shown that,  if the earth  be  not quite rigid, this
inequality might have the effect of modifying the path of the axis of
figure in the body, in consequence of readjustments to a figure of
equilibrium.
   Various hypotheses as to the power of adjustment are considered, and
the paths of the instantaneous and principal axes in the precession of a
viscous spheroid undergoing deformation are found.
   It is maintained that although the earth may be sensiblv rigid to the
tidally deforming forces exercised by the sun and moon, it would not be
so to considerable departures from the figure of equilibrium, such as
would arise from a wandering of the pole of figure from its initial
 position ; and that readjustments to an approximate form of equilibrium
probably take place, at considerable intervals of time, impulsively by
means of earthquakes.         Such periodical adjustments would not sens1bly
modify the geographical path of the principal axis as due to terrestrial
deformation.      But it is held that during the consolidation of the earth
there must have been great instability in the geographical position of the
 poles.    Throughout the rest of the inquiry, however, the hypothesis of
the earth's sensible rigidity, together with the possibility of more or less
rare impulsive readjustments to the figure of equilibrium, is adhered to.
In consequence of these results dynamical considerations may be dis
 missed, and it only remains to consider the kinematical question of the
change in the earth's principal axes due to any deformation of its shape.
   2. Formulae for this end are here found, and are adapted for numeri
cal calculation.     It is assumed, in the first place, that the deformation is
such   that  there  is no change in the strata of equal density ; and accord
 ingly all suppositions as to the nature of the internal changes accompany
ing geological upheaval and subsidence are set aside.
   3. The forms of continent and depression are next investigated, which,
for the transport of a given quantity of matter from one part of the
earth's surface to another, would cause the maximum deflection of the
principal axis of greatest moment — subject, however, to the condition that
the layer excavated or piled        up  shall  nowhere   exceed a given   small
fraction of the earth's radius.
   It  is shown that the continents and depressions must be of uniform
height and depth ; there must be two of each, all similar to one another;
that each has one of its own kind diametrically opposite to it ; that they
are in shape sphero-conics, formed by the intersection of a certain
elliptic cone with the sphere     ; that the centres of the four sphero-conics

are all on the same complete meridian and all in latitude 45°. A Table
of numerical results depending on the values of certain elliptic functions
is given.
    4. In this part an endeavour is made to collect evidence as to the
extent to which the earth may have undergone deformation from geolo
gical changes. The object is to discover what are the largest areas over
which there has been a consentaneous rise or fall, and what is the great
est vertical amount of that rise or fall ; also to determine how the
erosion of the land and the sea affect the local excesses or deficiencies of
matter on the earth's surface.      The areas and amounts of elevation and
subsidence    which  on a sealess   and rainless globe are equivalent, as far
as producing excesses or deficiencies of surface matter, to those which
obtain on the earth are referred to as " effective ; " and it is only the
effective elevation or subsidence which we require to know in order to
determine the shift of the earth's axis.
   The evidence as to area is very meagre, because precise boundaries to
regions of elevation and subsidence cannot be assigned ; but, faute de
mieux, the author's father, Mr. Charles Darwin, marked out for hin1 on
a map an area in the Pacific Ocean which (on account of the structure
of the coral islands) he believes to have undergone subsidence within        a
recent   geological period.     From a consideration of this and of other
points   the   author  believes  that from -^ to -fa of the whole earth's
surface may, from time to time, have undergone elevation and sub
sidence.    The greatest vertical effective amount of rise or fall cannot be
determined from geological evidence, because of the effects of erosion
and of the influx of the sea into parts below the mean level of the earth.
   The only way of determining the point seems to be to find what is the
difference of mass, standing on unit area of the earth's surface, in an
ocean of, say, 15,000 feet deep, and in land of, say, 1100 feet high.
From this difference of mass the effective elevation of an ocean-bed in
its conversion into land can be at once determined.          Taking the above
numbers, it is found to be 10,436 feet; and in the examples given in the
following part, the deflection of the polar axis, for an assumed effective
elevation of 10,000 feet, is given in each case.
   It is then pointed out that if the deformation of the earth were of
very wide extent, the level surface of the sea would approximately follow
the rocky surface, and that thus there might be sufficient change in the
earth's shape to sensibly affect the position of the principal axis, without
there being any geological signs of elevation or subsidence.
   5. Numerical application is now made of the preceding work to the
case of the earth, and, as before stated, all the results are given for 10,000
feet of effective elevation.
   The first application is to continents and seas of maximum effect, and
a Table of results is given.      It may be here stated that if ^fa of the
earth's surface is elevated, the deflection of the pole is 11 j'; if ^0-,

332       Influence  of Geological     Changes   on  Earth's Axis.      [Nov. 23,
1°46|' ; if -iV, 3° 17'; and if £, 8°4£' *. In each case an equal area
is supposed to fall simultaneously.
    Other examples are then given for continents and seas which do not
satisfy the maximum condition ; in some the boundaries are abrupt cliffs,
in others shelving.
    The conclusion     is arrived   at, that a single large geological change,
such as those which        obtain on the earth, is competent to produce an
alteration in the position of the pole of from one to three degrees of lati
tude, on the hypothesis that there is no change in the law of internal
density.
    6.   Various hypotheses    as to the nature   of the internal changes accom
panying the deformation        of the earth are discussed.
    First, it is shown that   if upheaval and subsidence are due to a shrink
ing of the earth as a whole, but to the shrinking being quicker than the
mean in some regions and slower in others, the results are the same as
those previously attained.
    Second, the increase of surface       matter   due to the deposit of marine
strata also gives the same results.
    Third, the hypothesis that upheaval and subsidence are due to the
intumescence or contraction immediately under the regions in question
is considered.      Under certain special assumptions, too long to recapitu
late,  it is shown that the previous results must         be largely reduced.      A
Table of the values of the reducing factor for various thicknesses of the
intumescent strata is given ; from which it appears that if the stratum
is tolerably thin and at all near the surface, the deflection of the pole is
reduced to quite an insignificant amount.             Even if the intumescence
extends right down to the centre of the earth in a cone bounded by the
elevated region, the results would be only about | of the former ones.
Hence it appears that the earlier results can only be stated as a superior
 limit to what is possible.
    7. In conclusion it is pointed out that if the earth be quite rigid, no
 redistribution of matter in new continents could ever cause the deviation
 of the pole from its primitive position to exceed the limit of about 3°.
 But if the previously maintained view is correct, that the earth readjusts
itself periodically to a new form of equilibrium, then there is a possibility
of a cumulative effect ; and the pole may have wandered some 10° or 15°
from its primitive position, or have made a smaller excursion and
returned to near its old place. No such cumulation is possible, however,
with respect to the obliquity of the ecliptic.
    It is suggested that possibly the glacial period may not have been
 really one of great cold, but that Europe and North America may have
 been then in a much higher latitude, and that on the pole retreating
 they were brought back again to the warmth.             There seems to be, how
 ever, certain geological objections to this view.
   * The area of Africa is about '059, and of South America about '033 of the earth's
surface.

 II. "On          the   Structure and Development of the Skull in the
         Urodelous Amphibia." — Part I. By W. K. PARKER, F.R.S.
         Received November 9, 1876.
                                          (Abstract.)
     Through the kindness of several friends*               I have been enabled to work
 out the development of the skull in a Salamandrian type, which can now
 be compared with that of a Batrachian.
     I was the more anxious to do this work perfectly (it had been done in
 part) because Professor Huxley showed me, some two years ago, certain
errors in my first paper on the Batrachian skull; and                        I wished not
only    to  go   over   that  ground again,     but     also  to  have the morphology of
the Salamandrian type of skull quite mastered, so that the two might be
compared together.
    Moreover one important error in my first paper (on the Frog's skull)
arose from my taking it for granted that a certain element, the " stapes,"
arose similarly in the two groups.             Also an impetus was given to me by
the publication of Professor Huxley's article on the " Amphibia in the
                                                                                   "

                                 I
    In the present paper have shown the condition of the skull in nine
stages of the Axolotl (Siredon) ; and then, as a tenth stage, the skull of
Amblystoma is given, the Salamandrian into which certain individual
Axolotls pass when they take on a higher metamorphic condition.
    But the earlier stages of the cranium of Siredon are well illustrated by
what is seen in the lower Perennibranchs.                      Prof. Huxley's interesting
Menobranchus is not nearly so low and simple a type as that here given
by me, namely Proteus.
    Moreover the truly Salamandrian Amblystoma is not an average kind
of " Caducibranch," but differs from the majority of the species in several
particulars.        Serionuta perspmllata, one of the smallest of the order, is a
good average type ; and happily a little larva of this species gives me an
intercalary stage between my third and fourth of Siredon.
    The materials here offered to the Eoyal Society are but a portion of
        I
what could have offered ; but as the bulk of such a communication would
have been far greater than            I  can ask space for,        I have here and there
made reference to unpublished             matter on the skull of a number of these
 tailed Amphibians.
    After describing       theae   skulls in their   stages, and through    their changes,
 I have    made a somewhat detailed comparison                of  the Salamandrian with
 the   Batrachian type of skull.

 334               Mr. W. K. Parker      on the  Structure of       [Nov. 23,
    Then, at the end,   as I am spending my life not to illustrate the cranial
 morphology    of  this  type or of that, but as digging down to find one
common root,     I  have made an incipient attempt at showing what is
common     to  the  whole   series of the Vertebrates — of the brain-bearing
Vertebrates,    at any rate.
    It is evident that beneath the neural axis, which arises in " epiblast,"
there is a foundation, laid in
                                  " mesoblast," of the whole animal, from its
 snout to the end of its tail.
   This foundation, or rather root-stock, is double, and each moiety lies
right and left of a truly azygous structure, the notochord — a structure
which, according to some, arises in the mesoblast also, but which,
according to the latest and best observations (namely, those of Mr.
Balfour), arises, in the Selachians at least, in the lowest layer, the
" hypoblast."
   Whether the notochord is mesoblastic or hypoblastic, at present is not
of vital moment to the morphology of a vertebrated animal : the im
portant points are that the notochord is universal, and that it always
passes some distance into the skull.
   There are several important modifications in the region of the head, as
compared with the body generally, that make the problem of cranial
morphology an extremely difficult one.
   To mention some, there are : — (1) the swelling of the neural axis into
three vesicles ; (2) the flexure of the head upon itself ; (3) the develop
ment of three pairs of sense-capsules, that press upon its sides and
mingle with its structures ; (4) the union of a palatal divertieulum with
the brain to form the pituitary body, thus arresting the median noto
chord ; and (5) the dying out of the pleuro- peritoneal space in the region
of the throat.
   Thus the modifying causes are manifold in the head of a vertebrated
animal, — some of them showing their effects very early in the life of the
embryo ; whilst others, that relate to the specializations of the parts of the
cranium and of the parts of the face, the parts that encircle the mouth and
sense-capsules and that form the basket-work of the branchial appa
ratus — these appear later.
   For details of what can be seen in the growing skull of a Salamandrian,
I  must refer to the main paper.        Here   I may remark that, while the
development of the Batrachian skull seems strongly to favour the doc
                                     "                 "
trine of the facial nature of the jiro-notochordal bands (" trabeculae "),
the study of the Urodelous type suggests that they are truly basal
(basicranial).
   In front they are evidently facial, or belong to the visceral-arch series,
and are axial to the premaxillary arch ; but in the internasal and inter-
orbital regions they are very probably mere continuations of the para-
chordal tract of mesoblast which in the trunk gives rise to the bodies
of the vertebrae.

     The difficulty with regard to the existence of another preoral arch is now
  settled ; the so-called " antorbital
                                             "
                                               cartilage of Urodeles is a distinct
  ethmo-palatine rudiment of a visceral arch, and crops up in several
  groups ; the pterygoid foregrowth of the suspensoriu1n is another thing,
  a sympleetic process, and not an independent arch.
      The Urodeles differ from the Batrachia in having an " ascending
               to their suspensorial " pedicle ; " only in Proteus is this absent,
            "
  process
  because only in this type does the trabecula fail to send upwards an ali-
  sphenoidal crest.
     Late or early, the Batrachia never fail to develop an epihyal              (hyo-
                                                                               " colu-
  mandibular) segment, and this is always specialized to form the
  1nella  auris."
     Proteus develops a large, and Siren and Menopoma a small, cartilage of
  this nature     : it is never specialized into a columella, however, in them.
 In    twelve other kinds    (" Caducibranchs ")    I have failed to find a rudiment
 of this segment.
     In   the Batrachia,    as  I  have shown     (the fact was first pointed out to
 me by Professor Huxley), the stapes develops in the fenestral cleft as an
 independent cartilage.
     In the Salamandrians,       as I long   ago asserted, the stapes is segmented
 off from the pre-existing cartilage of the floor of the periotic capsule.           I
 erred in supposing the frog's stapes to be formed in the same way.
                              I
     In the Batrachia, as correctly showed in my fir.it paper, a ray from
 the elbow of the suspensoriu1n becomes detached, to form part of the
 external     auditory apparatus ; not, however, the
                                                            " columella," as  I  sup
 posed, but the cartilaginous annulus tympanicus.
     That ring of cartilage       I correctly referred to the category of
                                                                              " bran
 chial rays," such as are seen in the Selachians : it is, in truth, their
 spiracular cartilage (that of the sharks, not that of the skates, which is a
free metapterygoid segment).
    As a rule, in the Urodeles, there is a suspensorio-stapedial ligment run
                                                "
 ning forwards beneath the " portio dura nerve ; in my chief instance, the
 Axolotl, there is, instead of this, a fascia passing over that nerve to the
 place of the spiracular ray of the tadpole, namely, the back of the sus-
 pensorium above.
    In the huge Menopome, which partly loses its gills, and in certain
 small true Caducibranchs (namely, Spelerpes salmonea, S.'rubra, Desmo-
(jiu1thus fuscus) there is a recurrence of the spiracular cartilage over the
portio dura.
    This generally attaches its small posterior end to the face of the stapes,
and then is encupped by the stapedial ossification : on one side of Des-
moynathus it does this, and on the other it is distinctly ossified, and not
fixed to the stapes.
    This succedanewn for the true columslla is very large in the Mono-
pome : it is a thick but somewhat flattened cartilage, in outline like a
    VOL. xxv.                                                          2 B

                  Mr. W. K. Parker        on the Structure $c.   of      [Nov. 23
bell-flower,    and having its broad-lipped end attached, like a snail's foot, to
the top     of the  back of the suspensorium, and its small roundish end, or
apex, set in a neat bony cup that grows from the face of the stapes.
    Nevertheless the
                         " spiracle" or " tympano-Eustachian cleft," is scarcely
at all apparent in the Urodeles ; in the Batrachia it is large within, but
never fairly open externally.
                        I
     In the Urodeles miss entirely the copious labial growth of cartilage
outside the true visceral arches ; and although Siren lacertina has horn
 011  its jaws,  I feel certain that its mouth is never suctorial even in a very
early stage.
     It  is not suctorial in the   " A glossal Toads," as I have   recently shown,
but they have a rich growth of labial cartilages.
     There are some more very important facts in the morphology              of the
 skull in the Urodeles that      I  am anxious to lay before the Society.
     The nasal roofs are free, independent " paraueurals," and not mere
 outgrowths of the trabeculae ; thus they correspond with the eyeballs and
ear-capsules.
     The trabeculae cranii appear much later than in the Batrachia, and are
at first (a) relatively much smaller, and (li) have three or four times as
much of their substance situated parachordally.
     The hinder half of the basilar plate, or " investing mass," is formed as
a pair of distinct cartilages.       The trabeculae chondrify four or five days
later than the visceral arches, and the " parachordals
                                                                 "
                                                                     ten or twelve
days later than the trabculae.
     My earliest observations of the notochord, in unhatched Axolotl         " fry,"
show only a moderate downbend of the apex of the notochord.
    But Mr. Balfour's observations show that in Selachians it is like a
sheep-hook ; mine, on older embryos, show a moniliform condition of the
notochord in front, seemingly due to pressure in growth against the
pituitary gland.
    I  have not seen in Amphibia what Gotto shows in the Bombinator
Toad,      namely, a cartilaginous notochordal sheath; this is well seen,
however, in embryo sharks and rays.
    But nothing seen in sharks and rays is more suggestive than what               I
am in this paper describing in the Urodeles, for they form two rudimen
tary vertebral centra behind the pituitary body.
    Besides this, in several kinds, that part of the notochord which, in the
" Sauropsida," is
                      jammed in between the investing-mass cartilage, where it
forms the median occipital condyle, is in certain Urodeles formed into a
small, imperfect, intercalary vertebra.
    This vertebra is formed of a pair of " parachordal " patches of carti
lage and a tract of notochord which gets its own bony sheath ; the side
pieces ossify independently (in Spelerpes rubra), and then coalesce with
the anterior part of the notochordal segment.
    We have thus, in front of the vertebra which serves            as the  " atlas "

1876.]            the Skull in the Urodeloua Amphibia.                   337
to carry the head, an imperfect vertebra with a broad fore end : in the
adult (Spelerpes, Triton) this joint has coalesced with the head-carrying
vertebra, and forms its odontoid process ; it then resembles the true
odontoid process of an ox or sheep.
   I  cannot refrain from coupling the facts above given with another,
namely, that the
                     " hypoglossal " is a spinal nerve in these and other
Ichthyopsida.    That the fore end of the notochord should vary in the
cranium of different types of Vertebrata is not to be wondered at ; the
two evanescent vertebral rudiments in the hind cranium of the Urodeles
and the intercalary joint may be set over against what         I have lately
made out in the Selachians.
   In the Sharks the cartilage on each side of the notochord in the neck
(itself ensheathed in cartilage) is some time before it breaks up into the
moieties of centra, and these do not correspond in number \\ith the
neural arches.
   In  the Bays we have a similar state of things    ; but I cannot discover
any segmentation of the cervical parachordal tracts, even in young
unhatched skates that have acquired their final form.
   In this very imperfect abstract   I  have made mention of those things
that have produced the greatest effect upon my own mind, not caring
so much for order as for suygestiveness.     A true theory of the skull does
not yet exist ; it draws near, however, to the time of its delivery.

     GENTLEMEN,
THE annals of the Eoyal Society show that the year ending with this
Anniversary presents no falling off in the value and interest of the com
munications brought before our meetings, as compared with previous
years, and indeed surpasses them in number and extent of publications,
and in demands on the time of your Council. We have been called upon
more frequently than ever to aid in giving effect to those efforts for the
advancement of natural knowledge which, whether originating in private
enterprise or in the Councils of the State, have marked the year as a
memorable one     in the history of science.
   Before, however,      proceeding to the historical summary which this
statement    involves,   I  have to discharge the always painful task of
recalling to memory the names of the most distinguished of our Fellows
who have died since the last Anniversary. In Science we have lost Mr.
Bennett, Mr. Campbell De Morgan, Dr. Parkes, Mr. Poulet Scrope,
Dr. Sibson, and Lieut.-Col. Strange ; in letters and public services, the
Eev. Dr. Bosworth, Lord Lyttelton, Earl Stanhope, and the Eev. Dr.
Wilson ; and the names of the botanist Brongniart and the veteran
microscopist    Ehrenberg disappear from the list of Foreign Members.
    As regards the part taken by your Council in the labours of the
year now expired,     I feel it to be my duty, as it is, indeed, my pleasure,
to inform you, so far as the limits of an Anniversary Address will
 admit, of the importance of those labours — and the more so, as without
this opportunity it would not be easy to make you acquainted in a way
commensurate with their value with the scientific services of your Council
as contradistinguished from their current duties.
    As anticipated in my "Address of last year, application has been made
to the Treasury for a grant to cover the cost of printing the decade
1864-73 of our Catalogue of Scientific Papers, comprising now more than
 100,000 titles ; and   I  am happy in having to announce that the applica
tion was acceded to     in  the same handsome spirit as that in which the
Lords of the Treasury, during Mr. Gladstone's administration, placed a
sum upon the Parliamentary votes to defray the expense of printing the
first six volumes. The value of this work becomes more and more appre
ciated with lapse of time ; and you will be glad to learn that the con
tinuation of this Catalogue from year to year has been ordered by your
Council as a permanent part of the Society's official work. As you are
aware, the expenditure for this work appears regularly in our annual
balance-sheet.
   Acting under a recommendation by the Library Committee, your Council
offered the custody of our collection of Oriental MSS. to the India Office
under certain conditions, viz. that the manuscripts which require binding
should be bound, and a Catalogue made of the whole collection.           The
Secretary of State for India in Council has accepted the offer with its

340                        Anniversary Meet1ng.                  [Nov. 30,
conditions; and at a fitting opportunity the collection will be transferred
to a locality where it will be in competent hands and be readily accessible
to students and scholars.
    Arrangements have been made for the publication of the Eeports of
the naturalists sent to Rodriguez and Kerguelen Islands in a separate
quarto form, with illustrations ; and a grant of .£100 from the Donation
Fund has been made in aid of the work. The botanical specimens
have been named, and are being distributed to the Herbaria of Kew, of
the British Museum, of the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens, and others.         A
complete set of the zoological collections will be deposited in the British
Museum, and the remainder distributed among the Museum of the
Eoyal College of Surgeons of London and the Museums of Edinburgh,
Dublin, Oxford, and Cambridge.
                                               "
    The Eeport on the results of the " Eclipse Expedition has been drawn
 up by Mr. Lockyer, and is far more satisfactory than could have been
anticipated, considering the unfavourable conditions which prevailed
 during the whole of the time the observations were being made. It now
•appears that the light which photographs the prominences does not come
from hydrogen, but most probably from calcium, while the photograph of
 the corona with the prismatic camera shows that its chief light is derived
 from the hydrogen.     The complete account of the eclipse will appear in
                    '
 our ' Proceedings very shortly.
    For the financial state of the Society I must refer you to the balance-
sheet prepared by our Treasurer now in your hands.           It shows that
our resources have been increased by receipt of the Dircks bequest,
 £878 12s. lOd. A further increase will occur towards the end of the
 year by the incoming of the .£2000 Consols to which we are entitled under
the will of our late Fellow, E. C. Carrington.      Besides these, an addi
 tion has been made to our Trust Funds by the settlement of the long-
 pending question of the Handley bequest.           The amount ultimately
 awarded to us was £6378 19s., the balance of which, after payment of
 legacy duty and certain legal charges, has been invested, as may be seen
in our balance-sheet, in Eeduced 3-per-cent. Stock.
    The Donation Fund has been increased by the receipt of the .£500 be
 queathed by our late Fellow, Sir Charles Wheatstone, raising the total to
 £6333 10s. 4d. Additions to this fund are greatly to be desired : it is
 applied, as you are aware, in aid of research ; and a very strict account
 is kept of its expenditure.    Were such a fund at all what it ought to
 be, considering the amount of capital accumulating in this country, in
 great part the direct outcome of scientific inquiry, we should have fewer
 complaints of the insuff1ciency of means of encouragement for research.
    To Sir Charles Wheatstone we are further indebted for a valuable
 collection of portraits of scientific men, including one of the devisor,
 and one of Boyle (by Kneller), both in oil.     Mrs. Selwyn has presented
 the negatives of the eleven years' series of photographs of the sun-spots

1876.]                      President's    Address.                           841
(more than 2000) taken at      Ely, from 1863-1874, under the late Canon
Selwyn's instructions.
    You will share my feeling of pleasure when     I inform    you of the deposit
in the hands of our Treasurer of          a munificent     contribution, .£6000,
to be devoted to the aid of scientific research, by Mr. Thomas Phillips
Jodrell, the founder of the Chair of Animal Physiology in University
College, London, and donor of the Laboratory of Physiological Eesearch to
the Establishment at Kew. Early in last year, Mr. Jodrell informed me by
letter that it was his wish to place at the disposal of this Society, as the
one body in which all branches of British science are represented, this
generous sum, to be applied (principal as well as interest) in any manner
that the Society may consider most conducive, for the time being, to the
encouragement among our countrymen of original research in the physical
sciences — his object being not, on the one hand, to found a permanent
endowment for the benefit of a future generation, nor, on the other, to
relieve the Government of any part of its obligations to the present, but
to ascertain, as far as may be, by practical experiment on a limited scale,
to what extent the progress of original research in the physical sciences
is retarded in this country by the want of public support to those engaged
in it, and in what form an increased measure of such support would be
 most likely to promote its development.
    I   need hardly add that your Council, before whom       I  laid Mr. Jodrell's
 letter at once, thankfully accepted his offer, and appointed a Com
mittee to consider and to report upon the best means of giving effect to
 his liberal views. Before, however, the Committee had presented their
 report, we were informed of the intention of Her Majesty's Government
 to increase largely the funds placed at the Society's disposal in aid
of scientific investigations, and to allow part of the increment to be
 devoted to the sustentation or remuneration            of investigators — thus
 fulfilling the main desire which Mr. Jodrell had in new in making his
 donation.
    When    I communicated   the intention of the Government       to Mr. Jodrell,
 he signified his desire to reopen the question of the application of the
 ,£6000, which he still wished to leave in our Treasurer's hands ; for
 his object had been to induce the Government to do what, to the surprise
 of every one, it had done, and not to supplement a permanent government
 endowment by a temporary one of his own.              Whatever might bo the
 ultimate decision, he did not doubt that this Society would be the most
 competent agency for carrying it into effect ; and he suggested that the
 fund should be invested temporarily, and the question of its appropriation
 reserved until we should meet this session.          Finally, Mr. Jodrell has
 proposed    that the gross sum   should be  retained    in its present invest
 ment in the prospect of some want of it arising in the course of the next
 few years, and that the interest accruing in the mean time should bo
applied by the Society as part of our revenue. This proposal was willingly

342                         Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
accepted, and the best thanks of your Council have been presented to
Mr. Jodrell.
   In April   last I was   informed  by the Lord President of the Council
that  Her Majesty's Government      had under consideration the question of
giving further aid to scientific research, by increasing the Parliamentary
grant of £1000 per annum which is administered by the Council under
the recommendation        of the Government Grant Committee in aiding
investigators with apparatus and assistance.      They proposed in future
to augment the Grant annually for five years by £4000, to vest the
administration of the whole in the Science and Art Department, and to
invite the Society's Council to aid Her Majesty's Government, as hitherto,
with advice and assistance as to its appropriation and expenditure, and
further to give us the power of recommending, in certain cases, the
payment of personal allowances to investigators.         The communication
also advised that the Presidents of fifteen learned bodies in the United
Kingdom should be ex qfficio members of the Government Grant Com
mittee, — a change in its constitution more apparent than real, as the
majority of the Presidents specified were already Fellows of the Society.
After several conferences with the Minister, the original proposal was,
with his concurrence, modified, and made to apply to the additional
£4000 only, the administration of the original £1000 remaining as
heretofore, to be accounted for to the Treasury, and the recommen
dations of the Council with respect to the appropriation of the ad
ditional sum to be liable to revision by the Lord President, in whose
department the vote is taken, and who must be responsible to Par
liament for its expenditure.        With this proposal your Council con
curred, on the understanding that should it happen that the Lord Presi
dent found it inadvisable to act upon all your Council's recommendations
(which, in his Lordship's opinion, is never likely to happen), the Council
should have the opportunity of revising them, so that, if thought
desirable, the items of the grant to which exception had been token
might be allocated in some other way.
    There are therefore now two Government grants in aid of scientific
research, one of £1000 per annum, for the administration of which your
 Council is directly accountable to the Treasury, and which, as heretofore,
 will be appropriated to the providing of instruments and assistance for
 scientific inquirers : the other, of £4000 annually for five years, to be
applied to the aid of investigators, not only by providing instruments
and assistance, but occasionally by personal allowances or grants of
money, in accordance with recommendations          to  be made to  the Lord
President.
    The constitution of this new Committee is 'not yet settled ; but it
 will probably consist of the existing one, together with all the ex ojficio
 members as proposed.

1876.]                      President's Address.                       343
   Before dismissing this subject    I feel it to be incumbent on me to
express our obligations to His Grace the Duke of Eichmond and to Lord
Sandon, for the active interest they took in providing the grant, and for
the liberal manner in which they entered into the views of the Council
in respect of its appropriation.
   Two of the provisions of the Vivisection Bill called forth an earnest
remonstrance    from your Council, which was communicated by the Presi
dent to the Prime Minister in June last. These provisions were the
limitation of experiments, even under anaesthetics, to such only as can
be shown to contribute directly to the prolongation of human life and
the alleviation of human suffering ; and the prohibition of experiments
upon dogs. It was pointed out, in the communication to the Minister,
that, as regards both these limitations, the Bill went beyond the recom
mendations of the Eoyal Commissioners upon Vivisection for scientific
purposes ; and, in respect of the first of them, it was represented that
the history of physical science shows that all the great discoveries which
have contributed to the welfare of mankind have resulted from investi
gations pursued in the interests of pure science, without reference to
their practical application, and that to this rule physiology forms no
exception, since all the physiological truths which constitute the foun
dation of the rational practice of medicine have been ascertained by
experiments upon living animals, conducted by persons actuated by that
desire for the advancement of natural knowledge which the Eoyal Society
                                                     "
was instituted to foster ; and it went on to say : — Profoundly convinced
of the mutual dependence of all branches of physical science, the Presi
dent and Council feel that any legislation which arrests the development
of one is an injury to all, and they would lament the admission into the
Statute-book of a principle which is essentially antagonistic to the pro
gress of all Natural Knowledge."
   With respect to the second provision it was urged that, while the Bill
professed to regulate experiments only, it prohibited them in the case of
 dogs, although the constitution of the dog is such as to render it indis
pensable for some of the most important physiological problems.
   The receipt of this letter was followed by Lord Beaconsfield's com
municating with me on the subject, when          I  had the opportunity of
representing the views of the Council as being unalterable as to the
necessity of modifying, if not of rescinding, these two provisions.    The
Prime Minister promised and gave full and, as it has proved, favourable
consideration    to the Council's representations ; for, before the third
 reading of the Bill, its provisions were so modified as to place no
obstacle in the way of experiments on all animals for purely scientific
purposes by properly qualified persons.
   On a subsequent occasion, when time did not allow of my communi
cating previously with the Council,      I ventured, in the name of the

 844                        Anniversary     Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
Society, to request an audience with the Home Secretary, principally on
the subject of the clauses that limited the making of experiments to
registered localities, thus preventing physiologists from pursuing their
researches during their vacation travels, or at their temporary residences
at watering-places and other localities in which no registered institu
tion existed.     On this occasion also     I found a willing ear lent to the
Society's  voice, followed  by  a favourable   consideration of our representa
tions, special certificates being now procurable which enable the experi
menter to pursue his researches wherever he may be.              On the same
occasion   I urged  the confining the operation of the Bill to warm-blooded
animals, but with only partial success ; the provision which extended to
all animals was finally curtailed, so as to apply to the vertebrate class
only.    Lastly, a protest against the clause compelling all experimenters
to transmit to the Secretary of State a detailed report of all the experi
ments they might undertake, and their results, was more successful ; for
the   Bill now requires reports to      be made   only when called for by the
 Secretary of State.
   The Loan Collection    of Scientific Instruments. — In my address of last
year the proposed action of Government in reference to this important
object was stated, together with the opinion of the Lord President and
Vice-President of the Council, that it might prove the means of carry
ing out that recommendation of the Science Commissioners which dealt
with the want of a Museum illustrating methods of experimenting and
means of observing (see 4th Eeport, §93).         This was followed by a letter
from the Duke of Richmond addressed to myself, suggesting that the
Scientif1c Societies should organize in connexion with the Exhibition a
series of Conferences, similar to the sectional meetings of the British
Association.    This led to that brilliant gathering in May last of scientific
men from the metropolis and all parts of Europe (not fewer than thirty-
five from Germany alone), and from America, many of them charged by
their Governments to report on the collections, and to those public
lectures on the instruments and apparatus displayed by many of the
most eminent of these scientific men, which imparted such value and_in-
terest to the Exhibition.
   Among the objects so exhibited, amounting to 20,000 in all, were to
be seen specimens of the work or evidences of the genius of a considerable
proportion of the eminent scientific men and manufacturers of scientific
instruments from the days of Tycho Brahe and Galileo down to the present
day, together with a collection of the appliances for scientific teaching
adopted in many countries.
   It cannot fail to be a matter of congratulation that the objects lent
by the Eoyal Society were not surpassed in scientific value or in
historic interest by those of any other institution or country, though
among these are the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers of Paris, and

1876.]                    President's Address.                            345
the Museums of Berlin, Florence, and Haarlem. We contributed twenty-
seven articles, all of the best construction of their day, and which may be
regarded as monuments of the skill of famous makers. They include :—
Boyle's air-pump with double barrel, presented by himself in 1662;
Newton's original reflecting telescope, constructed by himself in 1671 ;
Huyghens's aerial telescope, with three object-glasses, of 122, 170, and
240 feet focal length, presented respectively by himself in 1691, by
Newton, and by the Eev. G. Burnet ; a large levelling-instrument used
in the Ordnance Survey ; two chronometers by Arnold, which were taken
round the world by Capt. Cook ; Capt. Rater's hygrometer ; Priestley's
electrical machine ; and Sir H. Davy's experimental Safety Lamp.
   The interest excited by the Exhibition is best shown on the one hand
by the number of visitors, which at the end of September amounted to a
quarter of a million, and on the other by the efforts made by a large body
of scientific men, who desire to   see effect given to the views of the   Lord
President in founding a permanent Museum of this nature. A memorial
to this effect, signed by more than one hundred scientific men, has been
addressed to the Duke of Richmond, representing the advantages of a
Museum of Scientific Apparatus, Appliances, and Objects, and of Chemical
Products — illustrating both the history and the development of Science —
with which the objects now contained in the " Patent Museum " should
be incorporated.       Among the advantages enumerated which would
accrue from such an institution, are the saving of time and labour to
investigators, assisting teachers, informing constructors of philosophical
instruments as to the directions in which reproductions are wanted, or in
which improvements may be effected, and possibly the lending instruments
to investigators under suitable restrictions.
   With regard to the advantage of combining the objects of the Patent
Museum with the general collection, it is pointed out that the value of
these objects as mere subjects of a patent is very imperfectly represented
by their separate exhibition, whereas it would be greatly enhanced were
they placed in juxtaposition with instruments of the same nature, which,
though unpatented, may be both better adapted to their purpose and of
greater instructive value.
   The Meteorological Office. — In my last year's Address  I
                                                          stated that the
Lords Commissioners of the Treasury had appointed a Committee to
inquire into the working of the Meteorological Office, and the value
of the results hitherto obtained by       it,
                                            and that the result of this
might  afford to  Her   Majesty's Ministers the opportunity of adopting
measures that would greatly increase the scientific efficiency and public
interest of that Office.
   The labours of the Treasury Committee are now concluded.            It
sat frequently during the whole of last session of Parliament, examined
many witnesses, scientific and practical, including the most eminent

 340                         Anniversary   Meeting.                  [Nov. 30,
 meteorologists   of this country whose attendance        could   be obtained;
 and a   report has been drawn up which will shortly    be  laid before Parlia
 ment.     It will include the answer of the Committee of this Society to
 a  letter addressed to the President and Council by a Committee of the
 Treasury requesting information on the following points : — 1. As to
 the extent to which the objects indicated in the Eeports presented
 by your President and Council in 1855 and 1865 for the guidance
 of the Office, had been attained by means of the labour and publications
 of the Office. 2. How far they had led to a better knowledge of the laws
 governing the weather, and to the discovery of new laws.          3. How far
 they had led to     the  collection of data, not otherwise procurable, that
 form a necessary basis for the establishment of new laws. 4. Should
 the same objects be further pursued ? and if so, in accordance with the
 programme of operations now in force ?          5. Should a change in the
programme of the operations appear desirable, what should their nature
be?
    The Committee of the Eoyal Society, which consisted of Sir G. Airy,
the Eev. E. Main, Professors Adams, Stokes, and B. Stewart, Dr. Guy,
 Messrs. De La Eue, Warington Smyth, Broun, and Spottiswoode, sent in
a series of recommendations to the Council that were embodied in a letter
addressed to the Treasury Committee.
    Tour Council reported that oceanic meteorology had been greatly
enriched by the investigations       made with regard to winds, currents,
and temperatures      of the ocean, and by the deductions obtained there
from, and that these contained results on which sailing-directions of
the most trustworthy character, for the use of navigators, can be con
structed.
    As regards terrestrial meteorology, that the number of stations for
which observations are signalled for the purpose of forecasts should be
increased rather than diminished ; and that these forecasts are justified
by the results of three-fourths of the cases recorded.
    That daily weather-charts are considered to have contributed     materially
to a diffusion of the knowledge of meterological phenomena among all
classes, and are on that account of great utility ; and, further, their pre
paration and issue are regarded as beyond the means of private estab
lishments, and eminently worthy the support of the Government.            That
the publications of the Office generally bear the impress of a scrupulous
regard to accuracy, and embrace a collection of data not otherwise attain
able, and supply a large mass of material of a nature indispensable to
the establishment of new laws ; and that all the work appears to have been
done in accordance with the recommendations of the Eoyal Society.
   As to the future of the Office, your Council were of opinion that the
programme now in force should be generally followed ; that the hitherto
unpublished results of oceanic observations should be brought out as soon
as possible, so that the meteorology of all navigable parts of the ocean

should be known ; that the rules followed in forecasting storms should bo
published for the information of future meteorologists ; that it would be
advantageous to publish weekly averages of the climate of the British
Isles for the use of agriculturists and collectors of statistics of health,
mortality, and the distribution of disease, these averages to be printed in a
tabular form, giving the results not only of the week but of the previous
week, of the corresponding week of the foregoing year, and of the aver
age of the corresponding weeks in the foregoing 10 years. That the
operations of the self-recording observatories should be continued as at
present, until the expiration of the 12-year sun-period, after which
the subject of their number and position might be advantageously
reconsidered ; and that special observations should at once be taken for
the purpose of comparing their records, ascertaining their local peculia
rities, and determining such constants as would ultimately permit of a
 large reduction of their number ; and with regard to the eye-observing

 your Council recommended that the Office should be presided over by                  a

fettered the investigation of the laws of climate.
                                                I
    It will not be thought out of place here if add a few remarks on the
present state of Meteorology as one of the physical sciences, the progress
it has really made, and the direction in which further progress is attain
able. In this    I  have been aided by General Strachey, a late member
of. the Treasury Committee, who, having studied meteorology in India as
well as in Europe, has kindly drawn up a statement of our views, and
placed it at my service for this Address.
   Without question, the chief point in which meteorology now differs
from what it was, is the recognition of the necessity for taking into con
sideration the facts observed at many places simultaneously over a large
area, instead of facts observed in succession at a single locality. This
great step has been no doubt mainly due to the extension of the electric
telegraph, which renders possible the rapid juxtaposition of observations
made over a very large area, and the equally rapid dispatch to great dis
tances of the results derived from the consideration of such observa
tions, thus furnishing the means both of acquiring the knowledge and of
making it practically useful.    A comparison of the first feeble efforts to
appreciate the nature of  the fluctuations of barometric pressure recorded
in the Eeports of the British Association for the years following 1843, and
chiefly due to Mr. Birt, and the beautiful synoptical charts now published
in many countries, of which those prepared by Captain Hoffmeyer may
be taken as an example, will indicate the great progress made in this
direction.  Charts such as these convey very complete information as to
how the chief variations of weather occur over the greater part of
Europe and the United States —though why they occur is yet too little
understood.    It    is,
                       unfortunately, still true that very little has been
done towards tracing out the physical causes of the changes of pressure
of the occurrence of which we are thus made aware but  ;       it  not to be
                                                                    is
doubted that, the facts being now presented to students in a readily
accessible and intelligible shape, no great interval  islikely to elapse be
fore the causes that produce them are ascertained, at all events
approximately.
  It   ispractically certain that the changes of atmospheric pressure are
1mmediately dependent on changes of temperature        ; but no intelligible
relation has yet been established between the two, except in the very
vaguest manner.       And this indicates the first great want of scientific
meteorology    — namely, an improved theoretical knowledge of the move
ments of elastic fluids subject to changes of temperature.    The difficulties
to be surmounted in this branch of mechanics are great but probably the
                                                           ;
means may be attained of subjecting the hypotheses that will eventually
form the basis of scientific meteorology to the rigorous test of mathema
tical calculation, though hardly the first step has yet been, taken in that
direction.

   For the purpose of bringing one class of the observations on which a
scientific meteorology must be based into a form suited for the application
of theoretical tests such as these, the harmonic analysis seems to supply
the necessary means.     This method may   be   familiarly explained   as having
for its object to break up any observed series of quantities representing        a
recurring phenomenon, such as the diurnal or annual variations of tem
perature or atmospheric pressure, into other series so arranged that each
observed quantity shall be conceived to be an aggregate consequence of a
number of different series of variations from the mean value — the first of
such series being completed but once in the whole epoch under considera
tion, the second recurring twice, or being completed in half the epoch, the
third recurring thrice, or in one third of the epoch, and so forth.
    The arithmetical computations requisite for thus transforming perio
dical observations being very laborious, Sir W. Thomson (adopting an idea
of his brother's, Prof. J. Thomson) has proposed to construct a machine
that shall perform the calculations with the aid only of the graphical pro
jection of the curve resulting from the recorded observations — an
illustrative model of which he exhibited to the Society in the course of
last Session, and an account of which has been published in our ' Pro
ceedings.'
  It is well to remark     that this treatment of meteorological or other
observations   gives no direct aid in referring the phenomena to physical
causes, and is only to be regarded as a means of bringing them into a
shape in which they can be compared with theoretical formulae or dyna
mical or other hypotheses.     It has too long been thought that the arith
metical manipulation of the results of meteorological observation was a
sufficient end to be attained ; and too often the necessity for seeking for
the efficient causes of the phenomena has been lost sight of. An alto
gether useless refinement has also frequently been insisted upou in re
cording observations of what, in a scientific sense, may be termed insig
nificant details ; and a wholly illusory appearance of accuracy has been
aimed at, far beyond what can in fact be attained.     The true conception
of averages    is,
                in meteorological calculations as in many others, very often
missed, and mean results are exhibited which have no real signification.
  The relation of meteorology to physics may be compared to that of the
natural-history sciences to physiology.     Physics include the study of the
forces the  operation   of which on the atmosphere gives rise to meteorolo
gical phenomena.      The intelligent application of physical research    un
                                                                          is
questionably  one  of  the most necessary elements   in the satisfactory pro
gress of this science and Professor Tyndall's study of the action of the
                     ;
air and other gases in relation to radiant heat affords an excellent illus
tration of the manner in which experimental investigation contributes to
the knowledge required to explain atmospheric phenomena.

of those germs that ever come to maturity, has often been                             a subject    of
comment.            I venture     to remark that a prodigal waste no less conspicuous
is to be seen   in the long rows of volumes on our shelves containing
meteorological observations which doubtless contain vast numbers of scien
tific germs, but germs not destined to fructify. It is without doubt one
of the most serious difficulties that attend our efforts at progress in this
science to determine what records to make, what to keep, what to publish.
So long as our knowledge                is so rudimentary,     we cannot properly judge
what is essential and what unimportant.                      Like many other difficulties,
this,    I
       presume, must be left to time for its             solution    ;    at all events,    I shall
not attempt it.

press upon all interested in it that it is to            well-directed thought on the
physical connexion between the many closely related atmospheric pheno
mena which are now so clearly presented to the student in the publi
cations of the present day, that we must look for real progress in the
science —and that it              will almost certainly      be   found        that   it is rather
through an examination of the better-known recurrent phenomena,
viewed broadly, that success will be secured, than by a laborious search
after deviations from what is of common occurrence.

successor Capt. Thomson, including twenty-nine charts of sections of the
great oceans, with soundings and isotherms for all depths from the sur

extends from lat. G0°N. to 10°N., expanding greatly in the tropics ; and
a southern one, commencing a few degrees to the south-eastward           of   the
other, exteuds far into the Antarctic basin, of which it may be regarded
as a northern prolongation.  Between the eastern and two western basins
a comparatively   narrow belt of subocoanic highlands extends from the
Arctic to the Antarctic circle along a sinuous line which, roughly speaking,
occupies a mid-channel course.
  Of the oceanic islands, the Azores,St. Paul's rocks, Ascension, and
Tristan d'Acunha are emerged peaks of these highlands.   The Bermuda
Islands rise out of immense depths in the N.W. basin ; Fernando de
Noronha and Trinidad Island (in 20° S. lat.) rise out of the S.W. basin ;
while not more than one island (St. Helena) is to be found throughout the
whole length of the Eastern basin.
   Not only is this discovery of great importance in relation to the sub-
oceanic distribution of life, but also in reference to theories of the distri
bution of land-animals and plants.          In the present state of our know
ledge,  it disposes of  all speculations as  to the former existence of tracts
of now submerged land, which, extending from the great continents to
the islands in question, might have aided the migration thither of animals
and plants ; and it obliges us to conclude that they were peopled with
living things by the direct or indirect agency of the elements.

movements of the sea-water at these stations, and with others relating
to the mineral matter covering the floor of the ocean.

be formed of the number of specimens fit for mounting for museum-
purposes which were collected in the deep sea; but ho thinks that

   of closely allied forms, requiring in many cases great care and skill to
  determine what among them should be regarded as types of species,
  and what as local or accidental forms of one species.
      In  the collection   of the abyssal fauna, Sponges and Ecbinodermata
 predominate ; and Sir C. Wyville Thomson expects that at least one half
  of these consists of undescribed and newly discovered species — an opinion
  in which lie is fortified by competent judges who have inspected the col
  lection.    Crustacea, Annelida, and Polyzoa are also well represented, and
 are to a great extent of new and remarkable forms. Pishes are numorous,
 but are for the most part referable to families already made known by the
 memoirs of the late Rev. It. Lowe ou the Fishes of Madeira.
     All   the specimens have been preserved in such a way that they can
 be investigated     anatomically in every detail ; and those who visited the
 biological laboratories on board the ship at Sheorness, and saw the extent
 and nature of the appliances for the preservation of soft animals of all
 sorts, may readily understand        how rich a harvest awaits the reapers who
 have sown so diligently.
     Considering how liberal has been the action of the Government
 hitherto, there cannot be a doubt of Sir Wyville Thomson's being placed
 in   a position that will enable him to superintend the publication of the
 results of this Expedition ou a scale and with a completeness commen
surate with their value and worthy of the nation.          Au unequalled oppor
tunity is now afforded him of investigating the phenomena of migration,
variation, of the first appearance, succession, multiplication, and extinction
of forms belonging to many orders of the animal kingdom — and this
over areas so extensive that they may be regarded as, in a certain sense,
the equivalents of geological periods.        For this purpose it appears essen
tial that the collections should be kept together under the eyes of the
naturalists who formed them, until every species and variety has had
attached to     it all the details respecting its habitat and environing condi
tions that were obtained when it was collected          ; otherwise  the primary
object of the Expedition will be frustrated.
     It  may appear superfluous to suppose that any other course would be
possible under the circumstances ; but that it is not so is proved by the
fact that, many and important as have been the collections made during
voyages of discovery and survey which have been dispatched from our
shores and brought to England, there is absolutely not one of them, from
the days of Cook to the present time, of which, so to speak, any thing
like the whole material has         been published.    True enough, this has in
some cases been attributable to a want of energy on the naturalists' parts;
but it has far more frequently been due to the parsimony or indifference of
the Government, which has refused the opportunity of study, or the means
of publication, or both.
                                    I
     Before leaving this subject, must mention the endeavour of our Fellow,
Mr. Sorby, to determine the nature of the Red Clays of the ocean-bottom,
                                                                   2 c2

of which we have heard so much. He informs me that, though any con
clusions now to be drawn from his observations must be provisional, it is
safe to consider that many specimens of the Eed Clay are so entirely analo
gous to what the Gault must originally have been, that those specimens
 might almost be looked upon as being as truly modern Gault as the
 Globiyerina-ooze is modern Chalk. In the Gault the grains of fine sand
 are chiefly quartz derived from the decomposition of schistose rocks. But
 the Pacific and Atlantic muds from great depths contain, besides quartz-
 fragments, others of glassy felspar, pumice, and other volcanic products ;
 and Mr. Sorby has not been able to detect any difference between the
 main mass of the Gault and other rocks which are composed of very
 minute granules like those derived from felspar or other minerals which,
 in a similar manner, easily undergo complete chemical decomposition.
 Independent, therefore, of the presence of different organic remains, and
 of the modern volcanic products, there is little or no difference between
 the Eed-Clay deposits and some of the earlier stratified rocks.
    The return of the Polar Expedition is too recent to allow of any
 accurate estimate being formed of the value of the scientific facts which
 it has accumulated.       Captain Nares, in his off1cial Eeport to the-
 Admiralty,    bears warm testimony  to the services (both as a collector and
 an observer) of Captain Feilden, who was selected by your Council as
 Naturalist to the Expedition ; and we have very good reason to believe that
 his and   Mr. Hart's contributions to Arctic Geology and Natural History
 generally will prove to be the most important and extensive ever obtained
 from the highest latitudes of the globe.
    From a communication with which Captain Feildeu has favoured me, it
 appears that there are no signs of a cessation of animal or vegetable life up
 to the furthest point reached by the Expedition: birds and mammals
 occur on the shores of the Polar basin in lat. 82° 45' ; and the sea it
 self abounds in Crustacea and Mollusca, which latter were collected in a
 fresh state chiefly on the recently raised beaches.     Of land mammals,
 the Lemming and its enemy, the Ermine, were found on the North
  Greenland     coast, between the parallels of 82° and 83°, along with
 twenty    or thirty species of flowering plants, including the beautiful
 Hesperis PaUasii, Saxifrcuja fayellaris, and Vtsicaria arciica.           The
 absence of whales from Smith's Sound was a noteworthy fact : we may
 assume that the great Mysticetus, which is almost extirpated in the
  Spitsbergen   seas, and which was traced up Baffin's Bay and to Prince
  Eupert's Inlet, is now hemmed in by the polar ice of Bank's Straits and
 MeClintock's Channel, and did not attempt to face the pack of Smith's
  Sound.    Birds, which abound in Baffin's Bay, were scarce in the Sound,
  owing to the cold tides and want of open water in the Polar basin ;
 nevertheless the Knot, the Sanderling, and the long-tailed Skua Gull
  were all observed to breed on the shores of that basin.

    Insects were found at the extreme point reached by Captain Feilden ;
 and, of the lower orders, Echinodermata were very common.              Among
 these is a beautiful  Comatula, identical with one dredged up in 82° 6'
by Captain Buchan, in the ' Dorothea,' in 1818, and afterwards by
Franklin in the ' Trent,' in lat. 82° 26'. As the latter localities are on
the east coast of Greenland, and this species had not been found previously
in any part of the American Polar sea, another reason is suggested for
concluding that Greenland is an island, and that the coast traced to the
                                                  '
eastward by the sledge expedition of the 'Alert is truly its northern one.
   The geology of Smith's Sound is very instructive, Captain Feilden
having succeeded in laying down its outline, at any rate, and connecting
its rocks with some of those of the Polar regions to the south. Gneiss,
syenite, and hornblende rocks extended from Cape Isabella, in lat. 78°, to
Hayes Sound, in lat. 79°, where they were overlain by marine beds of
Silurian conglomerates, full of fossils, dipping E. and W., and reaching
northward to Cape Collinson.       On the Greenland coast, in Bessel's Bay
and Petermann Ford, the same rocks are found. On the opposite coast, in
Discovery Bay, these fossiliferons rocks, if they ever existed, must have
been denuded, and are replaced by azoic slates and limestones presuma
bly answering to the Silurians of American geologists.         This formation
was traced to lat. 82°, where an anticlinal ridge occurs, the northern
strata of which dip to the N.N.E., and are, in lat. 82° 44', overlain by Car
boniferous limestones-
   Miocene strata were discovered near Discovery Bay, in lat. 81° 44',
including a 20-foot seam of coal rich in fossil plants.           Postpliocene
beds full of shells, and sometimes 400     feet thick, filled up the valleys,
and overlay hills 100 feet high ; these contained bones of the musk-ox and
seal, together with drift wood, all deposited as they might have been
under existing conditions.
   Drift pine wood abounds on the shores of the Polar Sea, no doubt
drifted from the Siberian rivers ; and birch wood occurred in the Sound.
   Evidence of a recent change of climate was met with in the numlier
of deserted Eskimo settlements, which were traced nearly as far north as
the parallel of 83°. One of the houses was roofed with large whales' ribs.
   I have  now, Gentlemen,   concluded my endeavour to bring under your
notice some of the principal labours of your Council during the past year,
together with their immediate and prospective results.          I should have
liked, had time permitted, to direct your attention to a few of the more
interesting papers and experiments that have been brought before us at
our evening meetings, and to point out to you that in the consideration
and preparation of papers for publication a heavy burden is laid on your
Secretaries and that longsufiering body the Committee of Papers.              It
would perhaps surprise you    could  you be  made   aware  of the  amount   and
importance of the work connected with papers which is performed by

your officers and the Committee.        It  is work which   only in its results
comes before the eye of the Society ; but       I think you will agree with me
that those results     show how  well and  faithfully the work has been done.

                      "
it was resolved — That the thanks of the Society be returned to the
President for his Address, and that he be requested to allow it to be
printed."
     The President then proceeded to the presentation of the Medals : —
     The Copley Medal has been awarded to Professor Claude Bernard,
Tor. Mem. E.S., for his numerous contributions to the science of Phy
 siology.
     It  fell to the lot of Claude Bernard to make, at about the same time,
 two discoveries of which it may be said that they have proved more
 pregnant of physiological interest than any two discoveries which have
 been made by the same man during the last five-and-tweuty years.
 Not only were the discovery of the glyeogonic function of the liver, and
 of vaso-motor nerves, of prime importance at the time at which they
 were made, but their subsequent influence on the progress of physiology
 has been such that it would bo diff1cult to overrate it.
     When, in 1853, Bernard published his work 'Sur une Nouvelle
 Fonction du Foie,' physiologists, notwithstanding the proof afforded by
 Liebig and others that animals are able to form fat out of the starch and
  sugar of their food, still clung with remarkable tenacity to the view that
  the great distinction between animal and vegetable life lay in the fact that
 the chemical actions of the former were exclusively destructive, and of the
 latter constructive.     When, however, Bernard showed that the hepatic
  cells were able,   like the vegetable colls, to manufacture and deposit in
  themselves a veritable starch, the older view received its death-blow ; the
  constructive powers of the animal economy could no longer be denied,
  and the minds of physiologists became opon to the fact that in studying
  animal nutrition they must bo prepared for the existence of other pro
  cesses than those of simple destructive oxidation.       The subsequent dis
  covery of glycogen in other (and especially in f ootal) tissues made this still
  more clear.     How beneficial this clearing-away of erroneous theoretical
   conceptions has been is shown by the rapid progress which the physiology
   of nutrition has made during the last quarter of a century.
      The discovery of glycogen has also another influence of a general cha
   racter.    Governed too much by the leading idea of the animal body being
   composed of organs with special functions, physiologists were content
   with the view that the liver was an organ whose function is to secrete
   bile, and that when it had secreted a proper quantity of bile its work
   was done.       The fact that in the liver, at the same time that bile
   was being secreted, chemical labours of an apparently wholly different

1876.]                        President's Address.                     337
kind were being carried on, put an end to these narrow conceptions.       It
was felt at once that a new path of inquiry had been opened up for the
study, not only of hepatic, but of all other tissues — a path of which even
yet we see only the beginning.
   Though such theoretical considerations as the foregoing stamp the dis
covery of glycogen as emphatically epoch-making in the history of phy
siology, its immediate and practical fruits were not inconsiderable.      It
and the subsequent discovery by Bernard that puncture of the fourth ven
tricle produces a temporary artificial diabetes, at once threw a vivid bight
over the dark subject of diabetic disease ; and if neither the labours of
Bernard himself nor those of Pavy and others, who have extended and,
in a measure, corrected Bernard's conclusions, have cleared up the whole
mystery of this fatal malady, its rational pathology began with the dis
covery of glycogen ; and the complete interpretation of   it,when it  comes,
must be based on Bernard's results.
   No less epoch-making than the discovery of glycogen was the obser
vation made   by Bernard in the early months of 1852, that division of the
cervical sympathetic caused dilatation of the blood-vessels of the face
                               a
and neck. That simple experiment was the beginning of the long series
of researches on vaso-motor     nerves, on nerves of secretion, we may
perhaps  add nerves of nutrition, and on inflammation, which so eminently
characterize the physiology of the present generation.    The progress of
physiology during the last twenty years has been      far more rapid with
respect to our knowledge of the laws regulating vascular supply and
secretion than in any other direction.     Nor    the value of Bernard's
                                                 is
initial experiment lessened by the fact that in later month (August) of
                                                a
the same year, Brown- Se'quard had independently obtained similar
results to those of Bernard, and had pushed them further than he had,
nor by the fact that Waller in the same year had seen the importance of
the new truth more clearly than Bernard himself seems at first to have
done.   The air of physiology was at that time heavy with some such
discovery;  and since Bernard not only was the first to call attention to
the facts, but also subsequently expounded fully their importance, his
merit in the discovery cannot be diminished          by
                                                 others having indepen
dently arrived at the   same results.
   But Bernard's merits as physiologist do not end here. Second only
                               a
in importance to the discovery of glycogen and vaso-motor nerves was
the observation made by him in 1856, and at about the same time inde
pendently by Kiilliker, that the South-American arrow-poison, urari,
destroys the conductivity and irritability of motor nerve-endings, but
leaves muscular contractility intact.    This was of great theoretical im
                                         •
portance, inasmuch as    afforded striking evidence in support of Haller's
                         it
views on muscular contractility, views which had been somewhat
thrown into the background     and though the opinions expressed by
                                   ;
Bernard in publishing this important discovery have not been fully con

358                        Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 30,
firmed by subscqucut inquiries, the fact which l1e and Kolliker enunciated,
that profound differences exist between the action of the poison on the
contractile tissue itself and its action on the endings of the motor nerves,
remains as a fundamental doctrine of physiology.       The discovery of the
properties of urari had, moreover, all the contingent advantages of the
invention of a method. Urari has proved of indispensable advantage
as a means of physiological    analysis ; its use in this respect is second
only to that of chloroform and other anaesthetics.        Many of the most
important results in physiology gained during the last quarter of a cen
tury would probably have never been reached without the assistance of
urari. Indirectly, therefore, we owe these to Bernard and Kolliker.
    Wo are also indebted to Bernard for what was his earliest work, an
important research ou the functions of the pancreas, more especially on
the use of the pancreatic juice in the digestion of fat.     This alone was
an important addition to physiological science ; but it retires into the
background before the more important labours on which       I have dwelt.
    Lastly, in addition to these special researches, physiology has been
enriched by a series of general lectures on the nervous system, on
digestion, on poisons, on the properties        of blood and other animal
fluids, in which Bernard not only brought forward many other observa
tions of interest and importance, as for instance those on carbonic-oxide
poisoning, but also directed his readers in a lucid and striking manner to
general considerations of great value.
    Some of the views which he has thus put forward have not stood the
test of subsequent investigation ; but many of them, for instance the
conception of the blood as an internal medium on which the several
tissues live, have become part and parcel of the higher physiological
teaching of the day ; and by the exposition of his general views, Bernard
has done service to physiology quite commensurate with the fruit of
his more special inquiries.
    [The Medal was received for M. Bernard by His Excellency the French
Ambassador.]
    The Eumford Medal has been awarded to M. Pierre Jules Cosar
Jansseu, For. Mem. U.S., for his numerous and important researches on
the radiation and absorption of light, carried on chiefly by means of the
spectroscope.
    For the last 16 years Janssen's labours have been unceasing ; and he
 is continuing them with unabated vigour at the present moment.
    His first communication dates from 1860, in which year he recorded
some observations on the absorption of radiant heat by the interior of
the eye.    This thesis gained for him the Doctorat cs sciences physiques.
In 1862 he published the first section of his celebrated researches on the
origin of the telluric lines of the solar spectrum : he gave us the new
 form of spectroscope of which we are only now beginning to take full

 advantage (I allude to the
                                    " Direct-vision Spectroscope," long asso
 ciated with the name of Hofmann, because that optician was employed
 by Jansseu), and pointed out how spectrum-analysis might enable us to
 settle the vexed question of the existence of a lunar atmosphere.
     In 1866, with reference to the telluric line, he experimented at La
 Villette on a tube, some 37 metres long, containing steam at the pressure
 of 7 atmospheres, with the result that by comparing the spectra he was
 enabled to demonstrate that the telluric lines were really due to the
 absorption of aqueous vapour.        The experiment was repeated in another
form by observations of the spectrum of a flame several miles away
through the vapour overlying the Lake of Geneva.
    After these researches he sought and obtained a mission from the
 Paris Academy of Sciences to South-eastern Europe to make observations
 on the spectra of stars ; and he was enabled to establish the fact that
aqueous vapour exists in the atmosphere of some of them.
    These researches on aqueous vapour led him to observe many spectra,
                                                                     '
among which were iodine, bromine, and others ; and in the Comptes
          '
Eendus and Proceedings of the Societe* Philomathique, observations are
recorded which show that at that time he and Angstrom were          in the van
of such researches.
    Janssen's observations regarding aqueous vapour naturally led him to
take every occasion of studying the solar atmosphere ; and since the
annular eclipse of 1867 (which he observed at Trani) there has been 0110
total solar eclipse only which he has not studied.
    After a scientific mission to the Azores in 1867, he went to India in 1868
to observe the great eclipse of that year. Not only were his observations
of the eclipse itself of the highest value, but during the eclipse, with
a flash of genius, the thought occurred to him that an eclipse was not
necessary to the observation of the social phenomena into which every
body was inquiring ; and he was the first to apply the method, now well
known, which is being utilized in all civilized countries for the advance
ment of knowledge.
    For some months after the eclipse Janssen remained in India, and
brought home a rich series of observations, opening up many branches
of inquiry which have since proved most fruitful in result.
    In the eclipses of 1870 in Africa, 1871 in India, and 1875 in Siam,
Janssen was present, and advanced further the question which he had
set himself, and with the solution of which his name will always be
associated.
    Janssen's skill as an observer and his sound knowledge of optical and
mechanical questions, have not been shown merely in connexion with the
spectroscope ; he was anxious to observe not only the recent transit of
Venus, but to obtain records of several physical phenomena which can
be observed only at such times.         1'or this purpose he gave attention to
astronomical photography ; and         the  result was the introduction of his

revolving apparatus, which was instantly adopted by our own eclipse
parties, and will probably be the only photographic instrument used in
future transits.
   Janssen is at the present time engaged in organizing a physical obser
vatory, and is taking daily photographs of the sun, preliminary to obtain
ing daily spectrum-photographs        to elucidate all those inquiries which
have been raised by his former work.
   I  have limited this statement to those researches of M. Janssen which
have reference to the Eumford Medal. In the sixty notices of his papers
                  '
printed in the Catalogue of Scientific Papers,' some will be found on
other branches of knowledge, the results of his many scientific missions,
of which a list is appended : —

1861-62. Study of the Telluric Lines in Italy.

   A Eoyal Medal      has been awarded to Mr. William Froude, F.E.S., for
his researches, both theoretical and experimental, on the Behaviour of
Ships, their oscillations, their resistance, and their propulsion.
    It is generally admitted that Mr. Froude has done more than anybody
else towards the establishment    of a reasonable theory of the oscillation of
ships in wave-water, as well as for its experimental verification.   The very
accurate instruments which he has contrived for the measurement of a
ship's oscillation at sea have even permitted him to measure (as a dif
ferential phenomenon) the mean wave acting upon the ship with a degree
of exactness exceeding that with which it has hitherto been possible to
ascertain the profile of the surface-wave of the sea.
   He was also the first to establish ou thoroughly sound principles the
mechanical possibility of that form of motion known as the trochoidal
Bea-wave, which more nearly than any other appears to represent the
shape of smooth ocean-wave, and which now forms the groundwork of
all useful theories of the oscillation of ships.

very important and little-understood question of the law connecting the
behaviour of ships, in all these respects, with that of models of ships on
a much smaller       scale.  These experiments      have  been conducted    partly
for the government, and with public money        ; but they have also very largely
taxed Mr. Froude's own private resources, the sums repaid to him by no
means representing his whole expenditure on these matters, and including
no compensation whatever for his own time or labour.
    The amount of mechanical skill, as well as of theoretical acuteness,
which has been exhibited        in all this work has placed Mr. Froude in the
foremost rank of all investigators on this subject.          No one, indeed, has
ever done more, either theoretically or practically, for the accurate deter
mination of a ship's motion, whether in propulsion or in waves, than Mr.
Froude. Without undervaluing other modern writers, it is not too much
to say that his investigations at present take completely the lead in this
 very important question — most important to a maritime nation.
    Mr. Froude's papers are mainly to bo found in the ' Transactions ' of
the Institution of Naval Architects and of the British Association, as also
in separate official reports published as " Blue Books."
    [The Medal was received by Mr. Froude.]
    A Eoyal Medal has been awarded to Sir Charles Wyville Thomson,
for his successful direction of the scientific investigations carried on by
H.M.S.' Challenger.'
    In   consequence of representations made to Her Majesty's Govern
 ment by the President and Council of the Eoyal Society, the Lords
of the Admiralty, in 1872, fitted out and commissioned the ship ' Chal
          '
lenger      for the purpose of undertaking     a survey of the ocean of a more
systematic      and complete character      than any which had hitherto been
attempted.
    After crossing the Atlantic in various directions,         the distinguished
officer,    Captain Nares, who       was intrusted with the command of the
'Challenger,' was instructed          to proceed southward to the Antarctic
regions,     and  thence to take  his  way along the western side of the Pacific
to Japan ; from Japan he was to cross the Pacific, and, running south
ward through its eastern region, to return to England by way of Cape
Horn.
    The track taken by Captain           Nares, and his successor in command,
 Captain Thomson, covered 69,000 thousand miles ; and the chief objects
 of the expedition were to obtain at stations of accurately ascertained
 position, observations by which the temperature of the sea, and its
 physical and chemical condition, from the surface to the bottom and at
 all intermediate     depths, could bo determined, to drag up the sea-bottom
 itself in quantities sufficient for its satisfactory examination, to ascertain
 the nature of the fauna at the surface and at the bottom, and to collect

  302                         Anniversary   Meeting.              [Nov. 30,
  and preserve the animals thus obtained, in such a manner as to enable
 their nature and affinities to be determined, under more favourable
 conditions than those afforded by life on shipboard, on the return of the
 vessel.
     In this way it was hoped by those who proposed the Expedition to the
 Government, that a firmer foundation by far than any which formerly
 existed would be laid for the physical geography of the ocean.
    The Fellows of the Eoyal Society hardly need to be reminded of the
 manner in which those duties have been performed.       From time to time,
 in the space of the three years and a half during which the ' Challenger'
 has cruised   in every variety of climate, and circumnavigated the globe,
 many long and interesting Eeports, sent home by the Director and the
 other officers of the Staff, have been laid before the Society by order of
                                                          '
 the Lords of the Admiralty, have been printed in the Proceedings,' and
 afford  solid evidence of the nature and value of the work that has been
done.
    We have records of serial temperatures and determinations of the sea-
bottom obtained at 354 stations, of the extraordinary fact of the occur
rence of peroxide of manganese in masses over thousands of square
 miles, of the final answer to the vexed question as to the habitation of
 the Globigerince (which contribute so largely to the existing processes of
rock-formation), of the general uniformity of the deep-sea fauna all
over the world, together with many other new and interesting discoveries
which need not be enumerated. The collections which have been formed
are of unexampled value for their extent and the excellency of their
preservation.
    It may be truly said that no Expedition for scientific purposes ever
left the shores of any country better organized or more abundantly pro
vided with all that would be required for its efficiency ; and it is no less
true that none has ever more completely fulfilled the purpose for which
it was organized.
    Under these circumstances       the President and Council of the Eoyal
Society have judged      that   the award of a Eoyal Medal to Sir Wyville
Thomson is a well-earned recognition of the great success which he and
                              '
the Scientific Staff of the Challenger,' under his direction, have rendered
to Science, and, at the same time, a fitting acknowledgment, on their
part, of the successful manner in which he has discharged the duty with
which, on their recommendation, the Government intrusted him.
    [The Medal was received by Sir Wyville Thomson.]

      Report of the Kew Committee            for  the  Year ending
                           October 31, 1876.
   Magnetic Work. — The Magnetographs have been in constant operation
throughout the year.     The horizontal-force instrument has undergone
readjustment of its suspension on two occasions, in order to increase its
sensibility, which appears to have somewhat diminished of late.
   In  accordance with the usual practice, determinations of the scale-
values of all the instruments were made in the first week of the new
year, and of the Bifilar when required.
   The monthly observations with the absolute      instruments have been
continued, as usual, by Mr. Whipple and Mr. Figg, and the results are
given in the Tables appended to this Eeport.
   The paper referred to in the last Eeport, containing the results of the
Absolute Observations for the six years ending March 1875, having been
read before the Eoyal Society, has been printed in vol. xxiv. of the ' Pro
ceedings.'
   The two Sergeants of the Eoyal Artillery, formerly in Sir E. Sabine's
office at Woolwich, have been in regular attendance at Kew throughout
the year, principally engaged in the preparation of his paper " Contri
butions to Terrestrial Magnetism, No. XV.," which will be printed in
the Philosophical Transactions.

                      Report   of the Kew   Committee.                 371
   The tabulation of the magnetic curves, alluded to in the last Eeport as
being in arrear, for the years 1871-73 was almost completed when it was
stopped in May by the resignation of the extra assistant appointed for
that work. The vacancy has not yet been filled, and the work, together
with the measurement of the recent curves, is at present suspended.
   Magnetic data have been supplied to Prof. Barrett, Prof. Core, Messrs.
Elliott Brothers, Mr. Gordon, Dr. Guthrie, jthe Hydrographic Office,
Prof. Balfour Stewart, Dr. Marshall Watts, and Mr. H. Watts.
   The Unifilar, Declinometer, and Azimuth Compass used by Captains
Anderson and Peatherstonhaugh, of the Royal Engineers, during their
operations in the North-American Boundary Commission, have been
returned to Store in the Observatory, and the observations made with
them having been examined, will be embodied in a paper shortly to be
presented to the Eoyal Society.
   Captain Maclear, E.N., has visited the Observatory, and, assisted by
the Staff, redetermined the constants of the magnetic instruments used
                    '             '
by him during the Challenger        Expedition, thus completing the obser
vations by making   Kew   the  base station of the voyage.
   A communication having been made to the Committee by Mr. E.            J.
Ellery, Director of the Melbourne Observatory, requesting an expression
of opinion from them as to the desirability of continuing the photo
graphic registration of the magnetometers at his Observatory, and asking
also for suggestions for dealing with the results obtained, a circular was
 drawn up, and replies to it were received from the following gentlemen : —
                          Prof.  J. C. Adams.
                          Prof.  W. G. Adams.
                          Prof. Buys Ballot.

 Most of whom strongly advocate the continuance of self-recording mag
 netometers in Victoria.
    Meteorological Work. — The several self-recording instruments for the
 continuous registration respectively of pressure, temperature, humidity,
 wind (direction and velocity), and rain have been maintained in regular

872                   Report of the Kew Committee.
operation   under  the care of   Mr. T. W. Baker, assisted by T. Gunter.
The daily standard      eye-observations for the control of the automatic
records have been made regularly, as well as daily observations in con
nexion with the Washington synchronous system.
    In addition to the regular work of Kew as one of the self-recording
Observatories in connexion with the Meteorological      Office, the duty of
examining and checking the work of the six other self-recording Obser
vatories of the same character has been carried on, in accordance with
the method described in the Eeport of the British Association for 1869.
This port1on of the work has been performed of late by Messrs. Hawkes-
worth, Aldridge, and Harrison.
   The arrears of work, caused by the removal of Mr. Cullum to the charge
of the Valencia Observatory, have been cleared off, and the work is now
up to date.
    The Observatories at Aberdeen, Armagh, Falmouth, Glasgow, Stony-
hurst, and Valencia have been visited by Mr. Whipple, and their instru
ments inspected.
   Electrometer. — This   instrument    having experienced    an   accidental
derangement in June has since failed in its action, and all attempts at
setting it to work satisfactorily have been hitherto unsuccessful.       The
maker, Mr. White, of Glasgow, has promised to visit the Observatory at
an early date and examine it to find the cause of failure.
   A determination of the scale-value of the Electrometer       by means of
a 100-cell  Bunsen battery was made in January.
   Photoheliograph. — The Photoheliograph having been replacedin the Eoyal
Observatory, Greenwich, by one of the instruments constructed for use
in the Transit-of- Venus expeditions, was returned to the Observatory
January 5th, and re-erected in the Dome, but was again dismounted in
March, and sent, together with a number of solar negatives, to the Loan
Exhibition, South Kensington, where it now remains.
   The re-examination of the measurements of the Kew sun-pictures, as
noticed in former Eeports, has been steadily carried on throughout the
year by Mr. Whipple, assisted by Mr. M'Laughlin, who has been tem
porarily engaged for this purpose; and the Epbemerides for the whole
period of the Kew Sun-Spot Observations have been recalculated by Mr.
A. Marth, and are now in the Observatory. All of these operations have
been conducted at the expense of Mr. De La Rue.
   A new Micrometer for use in India, with a Photoheliograph, has been
made under the supervision of Mr. De La Eue, in which various modi
fications, suggested by experience obtained in the use of the instrument
at Kew, have been introduced.
   At the request of Mr. Hind, F.E.S., a careful inspection has been
made of the Kew sun-pictures from 1858 to 1875, with a view to obtain
evidence as to the existence of the intra-Mercurial planet.    The observa
tions bearing on the question have been communicated to that gentleman.

                         Report   of the Kew    Committee.                     373
    The eye-observations of the sun, after the method of Hofrath Schwabe,
 have been made daily by Mr. Foster, when possible, as described in the
 Eeport for 1872, in order, for the present, to maintain the continuity
 of the Kew record of sun-spots.
    A catalogue of the Schwabe MSS., deposited in the Observatory, has
been made for the Eoyal Astronomical Society.
    Extra Observations. — The observations with Prof. H. E. Eoscoe's
 Photometer were discontinued in November last, the year for which the
 experiment was undertaken having expired.             The instrument has since
 been returned     to the Owens College.
    The Solar-radiation Thermometers are still observed daily.
    The Campbell Sundial, described in the last Eeport, continues in
action, and the improved form of the instrument, giving a separate record
for every day of the duration of sunshine, has been regularly worked
since March.
    At the request of the Editor of the ' Times,' a copy of the traces of
the self-recording instruments on a reduced scale, together with an
epitome of the general features of the weather, is now prepared.              This
is published every     week  in that  journal, the  cost to the  Observatory being
defrayed by the proprietors.
                    — A fair increase has occurred in this branch of the work

                        Report of the Ke1v Committee.                      379
                                APPENDIX.
Magnetic    Observation^   made   at the Kew Observatory, Lot. 51° 28' 6" N.,
    Long.  Oh lm 15'-1 W.,for tJie year October 1875 to September 1876.
   The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked KC1, and
the Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones, the property of tho
Magnetic Office, directed by General Sir E. Sabine.
   The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnet N E being employed for the purpose.
   The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle No. 33, the needles
1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3| inches in length.
   The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
values of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
   These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the units in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
and in the other one milEmetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English values to metric values being 0-46108.
   By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also
given.
   The value of log      r"K  employed    in the reduction is 1-64365 at tem
perature 60°.
   The induction-coeff1cient    /u
                                   is 0-000194.
   The correction of the magnetic power for temperature       <0
                                                                 to an adopted
standard temperature of 35° Fahr. is
                0-0001194 (<0-35)+0-000,000,213 (<0-35),.
   The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-bar
marked 1-0 ft. and 1-3 ft., are 1-000075 ft. and 1-300097 ft. respectively.
   The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force of
the suspension-thread subsequently.
   No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.

    The connective tissue of the tongue of Batrachians was first studied,
with reference to the changes which it undergoes in inflammation, by
Prof. Cohnheim in 1869 1. The animal employed by him was the ordi
nary edible frog (Rana esculenta).              His mode of preparation was as
          —
follows : A plate of glass about 3" by 5" was first prepared, having a
smaller oblong plate, measuring 1" by 0"-7, cemented to it with Canada
balsam at one end. . This was surrounded by a cork ring border of the
same thickness.        On this plate the body of the frog (previously cura-
rized) was placed, resting on its back, in such a position that the
tongue could be readily extended over the oblong plate with the aid of

                     Tissue of the Tongue in Inflammation.                391
pins stuck into the cork ring. As thus displayed, the smooth surface of the
organ of course rested on the glass, the papillary surface looking upwards.
     To expose the submucous tissue, Cohnheim found it necessary to divide
the mucous membrane to the extent of an eighth of an inch ; by doing so
he was able to obtain a sufficient surface for microscopical examination,
in which, if care was taken to keep it constantly moist with serum and to
avoid undue stretching, the circulation could be observed for many hours.
Although, as compared with the one to be immediately described, the
method was imperfect, it was much superior to any which had been em
ployed before for the study of the textural changes which are associated
with the process of inflammation.
     In the stratum of tissue thus exposed, the objects which first attract
attention are, it need scarcely be said, the arteries, veins, and capillaries,
and the rapidly circulating blood. In addition to these, various fibrous
 structures present themselves, namely striped muscular fibres, single or
in groups, some entire, others broken; nerves, each consisting of a
 variable number of dark-bordered nerve-fibres, bundles of white fibrous
 tissue, and very numerous single fibrils. In the spaces between these
 structures a number of bodies are seen scattered without apparent regu
 larity in the fine transparent membrane of areolar tissue. With reference
 to these bodies, which were first described by Cohnheim, and constituted
 the principal subject of the paper now referred to, he remarks that although
 they differ considerably in form and appearance from the fixed elements
 of areolar tissue elsewhere, they can only be regarded as " connective-
 tissue corpuscles."
     Cohnheim found that when this tissue, immediately after having been
 exposed in the manner above described, was observed continuously for
 many hours under the microscope, the circulation became much accele
 rated, and the vessels (veins and arteries) became dilated.        Soon the
 dilatation of the arteries diminished, while the motion of the blood became
 slower, especially in the veins of which the diameter was still larger than
 in the natural state. In a short time the colourless corpuscles began to
 hug the walls of the veins, and soon after emigration set in with great
 vigour. As this went on, it was seen that in numerous capillaries stasis
 was either commencing or complete, a state of things which rapidly led
 to diapedesis, affecting both capillaries and veins.
     These facts having been ascertained, and being moreover in complete
 accordance with what Cohnheim had himself described in inflamed parts
 elsewhere, it remained to inquire what part the fixed elements played in
  the   active changes going on around them.       For our present purpose
  it is sufficient to state that Cohnheim concluded that they took no part
 whatever in those changes ; and he used this fact in support of his general
  position, that fixed elements of tissues do not participate in any inflam
  matory processes of which those tissues may be the seat.
     But since 1868, as is well known, Cohnheim's conclusions on this sub

  392              Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell      on the Connective
  ject have been warmly disputed.       On the one hand the pathological his-
  tologists of the Vienna School have maintained, on the basis of much
  laborious    work done by Prof. Strieker and his pupils, the previously
  received belief as to the textural origin of those young cells the presence
  of which is the most essential characteristic of inflammation.        On the
  other    hand Cohnheim,    supported by Axel Key and many others, has
  strengthened     his view of the case by extending -the research in new
  directions.
     As regards the tongue of the frog, Prof. Strieker has published obser
 vations in which, following Cohnheim's own method, he arrived at oppo
  site conclusions.
     I  have thought it desirable to publish the observations here recorded,
 because     the methods now adopted appear preferable to any previously
 employed, the tongue of the toad being much better adapted for the study
 of the tissues than that of the frog.
     The organ, when protruded, extends nearly an inch out of the mouth ;
 and in this state exhibits near the mouth the form of a flattened cylinder,
 of which the cross section is oval. Towards its extremity it becomes
 flattened, and exhibits a tendency to bifurcation, ending in two short
 tips, often called cornua.    Of its two principal surfaces, of which one is
 beset with papillae, the other smooth, the former (supposing the animal
to be in the supine position) is undermost.       But when the organ is re
tracted, and occupies its usual position in the mouth, it is bent back
in such a way that the papillated surface looks towards the palate.
     The arrangement and anatomical relations of the structures which con
stitute the substance of the tongue may be most readily understood by
the examination of transverse sections.       In any vertical section of a pro
perly hardened tongue across the thicker part of the organ it is seen that
immediately underneath the mucous membrane of the smooth surface
there is a large cavity, which, from its lining of flat cells, (he ana
tomist at once recognizes as a lymph-sac.          The floor of this lymph-
sac is formed towards the middle line by a mass of muscular fibres, of
which the direction is longitudinal, and from which the liquid contents
are only separated by the cellular lining.         The under surface of the
muscular mass is also covered by cells whiqh form the lining of a second
lymphatic cavity, which is in a similar relation to the papillated mucous
membrane to that in which the principal lymph-sac stands to the mucous
membrane of the smooth surface. There is, however, between the lymphatic
cavity and the mucous tissue a superficial stratum of muscular fibres.
In    fresh preparations it can be easily made out that the deeper muscular
fibres, which are nearest the attachment of the tongue, form a single
bundle on either side of the middle line, spread out towards the double
tip in finger-like processes having    spaces between them.    Through these
spaces    the  two lymphatic sacs freely communicate, so that when liquid is
injected into either sac, the other also becomes distended.

                      Tissue   of the  Tongue     in Inflammation.                 393
   In   my method of observation          I followed in the main that employed by
Prof.   Cohnheim.       That method was, however, modified in the following
important particulars:      — 1. The     toad being preferred to the frog on the
grounds    already    stated,  I found   it necessary to employ very much larger
quantities of curare.        The dose used by Cohnheim did not exceed 0-001
grain, quantity
         a             which   is well known to be sufficient for the frog.        But
in the toad       I  found that 0-004 grain was required, and that it was
necessary    to  repeat the injection every 36 or 48 hours during the course
of each observation.        2. The support on which the body of the animal
   Outline sketch of the cork support used in all the experiments (actual «ize). The
                dotted lines represent the outline of the tongue and head.
rested was not of glass, but of cork.               On either side of it is a block
of cork, which answers the purpose of Cohnheim's cork border. The
small oblong plate of glass used by him is dispensed with. 3. In order
to prepare the tongue for observation, it is necessary first to distend
the lymph-sac by injecting into it |-per-cent. solution of common
salt with the aid of a hypodermic syringe, and secondly to divide the
mucous membrane which constitutes its roof with fine scissors.                    This
having been accomplished, the cut edges are drawn aside so as to expose
the surface of the septum of muscular fibres which divides the lymph-
sac into two parts.        A well-lighted field is thus obtained, in which the
most delicate details of structure           can be satisfactorily observed, even
under high powers.
   The injury thus inflicted on the organ is           so trifling that, provided that
care has been taken to guard against the production              of haemorrhage, there
is at first no evidence of any pathological disturbance.               Soon, however,
the changes (of which an account has been already given) begin to present
themselves, the several phenomena following each other in the order in
which they were originally described by Prof. Cohnheim.                  I would only
remark that the vascular changes can be studied very advantageously,
and in particular that the process of emigration displays itself before the
observer with wonderful beauty and distinctness.
   As in my observations         I confined myself entirely to the behaviour of
the fixed elements of the tissue,        I  shall say nothing more of the vascular

394               Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell       on the Connective
changes, the interest of which to me consisted principally in that their
presence afforded the evidence that the part observed was in a state of
active inflammation.      The question   I had to answer was, whether or not
this state, even when prolonged, is attended with any change whatever
in the anatomical characteristics of the preexisting elements.
    For this purpose more than a dozen series of observations were made
on as many different animals, each series being continued for several days.
At the beginning of each series a group of connective-tissue corpuscles,
such as the one represented in Plate 8. figs. 3 and 4, was selected and
(with the vessels and other structures in relation with it) accurately drawn
with the aid of the camera lucida. The preparation was then removed from
the microscope and placed in a vessel in which the air was kept saturated
with aqueous vapour. The next day, after removing the layer of exuded
colourless corpuscles (pus) which covered the exposed surface of the
lymph-sac, by directing upon it a gentle stream of salt solution, the outlines
of the group of connective tissue were again traced with the aid of the
camera.
    In this way several daily observations were taken in respect of each
animal.     It usually happened that on the fourth or fifth day the circu
lation   became   impaired or ceased ; but in one instance it continued in
vigour as long as nine days, during the whole of which period the same
group of corpuscles was kept from time to time under observation.
    The result may be stated in a single line. So long as the circulation
continued,     " no change whatever took place in the connective-tissue
corpuscles, either as regards form or appearance," notwithstanding that
the tissue of which they formed part was beset with innumerable emi
grant colourless corpuscles, i.     e. (to  use ordinary language) was infil
trated with pus.
    In order that the reader may be put in possession of certain facts
which     have not been sufficiently noticed in the summary        I have now
given of the results of my investigation,       I will add a few short notes
relating to particular experiments.
    The first two experiments differed from the others in this respect, that
immediately after beginning my observations        I touched the observed part
with   a drop   of water acidulated with hydrochloric acid (1 part of strong
acid to 100 of water).      The vascular changes of the early stage exhibited
themselves in intensity, and resulted in a very abundant emigration of
 leucocytes ; but as the observation was only continued for two days, the
results were of less value as regards the special question under investiga
tion.     The fixed corpuscles were remarkably distinct, and these under
went no alteration.
    In  the fifth experiment (see description of fig. 3) the observation was
 continued for 5 days, at the end of which period the animal was killed.
 At that time the connective-tissue corpuscles, which were distinct and
  presented very remarkable contours, remained entirely unchanged.

     In experiment         6 (see fig. 4) the observations were continued successfully
for seven days, during the whole of which period the circulation was
vigorous, although active emigration took place.       Neither in this nor in
any  of the other cases was any  extravasation  of coloured blood-corpuscles,
either from veins or capillaries, distinctly viewed. In this respect there
may be a difference between the frog and toad.
   In experiment 8 no exudation took place during the first day, the circu
lation going on apparently normally. Subsequently leucocytes began to
escape, and exhibited their usual character and behaviour.   The observa
tion was continued for three days, but   no change occurred in the fixed
corpuscles.

6.   The circulation was vigorous until the sixth day ; emigration was
abundant, and commenced immediately after the commencement of the
observation.   In the course of the sixth day it became feeble, and it was
then observed that the connective-tissue corpuscles, although retaining
their form, lost their transparency and became granular.

            field into view from time to time during the whole period. The vein marked
            D was at the beginning of the observation obliterated, having been injured in
            preparation. Towards the third day blood began to pass through              it,

    which one is of such remarkable form and appearance that the least change in
    it could be very readily observed.     It contains a conspicuous vacuole, and it
    sends its processes along the fibrils of elastic tissue, as formerly described.  N

    migratory colourless blood-corpuscles.
       This body was kept under observation for eight days, during the whole of
    which emigration continued. It remained absolutely unchanged, with the
    exception that the vacuole varied somewhat in size. Thus on the fifth day it
    became somewhat more distinct than it had been before.             About the same
    time highly refractive granules and bodies resembling Bacteria appeared, and
    the leucocytes present seemed also to contain granules. On the seventh day
    it was observed that the circulation was growing feeble, and the tissues were
    losing their transparency, a change in which the fixed corpuscles obviously
    participated.    On the morning of the eighth day it was found that circulation
    had ceased.

    Sir CHARLES LYELL was the eldest son of Charles Lyell, Esq., of Kin-
nordy, in Forfarshire, where he was born on the 14th of November, 1797.
He inherited from his father a strong taste for natural-history pursuits,
and in early boyhood devoted himself to them with enthusiasm in the New
Forest, to which his family had removed not long after his birth.
Destined for the legal profession, he studied at Exeter College, Oxford,
and took his M.A. degree in the year 1821.         He was duly called to the
bar ; but by this time his bias towards the life of a scientific student had
grown so decided, that the practice of the law became increasingly irksome
to him. He had studied geology under Buckland, whom he had accom
panied to the field on those equestrian excursions which the merry Pro
fessor used to lead over the surrounding country.     We find him already, in
February 1824, elected Secretary of the Geological Society of London, and
in 1826 he entered the Eoyal Society. His first geological memoir was on
some freshwater marls in his native county of Forfarshire ; it was read
in December 1824 : containing a comparison of the recent with ancient
deposits of the same kind, it showed the pathway of inquiry which even
then he had deliberately chosen, and along which he was to journey to the
end of his life as the great apostle of the doctrine that the Present
alone affords the key to the Past.
   Having recognized at the beginning of his career that the true progress
of geology could best be advanced by a careful collection and discussion
of all facts bearing upon the present changes of the earth's surface, he
devoted himself for several years to a diligent study of all accessible works
of travel from which trustworthy information could be obtained regarding
modern geological changes.     During this time he seems to have written
no scientific memoirs for publication ; but by the end of the spring of
                                               '
 1823 he had completed the sketch of his Principles of Geology.'           In
 May   of that year he accompanied   Mr.   and   Mrs. Murchison   to  France,
and spent some time with them in the scientific circles of Paris, among
the volcanic rocks of Auvergne and in the interesting valley of the
 Shone. This journey formed the turning-point in his career. Instead
of returning to London and resuming his professional work, he wrote to
his father stating that after the fullest consideration he had at last
decided to give up the law and devote himself to science as the occupation
of his life. Having taken this determination, he struck southwards into
Italy and Sicily, and was soon immersed in those researches in tertiary
 geology which formed one of the great features in the scientific work of
his life.
                                         '
   The first volume of his ' Principles was published in January 1830.
Its appearance at once placed its author in front of the geologists of his
day — a position acknowledged even by those who would not admit his
doctrine that the present order of nature should be taken as a measure
and guide in explaining former geological changes.        Before the second
 volume appeared in January 1832, ho hid been elected Professor of
    VOL.  xxr.                                                    c

Geology in King's College, London —an appointment, however, which he
did not long retain.   His summers were devoted to excursions through
different parts of the British Islands and to tours on the continent, not
so much with the view of doing original field-work himself as to see
with his own eyes the ground and the rocks described by others, and thus
to be better enabled to realize their descriptions and to judge of the rela
tive importance of their contributions to geology.        In this way he tra
versed Europe, from the mountains of Scandinavia to the shores of Sicily,
and extended his travels into the Canary Islands.        Anxious still further
to enlarge his experience, he went to the United States and spent some
time in a geological tour there, of which the results were published in
1841 in his volumes of a ' Visit to the United States.'      A few years later
he again crossed the Atlantic and collected materials, which appeared
in 1345 in his ' Second Visit to the United States,' as well as in nume
rous papers published in various scientific journals.
   Though he wrote many minor papers and a few large memoirs on
original researches of his own, most of his work appeared from time to
                                              '            '
time in the successive editions of his          Principles and ' Elements.'
Among his most important memoirs should be mentioned his paper on the
Consolidation of Lava on steep slopes upon Etna, published in the ' Philo
                       '
sophical Transactions    for 185& This paper may be regarded as having
finally exploded the elevation-crater theory of Von Buch, although the
admirable memoirs of Scrope had already given that theory its death
blow.
   Perhaps the best idea of the solid services rendered by Lyell to geology
is obtained by looking back at the condition of the science when he first
began to study it,
                 and by contrasting that state with the luminous exposition
of the subject in the early editions of his Principles.' To men who had
                                           '
been compelled to gain their general view of geology from such works as
Daubuisson's     Traite' or Cuvier's  Theory of the Earth,' the appearance
              '       '             '
of Lyell's volumes must have been of the nature of a new revelation.
From vague statements about early convulsions and higher intensity of
                                                       a
all terrestrial energy culminating in periodic catastrophes, they were led
back, with rare sagacity and eloquence, to the living, moving world around
them, and taught to find there, in actual progress now, the analogues of
all that they could discover to have been effected in the geological past.
   The keynote which Lyell struck at the very outset was, that in geology
the past can be understood only through the present, that the forces now
in operation are quite powerful enough to produce changes as stupendous
as any which have taken place in former times, provided only that they
get time enough for their task.
  These views were not promulgated for the first time       by
                                                             the author of
the Principles of Geology.'
  '                          In cruder  form they had been earnestly urged
by Hutton, and eloquently illustrated and extended     by
                                                        Playfair but after
                                                                  ;
much turmoil and conflict of opinion, they had very generally been allowed

                                         Xlll
  to sink out of sight.     On the continent, indeed, they had never excited
  much attention, and were for the most part ignored as mere vague spe
  culation ; in this country they had been only partially adopted even by
  those who professed to belong to the Huttonian school : so that it was,
  in one sense, as a new doctrine that they were taken up by Lyell, and
  enforced with a wealth of illustration and cogency of argument which
  rapidly gained acceptance for them in Britain, and eventually led to their
  development in every country where the science is cultivated.
     In one important respect Lyell's teaching differed from that of his pre
  decessors.   lip till his time little had been made of organic remains as
  monuments of former physical changes as well as records of the history
  of the progress of life upon the surface of the earth. The stratigraphical
  labours of William Smith, followed by the palaeontological researches
  of Cuvier and Brongniart, opened fields of inquiry of which their pre
  decessors never dreamed. The old beliefs were being rudely shaken, and
  in this transition-state of the science there was needed a leisured
  thinker who could devote a calm judgment and a facile pen to the task of
  codifying the scattered observations which had accumulated to so vast an
 extent, and of evolving from them the general principles which they
  seemed to establish, and which, when clearly announced, could not fail
  greatly to stimulate and guide the future progress of geology.
     Such was the task which Lyell set before himself half a century ago.
 In its discharge he devoted himself with special ardour to the development
 of that biological side of geology which owes, if not its existence, at least
 its rapid and wide spread to his influence.       Though not himself, in the
 strict sense, either a zoologist or botanist, he kept himself throughout his
 life abreast of the progress of the biological sciences, and on terms of
 intimate relationship with those by whom that progress was sustained in
 this country and abroad. He was, in the true meaning of the word, a
 naturalist. He had in his day few equals in the grasp which he could
 take of natural-history subjects in their geological bearings.        Thus the
 geographical   distribution  of plants  and  animals  received more  and  more
 ample treatment from him as he advanced in years ; the succession of
 living forms in time gave him a theme for accurate and eloquent descrip
tion. In fact the breadth of his conception of what geology ought to be
was perhaps even more conspicuously marked in this biological side than
in that which treated of inorganic operations.        He enlisted in his service
every branch of natural history        which  could elucidate the story of the
earth and its inhabitants ; and not merely the published information on
these questions, but many of the floating ideas of discoverers, found their
first exposition and illustration in his pages.
                                                '
    Probably no scientific work, except the Origin of Species,' has during
the lifetime of its author exercised so powerful an influence upon the
                                           '
science which it illustrates as Lyell's Principles of Geology.'       No fewer
than eleven editions appeared, each of them marking a distinct and some

                                     XIV
times a very great advance. At first the descriptive part, relating to the
succession of the stratified formations of the earth's crust, was included in
the larger work ; but this was soon separated, and expanded into an in
                                         '
dependent   volume under the title of Elements of Geology,' of which
(including the Student's Elements ') the author lived to edit eight edi
                '
tions.   Of these, too, each as it appeared was hailed as the summing-up
of a calm and impartial judge of the evidence and arguments in all the
disputed stratigraphical questions of the day.  'When the discussion first
arose as to the nature and significance of the worked flints found in the
valley of the Somme and elsewhere, Lyell at once put himself in the front
by collecting all the available information and publishing    in 1863, in
                                                               it,

      '
   6ir Charles Lyell's position, as  a    foremost thinker among the geolo
gists of his day, was fully acknowledged during his lifetime.         He twice
held the Chair of the Geological Society.       He presided over the British
Association at Bath in 1864. He received the honour of D.C.L. from
his own University in 1855. The Eoyal Society gave him the Copley Medal
in 1858. He was chosen member of the chief learned societies of Europe
                          a
and America.     By his own Sovereign he was knighted in 1848 and, as;       a
further mark of Her Majesty's appreciation, he was raised to the dignity
of Baronet in 1864. He married a daughter of the late Mr. Leonard
    a
Homer, F.R.S. Throughout his long and honoured career she joined to
the fullest in his labours, accompanying and aiding him in his journeys,
assisting him in his literary work, entering into his geological speculations
with the heartiest sympathy, and, above all, sharing his friendships and
throwing over them, and over the social gatherings at his house, the charm
of her genial manner and conversation.         She predeceased him in 1873,
leaving no children.     Sir Charles himself died on the 22nd of February,
1875, and, as  a  fitting close to his illustrious life, was publicly buried in
Westminster Abbey. — A. G-.
    Dr. NEIL ARNOTT was born at Arbroath, in Scotland, on the 15th May,
1788, and died in London on the 2nd March, 1874. He passed his child
hood at Upper Dysart, and began his education partly with his mother,
a woman of great energy and ability, and partly in the parochial school
of Lunan,    near  Arbroath.    From his earliest years he gave great
attention to all natural objects around him, and in after life he often
referred to the experience thus acquired as his introduction to the pheno
mena of the physical world.
  Neil Arnott entered the Aberdeen          Grammar School in November
1798, and he continued there three years. He went into the Bursary
Competition at Marischal College at the beginning of the session of
1801.  He was then thirteen, and older than the average of boys at the
same stage in the school. He came in sixth, and was entered  student a
of Marischal College, where he went through the accustomed course of

                                       XV
 four sessions, devoting his time to the study of the classics and mathe
 matics, to civil and natural history, as well as chemistry, botany, and
 zoology.
     In the third year of the curriculum he took up the subject of Natural
 Philosophy, which appears to have had for him an absorbing interest.
 The Professor in the University was Patrick Copland, a man gifted with
 remarkable    powers of elucidating the phenomena of the science by
 experiments, and of attracting and fixing the attention of his young
 pupils. Among these none profited BO much by Copland's lectures as
 the subject of this memoir. In this department Neil Arnott        felt himself
 thoroughly at home, and, aided by the friendly counsel and         encourage
 ment of the Professor, he made great and rapid progress.           He carried
 away full notes of these lectures, and turned them to account      in his after
 studies.   In  other points, too, he benefited greatly by Copland's instruc
 tions, i.e. in selecting from daily life familiar illustrations of natural
phenomena, and in the invention and construction of the most simple
forms of apparatus for the purpose of experimental demonstration.
 After a successful career of study, Neil Arnott obtained his M.A. degree
in the year 1805.
    He selected the medical profession for his future career, and com
menced the study of medicine in Aberdeen, where it was known that he
had worked hard in order to qualify himself for entering one of the
London Hospital Schools. His wishes in this respect were soon gratifeed.
 He arrived in London on the 29th September, 1806, when in his nine
teenth year, and entered as a pupil at St. George's Hospital, under Sir
Everard Home. Through the influence of Sir Everard he, at a later
period, obtained-an appointment as surgeon in the East-India Company's
medical service.     Much of the experience of sea-life which he thereby
obtained he afterwards turned to good account in preparing the work by
which his name is so well known to the scientific world, — -the ' Elements
of Physics.' Numerous observations on the waves, currents, tides, winds,
and storms, and on the depth and colour of the sea were made by him,
and afterwards incorporated in the chapters of this work. He left Eng
land on his first voyage to China in 1807, before he had completed his
nineteenth year, and after a disastrous course, which took him across the
Atlantic to Eio, he landed at the Cape of Good Hope. He there ascended
the Table Mountain and made those meteorological observations which
are recorded in the ' Physics.' He returned to London in 1809, and made
a second voyage to China in 1810.
    It was during these vo\'ages, and when in charge of troops, that his
attention was specially directed to sanitary matters : ventilation, warmth,
clothing, food, air, and exercise were subjects which came before him in
a practical  form, and many ingenious contrivances were resorted to by
him in order to restore and maintain in a healthy condition the invalided
men who had been placed under his care.        He was   so successful  in these

                                         XVI
efforts that he lost during the voyage home only one man who was hope
lessly diseased, and on his return he received the thanks of the military
 authorities.
    In 1811 he commenced practice in London, in Hunter Street, Bruns
wick Square. He was acquainted with the French, Spanish, and Italian
 languages ; and he had among his patients a large number of foreign
refugees who resided in that neighbourhood.          He obtained the diploma of
 the College of Surgeons in 1813.          Although fully engaged in medical
 practice, Neil Arnott's mind was still much directed towards chemistry
 and physics, and in this year he gave at the Burton Eooms a course of
 lectures on Natural Philosophy applied to Medicine. The novelty and
 utility of this course rendered it highly attractive to medical men. At
 a later date (1825), when residing in Bedford Square, he gave two
 courses of lectures on      the same     subject, chiefly to members of the
 medical profession.      He declined, however, to continue these courses ;
 and in the year 1827 he published        the substance of them in his '     Ele
 ments of Physics.'
    In   1814 the University of Aberdeen       conferred  upon him the degree
 of M.D.      He practised for many years         as a physician,  and held the
 appointments     of   physician  to   the   French   and   Spanish   Embassies.
 As   a physician   Dr. Arnott placed more confidence in regimen than he
 did in drugs.      He made many useful mechanical suggestions for the
 treatment of certain diseases,   such as hernia, stricture, &c.    It was from
 1838 to 1855 that he was in the height of his professional career.           He
 then withdrew from practice, and devoted his time almost exclusively to
 scientif1c subjects, including also those of a sanitary nature.     In this year
 he published    an account of his smokeless grate, a modification of the
 open fire-grate, but possessing many of the advantages of the stove.
 This invention included a complete combustion of smoke and a great
economy of fuel with a steadiness and endurance of the fire.           It was in
 reference to this invention that    in  1854  the  Eumford Medal of the Eoyal
 Society was awarded to Dr. Arnott.
    In 1832 he first made known the use of the Hydrostatic or Water-
bed, which has proved of such important service in medical practice.
Devoting his attention to sanitary appliances, including the proper
methods of warming and ventilating dwelling-houses, hospitals, and infir
maries, he introduced the stoves which are well known by his name.
In   his essay on  " Warming and Ventilation," published in 1838, he gave
a full description of his stove. For this and other novel appliances in the
treat ment of disease and the preservation of public health, the Jurors of
the Universal Exposition of Paris, in 1855, awarded to him a Gold Medal,
to which the Emperor Napoleon         III.  added the Cross of the Legion of
Honour.
    On the foundation of the University of London, in 1836, Dr. Arnott
was appointed one of the original Members of the Senate.             In 1837 he

                                            xvu
  was named one of the Physicians Extraordinary to Her Majesty, and in
  the. following year he was elected a Fellow of the Eoyal Society. In 1854
  he was requested by the President of the General Board of Health to
  become one of the Medical Council ; and it was at this period that he
  devoted a large portion of his time to education and public works.
     As the inventor of the . " Arnott Stove," the " Arnott Ventilator,"
  and the Water-bed, it is not likely that his name will soon be forgotten;
  but it deserves to be recorded in his honour that he refused to patent
  any of his inventions.          His great object through life was to benefit
  others, and not to obtain pecuniary profit. Sir Arthur Helps, in one of
  his later works, says truly of Dr. Arnott, " His whole life was given to
'
  the service of his fellow men. A truer reformer in the best sense of the
  word never existed." One great secret of Dr. Arnott's success as a writer
  on natural philosophy was, that from his earliest days he was an acute
  observer of all that went on around him.            Nothing bearing upon physics
  escaped     his notice.    In  addition  to  this faculty of observation he pos
  sessed happy powers of description.          The reader was not only instructed,
  but made to feel a deep interest in the subject. Instruction was thus
  rendered a pleasing recreation.         His earnest wish was to make the path
                                                             '
  of learning easy      to all ; and  the reception of his Elements of Physics,'
  the first edition of which appeared in 1827, is a proof of his success in
  this respect.     There are few educated men of the past generation who
  will not remember the interest with which they read the first volume
  of this excellent work ; and it is not too much to say that the learned
  and the unlearned,        the student    and the philosopher, have benefited by
  its perusal.     This work did more for the encouragement of the study of
  Natural Philosophy than all the works on the subject which had preceded
  it. Within five years of its publication five large editions were called
  for, and, .although not then complete, it was reprinted in America and
  translated into several foreign languages.          In November 1829 appeared
  the   first part of  the  second   volume.     The  work underwent six editions
  during the life of the author, and       a posthumous seventh edition has lately
  appeared.
      In 1861 he published his ' Survey of Human Progress,' and this was
   followed by various monographs on educational subjects.
      In   1856   Dr. Aruott married the widow of one of his oldest friends,
   Mr. Knight. This ladyjwas the daughter of James Hunt Holley, Esq., of
   Bleckling, in Norfolk. She was an accomplished woman, and the match
   was in every way suitable.        She survived her husband upwards of two
   years.     She had  the  same   philanthropic and educational views, and lived
   to carry out his intentions in reference to the endowment of the Scotch
   'Universities.    The desire of both was to encourage the study of Natural
   Philosophy. In 1869 Dr. Arnott granted to the University of London
   £2000, and to each of the four Universities of Scotland (Aberdeen,
   Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St. Andrews) £1000, while, subsequently to his

                                      XV111
  death, Mrs.  Arnott granted an additional       sum of .£4000 to be divided
  among these Universities.      Thus within the period of seven years Dr.
 and Mrs. Arnott had contributed the sum of ten thousand pounds for
 the promotion of scientific knowledge.
     Dr. Arnott was a man of genial disposition, and had a large circle of
 friends.   He took a delight in the society of these friends and in the
 progress  of scientific research, until the infirmities of age compelled him
 in a great measure to withdraw from social intercourse.
    He died in the 86th year of his age, and up to the last year of his life hia
 mind was still actively occupied in devising and maturing new projects or
inventions.    Among these may be mentioned a chair-bed for the pre
vention of sea-sickness and a floating breakwater.         It was the delight
of his life to devise means of ameliorating suffering and adding to human
comfort.                                                                    .
    Dr. Arnott died in the Bonran Catholic faith, and by his own desire
his body was buried in the Dean Cemetery, at Edinburgh, in the grave
in which the remains of his mother and other members of his family are
deposited.    An obelisk with an appropriate inscription in commemoration
of himself and them has been erected over the grave.

                            Tissue   of the Tongue in Inflammation.                           395
       In experiment        6 (see fig. 4) the observations were continued successfully
 for        days, during the whole of which period the circulation was
        seven
 vigorous, although active emigration took place. Neither in this nor in
 any of the other cases was any extravasation of coloured blood-corpuscles,
 either from veins or capillaries, distinctly viewed. In this respect there
 may be a difference between the frog and toad.
    In experiment 8 no exudation took place during the first day, the circu
 lation going on apparently normally. Subsequently leucocytes began to
 escape, and exhibited their usual character and behaviour.   The observa
 tion was continued for three days, but no change occurred in the fixed
corpuscles.
       In   experiment       11 the observation was as successful         as   in experiment
 6.     The circulation was vigorous until the sixth day
                                                       ;  emigration was
 abundant, and began immediately after the commencement of the obser
 vation.  In the course of the sixth day it became feeble, and it was
 then observed that the connective-tissue corpuscles, although retaining
their form, lost their transparency and               became granular.

            the lymph-sacs, and forming a continuous sheath to the bundles of muscular
             fibre. In this membrane are the fixed corpuscles, the subjects of observation.

             Emigration has not commenced, but in the vein A the leucocytes (F, F) begin t o
            tend towards the internal surface of the wall. Through the capillary B a few
            coloured corpuscles are passing.     C, C are the fixed corpuscles of the tissue.
            The fine lines are single fibres of connective-tissue.    E, E are the red blood-
              corpuscles.
                 In    this experiment, in which, as already stated, the observations were con
                tinued for five days (from Oct. 23 to Oct. 29),  I   was able to bring the same
               field into view from time to time during the whole period. The vein marked
               D was at the beginning of the observation obliterated, having been injured in
               preparation.    Towards the third day blood began to pass through        it, and
               soon the circulation in   it  was completely reestablished.     In this case the
               connective-tissue corpuscles represented          C) were watched with the most

               so that before each observationit   was necessary to cleanse the surface of the
               lymph-sac by irrigation, as above described, there was no alteration of form
               whatever, either in the corpuscles themselves or in their nuclei, nor did they
              exhibit the slightest tendency to divide.

396                      Mr. C. H. Gimingham on               a new                [Dec. 7,
            and   active amoeboid movements.      C. C are connective-tissue corpuscles, of
            which one is of such remarkable form and appearance that the least change in
            it could be very readily observed.     It contains a conspicuous vacuole, and it
            sends its processes along the fibrils of elastic tissue, as formerly described. If
            is a small nerve-trunk.    M, striated muscular fibres.       L, L are leucocyte* —
            migratory colourless blood-corpuscles.
               This specimen was kept under observation for eight days, during the whole of
             which emigration continued. It remained absolutely unchanged, with the
            exception that the vacuole of the corpuscle above described varied somewhat
            in size. Thus on the fifth day it became somewhat more distinct than it had
            been before.     About the same time highly refractive granules and bodies
            resembling   Bacteria appeared, and the leucocytes present seemed also to contain
            granules. On the seventh day it was observed that the circulation was growing
            feeble, and the tissues were losing their transparency, a change in which the
            fixed corpuscles obviously participated.     On the morning of the eighth day it
            was found that circulation had ceased.

Having now succeeded in constructing an instrument yielding very
satisfactory results both in degree of exhaustion and rapidity of working,
1 purpose giving a detailed description of                    it,
                                                      together with a new
form   of  vacuum-tap   which    has  been found   exceedingly useful while
working with vacua.
   The instrument, owing to the number of accessories, at first sight
appears complicated.        will therefore first explain the principle of the
                                 1
pump, tracing the mercury and exhaustion through the different tubes,
and then describe each adjunct separately.

that when      A   is full the level of the mercury shall be just above the
ends of the fall -tubes (h,    i,j) in the fixed reservoir B.
   A    sufficient quantity of mercury being poured into B, the pinch-cock
(K) opened, when the mercury flows through the flexible tubing* into
      is
A, in the direction shown by the arrows, till the level in each reservoir
is the same ; K is then closed and A raised to the stop S'.              8" is another
stop for the reservoir A, placed halfway up the stand, so that when the
exhaustion has proceeded sufficiently to cause the mercury to rise to the
necessary height, by the excess of external pressure, much labour may be
saved by only raising the reservoir to this middle stop.
   The pinch-cock K being closed and the reservoir A raised, the mer
cury   passes    the three-way connexion (L) up a small length of flexible
tube to the pinch-cock M, thence up the glass tube a, through the air-
trap b, and, rising over the point c, falls into the jet e, where it is
divided into three columns, supplying the three fall-tubes (h, i, j), and,
having taken out a certain amount of air in its passage down these, is
collected in B.
   The exhaustion        is carried  through the arm /, with which it will be
seen are connected, by means         of mercury joints and the author's device
for a vacuum-tap, the different gauges, &c. considered useful when
working with high exhaustions.               g is an ordinary barometer-gauge
dipping into a separate reservoir C, having the barometer (k) on one side
and the measuring-rod (1) on the other ; the latter is a glass tube divided
into millimetres measured from a point at the bottom, which is always
made to touch the surface of the mercury in C before taking an obser
vation of the height of the gauge or barometer.
   m represents a small siphon-gauge, but is only of little value, owing
to its small bore and the consequent interference of capillarity ; this, how
ever, could at any time be replaced by one of a larger bore where occa
sion to require its accurate use.
   n is one of      Mr. Crookes's radiometers, made on          a small scale, consti
 tuting   a most valuable gauge as to the exhaustion         within the pump, as its
rate of motion increases almost       to  the highest exhaustions obtained by the
 pump     alone  ;  and even  up  to an   absolute   vacuum, the radiometer would
give under any circumstances         valuable   indications   with regard to the state
 of exhaustion, as will be seen in future papers by Mr. Crookes.
   The wide tube o is the sulphuric or anhydrous phosphoric                         acid
reservoir.
    Connected to the exhaust arm by the spiral P is McLeod's beautiful
apparatus for measuring the exhaustion by condensing a large quantity
of the residual gas into a small graduated tube, and then by allowing
 calculation    for the different pressure.
   The letters r, q, p represent this apparatus           : q is the small graduated
   * This tubing is specially made   to stand great pressure  by having a tube of canvas
between two tubes of india-rubber.

tube in which the residual gas is condensed, and              r another   graduated
 tube, where the pressure is taken.
    The supply of mercury for condensing the gas is taken from the
reservoir A of the pump, passing through the pinch-cock N up the
tube p *.
    The mercury joints used to connect the different parts of this pump
 are small blown funnels carefully stoppered, shown in section (fig. 2) :
a, represents the funnel ; 6, the stopper ; e, mercury ; d, sulphuric acid.
    The stopper is ground by hand with fine emery and water into the
neck of the funnel, using " rotten-stone to finish with.

carefully in this way need no grease, as the mercury and sulphuric acid
will not pass between surfaces fitting so closely. Sulphuric acid is used
to ensure perfect contact between the glass and mercury.
                             I
    Before going further, will describe the vacuum-tap, which constitutes
one of the principal improvements in this pump, and will,            I think, prove
very valuable to many who may conduct research at high exhaustions.
    It consists of three parts (A, B, C, fig. 3) : A is an ordinary stopper
ground to fit perfectly in B ; the lower end of the funnel B is a closed
stopper fitting very accurately in C.
    A neat hole (d), drilled through the centre of the stoppered or
ground part of B, meets a rather deep groove («) cut in the funnel C
rather more than halfway up the ground part.               When these three are
 put together (lubricating the stoppers with a very little grease or burnt
india-rubber),    the funnel B turns independently of A and C, so that
the latter parts can be fixed in any way necessary.
    The tap is closed with the funnel B in any position, except that in
which the aperture d is opposite the groove e, when of course A is
in connexion with C and any apparatus attached. The stoppers are
proof against leakage on account of their working under mercury and
sulphuric acid placed in the funnels. When the tap is turned off, in
order to make it absolutely proof against leakage, supposing the tube A
or any thing connected with it has to be cut or opened after exhaustion,
before doing so the stopper A is slightly lifted to let a drop of mercury
fall from the funnel and cover up the little aperture d. The tap is now
a perfect mercury joint, allowing any apparatus to be taken off or fastened
to A without the slightest fear of deteriorating the vacuum below C.
    To again connect the tap with the pump (and therefore any apparatus
to which     it is blown) the stopper A is removed, and the mercury
covering   the   small aperture d taken out with a fine pipette ; a small
globule of mercury will still remain in the little aperture, which, if desired,
may be taken out with an amalgamated copper wire ; otherwise, when the
tap is turned on, it will fall on the side of least pressure, viz. the side
best exhausted.
   * For detailed description of this apparatus  see MoLeod's paper in Phil. Mag. for
August 1874, p. 110.

    After having removed the mercury, the stopper A is replaced and con
 nected with the pump.        When the exhaustion of the latter is complete
 the tap may be turned on without admitting any air into the apparatus.
    Where this tap is used in connexion with the pump itself, the mercury
 covering the little aperture d need not be removed, as it merely runs
 into the pump when the tap is turned on.
    There are three of these taps used in the instrument (fig. 1, t, u, v) : —
 v, placed at the exhaust arm of the pump, is useful to turn off after
the exhaustion of an instrument, to prevent air entering the pump when
 another apparatus is blown on (a certain amount of time is thus saved) ;
 t and u connect with the pump the two instruments having the largest
 cubic contents, viz. the radiometer and McLeod's apparatus, enabling
 them to be cut off when not in use, thereby greatly diminishing the space
 within the pump.
    The air-trap (6, fig. 1) is the same as used and described by Mr.
 Crookes, in his first papers on " Eadiation ; it is enlarged in fig. 4. The
                                                "
 tube a is blown into b at the point c, and passes some distance down
 inside, the end being covered by a small glass cap (d). This cap must
 have sufficient room to entirely fall off the end of the tube descending
 inside 6, in order to enable one to empty the trap of air into the pump
 when necessary, which is done by opening the pinch-cock M (fig. 1)
  when the reservoir A is down, thus allowing the mercury to fall in the
 tube a. The cap then drops off the end of the inner tube, and the air
 rushes into the pump, the latter of course having been previously
 exhausted.      It will be easily seen how any air carried mechanically up
 the tube   a (fig. 1) is caught by this trap and collects round the joint c
 (%    4).
    Following the mercury up from the trap, we come to the sulphuric acid
 tap, used to lubricate and clean the fall-tubes when required.   This opera
 tion, and also that of admitting air when necessary, used to be done by
 raising a simple stopper, kept covered with mercury and sulphuric acid ;
 but on account of the many accidents happening through the unsteady
raising of the stopper, since devising the vacuum-tap      I  have adapted a
 modification of the latter to this purpose.      Fig. 5 shows the arrange
ment on a large scale : a is a bulb for the reception of sulphuric acid ;
6, a stopper and funnel, drilled and grooved as for a vacuum-tap, but
the stopper having, on the opposite side to the aperture, a groove cut
so far down the stopper that it shall slightly overlap with the groove in
the funnel when turned so that they meet.
    Now if the stopper is turned to bring the aperture opposite the groove
in the funnel, sulphuric acid runs from the bulb a into the pump, and
is carried with the mercury to the jet, where it is distributed to the three
fall-tubes.    On the other hand, when it is so turned that the two grooves
come together, the mercury in the funnel first runs in, followed by air,
of which the rate of influx and amount admitted is, by this means, under

perfect control,       c is a simple stopper to prevent the sulphuric acid in
 a from absorbing moisture.
    We now come to the jet («, fig. 1) : it is made with a double-stopper
 arrangement, so that the jet may be easily separated from the pump,
 should it require altering, or any stoppage occur.
    The jet itself, where the mercury divides, is made of platinum and
 blown to the glass ; the centre hole is straight, the two side ones being
 drilled at  a slight angle, to direct the mercury into (he side tubes.
    Owing    to the double stopper the jet may be turned, at any time, so as
 to direct all three streams of mercury down the centre tube if desired.
 Whether any advantage is gained by so doing is perhaps rather doubt
 ful, though I think that a great force of mercury will sometimes carry
 entirely down minute traces of air, which a less force will only take part
 of the way down, the little bubble then rising again to the surface, when the
 work has to be recommenced.
    At first the division of the one column of mercury into three streams
 presented rather a difficulty ; but after numerous experiments 1 found a
 platinum jet most simple and successful.
    The spiral ( W, fig. 1) is used as a flexible joint between the apparatus
 and the pump ; it enables one to use levelling-screws, <fcc. without fear of
breaking the connecting-tube.                   I
                                     Of course am speaking with the under
standing    that   all instruments  are put on the pump by means of a mer
cury or blown joint, as no other is perfect when working at the highest
exhaustions.      India-rubber connexions, covered with glycerine, are very
excellent joints, but are very disagreeable to work with, and cannot be
compared with a blown or mercury joint.
    The gauge (</, fig. 1) is fixed to the pump by a mercury joint in order
that it may be easily removed and cleaned when necessary, accurate
heights being much more easily taken with a perfectly clean surface of
mercury.
    The height of the gauge and barometer is taken by means of the slide
y moving rather stiffly on the divided rod ; the slide carries an arm pro
jecting across both the gauge and barometer at perfect right angles to
the divided rod.
    Behind the top part of these instruments       is placed a mirror, in order
to prevent the interference of parallax while taking the heights, by using
the reflected images to level the eye.       A cathetoineter is of course pre
ferable  ; but very great accuracy may be obtained in this way.
   Just  above the tap at the end of     the sulphuric acid reservoir is placed
an electrical vacuum-tube (D), the terminals of which are made of alu
minium, and only separated by one eighth of an inch. It is very con
venient to have this fixed to the pump, as it is thus always in readiness
to test the vacuum as regards its conductivity with the induction-coil.
   Below this tube, and between it and the tap, is placed a small bulb (E)
packed rather tightly with gold leaf, intended to stop any mercury vapour

    that may reach here before entering the apparatus           attached  to the
    pump.
       I  will now refer to some of the mechanical arrangements fixed to the
    stand for the convenient working of the instrument.
       The reservoir A is fixed on a slide running up and down the stand
   in grooves cut in separate pieces of wood and screwed to the stand. The
   stops 8' and S" are of brass, and kept jutting out from the stand by a
   spring from behind ; they are pressed in when the slide passes over them,
   and fly out again directly underneath it. When lowering the reservoir,
   the stops are pressed back by the thumb.
       The pinch-cock K is especially contrived      for rapid working.     It  is
   represented in fig. 6. The lever (a) is made of oak, one end being loosely
   screwed to the stand with an ordinary screw ; the other end is cut into a
   fork to receive the fine threaded screw (6), which carries two nuts, and
   moves backwards and forwards on the pinned joint (c). Now when once
   the nuts on the screw (6) have been screwed down on the fork of the
   lever, so as to sufficiently compress the pipe, it is then entirely opened or
   shut by simply working the screw on the joint (c) : the open position is
   shown by dotted lines. When closing this pinch-cock, the lever is pressed
  down by the thumb while the first finger places the nuts over the fork.
       The pinch-cocks N, M are made in the same way as the above, but
   without the joint c, the gradual opening and shutting by means of a
  screw being necessary.
       The stand is 5 feet 6 inches high and 11 inches broad. The fall-tubes
  measure about 3(5 inches from the highest level of mercury in B to tbe
  jet   : the two side ones   have a bore of about 2 millims. ; the centre one
  is smaller (about 1| to 1| millim.), being the size according to my
 experience to produce the most complete vacuum.             The auxiliary side
  tubes are made of the larger bore for the sake of rapid exhaustion up to the
  point at which the barometer and gauge appear to be level, when the
 centre tube does the principal work, although the side ones still aid con
 siderably.
      The reservoir   A  contains, when full, rather more than 20 lbs. of mer
 cury, being     a convenient  weight to lift.  With regard to the capabilities
 and advantages of this pump it is unnecessary for me to dwell at any
                                      " Sprengel " principle is capable of pro
 length, us the vacuum that the
ducing is so well known at the present time ; although 1 may safely say
that the exhaustion produced by this instrument will at least rival, if not
considerably exceed, that produced by any other air-pump yet brought to
bear upon research in vacua. The rapidity of working is of course the
chief advantage   D
                     of an instrument of this construction.
      Experiment has shown that the raising of the reservoir and passing of
its contents through the pump five times will reduce the pressure within an
apparatus having a cubic content of about 80 cubic ceutims. to '041
millims., measured by MeLeod's apparatus.            But with regard to these

    In  a paper which was read before the            Royal Society in 1S73, and which
                                               '                                '
 was honoured with a place in the Philosophical Transactions                      of that
 year  *,  I  discussed    the  diurnal     variations   of  the wind and    barometric
 pressure at Bombay, and deduced therefrom the fact that a system of
 diurnal wind-currents moves synchronally with the diurnal variation of
 barometric pressure.         Reasons were given for believing that that system
 of  diurnal    wind-currents     is a universal phenomenon ; and on that hypo
 thesis   I  showed how the diurnal variations of the barometer could be ex
 plained    as  a result of those currents.
     I have lately examined closely the

 logical Office, London,' July to September 1872.                Those results support
 the conclusions arrived at in my former paper in such a remarkable man
 ner as to justify the readvancement of some of them in a form which
 will prominently exhibit their relation to the diurnal variation of the
 barometer.
     The following Table (p. 403) exhibits the mean diurnal variations of the
  north and east components of the wind, in miles per hour, at Bermuda, for
 the whole year and for the summer and winter half-years.                 It is compiled
 from Table II. of the Appendix to the Quarterly Weather-Report already
 referred to.
     These variations       are also represented graphically by figures 1 to 9
  (p. 404),    the  variations   of the north and east components for each of
 these periods being exhibited separately by figures 1 to 6, and in a com
 bined form by figures 7 to 9.
                                                                        '                  '

404 Mr. F. Chambers on the Variations
1876.]             of the Wind and Barometric P reasure.                             405
curves, implying that the inferences drawn from the Bombay observa
tion, which led to the construction of the former curve, are essentially
true.
   The evidence which the Bermuda wind results afford, taken together
with that which        I
                      have previously advanced,        is,
                                                       I    think, sufficient to war
rant the conclusion that the existence of such          a  system of diurnal wind-
currents should no longer be regarded as           a   working hypothesis merely,
but  that    itmay  indeed   fairly  claim    to  be regarded as an observed fact.
Accepting this conclusion,     I   proceed to show, in greater detail than was
justifiable  from  the  evidence    advanced in my former paper, what kind of
barometric variation may be expected to result from such                a    system of
wind-currents.      For  this  purpose      the  only results  that will  be  used are
the mean diurnal variations of the north and east components of the wind
for the whole year at Bermuda.            Strictly speaking, similar results for at
least one other station in         a different latitude, but otherwise similarly
situated, are essential     to  the completeness of the explanation         ;   but, as
suitable observations for such         a station are not yet available, their place
 will be supplied by the simplest suppositions that can be made. The
results, however, will be seen not to depend wholly on those suppositions,
but     it will be evident that similar conclusions will follow without
them.

situated for the investigation of such movements of the atmosphere as

plicated     the great difficulty of having to eliminate those peculiarly
              by
local winds, such as the land- and sea-breezes, which are always found
on the coasts of extensive tracts of land, and such as the secondary
systems of diurnal wind -currents, of which we have indications in the
hot winds that blow in the daytime from the interior of large continents
like India, and which are to be attributed to local causes similar in cha
racter to those which produce the primary system of diurnal wind-
currents over the whole of the earth's surface — these secondarv systems
originating in outward movements from the middle of heated continents,
in the same way that the primary system originates in outward move
ments from the middle of the heated hemisphere.

  Suppose, then, the existence of twenty-four blockades formed      the                                 by
twenty-four meridian lines corresponding to the twenty-four full hours,
and   by   the equator and the parallel of north latitude, taken as 32° 23',
on which     Bermuda stands.   Bearing carefully in mind that only the
diurnal variations of the wind are being considered, the mean diurnal
variation of the north component of the wind for the whole year at Ber
muda affords the means of calculating how much air flows into or out of
each of these blockades on the north, and the corresponding variation of
the east component of the wind affords the means of calculating the
quantity of air which flows into or out of them on both their east and
west boundaries,     e. across each of the meridian-hour lines,
                                i.                               on the
supposition that the variation of the east component of the wind     the                                is
same between Bermuda       and the equator as at Bermuda, an assumption
which   isdoubtless only approximately true, and though somewhat rough,
yet sufficiently exact for our present purpose.  But we have no observa
tions to show how much air flows across the equator into or out of each
of them. To tentatively supply the place of such observations the most
simple supposition that can be made     that there                 is,
                                                      no transfer of air                  ia
across the equator either into or out of any of them, or, in other words,
that on the equator there    no diurnal variation of the north component
                                          is
of the wind. It seems probable that this assumption       not strictly true,                 is
but that the position of the line at which the outward currents from the
neighbourhood of the equator may be said to originate, or at which the
return inward currents may be said to meet, not only has an annual
variation about its mean position, but that     also varies from hour to     it
hour, or, in other words, that there    no single line which satisfies the
                                                              is
assumption made for all the hours of the day. But, for our present pur
pose, the assumption that the equator does so will probably not very
essentially affect the results arrived at.

 408                    Mr. F. Chambers     on the Variations            [Dec. 7,
    Now      if the whole atmosphere participates in the movements which
are observed in the lower strata, an increase or decrease of the pressure
of the air, very nearly in direct proportion to the quantity of air whirh
enters or leaves any blockade, must result.            Assuming that the whole
atmosphere does participate in these movements, and taking 30 inches as
the mean barometric pressure for each of the blockades, the increment of
pressure i for each hour of the day is obtained by the proportion
where a is the area of a blockade in square miles (2,287,336 square miles
in the present case), and M is the number of square miles covered by the
air which enters or leaves the blockade per hour.          Adding successively
these hourly increments, we obtain the barometric variation which results
from the variation of the wind from which the values of M were
calculated.       The variations corresponding to the successive values of
    If      E
 M     , M    ,
                Mt of  Table II. are given in the following Table (p. 409), and
graphically      represented by figures 10 to 12.
    Figure 10 (p. 404) shows the diurnal variation of the barometer that
would result from the diurnal variation of the north component of the wind
only.      It is remarkably regular in form, and its turning points corre
spond     almost   exactly with those of the observed barometric variation in
low latitudes.       The diurnal movement is greater than the nocturnal one,
as   with the observed variation; but the morning maximum, in accordance
 with what might be expected from the notion of a gradually decreasing
oscillatory movement of the atmosphere, is perhaps not as proportionally
high as in the curve showing actual barometric variation.         It is, however,
higher than the evening maximum, a fact which could not be explained
 by the supposition that the movements of the N component of the wind
are simply of the nature of oscillatory movements resulting from the
midday disturbance, but which requires that some other cause should
also be in action at the same time.        This is probably to be found in the
gradual     cooling   of the air during  the night hours resulting in a gradual
 return towards the equator of the air which bad moved outwards during
 the day hours, causing the outward oscillatory movement of the night to
 be smaller than the subsequent inward movement.           And this is probably
also the reason why at places near the equator, like Batnvia, the diurnal
 barometric inequalities for the night hours have greater positive or
 smaller negative values than at places further removed from the equator,
 like Bombay.        Fig. 10 has, as might be expected, a smaller range than
the actual variation of the barometer.
    Fig. 11 is of the same general form as fig. 10, with the exception that
 the morning minimum occurs at two hours instead of between three and
 four hours as in the latter f1gure. This is probably an irregularity which
would disappear with a longer continuation of the observations.              The

 curve of barometric pressure.       This implies that the greater height of the
 morning   maximum     of  the   barometer    is due chiefly to an influx of air
 from the eastward, coming from the sun.
    Fig. 12, which is formed simply by the addition of the ordinates of figs.
 10 and 11, so closely corresponds to those derived from actual observation
 of the barometer, and its range approximates so nearly to the actual
 diurnal range of the barometer in low latitudes, as to leave little room to
 doubt that the true explanation of the large features of the diurnal
 variation of the barometer is to be found in the diurnal variation of the
wind.
    This explanation requires that in high latitudes a reversal of the baro
 metric variations should be found to compensate that part of the diurnal
 barometric variation of low latitudes which is due to the variation of the
north component of the wind.           It also leads to the anticipation that
that part of the barometric variation which is due to the variation of the
east component of the wind will, speaking generally, have the same
character from equator to poles, having a maximum range at the equator
and vanishing at the poles, like the variation of that component of the
wind on which it depends. A reason is herein found why the reversal
of the actual barometric variation should not occur until very high lati
tudes are reached. But it will probably be found, when other wind-
observations of higher latitudes than Bermuda are similarly discussed,
that the part of the barometric variation which is due to the variation of
the north component only, is reversed in character at a much lower lati
tude than the actual total variation.        The latitude in which the variation
may    be expected  to  be   nil  will be  that  where the reversed barometric
variation, due to the variation of the north component of the wind, is
equal to and therefore neutralized by the direct variation due to the vari
ation of the east component.
    Other causes, such as the variation of vapour pressure and the dyna
mical reactions pointed     out by Espy, which are the equivalents of the
energy expended by      or upon the atmosphere in expanding and contract
ing under the influence of gravity, doubtless affect the actual observed
variations of the barometer to some extent ; but, since the diurnal varia
tions of the wind are sufficient to account for nearly the whole of the
barometric variation, the inference       that other causes really exercise but
a minor influence seems inevitable.
    If we could suppose the centre of gravity of each atmospheric column
to remain vertically undisturbed while the increasing or decreasing ten
sion of the air on different      parts of the earth's surface, caused by the
diurnal variation of temperature, was being equalized solely by lateral
expansions and contractions, it could be shown that a very small lateral
velocity of the air would suffice for such equalization, and that the dyna
mical reactions resulting from the creation of these lateral movements
would be small compared with those which would result from a vertical

 elevation and depression of the centre of gravity of each atmospheric
 column.      Herein may lie the reason why lateral expansive and contrac
 tive currents are found to exist.
    A reference made by Dr. Andrews, in the course of his inaugural
 Address to the British Association at the recent Glasgow Meeting, to the
 work of General Menabrea, appears to give weight to this conjecture. He
         "
 says — His great work on the determination of the pressures and ten
 sions in an elastic system is of too abstruse a character to be discussed
 in this address ; but the principle it contains may be briefly stated in the
 following words : — When any elastic system places itself in equilibrium
 under the action of external forces, the work developed by the internal
 forces is a minimum."

    The mechanism by which      the leaf of D1oncea closes after mechanical
excitation has been already       studied by Mr. Darwin and many other
naturalists. It was, however,   necessary, in order to connect the electrical
phenomena which form the         principal subject of this paper with this
mechanism, to study the successive changes of form which the leaf under
goes in the act of closing.    The investigations we have made relating to
this subject have brought to our knowledge facts which have an im
portant bearing on the general question of the nature of the excito-
contractile process in plants and animals.
    The smooth green outer surface of a leaf of Dioncea in full vigour is
concave, and the marginal hairs are thrown back so that they are
nearly in the same plane with the lobe from the edge of which they
spring.     If one of the sensitive hairs of a leaf in this condition is care
lessly  touched   the leaf usually closes. If, however, a hair is touched

very cautiously, with the aid of a camel-hair pencil, it can be pre
dicted with certainty that no visible effect will be produced ; and a
similar gentle contact may be repeated several times before the leaf
begins to answer to the irritation by any movement.    Sooner or later,

 however, the marginal hairs bend inwards, and if the leaf is carefully
 watched it may be observed that each touch is followed by a slight approach
 of the lobes to each other.           If  the observation is continued, it is seen
 that   each   approach exceeds its predecessor in extent, until at last the
 lobes     suddenly come together in the manner which is, by this time,
 familiar to every one.
     It  being our primary purpose to determine the time which elapses
 between each several touch and the immediately resulting jerk-like
 approach, and to measure the extent of such approach, so as to learn how
 much     it contributes   to the final result, we made it our first business to
 devise some method of measurement by which we could verify the con
 clusions to which we had come from rough observation, namely, that each
 several excitation      of the leaf is attended        by  some   mechanical     effect.
 With this view, we constructed an instrument of the form shown in
 figs. 1 & la.      It consists of a h1nged screw-clamp by which the leaf is
 held, as between the thumb and fore linger. On the lower jaw of the clamp,
 the one corresponding to the thumb, which is made of glass, the midrib
 of the leaf rests by its under surface. The upper jaw consists of an arch
of copper wire, of which the curvature corresponds to that of the margins
of a lobe of the leaf. The two jaws meet each other in such a way that
 when they are brought together by the screw the two ends of the arch
are in apposition with the ends of the midrib close to its upper surface.
Each end is pierced by a pin : the points of these pins are directed
towards each other, so that together they serve as an axis of rotation for
a second similar arch of which the curvature is made a little larger
than the other, so that it may comprise it. From the middle of the second
arch a wire springs at right angles, to which a light glass lever is
attached.       By means of this lever it can be rotated outwards on its axis,
and thus made to diverge from its fellow at any desired angle.

    The instrument is used as follows : — A leaf having been placed in
position, that is with its midrib resting on the glass support, the two
arches are brought down by the screw until they all but touch the trough
of the leaf at opposite ends. This done, the arches are made to diverge

until both are in contact with the internal surface of each lobe close to
its border. All that remains is to fix a graduated arc against the lever,
to select a sensitive hair for excitation, carefully to touch it at regular
intervals, and to record the movements of the lever. Each approach of
the leaf is thus indicated in magnified proportion by the end of the lever.

 tions were absolutely without mechanical effect; (2) that the first
 effectual excitation was followed by so slight a movement that if it had
 not been enlarged by the lever it would have been imperceptible ; and (3)
 that after this each successive approach of the lobes, in most cases,
 exceeded its predecessor.        The numbers recorded in the third column
  relate to the time of interval between excitation and effect, and were
  obtained by the following method.

    The apparatus (fig. 2) employed for this purpose consists of : — 1, a
recording-cylinder ; 2, an electro-magnetic chronograph made for us in
Paris by M. Verdin, the perfection of which we owe to the kindness of
our friend Prof. Marey ; 3, signalling-keys, of which one closes, the other
opens, the signal-circuit — that of a battery of two Daniells. The cylinder,
of which the surface is blackened in the usual way, revolves with great
regularity five times per minute, and has a circumference of half a meter,
so that the rate of horizontal movement of its surface is two and a half
meters per minute (4'166 centims. per second); consequently a hundredth
of a second (0'4166 millim.) is readily measurable.
   In the present experiment it was necessary that the touching of the
sensitive hairs should be accomplished with great gentleness, care, and
exactitude, and always in the same manner.         The touch in each experi
ment was made by one observer at an expected signal from the other,
the arrangement being that A should count aloud 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, that B
should touch at the moment 5 is said, and that at the same moment A
should close the signal-circuit, having his eye on the lever, and being
ready to break the circuit at the first perceptible movement.        Consider
ing that the periods to be measured were of several seconds' duration,
this method was quite accurate enough for the purpose.
   The time-measurements, as will be seen at a glance, stand in a remark
able relation to the mechanical effects, showing that the delay between
excitation and effect diminishes as the extent of the effect increases, both
facts having the same meaning — namely, that in the plant, as in certain
cases well known to the animal physiologist, inadequate excitations when
repeated exercise their influence by what has been termed summation,
». e. that when any number of such stimulations,         gay o, b, c, d, e, &c.,
follow   each other  in succession, the  effect of  each  is prepared for and
aided by its predecessors : so that although, as in the present instance,
a, b, c, d, may seem to produce no effect whatever, each of them really
produces a change in the excited structure, and each contributes, when

  416       Prof. Burdon- Sanderson and Mr. F.        J.M.  Page      [Dec. 14,
  summed with its predecessors and successors, to the bringing about of
 the visible effect which follows e. During the remainder of the process
 the operation of the same law shows itself in the gradual augmentation of
 the increments, the last contraction, that by which the leaf closes, being
 the result of the summation of the excitation which immediately pre
 ceded   it with all the previous excitations.   Our conception of the nature
 of the process may be otherwise expressed by saying, that under the
 influence of successive excitations the latent excitability of the leaf gra
 dually increases ; for whereas before it either made no response or post
 poned its response indefinitely, it now answers to the same stimulus by
 a visible motion of which the promptitude          and the extent increase
 together.
     In one of our experiments we arranged our apparatus in such a manner
 as to obtain a graphic record of the successive approaches of lobe to lobe
 by which closure is ushered in ; a reduced, but otherwise accurate, copy of
 this record is given in fig.  3. It shows a fact which we had already ascer
tained by observation, namely, that in each approach the rate of motion
augments rapidly at the beginning, and then very slowly subsides.             It
was for this reason that we allowed two minutes to elapse between each
excitation and its successor ; for if the interval were less, the effect of the
excitation   began    before that of the previous one had ceased.       In the
experiments represented graphically the excitations were repeated every
minute, so that the lever was still rising at the moment that each new
ascent commenced.
    It appeared important to ascertain whether, after the leaf is closed, it
still continues to make mechanical efforts.        We had already observed
that a leaf which is repeatedly excited after closure seems to be clenched
with greater and greater force, and we thought it probable that mechanical
work would continue to be done by a leaf after closure if it had the
opportunity. To test this, all that was necessary was to attach weights
to our lever sufficient to keep the lobes expanded.     The result of a single

experiment was quite conclusive.          Each time, without exception, that the
 leaf was excited the weight (one gramme at a distance of 10 centims.)
 was slightly lifted, the extent of movement of the lever varying from one
 to three degrees.
    As regards the interval between excitation and the resulting movement,
 our observations show that it varies from 2| seconds (the shortest
 observed after numerous excitations) to 10 seconds.             The last estimate,
 however, is probably exaggerated ; for in the early stages, when the mo
 tion is of extremely small extent, it is not possible to determine exactly
 when it commences.         In the later stages this source of inaccuracy does
 not exist, so that we may confidently take two seconds as the inner limit
of the period in question.
        Part  II. — ELECTBICAL     DJSTIJBBANCE     OF THE NORMAL       LEAF.
      Section  1. — Electrical  Condition of  tl1e Leaf in  the unexcited State.
    The electrical condition of the leaf of        Dioncea   in the unexcited state
has very recently been made the subject of a minute investigation by
Prof. Munk, of Berlin. He has found (1) that if we conceive the
external surface of the leaf divided into strips by parallel lines crossing
the midrib nearly at right angles, and coinciding in their direction with
the veining, the external surface of each lobe is negative to the midrib;
(2) that in comparing different points of the midrib with each other
there is one, of which the position is two thirds of the distance from the
near to the far ends of the midrib, which           is positive    to the rest.  He
has further (3) stated that the potential of any point on the internal
surface of the lobe is exactly equal to that of the corresponding and
opposite point on the external surface.
    These   three   statements    may be generalized as follows: — On the
external surface of the leaf three lines may be distinguished — one which
may be called the positive line, which corresponds to the midrib ; and
two others, the lines of greatest negativity, which lie between midrib
and margin and are nearly parallel to the first.             Although it is not the
special purpose    of  this  paper to   investigate   this part of the subject, we
may state generally that we have found the first two propositions above
enumerated to be true in all normal leaves with the following exceptions,
namely : — first, that although the central part of the midrib is positive to
either end (more positive to the near than to the far end), the position of
the point of greatest positivity is not so definite as Dr. Munk states,
but differs in different leaves ; secondly, that the different points in his
isoelectrical negative line are never found to be absolutely identical.
As regards the third proposition we are compelled to say, generally, that
it is without foundation.        We have found that so far from its being
generally true that opposite and corresponding points of the two sur
faces exhibit the same potential, such identity occurs so rarely and
exceptionally, that it may be regarded as abnormal.               In a future paper

 418        Prof. Burdon-Sanderson         and  Mr. F.    J. M. Page     [Dee. 14,
 we propose to discuss the electrical condition of the leaf of Dionaa when
 unexcited as compared with that of other non-excitable leaves. For our
 present purpose it is sufficient to state as the general result of our
 observations on this subject, first, that the part of the midrib which lies
 nearest the two central sensitive hairs is positive to every other part of the
 external surface of the leaf, but has usually the same potential as the
 petiole and other inactive parts of the plant ; and secondly, that the
 external surface, so long as the leaf is in vigour, is always positive to the
 internal surface. These two statements, and particularly the second,
 may be accepted with confidence       ;  but with reference to the first   it must
 be borne in mind that, inasmuch         as unexplained differences of potential
often present themselves       between     symmetrical points of opposite lobes,
 even in leaves which appear to be in a normal state, the determination of
 the difference between any point and the midrib must necessarily be a
 matter of great difficulty.
                               Section 2. — Method.
    The method employed in the present research differs from that
 generally used in previous investigations relating to animal or plant
electricity in two important particulars, viz. : — first, in the adoption of
 the electrometer as a means of investigating the electrical changes ; and
 secondly, in the substitution of a constant for a variable potential.
    The electrometer used is that of Lippmann. We became acquainted
 with this instrument through the kindness of Prof. Marey, who had
already adopted it in physiological          investigations   relating to animal
electricity.     "We append the following description         of  the instrument,

pressed by a screw-clamp, so that the mercury in A can be subjected to
the pressure required in order to force it through the capillary, or to any
less pressure.   The tube B also contains mercury at its closed end : the
remainder of its cavity is occupied by dilute sulphuric acid, into which the
end of the capillary y is plunged.   Each of the two tubes A and B has a
platinum wire fused into    by which the two masses of mercury
                                      it,                                                .can be

be desired to compare the electrical condition.

  Each   capillary used as an electrometer must be graduated.  The
graduation      effected
                 is                by
                          Poggendorffs method of compensation, with
the aid of Mr. Latimer Clarke's potentiometer.   As   standard cell       a

purpose we preferred the electrometer to the galvanometer in the
present   investigation   are easily made clear.   In all investigations
relating to the electrical phenomena of plants and animals the object in
view    to ascertain in what way any changes in the electrical condition
       is

of   a living part are correlated with other vital phenomena            ; and for this
purpose,    what   is  required   is  always   to  measure   the  electromotive  force
between two points differing in function (in the physiological sense).
By the electrometer this measurement is made directly.                   In employing
the galvanometer a result is obtained which acquires no absolute value
until another investigation of very great difficulty has been gone virtually
through — that of measuring the electrical resistance of the tissues which
intervene     between    the   two points investigated.         In addition to this
obvious reason for preferring the measurement of tension difference to
the measurement of current, there are other reasons why the capillarv
electrometer above described is specially adapted to the purposes of the
physiologist.      One of the principal is that its indications are sensibly in
stantaneous, on which account it is admirably suited for the investigation
of electrical changes of extremely short duration, and further that it is
portable and little liable to bo injured by being moved from place to
place.     A third advantage that it possesses is that it can be made and
graduated by the investigator himself.              When in addition it is further
remembered that for every measurement made with the galvanometer at
least ten can be made in the same time with the electrometer with
greater accuracy, it does not appear unreasonable to anticipate that the
latter will in future be much used for physiological investigations.
   The second respect in which our method differs from those previously
employed is purely physiological.            It had long been known as regards
the living animal body that the only tissues which are electromotive are
the nervous and muscular.            All others behave, so far as has been ascer
tained, as ordinary moist conductors.            Investigated electroscopically they
exhibit,   so long   as they  are  in  the living state, no variation of potential.
In the plant it is the same. An ordinary stem of a herbaceous plant
has the same      potential as the soil in which it grows, or exhibits such
trifling variations     that it may be said to be constant.           In most of the
innumerable researches        which    have been made in the domain of animal
electricity since the early discoveries of Du Bois-Eeymond, the method
has been adopted of comparing the electrical state of the part to be
investigated not with some other part of the organism outside of the
area of electrical      change, and therefore possessing in relation to such
change a constant potential,         but with some other part of the electrically
active organ itself. Thus, in the case of muscle, the cut surface has been
compared with the natural surface, the tendon with the muscular sur
face, &c.     These considerations led us to begin our investigation by com
paring    those  parts of the leaf of Dionaa which appear to be the seat of
electrical change, not with other parts of the same organ, but with the
earth or with some other part of the same plant which we had previously
ascertained to be electrically indifferent and constant, t. e. free from
electrical vicissitudes.      The way in which this was carried out will be
explained in the next section.

     The greater number of the observations were made at Kew during the
  month    of August of this year, the plauts being obtained from the hot
  houses of the Eoyal Gardens, through the kindness of the Director, and
  brought to a conservatory in the house in which one of us resided several
  days before they were used.      The parts to be compared were connected
  with the electrometer by means of electrodes of the same construction as
  those which we always employ for electro-physiological purposes. Each
  consists of a U-tube supported by a convenient holder, and half tilled
  with saturated solution of zinc sulphate.       Into one arm is plunged a
  zinc rod, of which the immersed end is amalgamated ; into the other a
  glass tube filled with kaolin made into a paste with 0-75 per cent,
  solution of chloride of sodium.      The upper end of this mass of clay
  forms a cushion, which can be moulded to any required shape.            Elec
  trodes of this form are convenient to work with, and possess manifold
  practical advantages, the greatest of all being (1) the facility with which
  they can be renewed in case they are found (by testing with the galva
  nometer) to exhibit polarity, and (2) the facility with which they can be
 brought into any desired position.
     The arrangement most usually adopted is as follows : — The pot con
 taining the plant had been previously kept plunged in water.            Three
 electrodes are used   ; by one of them (called the fixed electrode) the damp
 surface of the pot is connected with a gas-pipe.        The other two (called
 movable electrodes) are in contact with any two surfaces of the leaf
 which it is desired to investigate.   By means of a switch either can be
 brought into connexion with the krger mercurial surface of the electro
 meter.    The capillary surface is connected directly with the earth. In
 many of the experiments the capillary surface was connected directly with
 the fixed electrode.
         Section 3. — General Characters of the Electrical Disturbance.
    When the capillary mercurial surface of the electrometer is connected
by the fixed electrode with the surface of the pot or of the petiole, and
the movable one is in contact with any part of the surface of the leaf,
whether inside or out, the effect of touching a sensitive hair is (with
certain exceptions to be mentioned hereafter) to produce a transitory
advance of the mercurial column in the capillary tube towards its orifice.
Such a movement will hereafter be referred to as a negative excursion.
Its extent may be readily measured with the aid of the vertical hair-line
which crosses the field    of the microscope, and the result recorded in a
number which may express either the change of position of the mercurial
meniscus in millimerets, or the change of potential as compared with
some unit of electromotive force.
    Considering that the value of the direct measurement varies according
to the part of the capillary measured, it is clearly more convenient to

write all results in terms of the electromotive force of a standard cell,
of which the letter d is understood to denote the hundredth part.
   When the whole of the outer surface of the leaf is covered with a
mass of clay moistened with salt-solution, and the mass is brought into
contact with the movable electrode, the fixed contact being, as before,
with pot or petiole, the effect of mechanical excitation is to produce a
negative  excursion, indicating a change of potential at the movable
contact of from 3-5d to 5'Orf : when a similar plug is applied to the in

 observed in the one case, while in the other the mercurial column re

 the bridge or isthmus         electromotive
                                is                 of importance to the under

   We      have already seen that         the area of disturbance  not exceed       does
that of the leaf itself. In our endeavour to limit that area further, or
at all events to determine the position of the centre      greatest intensity,
                                                                           of
we have allowed ourselves to be guided by the consideration that as the
disturbance itself must be regarded as correlative with the property pos
sessed by the leaf of contracting when excited, that centre           likely to               is
have its seat in the excito-contractile part of the organ.    Now there can
be little doubt that the excito-contractile   property      localized   in thatis
part of the internal surface on which the sensitive hairs are planted, and
further that the tissue which takes an active part in the changes of form
by which that property manifests itself      the parenchyma, of which an

abundant stratum stretches from one lobe to the other across the midrib.
This being so, we have a region roughly mapped out for us comprising
so much of the internal surface of the leaf as lies within and around the
sensitive hairs on either side along with the whole of the space which
lies between these parts.       If, now, we proceed to contemplate the region
thus indicated, in relation to its structure, and limit it by two parallels
crossing the midrib and following the direction of the veining, we have
the whole leaf divided into three structurally analogous parts, of which
the middle part may, with reference to the excitatory changes of form,
and therefore, it may be presumed, with reference to the excitatory
changes of potential, be regarded as representative of the other two.
That we are justified in thus regarding the leaf is rendered strikingly
 evident by the result   of an experiment in which a leaf is mutilated by
 first cutting away entirely the further third in the line c (fig. 6), and
then removing all of the nearer zone, with the exception of the midrib,
 so that the leaf is reduced to the form exhibited in fig. 5.      In such a
mutilated   leaf the electrical   phenomena of the whole leaf are unaltered,
there being at first no difference between it and the entire leaf, either as
regards the potentials of the surfaces or the changes which are produced
by excitation.
    It having, on these grounds, been determined that we should direct
our attention to the middle third of the leaf, the next step was to fix on
contact points for electrical investigation.       On the internal surface of
each lobe we selected the point (evidently the most important) which is
equidistant from the three sensitive hairs, on the external surface the
point opposite and corresponding to the first, and similarly two points
on the external and internal surface respectively of the midrib, situated
in the line of junction of the before-mentioned points on the lobes. We
now proceed to state what results are obtained when these several points
are investigated, it being understood that each of them exhibits a negative
variation when it is compared with some other part of the plant lying
outside of the area of excitation.       We shall employ the following abbre
viations — viz. the letters  I and m to denote the points already indicated

     a. Mechanical Excitation.    — In four  leaves (a, b, e, d) observed in succes
 sion, the potentials and variations of the external surfaces of the midrib
 and lobe were severally, in hundredths of the standard cell, as follows : —
          erriP — pP  . . . .         0           0            0          o

    The observations given, although taken in succession, exhibit great
 differences of result.       They serve to exemplify the general statement
 that, as regards the external      surface, the variation     is greatest near the
 midrib.
    When the variation is compared on opposite and corresponding              points,
 it is almost always found that the external variation         exceeds  the internal.
Thus in nine observations the elV and ilV were respectively — 6'5 (efV)
and —2-0 (ilV), —4-5 and 0, —6-5 and —1-2, —3-5 and —2-0, — 3'5 and
 — 1-8, —6-5 and —3-0, —4-5 and —2-2, -5-5 and —2-5, — 4-5and —2-5.

     Similarly in a vigorous leaf specially investigated with reference to the
internal and external surfaces of the midrib, the results were as follows : —
      imP— pP=— 3-0,      «roP-pP=0, tmV= — 3'0 to-3'5, «mV=-5'5.
     In  at least a dozen excitable leaves which we have investigated with
reference to the conditions of the external and internal surfaces, we have
met with no exception to the statement made above as to the predominance
of the external variation.       But in two leaves which, though apparently
 health v, failed to close when excited, the external variation not only did
not exceed the internal, but was actually positive, ranging from Q-od to
 I-Od, the internal variation being normal, f. e. negative, and ranging from
  — 0'5 to — 1'2.    In both instances the potential of the outer surface was
 unusually negative, both as compared with the petiole (elP — pP= — 4'5cf)
 and as compared with the opposite internal surface (UP— pP= — 3'5d).
      These were the only instances in which the external surface ex hibited
 a positive variation.     Other leaves, however, were observed in which the
 same condition presented itself on the internal surface, and was again
 associated with an extremely negative potential.           Thus in leaf 51, in
 which the internal variation was +l-2d and the external — 3'5rf, the
 difference of potential was 3'8d ; and in leaf 52, in which the internal
 variation was +6-0d and the external — 3'5d, the difference of potential
 was 4-5d.
      Before stating  in what way we think that these apparent anomalies
 may be explained, we must give an account        of a phenomenon of the same
 kind but of much more frequent occurrence.            In perfectly fresh leaves,
 i. e. in leaves  which  have  not yet been touched,  it sometimes happens that
  when a single hair is excited at regular intervals, the first few excursions
  obtained with the movable contact on the internal surface of the lobe
  differ from the succeeding ones in being preceded by what may be pro
  visionally called a preexcursion in the opposite direction.        Thus in leaf
  22 the first effect was a mere shudder of the mercurial column, followed
  by a very small negative excursion.      The second was larger (iTV= — l-2d)
  preceded by a very perceptible movement of the mercury in the opposite
  direction.     The next two were still larger, but the preexcursion was
  still perceptible. After this the excursions were purely negative. Three
  other instances were met with of the same kind.
       That any part of the surface of the leaf should exhibit a positive ex
  cursion seems, at first sight, inconsistent with the statement which has
  been made that the variation both of the external and internal surface
  of the leaf is negative. That it is not so, may, however, be readily under
  stood from the following considerations.
       We have already seen that the petiole or other part of the plant with
  which the fixed electrode is directly or indirectly in contact is electrically
   indifferent, or, in other words, serves the purpose of an ordinary moist
   conductor, just as if it were part of the clay plug by which the contact

426        Prof. Burdon-Sanderson and Mr. F.          J. M. Page     [Dec. 14,
is made.     By means of the petiole, the whole plant and the electrode
which is applied to it and the capillary tube are in contact with an electro
motive part of the leaf, namely, the " bridge
                                                   "
                                                     already mentioned.     The
bridge, as we have seen, is within the area of electrical disturbance, and
participates in the general negative variation ; but by reason of its position,
i. e. of the fact that it is virtually in contact with the fixed electrode, and
through it with the capillary mercurial surface, its action on the electro
meter, is opposed to that of the surface to which the movable electrode is
applied.    Supposing the variation at the two contacts to be simultaneous
and to have the same sign, they must counteract each other. In general
the variation at the surface of the leaf far exceeds that at the bridge, so
that the sign of the excursion is purely negative ; but whenever the dis
turbance in the neighbourhood of the bridge happens to exceed that
which occurs at the movable contact in intensity, the excursion becomes
partially, or*entirely, positive.    That this is so may be easily shown by
the following experiment : — If in a leaf of which the internal lobe-varia
tion is negative, the fixed contact is shifted from the petiole to the end
of the midrib next the bridge, it is observed either that the excursion
diminishes or becomes at once positive, or that there is a short negative
excursion followed by a longer positive one, this signifying that although
at first the lobe-variation has the better, it yields immediately after to
the more intense disturbance at the midrib.
   The principle thus illustrated applies not merely to the particular case
now under consideration, but to every case in which the difference of
potential is measured between any part of the surface of the leaf and any
part of the surface of the plant assumed not to be electromotive.            In
every such case it must be assumed that the difference measured represents
not the whole of the electromotive force exerted at the surface of the
leaf, but only so much of it as is in excess of the electromotive force
exerted at the end of the midrib next the bridge.
   We propose to apply the term " interference excursion " to the effect
observed whenever, as in the experiment referred to at the close of the
last Section, contact is made with both electrodes within the area of dis-
turbance ; so that the electrical state of the surface is compared, n,ot with
another surface of which the potential is constant, but with a surface
which is itself a seat of change.
   The characters of such excursions are much more complicated than
those we have hitherto considered — a fact which can be readily under
stood when it is borne in mind that, as will be shown in a future section,
the electrical disturbance, although it exhibits the same general character
everywhere, does' not either begin or attain its maximum at the same
moment in different parts of its area. To a great extent the characters
of interference excursions may be understood, if along with the want of
synchronism the differences of intensity of the changes going on at the
two contacts during the period of disturbance be taken into account;

 but it will   be   readily understood       that, in some    instances,   the conditions
 are so complicated that we can scarcely hope to explain their operation
 satisfactorily or completely*.
    b. Electrical    Stimulation.    — In
                                        the experiments of which the results
 were communicated          to the Eoyal Society in 1873 it was found that the
 passage of induction-shocks in rapid succession (faradization) through the
 tissue of the leaf in the immediate neighbourhood of the external surface
 of a lobe produced effects which resembled those which follow mechanical
 excitation.    It also appeared        that this mode of excitation was exhausting         ;
for although a leaf could be excited at 2 minutes' intervals for an hour or
two without any appreciable impairment of its excitability, it soon ceased
to respond when excited very frequently.
    During the last summer we have confirmed these observations, using
 not only faradization but single induction-shocks.      For both purposes we
 have found it convenient to employ as exciting electrodes steel needles
 sheathed in glass and bound together so that their exposed points were
 about a millimeter apart.     These points were thrust through the epi
 dermis of the leaf either on the internal or external surface.
    For the production of single closing shocks the primary circuit of
 Du Bois's induction-apparatus (that of a single Daniell) was closed at
 regular intervals by a Bonder's fall-apparatus (a modification of Pfl tiger's),
 the opening shocks being suppressed by a suitable contrivance.          The ex
 periment was begun with a fresh leaf and with the secondary coil at a
 distance of from 15 to 20 centims. The electrometer indicating that there
 was no effect, the distance was gradually shortened until the electrical
 disturbance took place. The excitation was then repeated at one minute
intervals until the leaf ceased to respond.      It was always found that it
was necessary to push up the secondary coil to within a couple of inches
of the primary — in fact, to use induction-currents of such strength as
 would be sufficient to awaken reflex action from the cutaneous surface of
the frog. There was an appreciable delay between the passage of the
induction-shock and the electrical disturbance which resulted from                      it,
a delay of which the duration varied according to conditions to be dis
cussed in the next section.
    When   a  leaf   excited at intervals of
                     is                        minute, or oftener, by closing
                                                   a

                                                                     a        in   it

column remains motionless.         The effects can, however, be reproduced
either by shifting the needle-points to a new spot or               by
                                                                 diminishing the
distance of the secondary coil.     The same result can be attained without
interfering either with the coil or the electrodes, by allowing the leaf to
rest for   alonger interval.

    We next proceed to compare the effects of single shocks with that of
faradization.      The difference is striking.     If  the same experimental
method is employed as before,        with  the exception that each excitation
consists of the passage through the tissue not of a single induction-shock,
but of a rapid succession of such shocks in alternately opposite directions,
it is found that an effect is obtained with currents of relatively small
intensity, so that if the experiment is begun with the coil at 20 centims.
distance, and pushed up a centimeter at a time, the leaf begins to respond
after one or two approximations.
    This observation appeared to us to indicate plainly that, with relation
to stimuli, the excitability of the leaf resembles that of the terminal
organs of the higher animals, with reference to which it has been lately
ascertained that they can be so excited as to awaken reflexes by relatively
feeble electrical stimuli, if applied at very short intervals and repeatedly.
 We therefore proceeded to make experiments in which each excitation
consisted of a definite number of induction-shocks         in rapid succession.
 The results were in accordance with our expectations.           It having been
 ascertained that with the electrodes in a certain position a single instan
 taneous contact had no effect when the secondary coil was at 7 centims.,
 but was followed by an excursion when it was pushed into 6-5 centims.,
 it was set once more at 7 centims.             Again    a  single contact was
 without result ; two such contacts at ^-second intervals were also
 futile ; but after 3 contacts there was an excursion.         This experiment
having been several times repeated, the coil was pushed back to 8 centims.,
 and successive experiments were made with series of 2, 3, and 4 con
 tacts at £ intervals, which were in each case without effect.            After
 5 contacts, however, there was an excursion.          On now interposing the
 vibrator of the induction-apparatus, of which the rate of vibration was
 30 per second, it was found that an excursion was readily produced at a
 distance of 11 centims., thus showing that the feebler the excitation
 the more frequently must it be repeated in order that a result may
 follow.
     These facts afford the key to the understanding of the phenomena
 when the leaf is excited at short intervals by faradization, the excitation
 buing continued each time until an excursion is produced.            'When this
  plan   is adopted we have the opportunity of observing the combined
  influence of summation and of gradually increasing exhaustion.         At first
  the leaf responds after eight or ten excitations, and a series of results
  present themselves quite analogous to those related in the preceding
  paragraph    ; but as the tissue immediately surrounding the electrodes loses
  its excitability, the number of excitations required to awaken it to action
  rapidly increases, the effect being ; postponed for longer and longer
  periods until it finally fails to occur.
      Thus, in eleven successive series of excitations at one-minute interval*,

 1876.]             on the  Leaf of Dionxa. muscipula.                      429
the number of double shocks which preceded the excursion increased as
follows : —
               18, 18, 20, 23, 21, 24, 24, 27, 33, 32, 74.
After the latter no further effect was producible.
   The result may be thus interpreted.          Each excursion is an effect to
which each of the induction-shocks which precedes it contributes.            At
first the summation is rapid ; for the tissue traversed by the currents is
still prompt to enter into that molecular change of which the excursion
is the visible sign. As this promptitude to change or, as it might be
called, explosiveness, diminishes, the number of individual stimuli re
quired in order to bring about the discharge becomes rapidly larger and
larger, until at last the result is indefinitely postponed.
   When a leaf is excited at regular intervals by single shocks of such
intensity as to be just beyond the limit of adequacy, so that the slightest
diminution would render them futile, it is sometimes observed that the
effects become rhythmical.      Thus in a series of 54 successive excitations
at half -minute intervals, we obtained the following results : — Excitations
1, 2, 3, and 4 were effectual ; but of the sixteen excitations following, every
other was futile, the alternate ones being followed by excursions ; then
followed during 8 minutes a series of futile excitations, after which the
leaf was allowed to rest for 2 minutes.           On resuming, the alternate
rhythm again appeared for six excitations, then becoming modified so
that an excursion followed every fourth instead of every third excitation,
a state of things which continued for a quarter of an hour.            In other
instances the same tendency showed itself, but less distinctly, the usual
result being (as has been already stated) that no further effect was produced
so long as the same spot was acted upon by currents of the same in
tensities.
   The fact that by changing the seat of insertion of the needle-points
the excursions could at any time be reproduced we regard as of import
ance, as showing that the excitability of the plant is a property possessed,
so to speak, independently by the protoplasm of every cell in the excitable
area.    When, after repeated excitations at any particular point, effects
cease to manifest themselves, their absence denotes, not that the whole
leaf is exhausted (for if it were so, change of insertion would not renew
them), but merely that the excitability of the tissue in the immediate
contact with the needle-points has been blunted.
Section 5. — The Electrical   Disturbance considered   in Relation  to the Time
                                 which it occupies.
    It has already been stated that the change of form consequent on
excitation does not begin until electrical disturbance is entirely over. In
other words, the latter occupies a period during which, while no visible
changes are taking place, molecular changes must certainly be in progress
in the excited part — a period which, with reference to muscle, Du Bois
                                                                2n2

Eeymond has fitly termed the " period of latent excitation."          In the
plant  the  time occupied by   this preparatory and   invisible change is, as
might be expected, many times as great as it is in animal muscle ; and
in consequence of this greater prolongation the electrical phenomena,
the only ones with which we are as yet acquainted, which accompany it
can be studied with much greater completeness. In muscle the electrical
disturbance begins, according to the researches of Bernstein, confirmed
by Du Bois-Eeymond, about 0"'005 after electrical excitation of the
nerve*.      In the plant this period, which may be called the period
of electrical delay, is always of perceptible duration, and may last over a
second.             To measure it we have employed the apparatus previously
described as used for investigating the time of commencement of the
first mechanical effects, with the exception that the signalling-key is so
modified that the same act which      closes the signal-circuit excites the
leaf.  This is effected by fixing to the spring of the closing-key a lead
wire which carries at its end a fine camel-hair pencil, so that when the
spring is depressed contact is made, and the hairs of the leaf are touched
at the same moment.
   The time which intervenes                         between excitation                 and the beginning of
the electrical   disturbance varies in different leaves according to then-
vigour,  but is very much affected by variations of temperature.  In sum
mer weather and with normal leaves the variation on the external sur
face at ihe midrib, or at the outer surface of the lobe, when the sensitive
hairs   the same side are touched, is found to begin about one eighth of
        oj1
a second after excitation.  When the opposite hairs are excited, the
period is increased to a quarter of a second. In six fairly normal leaves
under various conditions, in which the delay was measured with the
fixed contact on the petiole, and the movable one on the outer surface
of one lobe, the results given in the following Table were obtained.

   Combining the numbers contained in the two Tables, we have 0-295 as
the mean delay at midrib, O231 as the mean delay at the outer surface
of the lobe when the seat of excitation is close to the contact at which
its effect is observed, and lastly 0'403 as the delay when the electrical
disturbance has to make its way through the midrib from the opposite
side of the leaf ; so that O17, or one sixth of a second, is the time
required for the transmission of the effects from one side to the other.
All  the observations on which these numbers                 are founded were made by
mechanical     stimulation.        In   a few experiments      we substituted stimula
tion by single induction-shocks, modifying our apparatus by introducing
the electro-magnetic chronograph into the primary circuit, so that the
moment of its closure was recorded on the cylinder.                       The results we
obtained were remarkably uniform, and confirmed those already recorded.
Thus in four observations in which the needle-points were inserted into
the outer surface of one lobe close to the movable contact, the intervals
were respectively 0'25, 0-25, 0-28, 0-25.                When they were inserted into
the opposite lobe of the same leaf they were 0-42, 0-49, 0-52, 0-48, 0-56,
0-45, 0-54, 0-52, 0-50, 0-46, 0-55. The mean gives 0-18 as the time
which the variation takes in order to cross from one side to the other.
If  we assume the distance thus traversed by what we may call the wave
of negative variation to          be 8 millims., more or less, we have the rate of
propagation about 4'4 centims. per second, that is 600 times as slow as
in nerve. This estimate is, no doubt, too low ; for some of the observa
tions were made in cool weather, and we now know that the process is
much affected by temperature.                 If we take as our basis, observations
made under the most favourable               circumstances in this respect, we have
for the   outside    of  the   leaf  close   to the seat of excitation 0-13, and for
the opposite side 0-24, which gives 0'll instead of 0-18 as the time
required for transmission.              In one instance, indeed, we observed by
repeated careful measurements as short a period as 0-06 under normal
circumstances.        In the experiments to be mentioned in the next section,
when the leaves were artificially warmed, the delay was similarly abbre
viated.     This subject requires further investigation *.
   * It is to be remembered      that the measurements     were not made   in the hothouse,
but in an ordinary room. At the time they            were  made  we were   not aware of the
remarkable influence of temperature.

   In  the few cases in which we determined the moment at which the
variation commenced (by mechanical stimulation) on the internal and
external surface of the leaf respectively, we found that there was a dif
ference in favour of the outside.    Thus in one leaf (89) the delay at the
outer surface of the lobe was 0-18, at the inner 0-30, at the outer sur
face of the midrib 0-34, and at the inner 0-38.
   When, however, electrical stimulation is used, the difference becomes
very obvious.    In one of the experiments already referred to, relating
to faradization with weak currents, we employed two movable electrodes,
one on the external, the other on the internal surface of a lobe of a leaf,
the fixed contact being on the petiole, and the needles being inserted into
the opposite lobe. When by this means the excursions were taken
alternately from the outer and inner surface, it became very obvious that
in every instance the outside excursion began first.      At the commence
ment of the experiment when the condition of the excited part remained
fairly normal, the delays in seconds were as follows : —
           Outside                    0-48, 0-50, 0-52,  0~G5, 0-49.
           Inside                     0-71, 0-61, 0-68, 0-75, 0-95.
   As exhaustion   came  on, the difference was more and more obvious.
The following observations were made at intervals of a minute : —
           Outside              0-69, 0-82, 0-93, 0-78, 0-98, 2-26.
           Inside               0-89, 0-99, 1-13, 1-08, 1-43, 3-57.
After which no further results were produced until the distance of the
secondary coil    was reduced from eight to seven centims.            On then
exciting  every half minute the results were : —
           Outside                                 0-56, 0-66, 1-32.
           Inside                                  0-71, 1-43, 1-89.
 After bringing the coil to six centims. we had : —
           Outside                                       0-60, 1-08.
           Inside                                        0-82, 2-07.
   When, instead of investigating contacts comprised within the central
parts of the leaf, a comparison is made between the time at which the
excursion begins at the centre with that at which it becomes appreciable
towards the margin of the area of excitation, delays very much greater
than those we have been considering present themselves.           Thus, when
mechanical stimulation is used, and the two movable electrodes are
placed severally on the under surface of the midrib, a little beyond the
middle and on the bridge, the delays were     : —
      On the midrib                  0-27, 0-25, 0-22, 0-26, 0-32, 0-32,

  giving, as means, for the midrib 0-27, for the bridge 058. In another
 leaf similar comparisons were made between the excursion at the outer
  surface of the left lobe opposite the hairs and the bridge, with these
  results  : —
              On the outside                        0-26, 0-24, 0-12, 0-18.

     In  these instances the distance traversed by the wave of negative varia
 tion    was not even so great as          in the cases in which its progress was
 investigated     from one side of the leaf to the other ; so that it might, at
 first sight, be inferred from the much greater prolongation of the delay
 that the rate of transmission was slower towards the root of the leaf than
 across it. It is possible that it is so, but it cannot be inferred from the
 measurements ; for in the case of the observations relating to the bridge
 two excursions are compared of very different intensity ; and when this
 is the case the weaker one appears to be behind the other, and is, in fact,
 seen last even when the two culminate simultaneously.
     The time at which the mercurial column reaches its furthest point
 (acme of excursion), and the time at which it returns to its original posi
 tion, have been severally determined in a considerable number of instances
 in normal leaves. The results are embodied in the following Table.
 All of them relate to observations in which the fixed contact was at the
 external surface of the leaf, viz. in four cases on the outer surface of
 a lobe, in four cases on the midrib.           In all the cases the excitation was
 mechanical, and the hairs touched were in the immediate neighbourhood
 of the contact.

    From this Table the general conclusion may               be drawn that in normal
leaves, in    which the excursion       begins   to be    appreciable by the electro
meter at the external surface, at about a sixth of a second after mechanical
excitation, the excursion attains its maximum in one second, and that its

return occupies about the same time, so that we may regard two seconds
as the duration of the whole process of latent stimulation.         We have
already seen that the mechanical effect of excitation, viz. the change of
form of the leaf, does not begin until at least two seconds and a half after
the excitation ; consequently it may be concluded that in every instance
the electrical effect is entirely over before the mechanical effect begins.
                           Section 6. — Influence of Temperature.
  The conspicuous analogies which, throughout our investigations, have
presented themselves between the phenomena of excitation in the leaf
and those which occur in nerve and muscle, rendered it of great import
ance to ascertain whether those physical agents which are known to exer
cise a decisive influence on the excitation process in animal tissue have
a  similar influence on that in the plant. This subject we propose to
investigate more fully next season. In the mean time we submit the
results of two experiments, either of which would be sufficient to show
that the influence of temperature on the plant corresponds completely
with what is known as to its effect on the contractile tissue of animals.
   In each case a leaf, which for this purpose was necessarily detached
from the plant, was investigated at the ordinary temperature of a room,
then placed for twenty minutes in a chamber warmed to 45 C., and then
cooled by placing a block of ice in its neighbourhood.  The results of the
chronometrical comparison of its condition, under these circumstances,
are as follows :—

       BURDON-SANDERSON,         M.D.,   F.R.S. Received December 6,
       1876.
   In   the great work entitled ' Untersuch1mgen iiber thierische Electri-
citat,' of which the first volume was published hy Professor du Bois-
Eeymond in 1848, the author promulgated, as the result of the remark
able investigations undertaken by him during the previous six years,
certain propositions relating to the electromotive properties of muscle.
These propositions (which in the original work were printed in large
                                                         "
type) were termed by the author collectively the Law of the muscle-
current." They have been accepted by all later observers as fundamental
truths. They are as follows : —
   " The Law                             I. Active arrangements. A. Strong
                 of the Muscle-current.
 Currents.    If any point of the natural or artificial longitudinal section of
a muscle is brought into connexion with any point of the natural or artificial
transverse section of the same muscle, so that no tension is thereby pro
duced, a current is indicated by any galvanoscopic apparatus introduced
into the inactive conducting circuit, of which the direction in the cir
cuit is from the longitudinal to the transverse section. — B. Weak Currents.
a. Currents of the transverse section.   Further, if any point of a natural
or artificial transverse section of a muscle is connected in the manner
already described with another point of the same transverse section, or with
a point of another natural or artificial transverse section of the same
muscle, which we will regard as a cylinder, and if the points are at unequal
distances from the centre of the circular area of the transverse section,
the galvanoscopic apparatus again indicates a current, though much
weaker than the previous one, of which the direction is from the point
more distant from the centre to the nearest point. —b. Currents of
the   longitudinal section. Thirdly, if a point of the natural or arti
ficial longitudinal section, lying nearer to the geometrically central
transverse section of the cylinder formed by the muscle, is brought
in the same way into relation with a point of the natural or artificial
longitudinal section of the same muscle more distant from the central
transverse   section, the galvanoscopic apparatus again indicates a cur
rent, which is, however, much weaker than that between any point of
the natural or artificial longitudinal and any point on the transverse
section, but is equal in strength to that between different points on one or
two natural or artificial transverse sections. Its direction in the circuit
is from the point lying nearer to the middle transverse section to that
further removed from it. — II. Inactive       arrangements.     The galvano
scopic apparatus, on the contrary, remains at rest when two points in
one or two natural or artificial transverse sections connected through
the inactive conducting circuit are at an equal distance from the centre ;

or when one or two points in the natural or artificial longitudinal section
so connected are at an equal distance from the central transverse section."
   The purpose of the present note is to put on record observations
which prove
   (1) That the unmutilated gastrocnemius muscle of the frog possesses
electromotive properties which have not before been correctly described ;
                      " muscle-cylinder " of Du Bois-Beymond, the electro
   (2) That in the
motive phenomena are dependent on and determined by those of the
muscle, and exhibit electrical properties which, in many important respects,
are inconsistent   with the " law ; "
   (3) That the electrical change consequent on excitation, and termed
by Du Bois
                " negative variation," in like manner possesses characters
different from those assigned to it by him ;
   (4) That it is not true, as averred by Professor Hermann, that the
electrical state of muscle becomes negative during contraction as com
pared with that of muscle at rest.      On the contrary, the contracting parts
become positive.
   The following statements refer to the gastrocnemius          muscle of the
frog.
    1. When one terminal of the Lippmann's capillary electrometer (de
scribed in a previous paper by Mr. Page and myself) is connected by
a suitable electrode (to be called the fixed electrode) with the surface of
the back of a previously decapitated and pithed frog, and the other (the
movable electrode) with the surface of the gastrocnemius muscle at a
distance of from two to five millims. from the upper end, it is found
that the position of the mercurial column is nearly unaltered, indicating
that there is no, or only a slight, difference of potential between the two
surfaces thus compared.       If the potential of the surface of the muscle
be positive, the neutral point can be found by shifting the electrode
further down ; if negative, by shifting it further up.
    2. If now the movable electrode is gradually shoved down the surface
of the muscle without breaking contact, the mercury alters its position
so as to indicate greater and greater negativity of the muscular surface,
until at last a point is reached near the tendon beyond which the surface
again    becomes   positive, the positivity increasing   as the tendon  is ap
proached.
    3. If, the fixed contact remaining unaltered, the points already inves
tigated are compared with other parts of the muscle, it is found that,
as a rule, (a) any two points equidistant from the origin of the muscle
exhibit the   same potential, and (h) that the ends of the muscle exhibit
potentials which are identical with the potentials of the inactive tissues
 (e.g. subcutaneous cellular tissue, bone, &c) in the neighbourhood, this
being true both as regards the insertion (tendon) and the origin of the
muscle.

1876.]              Electromot1ve Propert1es   of Muscle.                437
  4.   If the tendon is divided and the muscle, remaining attached by its
origin, is separated from its other connexions, so that it is out of contact
with surrounding tissues, and in this state is reinvestigated, it is found
that the negativity increases from its origin towards the negative point,
and diminishes from that point towards the tendon in the same way as
before, the only change observable being that the absolute difference of
potential between that spot and the fixed contact is greater than before,
i. e. that all the other less differences are proportionally exaggerated.
  5.      If
          the muscle is thrown into tetanic contraction by faradization
of the sciatic nerve for a period of two seconds' duration, the excitation is
accompanied by an excursion of which the direction is positive, and which
attains its maximum during the second half of the period during which
the excitation lasts, beginning to decline immediately after its cessation.
The extent of the excursion is such as to indicate that the electromotive
force of the muscular    tissue diminishes by about a third.   This pheno
menon is observed before as well as    after separation of the muscle from
its connexions.
   6. If now the muscle is severed in its upper third by a cut transverse
to its axis, and again in the region of greatest negativity by a second
cross cut, a muscle-cylinder is obtained having the following properties,
viz. : — (1) The upper cut surface is negative to the natural surface in its
neighbourhood, but positive to the more distant parts.       Between these
parts an intermediate   zone  may manifestly   be found  where   the tension
 of the natural surface is equal to that of the upper cut surface.
    (2) As compared with any point of the natural surface in this zone
 the lower cut surface is strongly negative ; any point of the natural sur
face nearer the lower cut surface is also negative, its negativity increasing
with its distance from the zone ; and in like manner any point nearer the
upper cut surface is positive, the more so the further it is from the
zone.
   (3) When the muscle-cylinder is thrown into contraction by contact
with platinum wires in connexion with the ends of the secondary coil
of a Du Bois's induction-apparatus, excitatory variations are observed,
having the following characters : — a. If one terminal of the electrometer
is in connexion with the natural surface at a point equidistant from both
ends (Du Bois's equator), and the other with the upper cut surface, the
position of the mercurial column indicates that the cut surface is nega
tive to the natural surface,  »'.  e. the former to the latter.   On excitation
the difference of tension between the two increases — e., in Du Bois's lan
                                                       i.
guage,     positive variation occurs.
               a                        b.    If the same part of the natural
surface      now
               is  compared    with  the lower  cut surface, and the excitation
 repeated, the difference of tension between the two    is   found to be in the
 game direction as in the former case, but much greater.          On excitation
it  diminishes  — 1. «., in Du Bois's language,a    negative variation occurs.

         spects   : —
            (1) That the electrical tensions of the upper and lower cut surfaces,
         instead of being identical, differ widely ;
            (2) That the equatorial zone of the natural surface presents none of
         the properties assigned to it by the " law ;
                                                                         "
                                                                                                            " law."

            8.  On the ground of these experiments                         I conclude that in the gastro
         cnemius of the frog the part nearest the tendon is (in the natural state)
         negative to the opposite end, and from the investigation of other muscles
         of the limbs       I  infer that in them the distribution of electrical tension
         on the natural surface is governed by a similar law.                                   I  have further
         shown that the phenomenon hitherto known to physiologists as the
         " negative variation " cannot be described as " diminution of a previ
                                          "
         ously existing current              between cut and natural surface, but may, in
         all its phases, be completely explained as a temporary diminution of the
         electromotive force of those parts of the muscle which are in the natural
         state negative as compared with the electrically inactive tissues of the
         body of the animal ; and, as a direct consequence of this, that the excita
         tory variation of animal muscle is opposed in sign to that of the excito-
         contractile tissue of Dionaea.
            9. This being understood, all that is observed in the muscle-cylinder
         can be explained as resulting from the properties exhibited by the muscle
         itself before its mutilation ; so that it is not only true that the general
         properties of the cylinder can be deduced from those of the muscle as a
         whole, but that (as the Tables show) the special peculiarities of each
         particular    case may        be accurately          foretold if the whole organ has before
         been investigated.

           Vaso-motor Nerves of Striated Muscle." By W. H. GASEELL,
           M.A., Trinity          College,    Cambridge.         Communicated by              Dr.
           MICHAEL FOSTEB, F.E.S. Received November 23, 1876.
                                             (Abstract.)
        When    a muscle is      thrown into a state of tetanus by stimulation of its
   nerve,    it seems,     at first sight, reasonable to suppose that the contraction
   of the muscle substance must cause a considerable pressure on the vessels
   of the muscle, and, therefore, that for this reason less blood must pass
   through ; and,        if at the   same time that       the motor fibres are stimulated
   vase-constrictor        fibres are also stimulated, one must conclude that during
   the tetanus of a muscle there is a very much less volume of blood flowing
   through.
        On the other hand, in order for the muscle to do work for any length
   of time, it is necessary that there should be a greater facility for the
   removal of the waste products and a more active supply of nutritive
   material during the state of contraction than when the muscle is at rest.
   This hypothesis necessitates, therefore, a greater flow of blood through
   the muscle during the tetanus of that muscle.
        Which of these two statements is the true one, Sadler (Ludwig's
   '
      Arbeiten,' 1869) has already indicated. As, however, his method and his
   results are not absolutely satisfactory, I, at the suggestion and with the
   help of Professor Ludwig, carried out last year, in Leipzig, a series of
   experiments of the same nature as his, and, by means of much improved

440            Mr. W. H. Gaskell               on the      Action of the          [Dec. 14,
apparatus, was enabled to obtain much more satisfactory and trustworthy
results than he did.
   Speaking briefly, we found that, in the case' of the quadriceps extensor
of the dog, stimulation of the anterior crural nerve, by means of the in
terrupted current for a short time, say 15 seconds, caused a considerable
outspurt of blood from the muscle-vein, followed by a complete cessation
of flow, and that at the end of the tetanus there was an immense out
pouring from the vein.
   In the case of a longer tetanus we saw that, following upon the tem
porary cessation of flow, blood again began to stream out, gradually and
continuously increasing in volume, until at last, even while the muscle
was still in a state of tetanus, there was much more blood flowing from
the vein than before the commencement of the stimulation.
   On my return to England, wishing to examine more closely this phe
nomenon,   I   determinedto investigate              it,
                                               possible, under the micro

one for my purpose,    being easy to prepare
                        it                      for microscopic observa

tion without damaging the circulation through       and, in fact, without
                                                                  it,
even touching the muscle whilst, owing to its thinness, the small amount
                             ;
of connective tissue in the neighbourhood of the                  vessels,   and the absence
of pigment-cells,  it  possible here to measure with
                        is                               micrometer eye a
piece the diameter of vessels more accurately and easily than in any other
preparation.
   Upon placing this muscle under the microscope, without having pre
viously touched the nerve,       seen that the circulation presents much
                                 it   is
the same character as in the web, the median red-corpuscle stream with
an inert layer on each side being plainly visible, although, perhaps owing
to the manipulation, the arteries at first are slightly fuller and more
dilated than the corresponding vessels in the web. The calibre of the
smaller arteries does not, as   rule, remain for any length of time the
                                      a
same, variations taking place somewhat similar to what has often been
described in the vessels of the web, but with this difference, that whereas
in the so-called " rhythmic contractions " of the arteries in the web the
artery appears to contract to         a    point and then to return to its
                                           certain
original calibre or beyond      in the arteries of the muscle the vessel
                                  it,
appears  to d1late from the normal   calibre, and then gradually to return
to that calibre or below it. These dilatations vary considerably in extent
and are absolutely irregular in time, being much less marked both in fre
quency and extent in some frogs than in others, and depend, so       seems          it
to me, probably upon some chance stimulation of the vessels, such as
exposure to the air, &c.
   Upon direct stimulation of the web                   by
                                                means of the interrupted
current there occurs    most marked constriction, not only of the arteries
                        a

I  can, however, affirm positively that there    no contraction of the is

442              Mr. W. H. Gaskell      on the   Action of the       [Dec 14,
given as thereby to cause a decided tetanus of the muscle, it is possible
to observe, under a low power of the microscope, similar phenomena to
 those that take place in the experiments on the blood-stream in the qua
 driceps extensor of dogs that    I have already referred to. Upon the com
 mencement of the tetanus there is a sudden onward propulsion of the
 blood in the large veins, followed by a complete stoppage of the blood
 stream in them, even sometimes a retrograde stream ; while in the arteries
 the stream flows steadily on, increasing in rapidity and increasing in
 fullness ; the arteries dilate, the capillaries on the arterial side become
 large, filled with blood, very active, and, finally, after a few spasmodic
 attempts to move onwards, the blood in the veins seems to burst the
 restraining barriers, moves on more and more rapidly, continually in
 creasing in fullness, even though there is still a steady tetanus of the
 muscle ; and at last, on ending the stimulation, there is seen an extremely
 rapid, greatly dilated circulation throughout the whole muscle ; gradually
 and slowly the stream slackens, the arteries contract, and at last there is
again a quiet axial stream in the arteries and a slow steady flow in the
veins.     At the moment of commencing and ending the stimulation there
is an instantaneous stop in the arterial flow ; except at these times, the
blood flows continuously in the arteries during the whole stimulation.
This phenomenon confirms in every particular the observations made by
me at   Leipzig, and explains most satisfactorily the nature of the curves
obtained there.
    By employing larger   doses  of curare it is possible to examine the effects
of nerve stimulation apart from all contraction of the muscle. The fol
lowing facts are observed then, in a thoroughly curarized muscle, upon
stimulation of the nerve by means of an interrupted current.          Whether
the stimulus is long or short, there is always a rapid and very marked
dilatation of the artery under examination, which does not commence
until some 5 or 6 seconds after the beginning of the stimulation. During
this latent period there is not the slightest trace of any constriction, the
calibre of the vessel remaining either the same as before the stimulation,
or if the stimulation is applied while the artery is dilating or constricting,
then this dilatation or constriction continues during this period ; and even
if the stimulation is applied at a time when the artery is considerably
dilated, there is no trace of constriction, but, on the contrary, a still
further dilatation.    The maximum of dilatation occurs about 20 or 30
seconds after the commencement of the stimulation, and can be so great
that the diameter of the artery may attain to nearly three times that
which it possessed originally ; it is always accompanied by a greater
rapidity and fullness of the blood-flow, the whole circulation throughout
the muscle becoming much more active ; it lasts, as a rule, only a few
seconds at this maximum height, and then the size of the vessel gradually
diminishes to the normal, the blood-stream becoming thinner and rather
slower, until, as before the stimulation, there is a steady normal axial

  flow.    It  is not possible to keep up the dilatation for any length of time,
  so that   if the stimulation  is long, say a minute or more, before the end of
  it  the vessel may have regained its normal calibre ; and if the stimulus
  is long enongh and strong enough, then it is possible for a secondary effect
  to be produced in the form of a decided constriction of the vessel follow
  ing upon the dilatation and occurring after the stimulation is ended, this,
  again, being followed by a recovery to the normal diameter.             It is thus
  seen that, while in the case of the web stimulation of the sciatic always
  causes constriction, followed after strong stimulation by dilatation, in the
  case of the muscle    stimulation of its nerve always causes a dilatation of
  the vessels, followed, after strong stimulation, by a decided constriction
  of the same ; so that it seems highly probable that, when the sciatic in
  the frog is stimulated, constriction in the web is accompanied by dilata
  tion in the muscles of the leg, and dilatation in the web by constriction
 in those muscles. Moreover, as it is possible to keep up the constriction
 in the web for a much longer time, by commencing with a weak stimulus
 and gradually increasing its strength, so        I think, too, that the dilatation
 in the muscle can be made more enduring by the same method.
     Rhythmic stimulation of the nerve, by means of single induction-shocks,
 repeated at intervals of 2 or 5 seconds, produces the same kind of dilatation
 as the interrupted current.
     If, as sometimes occurs, owing perhaps to the muscle being over
 stretched or some other cause, the circulation through it is found
 to   be nearly    stagnant,  the arteries     constricted, the capillaries barely
 visible, it is only necessary      to stimulate  the nerve in order to produce a
  full active circulation throughout ; and this occurs even during the stimu
 lation ; while, under the same circumstances, in the web there is still
 further stagnation produced, still greater constriction, and it is only after
 the stimulation     has ceased that an increased and more active flow takes
place.
     A marked dilatation of the vessel is often seen to occur in an appa
 rently empty artery before the first rush of blood-corpuscles makes its
 appearance ; and this dilatation does not always occur over the whole
vessel at once, but rather parts of the previously constricted vessel appear
to bulge out, the intermediate parts remaining still constricted ; so that
the vessel has somewhat the appearance of a string of pearls, and gradu
ally as the vessel dilates more and more, and the blood-stream increases
in volume and rapidity, the walls of the vessel lose this uneven appear
ance and become uniformly dilated.
     Seeing, then, that even when the blood-current in the muscle is feeble
(that is, when the pressure in the vessel is diminished) stimulation of the
nerve    always causes a marked dilatation,         I determined to observe the
effect of stimulation when the arterial pressure had been removed by
compressing the aorta.
    Directly after the aorta is compressed by a clip a steady, rather rapid cou-

striction of the artery takes place, which soon reaches its limit, and the
hitherto slowly moving corpuscles remain stationary, the vessel appearing
empty, except for a few corpuscles stationed here and there.       Upon now
stimulating the nerve the vessel is seen steadily to dilate, a slow stream of
corpuscles appears in it moving in the reverse direction (that is, from the
veins to the artery), and this occurs without the slightest trace of muscu
lar contraction.     The dilatation is very appreciable, though not, so far as
I  have seen, of as great an extent as the stimulus produces when there ia
a normal blood-stream in the vessel ; and if now the aorta is unclipped,
there is at first a slight constriction, followed by a much greater dila
tation.
   At present it appears to me that the pressure in the vein is sufficient
                                      I
to account for this phenomenon ; intend, however, to carry out further
experiments on this point.
                             I
   As to reflex stimulation, have never been able to cause any dilatation
in the arteries of the mylohyoid by stimulation of the central ends of
either the sciatic or vagus nerves ; but, on the contrary,   I
                                                            have always seen
either no effect produced, or a decided though slight constriction of the
vessel — slight, that is,in comparison to the marked constriction occurring
in the arteries of the web under the same circumstances.
   Love'n having noticed the occurrence of dilatation in the saphena
artery and in the vessels of the ear of the rabbit upon stimulation of the
central end of the tibial nerve and the great auricular respectively,      I
 have attempted to obtain similar dilatation in the web by stimulating the
central ends of either the peroneal or posterior tibial nerves, the other
nerve in each case being left intact, and, in the mylohyoid and pectoralia
major muscles, by stimulation of the central end of the opposite mylo
hyoid and brachial nerves_respectively, but in each case have seen no trace
of dilatation, but always constriction.
   As to the effect of direct stimulation of the spinal cord upon the vessels
of  a muscle, I  think it  probable that dilatation occurs, as Hafiz has as
serted but as
        ;      I    have not yet made any systematic experiments to deter
mine this point,  I   think it best to leave this question for future con
sideration.
   Atropin does not impair the action of the nerve on the vessels of the
mylohyoid; for after repeated injections of sulphate of atropin sub-
cutaneously, until, with very strong stimulation of the vagus, no effect
could be produced 011 the heart,     was still easy to cause dilatation of
                                      it
the arteries in the muscle       by
                               stimulation of the nerve.     So, too, large
and repeated doses of curare produce no such effect here, as they are said
to do on the vagus fibres in the heart.
   As Qaude Bernard has described dilatation of branches of the facial
                                           a
artery and an increase of secretion in the submaxillary gland upon stimu
lation of the mylohyoid nerve in dogs, have examined other muscles in
                                           I
the frog, and have found that the same phenomena can be

the lateral portion of the rectus abdominis          muscle and the abdominal
portion of the pectoralis major muscle.
    As to the tongue, it   seemed    to me that haviug here a more compli
cated organ, supplied with so many more nerves than a simple muscle,
and one that had been already frequently examined without much success,
it was not   so suitable to the object in view.      From the few experiments,
however, that 1 have made on this organ, it seema to me that stimula
tion of the glosgopharyngeal nerve, rather than the hypoglossal, causes
dilatation of its vessels.
    In concluding   this short sketch of my experiments       I would venture to
say that as, from my own      observations,   stimulation  of the anterior crural
nerve of dogs causes, dilatation of the vessels in that group of muscles
known by the name of quadriceps extensor, while Sadler has shown the
same for the biceps and semitendinosus muscles and for the flexor com-
munis digitorum of the forearm, and as, in frogs, stimulation of their
respective nerves causes dilatation of the vessels in the 1nylohyoid, pec
toralis major, and rectus abdomiuis muscles, it is reasonable to suppose
 that this holds good for simple voluntary muscles throughout the body.
    I would further add that the beauty of the circulation and the extent
 of the dilatation that may be observed in the arteries of the mylohyoid
muscle lead one to hope that further investigations here may materially
assist in solving the vexed question, " What is the mechanism by which
 dilatation of a vessel is caused ?
                                     "
    All the foregoing observations on the circulation in the muscles of the
frog were carried on in the Physiological Laboratory of the University of
 Cambridge.

Considerable delay has arisen from the necessity, for these observations,
of a more uniform motion of the driving-clock. For this purpose, Mr.
Howard Grubb has successfully applied to the clock the control of a
seconds pendulum in electric connexion with a sidereal clock.           This
system works quite satisfactorily.
   The prisms employed are made of Iceland spar, and the lenses of
quartz.    After an extensive trial of different photographic processes,
preference has been given to dry plates.
   The apparatus is so arranged that a solar or electric spectrum can be
taken on the same plate, for the purpose of comparison, with the spectrum
of the star. Spectra have heen obtained of Sirius, Vega, Venus, the
Moon, <fec.
  I  do not purpose in this preliminary notice to describe in detail the
arrangements of the special apparatus which has been constructed, nor
to offer the results of the experiments in their present incomplete state to
the fioyal Society.       I
                       Still venture to hope that, even in this early stage
of the inquiry, the enlarged copy of the spectrum of Vega (a Lyrae)
which accompanies this note may not be regarded as altogether unworthy
of attention.
  After exposure to the light of Vega, the dry plate was allowed to
remain  in the instrument until the following morning, when a solar
spectrum was taken upon       it,
                               through the half of the slit which had
remained closed when the instrument was directed to the star.
   The photograph shows seven strong lines, all of them slightly shaded
at the sides. The two lines which are least refrangible coincide with two
known lines of hydrogen in the solar spectrum.
   It is expected, by means of an apparatus now in the course of con
struction, to obtain also any finer lines which may be present in the
spectrum of this star, as well as to extend the photographic method to
stars which are less bright.
I    need not now refer to the many important questions in connexion
with which photographic observations of stars may be of value.

       Reflection from the Pole of a Magnet."            By GEORGE FRANCIS
       FITZGERALD, M.A. Communicated by G. JOHNSTONE                 STONEY,
       F.R.S. Received November 14, 1876.
   At   a meeting   of the Dublin Scientific Club on Monday the 6th No
vember, Professor Barrett gave the Club an account of Mr. Kerr's
experiments on the rotation of the plane of polarization of a ray of light
when reflected from the surface of the end of a magnet, to which addi
tional interest was attached by the reading of a letter from Mr. Kerr to
Professor Barrett giving an account of the mode of making and of the
last results of his experiments.                     I
                                      At the time proposed trying whether
any similar effects would be produced by reflection from the surface of a
crystal of quartz cut perpendicularly to the axis, as       I was led to think
there might be, owing to the similarity of the rotatory polarization of
quartz and of substances under magnetic action. Following out that
clue,  I obtained the following explanation of Mr. Kerr's experiment, and
was enabled, through Professor Barrett's kindness in helping me to
verify my recollections of Mr. Kerr's letter, to make sure that my theory
explains the facts.
   Faraday has shown, in the nineteenth         series of his experimental re
searches,   that a ray  of plane-polarized light, when transmitted through
any solid (diamagnetic ?) transparent medium under the action of a
powerful magnet, has the plane of its polarization rotated in that direc
tion in which a positive current must circulate round the ray in order to
produce a magnetic force in the same direction as that which actually
exists in the medium.      Verdet, however, discovered that in certain ferro
magnetic media (as, for instance, a strong solution of perchloride of iron
in wood-spirit or ether) the rotation is in the opposite direction to the
current which would produce the magnetic force.
   Now Fresnel's explanation of the rotatory power of quart/- has been
applied by Professor Maxwell, in his 'Electricity and Magnetism,'
vol. ii. p. 402, to explain the similar, though not identical, phenomenon
of magnetic rotation of light. He there, in § 812, gives this explanation
in the following words :— " A plane-polarized ray falls on the medium.

448             Mr. G. F. Fitzgerald           on the Rotation           of             [Dec. 21,
This is equivalent to two circularly polarized rays, one right- and the
other left-handed (as regards the observer).     After passing through the
medium the ray is still plane-polarized, but the plane of its polarization
is turned, say, to the right (as regards the observer).  Hence of the two
circularly polarized rays, that  which  is right-handed  must  have had its
phase accelerated with respect to the other during its passage through
the medium.         In      other words, the right-handed ray has performed a
greater number            of vibrations, and therefore has a smaller wave-length
within the medium than the left-handed ray which has the same periodic
time." This is the same as saying that the velocity of the right-handed
ray is less within the medium than the left-handed, or that the refractive
 index for right-handed rays is greater than for left-handed in a medium
 that rotates light to the right. Hence, from what Verdet has shown, it
 appears that, in a ferro-magnetic substance, for a ray of light travelling
from the south to the north pole, the magnetic action is such as to male
the refractive index for riylit-lianded circularly polarized rays less than for
left-handed ones ; for in this case the plane of polarization is turned to
the left, for   it is     a right-handed   current that would produce the magnetic
force.
   By applying this to the             of light reflected from the south pole of
                                    case
a magnet, we get          what   I believe to be the
                                                   true explanation of Sir. Kerr's
interesting experiment.         In like manner, as in the case of a transmitted
ray,  I  consider   the  incident  plane-polarized ray to be the resultant of
two circularly polarized ones, one right- and the other left-handed.             Now,
for the right-handed         one, the   refractive   index  at  the  surface   of  the
south pole of the magnet, being a ferro-magnetic substance, is less than
for the left-handed ray. Hence if each of the two circularly polarized
rays be supposed to be the resultant of two plane-polarized rays, ono
polarized in the plane of incidence and the other at right angles to                           it,
the intensities of these four rays being equal,            it evident that the in
                                                                is
tensities of the pair of reflected rays corresponding to the left-handed
 ray will be greater than the corresponding intensities of those due to the
right-handed ray.        Hence the two rays which were polarized perpendi
 cularly   to   the  plane of incidence, and which originally destroyed one
 another, will, after reflection,' have       component in the direction of the
                                               a
 vibration of the left-handed ray after reflection.            Now, on account of
 the change of direction of the ray on reflection, this latter           towards the
                                                                                   is
 right. This         completely explained in M. Jamin's         Cours de Physique,'
                 2, is
                                                                     '

 rays, one polarized in the plane of incidence, and the other at right angles

 differed by 90° before reflection, and, except at the polarizing angle for
 iron, this difference of phase would not be completely destroyed, so that

the resultant would generally be an elliptically polarized ray the direc
tion of whose major axis would make a small angle towards the right
with the plane of incidence ; and at the polarizing angle for iron this
ellipse would become a plane-polarized ray whose plane of polarization
was turned towards the right, which           I   understand to be the direction in
which Mr. Kerr observed it to be turned —although from some ambiguity
as to the meaning of right and left rotations in a ray, arising from not
specifying whether it is relative to the direction in which the ray is
going or in which it is observed,       I am not quite sure whether            I  under
stand  Mr. Kerr correctly. Also from the fact that there are exceptions*
to the rule that rotations are positive for diamagnetic and negative for
ferro-magnetic substances, neutral chromate of potash being diamagnetic,
yet producing a negative rotation,        I  should be rather inclined to deduce
the direction   of the  rotation   that  would     be produced, if iron were trans
parent, from Mr. Kerr's experiment.
   It would be quite easy to deduce the difference of the refractive in
dices of iron for the two circularly polarized rays if we knew the amount
by which the plane of polarization is turned ; but it would be necessary
to employ MacCullagh's or Cauchy's formulae for the intensities of the
reflected rays ; and these are so complicated that it is hardly worth while
going through the calculations, as the effect         Mr. Kerr has observed        seems
only barely observable.
    Similar effects must, of course, occur in the cases of diamagnetic sub
stances, organic solutions, and quartz ; but the amounts in these cases
would be entirely beyond the range of observation of our present instru
ments ; for in quartz, for instance, the difference of the refractive indices
of the two circularly polarized rays is only 0-00008.

           Observations   confirmatory of the foregoing Explanation.
   Since sending my explanation of Mr. Kerr's experiment                  I  have made
some experiments in confirmation          of  it.   The  instruments,     with   the ex
ception of the electro-magnet, which was kindly lent to me by Mr. Teates,
are the property of       Trinity College, Dublin, and were placed at my
disposal by Professor Leslie.
   The electro-magnet      I used is of the horseshoe pattern, with movable
soft iron armatures,    a  face  of one of these being well polished.                The
magnet was placed vertically, and the armatures were arranged on the
poles so that the polished face was vertical and a vertical edge of the
other armature parallel and very close to this face.                A folded piece of
paper was inserted at the top between the edge             and    the  face to prevent
their being drawn together when the magnet was set in action. Two
Nicol's prisms were so placed that a horizontal beam of light traversing

 one of theni was reflected down the other by the polished face from that
 part of its surface which was opposite the edge.
     A  beam    of sunlight was now transmitted through the apparatus and
 observed on emerging from the second Nicol.             The following results
 were thus obtained :— When the light was polarized by the first Nicol,
 either in or perpendicularly to the plane of incidence, and when it had
 been extinguished     by the analyzer, as soon as the electro-magnet was set
 in action     the light immediately reappeared.       On now slightly moving
 the analyzer the light could be partly extinguished ; but no motion of the
 analyzer could make the field as black as it had been before the magnetism
 was excited, thus conclusively proving that what was produced was an
 elliptically polarized ray, as  I  had anticipated.    When the light was re
 flected from a south pole the plane of polarization was rotated to the
 right of the observer, which is the direction of rotation assumed in my
 explanation.
    I  next covered a portion of the polished face with gold leaf, as Professor
 Barrett had suggested ; and now the light reflected from this diamagnetic
 substance was unaffected by the magnetism, as          I had also anticipated.
 I  exhibited all these effects to Mr. Stoney, who entirely confirmed my
 observations.
                         Received November 25, 1876.
    The angle of incidence in the experiments described above was about
 60°.     If the incidence were either perpendicular or grazing, the theory
 which     I have proposed would lead to the conclusion that the angle
between the major axis of elliptic polarization and the original plane of
polarization would vanish.       If, accordingly, the observation can be made
at a perpendicular incidence, and if the Nicol's prisms be so placed as to
extinguish the light before magnetizing the iron, then on exciting it light
ought to reappear, as it does at oblique incidences ; but the field should
not become darker on moving the analyzer.
    I  attribute great weight to the verification of my theory arising from
the fact that the polarization of the reflected ray is found by experiment
to be in general elliptic, and also from the fact that there is no appreciable
effect when gold, a diamagnetic substance and therefore feeble, is sub
stituted for iron.

when Mr. Kerr's paper was read before Section A of the British Associa

influence of magnetism.        It is a connexion of this kind which have I

II. " On     the Increase in Resistance to the Passage of an Electric
       Current produced on Wires by Stretching."               By HERBERT
       TOMLINSON,    B.A., Demonstrator of Natural Philosophy, King's
       College, London.        Communicated by Prof. W. G. ADAMS,
       F.R.S. Received November 14, 1876.
                                  (Abstract.)
   The object of this inquiry was
   (1) To determine the relation between increased resistance to the
passage of an electric current and stretching force.
   (2) To ascertain how much of the increased resistance in each case is
produced by mere increase of length and diminution of section of the
stretched wire.
   In  order to determine   the increase of resistance from stretching, the
wires were each divided into two parts, about 14 ft. in length ; one end
of   each  part was fastened to a stout hook firmly fixed into a block of
wood.     These two hooks were about 8 inches apart, and the block of
wood in which they were fixed was securely fastened across two uprights
placed resting against a wall of the room, so that the weights, which
 were attached to the other ends of the wires, might swing clear of the
table.    The two parts of the wire were joined at the top, about 2 inches
below each hook, by a small piece of copper wire, which was securely
soldered on to each part of the wire so as to connect them.           Towards
the lower extremities of the two parts, about 5 inches above the points
of attachment of the weights, two copper wires of small resistance were
soldered so as to connect the wires with a Wheats tone-bridge arrange
ment.     The increase of resistance was measured by means of a sliding
scale of platinum wire divided into millimetre divisions, each equal to
'00166    ohm.   As the object was to obtain the temporary, and not the
permanent, increase of resistance, which permanent increase was found
more or less with all the wires, weights slightly heavier than those in
tended to be used were first put on and then taken off. Afterwards the
wire was balanced as nearly as possible by German-silver wire without
the sliding scale, and then very exactly with the sliding scale, which was
connected with one of two resistance-coils of 100 ohms each, which formed
the other two sides of the bridge.    The weights used were then carefully
put on to the wires, and the increase of resistance measured by means
of the sliding scale ; the weights were next taken off again, and the
sliding scale used for balancing once more. If there was any slight
difference, as sometimes occurred, between the readings of the sliding
scale before the weights were put on and after they were taken off, the
mean of the two readings was taken.           In order to secure still greater
accuracy, as many as eight or ten trials were frequently made with each
particular weight, and the mean of all the trials taken. In this manner

4 pianoforte steel wires, 1 wire of commercial steel, 3 iron wires, and
4 brass wires were examined with several different weights.  The wires
taken were of various sections, and it was found that in each case the
increase of resistance was" exactly proportional to the stretching force,"
the stretching not being carried beyond the limit of elasticity of each
wire.    The resistance ofa cubic centimetre of each wire was then deter
mined, also  the increase  of resistance which a cubic centimetre of each
wire would experience when stretched by a force of 1 gramme in the
same direction as the passage of the current was calculated from the
observations made.              The former values varied from
        1574-8   x      10~8 to 1882-4       x   10~8    in the   case    of steel, from
        1200-8 X 10~8 to 1291-0              x   10~9    in the   case    of iron, and from
         6567 X 10"8 to              782-2   x   10~8    in the   case    of brass     ;
the latter values varied from
          2982      x 10" 17 to 3511 X 10~W in the                case    of steel, from
                            17
          2557 X 10"             to 2712     x 10-17 in the       case    of iron, and from
          1565      x   10~17    to 1843 x       10~17   in the   case    of brass,
the numbers in each case representing so many ohms.
   On dividing the latter values by the former, it was found that the in
crease per unit of resistance for a stretching force of 1 gramme on a
cubic centimetre of each wire was nearly the same for wires of the same
material, but differed with wires of different materials.  The mean in
crease per   unit of resistance was

                     and for the brass            „      2244-9   X   10-w,
the greatest departure from the mean value being
                         for the steel less than 2-7 per cent.,
                         for the iron about 3-0 per cent.,
                     and for the brass about 8-5 per cent.

wire would experience on being stretched with force of       gramme was

of   1 gramme on a centimetre of the material by the increase of length
produced by the stretching force, so as to obtain the increase per unit of
resistance when the wires are stretched 1 centimetre, a mean value of
3-525 was obtained for the steel wires,          3-951 for the iron wires, and
2-203 for the brass wires — thus showing             that, though the   increase
per unit of resistance for a given stretching force is greater in brass
than in iron or steel, the increase per unit of resistance for a given
lengthening of the wire is much greater both in iron and steel than in
brass.
    The torsional rigidity of the wires was next ascertained by the method
of vibrations, several trials being made with different lengths of each
wire ; the results for different lengths of the same wire agreed very
closely indeed.
    From the values of torsional rigidity and the increase of length, the
diminution of section was calculated for a cubic centimetre of each wire
 when    stretched with a force of        1 gramme, assuming the wire to be
isotropic.     Next  the  increase  of resistance which would result from mere
lengthening of each wire and diminution of section was determined, and
 it was ascertained that, on subtracting this latter value from the total
 observed increase of resistance, there was a considerable residue in
the case of the steel and iron wire, also a residue not so great in the
 brass.    This residual increase of resistance probably arises from increased
 space in the line of flow of the current between the particles of the wire
produced by the stretching force.
    The conclusions to be drawn from the experiments are :—
    1. That the temporary increase per cent, of resistance of a wire when
stretched    in the  same direction     as the line of flow of the current is
exactly proportional     to  the stretching force.
    2. That the increase per cent, of resistance, when a cube of each
material is stretched by the same weight, is greater in iron than in steel
wire, and greater in brass than in iron ; also that the increase is nearly
the same for different specimens of the same material.
    3. That the increase per cent., when a cube of each material is
stretched to the same extent, is mueh greater in iron and steel than in
brass.
    4. That there is a residual increase in each case over and above that
which would follow from mere increase of length and diminution of
section ; that this residual increase is much greater in iron and steel
than in brass, and greater in iron than in steel.

         Temperature on the Origin and Growth of Microphytes."
         By WM. ROBERTS, M.D.               Communicated by Prof. TYNDALL,
         F.R.S.     Received December 18, 1876.
     In  a recent communication       to the Eoyal Society, Dr. Bastian * brought
  forward some experiments to show that while an acid urine usually
 remains barren after being boiled a few minutes, the same urine becomes
  fertile when similarly treated if previously neutralized or rendered
  alkaline by liquor potassae, especially if it be afterwards maintained at a
  temperature of 115° F. or 122° F. In this respect urine only conforms
  to the general rule observed by myself and formulated in my previous
  communication to the Society t —that " slightly alkaline liquids were
 always more difficult to sterilize (by heat) than slightly acid liquids."
     This difference came out strongest in my own experiments in the case
 of hay-infusion — the acid infusion invariably remaining barren after a
  few minutes boiling, and the neutralized infusion invariably becoming
  fertile after a similar boiling.        Accordingly      I  utilized hay-infusion to
 determine the cause of the difference in question.                  It could evidently
 only be due to one of two things            —  either (1) the change of reaction
 enabled germs preexisting in the infusion to survive the ebullition, or
  (2) the addition of the alkali exercised a positive influence in exciting a
 de novo generation of organisms.            To decide which of these two inter
 pretations was the true one, an experiment was contrived in which the
 liq. potassae could be added to the infusion not before, but after it had
 been boiled, and thereby rendered permanently sterile.                 When added in
             I
 this way, found that liquor potassae had not any power to excite germina
 tion.    The infusions invariably remained barren when the alkali was
 added to them after they had been sterilized.                  I  therefore concluded
 that the effect of the change of reaction consisted simply in enabling
 preexisting germs to survive a brief ebullition. Dr. Bastian, in repeat
 ing this experiment in the case of urine, arrived at an opposite con
 clusion : he found that whether the alkali was added before or after
 ebullition he obtained the same result — the urine in both cases became
 fertile ; and he concluded that the alkali had a positive power of pro
 moting the origin of organisms in the urine.
     This experiment, if properly performed, is obviously a crucial one,
 and it is recognized as such by Dr. Bastian.                 But two conditions are
 essential to the validity of the experiment.               In the first place, it must
 be ascertained beyond doubt that the boiled acid fluid has been really
deprived of its germs — in other words, that the ebullition has been
 sufficiently prolonged to render it permanently barren; and secondly,

  1876.]                Liquor Potassa       fyc. on   Microphytes.                     455
  that in adding the liquor potassaa due care is taken that no new germs are
 introduced at the same time. In repeating my experiment, Dr. Bastiau
  appears to have departed from my procedure in two points, and he has
  thus possibly laid himself open to the two sources of fallacy just
  mentioned. In my own experiments, the acid infusion, after it had been
  boiled, was set aside in a warm place for a fortnight in order to test its
  sterility ; and the liquor potasse was not added to it until the lapse of
  time had satisfied me that         it had been rendered permanently barren.            In
  Dr. Bastian's experiments the liquor potasse was added                   as soon as the
 vessels had cooled, so that he had no certainty that their contents would
  not have germinated without the addition of the alkali *. In the second
  place, instead of heating the tubes containing the liquor potassaa (as had          I
 done) to 250° F., and thus ensuring the destruction of all germs contained
 in the air imprisoned therein with the alkali, he contented himself with
 subjecting them for an inconsiderable period to the heat of boiling water.
     Seeing these two possible sources of fallacy,          I determined to repeat Dr.
 Bastian's     experiments        with urine, but taking care to avoid these
 defects.     I proceeded     as  follows : —
     A flask with a longish neck was charged with an ounce of normal acid
 urine. The due quantity of liquor potassae requisite to exactly neutralize
 this (as ascertained by previous trials) was enclosed in a sealed glass
 tube drawn to a capillary portion at one end.              The tube was then heated
 in oil up to 280° F., and maintained at that temperature for fifteen
minutes.       The tube was then introduced into the body of the flask. The
neck of the flask was next drawn to a narrow orifice ; then the urine
was boiled for five minutes, and the orifice sealed in ebullition. Ten
such flasks were charged and treated in the same manner.                       They were
then set aside in a warm place (from 70° F. to 80° F.) for a fortnight.
At the end of this time the contents of the flasks were found perfectly
transparent ; the urine was therefore assumed to be permanently steri
lized.     The liquor potassee was then liberated by shaking the tubes
against the sides of the flasks, and thus breaking their capillary points.
The previously acid and barren urine was thus neutralized.                      The flasks
were then placed in an incubator, and maintained at a constant tempera
ture of 115° F. At the end of two days it was found that the urine in
each flask had deposited a sediment of earthy phosphates ; but the super
natant liquid was perfectly transparent.              The flasks were again placed
in the incubator, and maintained at a constant temperature of 122° F.
for three days. At the end of this period they were withdrawn and
opened for examination.            Not one of them showed the slightest evidence
of living organisms ; the supernatant liquid was perfectly transparent,
and no Microphytes could be detected under the microscope.                       The pre-
    * It is not sufficient to rely in such a case on a control flask or retort. Each flask
or retort should have its own individual sterility tested, because it is practically im
possible to apply the heat exactly in the same degree in any two cases.

456       Influence  of Liquor   Potasses $c. on Microphytes.         [Dec. 21,
cipital • < phosphate in some of the flasks presented a granular appearance,
which might, by the unwary, be mistaken for Micrococei ; but any such
illusion was at once dissipated by adding a drop of hydrochloric acid,
which    instantly dissolved the phosphate and restored the perfect trans
parency of the urine.       Thia acid has no effect on the turbidity caused
by Microphytes.
    These experiments therefore negative the conclusion           that liquor
potassae, or a temperature of 115° F. to 122° F., or both conditions
combined, have the power of exciting the generation of organisms in
sterilized urine.
    The effect of elevated temperature was also tested in another way.
I  had by me twenty-nine preparations of fermentible liquids which had
remained over from my previous experiments in 1873-74.             These con
sisted of
                  15 alkalized  hay-infusions,
                   5 pieces of boiled egg-albumen in water,
                   1 pieces of turnip in water,
                   2 diluted ascitic fluid,
                   1  blood with water,
                   1  albuminous urine,
                   4 pieces of meat or fish in water.
    These had all been sterilized by the heat of boiling water two or three
years ago, and were contained in large bulbs with long necks.            Ten of
the hay-infusions were hermetically sealed ; the rest were all open to the
air, under the protection of a plug of cotton-wool.       All possessed per
fectly transparent supernatant liquids, and showed no signs of containing
organisms, nor of having undergone any fermentivo or putrefactive
changes.
    These twenty-nine preparations        were introduced    into    the  incu
bator, and maintained at a constant temperature of 115°           F. for two
days, and then at a temperature of 122° F. for three           days.     At the
end of this period not one of them showed any signs               of fertility.
The supernatant liquid in each bulb was quite transparent, and some
of them which were opened for microscopic examination showed no
traces of living organisms.
    I  can, however, fully confirm the statement of Dr. Bastian, that
Bacteria, or certain kinds of them, grow and multiply freely in (un-
sterilized) urine, both acid and neutralized, when exposed to a tempe
rature of 115°   F. to 122° F.

Elevated Temperature on the Origin and Growth of Microphytes," which,
at Dr. Eoberta's request,        I
                             have had the pleasure of presenting to the

Boyal Society, causes me to say earlier than should otherwise have done
that the subject which has occupied Dr. Eoberta's attention has also occu
pied mine, and that my results are identical with his.
    In acme of the experiments the procedure described by Dr. Eoberts
was accurately pursued, save in one particular which has reference to
temperature.    Small tubes with their ends finely drawn out were charged
with a definite amount of caustic potash, and subjected for a quarter of
an hour to a temperature of 220° Fahr. They were then introduced
into flasks containing measured quantities of urine.      The urine being
boiled for five minutes, the flasks were hermetically sealed during ebul
lition. They were subsequently permitted to remain in a warm place
sufficiently long to prove that the urine had been perfectly sterilized by
the boiling.   The flasks were then rudely shaken, so as to break the
capillary ends of the potash-tubes and permit the liquor potassae to
mingle with the acid liquid.      The urine thus neutralized was subse
quently exposed to a constant temperature of 122° Fahr., which is pro
nounced by Dr. Bastian to be specially potent as regards the generation
of organisms.
      I                                  ; for ten flasks, prepared as
            have not found this to be the case
above described towards the end of last September, remained perfectly
sterile for more than two months.             I
                                       have no doubt that they would
have remained so        indefinitely.
         retorts, moreover, similar to those employed by Dr. Bastian,
      Three
and provided with potash-tubes, had fresh urine boiled in them on the
29th of September, the retorts being            during ebullition. Several
                                               sealed
days subsequently, the potash-tubes were broken and the urine neutralized.
Subjected for more than two months to a temperature of 122° Fahr.
they failed to show any signs of life.
   These results are quite in accordance with those obtained by Dr.
Roberts. His potash-tubes, however, were exposed to a temperature of
280° Fahr., while mine were subjected to a temperature of 220° only.
   With regard to the raising of the potash to a temperature higher than
that of boiling water, M. Pasteur is in advance both of Dr. Roberts and
myself. In a communication to the French Academy, on the 17th of
last July, M. Pasteur showed that when due care is taken to add nothing
but potash (heated to redness if solid, or to 110° C. if liquid) to sterilized
nrine, no life is ever developed as a consequence of the alkalization*.
  * That alkaline liquids are more difficult to sterilize than acid    ones was announced

   M. Pasteur has quite recently favoured me with sketches of the simple
but effectual apparatus by means of which he has tested the conclusions
of Dr. Bastian.     Since his return from his vacation at Arbois, he has
carefully gone over this ground        with results, he reports to    me, not
favourable to Dr. Bastian's views.
   I may add that I    have by no means confined myself to the thirteen
samples of urine     here referred to. The experiments have already ex
tended to one hundred and five instances, not one of which shows the
least countenance to the doctrine of spontaneous generation.
   It gives me pleasure to refer to the skill and fidelity with which here,
as in other cases, Mr. Cottrell has carried out my directions.

  was named one of the Physicians Extraordinary to Her Majesty, and in
 the following year he was elected a Fellow of the Eoyal Society. In 1854
 he was requested by the President of the General Board of Health to
 become one of the Medical Council ; and it was at this period that he
 devoted a large portion of his time to education and public works.
    As the inventor of the " Arnott Stove," the " Arnott Ventilator,"
 and the Water-bed, it is not likely that his name will soon be forgotten ;
but it deserves to be recorded in his honour that he refused to patent
any of his inventions. His great object through life was to benefit
 others, and not to obtain pecuniary profit. Sir Arthur Helps, in one of
 his later works, says truly of Dr. Arnott, " His whole life was given to
 the service of his fellow men.        A truer reformer in the best sense of the
 word never existed." One great secret of Dr. Arnott's success as a writer
 on natural philosophy was, that from his earliest days he was an acute
observer of all that went on around him.          Nothing bearing upon physics
escaped his notice.         In addition to this faculty of observation he pos
sessed happy powers of description.         The reader was not only instructed,
but made to feel a deep interest in the subject. Instruction was thus
rendered a pleasing recreation.         His earnest wish was to make the path
of learning easy to all ; and the reception of his ' Elements of Physics,'
the first edition of which appeared in 1827, is a proof of his success in
this respect. T^here are few educated men of the past generation who
will not remember the interest with which they read the first volume
of this excellent work ; and it is not too much to say that the learned
and the unlearned,         the student  and the philosopher,  have benefited by
its perusal.    This work did more for the encouragement of the study of
Natural Philosophy than all the works on the subject which had preceded
it. Within five years of its publication five large editions were called
for, and, although not then complete, it was reprinted in America and
translated into several foreign languages.        In November 1829 appeared
the first part of the second volume.          The work underwent six editions
during   the life  of  the  author, and a posthumous seventh edition has lately
appeared.
   In 1861 he published his ' Survey of Human Progress,' and this was
followed by various monographs on educational subjects.
   In 1856 Dr. Arnott married the widow of one of his oldest friends,
Mr. Knight.       This lady was the daughter of James Hunt Holley, Esq., of
Bleckling, in Norfolk. She was an accomplished woman, and the match
was in every way suitable.          She survived her husband upwards of two
years.    She had the same philanthropic and educational views, and lived
to carry out his intentions in reference to the endowment of the Scotch
Universities. The desire of both was to encourage the study of Natural
Philosophy.      In   1869   Dr. Arnott granted to the University of London
.£2000, and to each          of the four Universities of Scotland (Aberdeen,
 Edinburgh, Glasgow, and St. Andrews) .£1000, while, subsequently to his
   VOL. xxv.                                                         d

                                       XV111
death,  Mrs. Arnott granted an additional sum of .£4000 to           be divided
among these Universities.        Thus within the period of seven years Dr.
and Mrs. Arnott had contributed the sum of ten thousand pounds for
the promotion of scientific knowledge.
   Dr. Arnott was a man of genial disposition, and had a large circle of
friends.     He took a delight in the society of these friends and in the
progress    of scientific research, until the infirmities of age compelled him
in a great measure to withdraw from social intercourse.
    He died in the 86th year of his age, and up to the last year of his life his
mind was still actively occupied in devising and maturing new projects or
inventions.      Among these may be mentioned a chair-bed for the pre
vention of sea-sickness and a floating       breakwater.     It was the delight
 of his life to devise means of ameliorating     suffering and adding to human
comfort.
    Dr. Arnott died in the Eoman Catholic faith, and by his own desire
his body was buried in the Dean Cemetery, at Edinburgh, in the grave
in which the remains of his mother and other members of his family are
deposited.      An obelisk with an appropriate inscription in commemoration
 of himself and them has been erected over the grave.
    Akdebs Jonas Angstrom was born on the 13th of August, 1814, at
the works of Logdo, in Medelpad (one of the most northerly provinces of
Sweden), where his father was chaplain.             Although the latter never
obtained any advancement in his profession beyond the position of Corn-
minister, he managed to make his scanty income suffice for the educational
expenses of his three sons at the secondary school and at the gymnasium
of Hernosand.        Of these sons, the eldest Johan, now a medical man at
 Ornskiildsvik, is well known for his botanical researches, and the youngest,
 Carl Arendt, is Professor of Practical Mechanics at the Polytechnic School
 of Stockholm.      The second son, Anders Jonas, after studying at the
 University    of Upsala, paid special attention to physics and mathematics,
 but was obliged from time to time to interrupt his studies in order to give
 private lessons.
    In 1839 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, and shortly after
 wards was appointed Professeur agregd of Physical Science at the Uni
 versity of Upsala, the celebrated Eudberg at that time holding the appoint
 ment of Professor of Physical Science.
     a
    Angstrom had a decided predilection for physics, but as, after the death
 of Eudberg, Adolphe Svanberg was, in 1841, appointed to the professor
 ship of Physics, ho saw no prospect of advancement for himself in that
 department     at Upsala.      He therefore    accepted the appointment      of
 Assistant Professor of Astronomy. In order to gain practice in making
 astronomical observations, he passed the year 1842 at the Observatory of
 Stockholm ; but after his return to Upsala he occupied himself chiefly with
 the theoretical branches of the science, because at that time it was almost

                                      SIX
impossible, owing to the want of a suitable observatory in Upsala, to make
really accurate observations there.
    Angstrom's published works on astronomy are not numerous.            The
 most important among them are that entitled ' Ad theoriam Cometarum
               '
additamenta      (which he published as an evidence of his competency for
the post of Assistant Professor), and another, first published, in 1862, in
the ' Transactions ' of the Society of Sciences of Upsala.
    This latter memoir illustrates Angstrom's power of arriving at his end
by a more direct process, but which others could only attain by long cal
culation. Both papers show considerable originality of thought. Thus,
for instance, he never approved of the explanation generally adopted of
the retardation of Encke's comet by the resistance of the cosmic ether ; but
his opinion was that it depended on the perturbations of the little planets
situated between Mars and Jupiter. There is a note of his on this subject
in the ' Comptes Eendus ' of the Academy of Sciences of Stockholm for
the year 1854. He considered that, as a rule, modern astronomers collect
too many observations, gaining from them very few new results in com
parison to the number and to the immense amount of labour expended.
   The observations on the phenomena of magnetism set on foot by Gauss
were originally considered as belonging to the domain of astronomy, an
opinion still held by some persons. Gustave 8vanberg had, as early as
1836, established at Upsala magnetometers which he had procured from
Gottingen. Angstrom became much interested in the observations made
with the aid of these instruments after his engagement at the Observatory ;
and in the course of a tour abroad, which he made in 1843, he visited the
Observatory of Bogenhausen, near Munich, in order to study the new
magnetic apparatus which Lament had constructed.         It was more parti
cularly the apparatus to be employed in travelling which attracted Ang
strom's attention.    He obtained at Munich some of these instruments,
and used them assiduously during the remainder of his journey, making
magnetic observations at Gottingen, Paris, Brussels, and other places.
Between the years 1850 and 1870 he made a large number of obser
vations on magnetic intensity and inclination in different parts of Sweden,
but they were never published.
   Angstrom was commissioned by the Academy of Sciences of Stock
holm to work out the magnetic observations which had been made be
tween the years 1851 and 1853, during the voyage round the world of
the Swedish frigate ' Eugenie.'     The observer, M. Johannson, had died
shortly after the return of that expedition, and Angstrom was considered
to be the person most competent for calculating out these observations,
because the English instruments employed by M. Johannson were very
 similar to those which Angstrom was then using for his own obser
 vations.
    The determinations     of constants   were executed between the years
                                                               d2

1854-56,    partly according to methods devised by Angstrom.           But  the
fact   that  the observer    had sometimes     neglected to determine some
corrections which had to be applied to the observations, gave rise to
scruples in the mind of the calculator, in consequence of which the
work advanced so slowly that it was not finished and published until a
short time before his death in 1874.
   The report of these labours of Angstrom forms part of the work pub
lished by the Academy of Sciences of Stockholm, ' A Voyage Bound the
                                     '
World in the frigate ' Eugenie.'
   In the year 1852 the King of Sweden granted new statutes to the Uni
versities of the kingdom.     Hitherto the duties of the assistant professors
had not been clearly defined    ;  but by these new statutes they were obliged
to give regular public instruction.      During the next few years Angstrom
held the professorship of analytical mechanics.         Subsequently when, in
consequence of enfeebled health, Professor Adolph 8vanberg needed a
temporary holiday, Angstrom from time to time performed the duties of
the Professor of Physics ; and on the death of Adolph Svanberg he was
appointed Professor of Physics at Upsala, and was at last free to devote
all his energies to his favourite studies.
   Angstrom's most important papers are those on optics and on the
theory of heat. His first treatise, published on the occasion of his being
made Doctor of Philosophy, was on conic refraction, and that which he
published when candidate for the office of Professeur agrege bore the title
' De theoria lucis                                Both treatises show his great
                      calorisque dissertatio.'
erudition in these subjects. He had an extraordinary fertility of ideas
and power of coordination.        These intellectual qualities are conspicuous
in his suggestive dissertation, ' Essay on a Mathematical Theory of Heat.'
This paper was, however, never completed; and Angstrom considered that
it required to   be completely recast.
   Closely connected with this last treatise was the note he published in
1842, on the occasion of the Meeting of the Scandinavian Naturalists at
Stockholm, and which appeared in PoggendorfFs             '
                                                            Annalen,' vol. viii.,
" Einige Beobachtungen in Betreff der Wiirme undderen Theorie,"         as well
as his researches on the transmission      of the heat of one metal to another
published,    in 1860, in the Transactions of the Society of Sciences at
Upsala.
    To the theory of heat he contributed another important memoir, ' On
the Temperature of the Earth at different depths,' for which he had cal
culated and worked out the observations on the temperature of the
Earth made by Eudbergat Upsala between the years 1837 and 1846.
   This work, and the ideas gained from his own previous experiments,
doubtless formed the basis of the new method of determining the con-
ducting-power of bodies for heat which he applied to solids in 1861,
and which he extended to fluids in 1862.           This method has attracted

                                       XXI
 much attention from physicists, from the fact that the determination of
the conducting-power is made independently of their radiating-power.
    Angstrom's first treatise of any length on optics was that ' On Eecti-
linear Polarization and on the Double Eefraction of Crystals with Three
 Oblique Axes,' by which he has contributed to the explanation of the
optical properties of those crystals.     With this Memoir is connected his
note ' On the Molecular Constants of Monoclinic Crystals.'            He also
wrote on the question of the principal properties of the plane of polari
 zation, and made experiments on the capacity of absorption of chloro-
phyl.
    Angstrom's important work, Optical Eesearches,' was presented to
                                     '
 the Academy of Sciences of Stockholm in 1853.            In this work he has
 shown that the spectrum of the electric spark is formed by the super
position of two spectra — one of them due to the metallic pole, the other
to the medium through which the spark passes.          Following up the obser
vations    made   by  Wheatstone   and  Masson,   he found  that the spectrum
 obtained from an alloy of two metals chemically combined with one
another contains the spectrum of each of the two metals.
    In  the same memoir, Angstrom propounds the theory that the only
luminous rays which a vapour or gas can absorb are those which it emits
when highly incandescent. It was apropos of this theory that Sir Edward
 Sabine, in his discourse to the Eoyal Society on the occasion of the election
of M. Angstrom      as a Foreign Member, remarked that the memoir contains
the   fundamental     principles of all subsequent progress in spectrum-
analysis.
   The continuation      of the spectrum  researches, published   at short in
tervals by Angstrom between the years 1860 and 1870, are well known to
physicists.     These are :— in 1861, a memoir on the lines of the solar
spectrum    ; in 1863,  a new determination   of the lengths of the luminous
waves ; and in 1865, a memoir, published jointly by Angstrom and
Thalen, on the violet part of the solar spectrum, which paved the way for
the great work which Angstrom published in 1868, ' Eesearches on the
Solar Spectrum,' containing the determinations, founded on exact mea
surements, of the length of waves for the different lines of Fraunhofer.
His intention was also to treat in this manner the question of the double
spectra of bodies ; but death interrupted his labours, leaving him only
time to discuss, in the ' Comptes Eendus' of the French Academy of
Sciences, some ideas put forth by M. Wiillner.
   Another work of the same sort, on the Spectra of the Metalloids, had
been begun by Angstrom some years previously, and was partly printed
before his death. Its publication was completed in 1875 by Thalen, in
the Transactions of the Society of Sciences of Upsala. A note of his
on the Spectrum of the Aurora Borealis, which he was the first to examine,

                                     XX11
is contained in the collection   of Memoirs published on the occasion of
Poggendorff Jubilee
               s         in 1874.
    It is much to be regretted that Angstrom, in consequence of his great
clearness of mind and facility in business matters, was, during his last
years, so much occupied with the administration of the University and
with other duties totally unconnected with his scientific work. He was
Hector of the University of Upsala in 1870 and 1871, President of the
 Council of Economic Administration of the University from the year
 1869 until his death, Secretary of the Society of Science of Upsala from
1867 also until his death, and a Member of the Administrative Council of
the city of Upsala from 1868 to 1873.
    Angstrom did not for many years receive much recognition of his
 scientific work; but with time distinctions accumulated.   In 1850 he was
elected a Member of the Eoyal Academy of Science of Stockholm, in
 1851 of the Eoyal Society of Science of Upsala, of the Eoyal Physiogra-
phieal Society of Lund in 1866, of the Societe des Sciences Naturelles
do Cherbourg in 1867, of the Eoyal Academy of Science of Berlin also
in 1867, Foreign Member of the Eoyal Society in 1870, of the Eoyal
Society of Science in Copenhagen in 1873, and Corresponding Member
of the French Institute in 1873.
    Before becoming a Member of the Upsala Society of Science he received
from that learned body pecuniary remuneration for researches communi
cated to them.    Several prizes were awarded to him by the Academy of
Science of Stockholm, and in 1870 the Eoyal Society conferred on him
the Eumford Medal.
    Angstrom regularly attended all the meetings of the Scandinavian
naturalists. He visited England and France in 1843-44, in 1859, 1866,
and 1867.     He was a Knight of the Order of the Polar Star, made Com
mander of the Vasa of the first class in 1873, and Commander of the
Italian Order of the Crown. Ho had a vigorous constitution, and it
was only during the last few years of his life that he often complained
of violent headache. On the 21st of June, 1874, l1e died of pachymen-
ingitis, after an illness of three weeks, leaving a widow, one son, and one
daughter.
           Lou1s RODOLPII AOASSIZ was born on the 28th of May, 1807, at
the village of Motier in the Canton of Freyburg in Switzerland. His father
was pastor of Motier, and his ancestors had followed the same profession
for six generations. At 10 years of age Jean Louis Eodolph was sent to
the Academy of B'tel, whore he gave evidence of unusual ability. He early
showed a strong taste for Natural History, and whilst at Biel began to
collect insects; and later on he pursued a systematic study of the plants
in the neighbourhood of Orbe near the Jura, to which place his father had
moved.

                                      xxn1
     He studied Classics at the Lausanne Academy, and in his 18th year
 entered on the study of Medicine. He spent two years at Zurich, and
 thence went to Heidelberg, where he studied Anatomy under Tiedemann,
 Botany and Zoology under Bischoff and Leuckart. He went in the follow
 ing year to the University of Munich, where there were at that time many
 distinguished professors, among them Oken.
     At Munich his inclination for the study of Embryology was fostered
 by his residence in the house of Dollinger. Even at this early period of
 his career Agassiz showed the strong leaning towards a combination of
 Natural History and Metaphysics which was his characteristic through
 life ; and whilst studying medicine with a view of making it his profession,
 he still found time to attend Schelling's course of Mental Philosophy for
 four consecutive years.
     Of his teachers at Munich he has since said, — " Our professors were
 themselves original investigators, daily contributing to the sum of human
 knowledge.     They were not only our teachers, but our friends. The best
 spirit prevailed among professors and students.        We were often com
 panions   of their walks, often present  at their discussions ; and when we
 met for conversation or to give lectures among ourselves, as we constantly
 did, our professors were often among our listeners, cheering and
 stimulating us in all our efforts after independent research. My room
 was our meeting-place, bed-room, study, museum, library, lecture-room,
fencing-room,     all in one: students used to call it 'The Little Aca
demy."'
    At the age of 21 his reputation at the University of Munich was such
that Martius entrusted to him the task of describing the fishes collected
in Brazil by Spix. This work was published in 1829, under the title
" Selecta genera et species Piscium, quos in itinere per Brasiliam peracto
 collegit et pingendos curavit Dr. J. B. de Spix : digessit, descripsit et
observationibus illustravit Dr. L. Agassiz."
    Agassiz had already taken the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, and
during the following year he passed examinations in Medicine and
Surgery.
    His work for Martius had led him to make a special study of Ichthyology;
and before long he extended his researches from living species to fossil,
and entered on that vast field which was to yield him so rich a harvest.
    On leaving Munich he resided for a time in Paris, where he acquired
the friendship of Cuvier and improved his acquaintance with Humboldt,
who    became  from that time his friend and counsellor for life.
    In  1832 he began his career as a teacher.     He applied to    M. Louis
Coulon to obtain for him a position as   Professor of Natural History in the
Gymnasium of Neufchiitel.        Xo professorship of the kind then existed
there ; but M. Coulon set to work and raised money enough to guarantee
a salary of 2000 francs for three years, and Agassiz was installed as the
Professor.      There being neither Museum nor Lecture-room, Agassiz

                                      XXIV
was forced to give his lectures in the Town Hall ; but in spite of defective
appliances he soon raised his subject to the first rank among those taught
in the Gymnasium.         He sent for all the specimens he had collected in
Germany,     constantly added new ones, and by-and-by had a large collection
for use. He worked hard at original investigations, constantly employing
two artists, Weber and Dinkel, and a painter, Jacques Burkhardt, an old
fellow-student at Munich, who became his life-long friend and companion.
Stahl, afterwards known as the best modeller at the Jardin des Plantes,
•was then employed at Neufch&tel ; Hercule Nicolet was persuaded to set
up there a large lithographic establishment, where were published the last
                '                                  '
 plates of the Poissons Possiles,' those of the Poissons d'eau douce,' of
 the embryology of Coregonus, of the works on the Glaciers, and of the
 Echinoderms.
    In  1832, the Societe des Sciences Naturelles a Neufch&tel, of which the
 " Little Academy " at Munich may        be said to have been the germ, was
 founded.     The first meeting was held in December, when Louis Coulon
was chosen as President and Agassiz as Secretary of the Natural-History
 Section.
    Agassiz held his professorship at Neufchatel from 1832 until 1846, and
 during that period got through an enormous amount of work. His work
 for Martins had led him into palaeontology ; and the result of his exten
 sive study of fossil fishes was the discovery that the scales of fishes
 correspond by four kinds of structure to four large natural divisions,
 which he called Ganoids, Placoids, Cycloids, and Ctenoids.         With this
 basis and    with  the aid  of his intimate knowledge of the skeleton he
 was enabled to tabulate all the known fossil species to the number
 of 10(10, and these results he published as 'Eeeherches sur les Poissons
 Fossiles,' in 5 vols., with about 400 excellent plates. This work occupied
 ten years in going through the press. It contains the germs of many of
 the theories he subsequently advocated so zealously in his public lectures.
 In the preface is found the first notice of his theory of the correspond
 ence between geological succession and embryological      development.
    The preparation     of this book involved an immense amount of work.
 He had to travel with an artist in order to examine and copy the speci
 mens which could not be sent to Neufchatel. The expense also was so
 far beyond his means, that he incurred heavy debts which hampered him
 for many years. They were not discharged until he had spent many
 years in the United States, travelling from place to place, giving public
 lectures on Natural History. At last, finding that this constant travelling
 interfered too much with his duties at Harvard, he established at Cam
 bridge a school for young ladies, he himself teaching botany, physiology,
 and geology.     This proved eminently successful, and relieved him from
all his embarrassments.
    After the publication of his work on ' Poissons Fossiles ' he came to Eng
land to study the fossils of this country, and in 1844 published an

                                       XXV
 elaborate account of those discovered     in the Old Eed Sandstone of the
 Devonian system.
    In  the midst of all this heavy work he entered on other investigations.
 He   bad already turned his attention to the vast ice-masses which furrow
 the sides of the Swiss mountains, and in 1834 made a report on the ob
 servations of Hugi concerning the structure of glaciers.       In 1837 he had
 as President to give the opening discourse to the members of the Helvetic
 Society of Natural History assembled at Neufchatel.           It  was the cele
 brated " Discours sur 1'ancienne Extension des Glaciers."    In this discourse
 he carried to their logical conclusion the facts already observed by Venetz
 and Charpentier, that boulders are transported and rocks scratched and
 polished by glacial action ; and inasmuch as Switzerland is strewn with
 these    boulders,   and  exhibits in   many   places   the  scratchings    and
 polishing of rock surfaces, he boldly asserted that the whole of
 Switzerland and also the northern parts of Europe had been covered
 in former ages by a sheet of ice of vast thickness.          This heresy fell
 like a thunderbolt on the Assembly.         Leopold von Buch, the greatest
 geologist of that time, lost all control over himself, and severely de
 nounced the new theory.          When shown the scratched surfaces near
 Neufchatel, he replied that the slides of the schoolboys had made them ;
 and he retired at last exclaiming, " O Sancte de Saussure, ora pro nobis."
 This violent opposition only spurred Agassiz to fresh exertions ; and for
 eight successive seasons he made a series of explorations in the neighbour
 hood of Mont Blanc and in the Bernese Oberland.           With the determina
 tion of ascertaining the intimate structure and the movements of ice
 formations, he established himself in the summer of 1840 on the Median
 Moraine of the Aar Glacier, and lodged his party, consisting of Desor,
 Vogt, Burkhardt, and Celestin Nicolet, under a large block of gneiss.
 This comfortless abode, which was invaded by frost at night and by
                                                            "
 trickling water in the daytime, was facetiously called I/hotel des Neuf-
 chatelais."   In 1842 a hut was built on the bank which overhangs the left
 side of the glacier, and this served as a shelter during the remainder of
 their visits.
    In 1840 and 1841 Agassiz published in French and German his ' Etudes
 sur les Glaciers,' accompanied by fine plates. His ' Systeme Glaciaire,'
with its maps and illustrations, did not appear until 1847.
    In the midst of these geological and palaeontological studies Agassiz
found time for a series of careful experiments in moulding.         In 1839 his
                    " Sur les Moules  de Mollusques    vivans et  fossiles."  In
paper appeared,
this paper he showed that the soft parts of Mollusca impress their form
on the interior of the shell, which form can be reproduced by a cast whose
inequalities will represent those of the original animal ; so that the casts
of mollusks found in great numbers in certain formations could no longer
be considered worthless.       He first made interior casts of living shells,
studied them side by side with the animals, and applied the knowledge of

                                            XXT1
    the animals thus obtained to the fossil casts.           This essay was followed
             '
    by  his    £tudes critiques   sur les  Mollusques   fossiles.'
       At   about the same period his attention was attracted to the study of
    the Eadiata and of Embryology. Under his direction experiments were
    conducted through several seasons on artificially fecundated eggs of the
   Swiss     White-Fish, Coregonus palcea, by Karl Vogt ; and in 1842 the
                                                     '
    account was published as a part of the Poissons d'eau douce.'                 It is
   worth noting that the Government of Neufchatel in that same year issued
   directions to fishermen for the impregnation of fish eggs.
       Agassiz had turned his attention to Echinoderms almost as early as to
.  Fishes. In 1834 he had published a paper, " Ueber die iiussere Organisa
   tion der Echinodermen,"       in the 'Isis;' and in 1839 he published an admi
   rable anatomical essay     on  Astrophyton. He prosecuted these investigations
   with extraordinary zeal, and was aided by Desor. Between the years 1838
                              "
   and 1842 appeared his Monographies d'Echinodermes vivans et fossiles."
   From the beginning of his studies he felt the need of having a systematic
   record of what specialists in palaeontology and zoology were doing.             He
   commenced an index, arranged alphabetically and zoologically, of all the
  generic names introduced into science from the time of Linnaeus ; this was
   accompanied by the proper bibliographical references, and formed the com
   mencement of the reform in zoological nomenclature, which was becoming
  entirely unmanageable.          The work was revised and enlarged by 22 of his
  colleagues, each of whom took a group.            The whole was completed in
  1846, under the name of         " Nomenclator Zoologicus."       The bibliographical
  part was subsequently published by the Eay Society ; it was edited by
  the late Mr. Strickland.
      In 1845, on the suggestion of Lyell, Agassiz had been invited by Mr.
  John A. Lowell to come to Boston and deliver lectures before the Lowell
  Institute. About the same time, the King of Prussia had been persuaded
  by Humboldt to present him with a sum of money in aid of a Scientific
  Mission to America. Agassiz was thus induced to cross the Atlantic
  Ocean in 1846; and when in 1847 Mr. Abbot Lawrence offered to found
  for him a professorship of Zoology and Geology in the Scientific School
  at Harvard College, he obtained his release from his engagements in
  Europe and accepted the position.
      In 1 848 he explored Lake Superior, and his account of the observations
                                    J
  made there was edited by Mr. . Elliot Cabot. At the request of Prof. Bache,
  of the Coast Survey, he passed the winter of 1850 among the Florida
  Eeefs, where he determined the law of growth by which that peninsula
 has gradually extended southwards by the successive formation of reefs,
 keys, and mudflats.
     In 1852 he was appointed Professor of Comparative Anatomy at the
 Medical College of Charleston.           This appointment did not interfere with
his duties at Cambridge, his lectures at Charleston being delivered during
the winter vacations of Harvard College.               He remained there for only

                                     XXV11
two terms, when he was compelled by the state of his health to give up
the appointment.
   In 1853 he published a paper on the newly discovered viviparous fishea
of California, and also began to work up the vast amount of materials
which he had collected in America.         The publications of the American
Academy of Boston, of the Boston Society of Natural History, and of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science contain a large
number of papers on the Natural History of the United States.        He was
                                                                   '
also for many years an active contributor to the pages of the American
Journal of Arts and Sciences.'         He sketched out a series of essays,
which were to be entitled    " Contributions to the Natural History of the
United States."      2500 names appeared on the subscription list of this
work. He hoped to publish ten volumes of this series, but only actually
published four, leaving a fifth unfinished.     These four are : — An Essay
on Classification ; North-American Testudinata ; the Embryology of
Turtles ; and ' The Acalephs,' under which were included Monographs
of the Ctenophorae, Discophorae, and Hydroidaa, and an essay on the
Homologies of the Eadiata.          His chief assistant in their preparation
was   the late Prof.  H. J.  Clark.   These books were illustrated by first-
rate lithographic plates, the best of which were drawn by Sonrel.
                                   '
   The ' Essay on Classification is the crowning work of Agassiz.        The
erudition displayed in this work is remarkable, and the grasp of facts,
intricate and numerous in their relations, is quite amazing. In nothing
is this better exhibited than in his celebrated demonstration of embryo-
logical, geological, and zoological succession.     He shows that in many
orders the species which first appear in the older beds resemble the embryo
of the highest species now living ; and, moreover, that this fossil and this
embryo have characteristics in common with the living species that stand
lower in the zoological scale.    Thus, among living Crustacea, the Brachy-
urans stand highest ; but the embryo of the Brachyuran has a long tail
like the Macrurans, which are characteristic of the middle geological
periods, and the living forms of which are zoologically inferior to the
Brachyurans.
   The last years of Agassiz's life were devoted to founding a large museum
arranged to show his views of the relations of living animals among
themselves, and their connexions in the geological and embryological
successions.
   His own collections, which had gradually outgrown the means of a single
individual, formed the nucleus of a Museum of Comparative Zoology.
An endowment-fund was commenced by the generosity of one of his
friends, Mr. F. C. Gray, the cooperation of Harvard College and the
 State of Massachusetts adding to its means at different times. On the
 death of Agassiz a "Memorial Fund" was raised by subscription, ample
 enough, it is hoped, to carry out some at least of his cherished ideas.
    This Museum has been the nursery for nearly all the Professors of

                                       xxvm
Natural History in the United States, most of whom are pupils of
Agassiz.      He did more than any one man to break down the old
 curriculum of the public schools, and to force the introduction of the
teaching of science. His own lectures introduced popular scientific dis
 quisitions into the Lyceum courses, so universal an America.        He was an
 admirable lecturer, fascinating to his audience, and carrying them along
by his own enthusiasm ; and few even of the public men of America had
 such a deep hold upon the community as Agassiz. His management of
the State Legislature, upon whom he long depended for the support of
the museum, was as simple as it was effective.             Farmers, merchants,
lawyers, and business men, who cared very little for Natural History,
 freely gave to Agassiz, whose motives were always unselfish, and whose
 sole aim was the advancement of science.
    His wish was to  leave  this museum   as a legacy to the people of America.
He gradually gave      less time to special investigations and more to the
museum, which was to show the forms of life in a connected order.
    He brought back    a vast collection of specimens   from his expedition to
Brazil, the results of which expedition are described by Agassiz and bis
wife in the work ' A Journey to Brazil.' This expedition was undertaken
at the cost of Mr. Nathaniel Thayer, who unasked, offered to defray all the
expenses, personal and scientific, of six assistants ; and eventually did even
more than he had promised, continuing to meet all the expenses that were
incurred until the last specimen was stored in the Cambridge University.
But not even the sight of familiar fishes, that reminded him of old times
at Munich and of Spix and Martius, could turn Agassiz again to special
studies.     He worked on as indefatigably as ever, keeping up his relations
with the public, his interest in education, his voluminous correspondence,
and giving popular lectures.
    But the strain of all this was too great, and in 1S69 he was seized with
a cerebral attack.   He, however, recovered from this, and in the year 1871
joined an exploring-expedition under the direction of the Coast Survey.
                          '
The steamer ' Hassler was fitted out expressly to make deep-sea dredg-
ings along the coasts of South America and the west coast of North
America.      Agassiz had become deeply interested in the results of the
deep-sea dredgings he made in 1866 and 1867 in the Straits of Florida,
during an expedition under the direction of the Coast Survey, in which he
was accompanied by Count Pourtalcs.               Although the plans of the
'          '
   Hassler Expedition were most carefully matured, it was not a suc
cess as far as dredging-operations were concerned.         He submitted cheer
fully  to all  the hardships   of  the voyage  round  Cape Horn to California,
and came back laden with fresh collections.        In the course of this expe
dition a careful exploration was made of the Sargasso Sea, and a nest-
building fish discovered, and other important contributions made to Natural
Science. His life ended happily ; he saw his Museum well supplied with
funds and rapidly progressing in size and order. By the aid of the gift of

                                       XXIX
the Island   o£ Penikese and of a large sum of money, he was enabled to found
a summer school of Natural History. The school started with about fifty
pupils, and Agassiz had the gratification of founding the first school of the
kind in the world. This additional strain on his powers at a season when
Agassiz had usually taken a holiday from his ordinary work was too much
for his already enfeebled health. On Tuesday, December 2nd, four days
before he was attacked with his last illness, he gave an address before the
Massachusetts State Board of Agriculture, at Fitchburgh, where he lectured
not only with ease but with an unwonted energy, an evidence, no doubt,
of cerebral disturbance. This over-exertion was so apparent that, by order
of his physicians, he gave up an engagement to lecture at New Haven on
the 8th.     On the 5th he met his students, and on the 6th, while at work
in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, he was taken suddenly ill and
retired immediately to his house and bed, never to leave them alive.
    His family physician, Dr. Morril Wyman, and his old friend Dr. Brown-
Sequard were almost constantly with him during his last illness.            He
died on the 14th December, 1873.
    His funeral was attended at Appleton Chapel, Harvard University, by
a vast assembly of mourning friends from Boston and many other towns
far and near.      The flags of the Municipality of Boston were hung half-
mast high, and the bells were tolled during the obsequies. To the solemn
music of the " Dead March in Saul
                                         "
                                           the family and a few near friends,
with the University Authorities, left the Chapel for Mount Auburn
Cemetery, where now rest the remains of L.        J. E. Agassiz.
    At the time of his death Agassiz was engaged in his discussion of the
" Evolution of Types," the first paper of which appeared in the ' Atlantic
           '
Monthly      for December.
    Agassiz was much opposed to the theories of Darwin.          His old scien
tific friends, who, one after another, joined the evolutionists, never could
understand how he, who had so early in his career pointed the way to
what is now one of the strongest proofs of evolution, could resist his own
arguments.      As a matter of history, it is an interesting record to turn to
                                                   '
the pages of his German edition of Buckland's Mineralogy and Geology,'
and read the notes, many of which would pass as the work of the most
advanced evolutionist.     But in his later years he was eminently a theistic
philosopher.     His argument against the doctrine of evolution has been
thus described : —
    1. There is order and system in organic nature, such as indicates
thought. 2. The evolution of species of plants and animals one from
another by natural causation is tantamount to a denial of this. 3. There
fore doctrines of evolution are untrue.
    Agassiz received the Monthyon and Cuvier prizes and the Copley and
Wollaston Medals.       He was a Foreign Member of the Royal and Lan-
nean Societies, a Foreign Associate of the French Academy of Sciences,
 and a member of most other learned Societies and Academies.

                                   XXX
  Agassiz early married a gifted sister of Professor Alexander Braun, by
whom he had three children, who survived him — two daughters, and a
son, who has made numerous valuable contributions to our knowledge of
Comparative Anatomy and Embryology. His second wife (ne'e Cary), the
ever helpful companion and associate in voyage and travel and in literary
and scientific work, survives him.

        By GEORGE J. ROMANES, M.A., F.L.S., &c. Communicated by
        Prof. HUXLEY, Sec. R.S., &c. Received November 21, 1876.

                        I.  FUNDAMENTAL OBSEBVATIOSS.
    §  I. Fundamental    Observations    on the Naked-eyed Medusa'. — The obser
vation which, in my last paper,        I  designated the
                                                           " fundamental observa
tion," has been this year repeated numberless times, both on the old
species of naked-eyed Medusae and also on some new ones.                 The result
has been in every case to confirm the rule previously enunciated, namely,
that    " excision of the extreme margin of       a nectocalyx   causes immediate,
total, and permanent paralysis of the entire organ."
    § 2. Fundamental Observations on the Covered-eyed Medusce.        — Regarding
the covered-eyed Medusae, it is necessary to say that             I have this year
confirmed all the observations which required confirmation from the fact
of their having been at variance with those of Dr. Elmer.              I  have con
tinued to find that the lithocysts are the exclusive seats of sponta
neity, so far as the
                        " primary movements " are concerned.          I  have failed
to detect the slightest evidence of spontaneity on the part of the " con
                  "
tractile zones ; for, after allowing the animal to recover from the shock
consequent upon removal of its lithocysts alone, and then observing the
degree of spontaneity it manifested,          I was in no case able to perceive
that, by now removing all the " contractile zones," this degree of spon
taneity was in the smallest degree diminished.               Again, as regards the
character of the " secondary contractions
                                                      "
                                                        which are manifested by
the covered-eyed Medusae after excision of their lithocysts or margin,              I
 have found all my previous statements substantially correct.             I   am still
unable to say that these secondary contractions appear to me either more
 " feeble " or " inefficient " than the primary ones, or that the former are
                    "     "
any more of a local character than the latter.               Neither can    I  modify
my previous statements as to the time after removal of the lithocysts
dur1ng which the secondary movements persist.               So far have  I  found it
from being true that these contractions          " generally cease after a few mo
ments, or, at any rate, after a few hours," that          I  am now able fully to

  1877.]                Locomotor System of Medusae,                           465
 confirm    my original statement        to the effect that these contractions
 " usually  last for several days."       In   most cases, indeed, they continue
 even after decomposition    of some parts of the tissues has set in and pro
 ceeded to the extent of giving the latter a certain ragged appearance,
which is due to certain portions disintegrating into shreds.
                                  II.   EHYTHM.
    § 1.  Relation  between Size and Rhythm.       —I  am able to endorse     Dr.
 Elmer's statement that in Aurelia aurita the rate of the natural rhythm
has a tendency to bear an inverse proportion to the size of the individual.
Size, however, is far from being the only factor in determining the differ
ence between the rate of rhythm of different specimens, though what the
other factors are   I am unable   to suggest.
    § 2. Relation between the periods    of Activity and the periods of Repose.
                                                                                —
Dr. Eimer affirms that the duration of the natural pauses, which in Au~
 relia alternate with bouts of swimming, bears a direct proportion to the
 number and strength of the contractions that occurred in the previous
 bout of swimming.      In my postscript     I pointed out that Sarsice are much
 better adapted than Aurelice for determining whether any such precise
 relation obtains, and observed that here        I was quite sure no such pre
 cise relation   did obtain, although      in a very general way it was true,   as
 might   be expected, that   unusually prolonged bouts of swimming were
 sometimes followed by pauses of unusual duration.             These statements
 have now been amply confirmed.
    § 3. Effects of Artificial Segmentation on the Rhythm. —I have also
 this year investigated Dr. Elmer's rule with regard to the half, quarter,
and eighth-part segments of Aurelia manifesting respectively a rhythm
 one half, one quarter, and one eighth part the rate of the rhythm which
had previously been manifested by the unmutilated animal.              I am glad
to observe that Dr. Eimer himself seems to regard this rule as a somewhat
 uncertain one, for     I cannot say that my experiments have tended to
confirm it. As stated in my previous paper, there is a general tendency
for the smaller segments of an Aurelia divided in this way to contract
less frequently than the larger segments ; and more careful observations
this year have not resulted in establishing any more precise relationship.
On the other hand, these observations have resulted in confirming my
previous opinion, that the potency of the lithocysts which happen to be
left in any given segment has more to do with the rate of the rhythm
than has the size of the segment ; for it is not difficult to obtain an eighth-
part segment with a more rapid rhythm than a segment four times that
size, provided that the Aurelia is divided so as to leave a decidedly pre
potent lithocyst to animate the smaller segment. In such cases, tow-
ever, the endurance of the smaller segment will be less than that of the
larger, notwithstanding the greater activity it displays during the first
day or two after the operation.       I  can only attribute this fact to the more
                                                                   2L2

rapid starvation of the smaller segment, owing perhaps to th? greater
proportional area of the nutrient-tube section in it than in the larger
segment.      It is interesting, however, to note that although a prepotent
lithocyst   thus  situated shows less endurance than the other lithocysts
towards deprivation of nourishment, it shows more endurance towards
deprivation of oxygen ; for in stale water the prepotent lithocyst will
continue active after the others have ceased to discharge, or its action
will continue rhythmical after that of the others has become irregular.
    § 4. Effects of  other forms of Mutilation on the Rhythm.
                                                                       —   Mutilation of
a covered-eyed     Medusa,   in which   the series of lithocysts   is left intact — such
as cutting off the manubrium or portions of the umbrella              —  causes marked
changes    in the  rate of the  rhythm.      The  first  effect of   the   mutilation is
usually to accelerate the rhythm ; but this temporary acceleration gra
dually declines, and eventually the rhythm becomes stationary at a rate
slower than that which was manifested by the unmutilated animal. Fur
ther mutilation will now be attended with a repetition of these effects.
To show the degree in which these effects occur,             I here quote a series of
observations.
 An Aurelia manifested per minute           a regular and sustained         rhythm
      of                                                                      ."       26

 Another circular incision, carried midway between the former one
      and the margin, caused rhythm to rise to                                         24
 Bate again gradually declined, and became stationary at                               12
 Another circular incision was then carried round as close to the
       margin as was compatible with leaving the physiological con
       tinuity of all the lithocysts intact : rhythm rose to                           14
 Within a few minutes it fell to                                                        fi
    Besides producing such marked effects on the rate of the rhythm, muti
 lation also frequently produces an effect in impairing the regularitv of the
 rhythm.      For instance, an Aurelia manifested a regular and sustained
 rhythm of 36 per minute. Immediately after removal of the manubrium,
 the rate of the rhythm in successive minutes was as follows : — 40, 39, 37.
 35, 32, 30, 29, 26, 24, 18, 14 (40 seconds' pause), 16, 15, 14, 15, 16 (40
 seconds' pause), 22, 20, 19, 15, 16, 17, 14, 13, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 14, 12,
 13, 11, 12, 9, 15, 16, 14, 12, 9, &c., the rhythm now continuing very irre
 gular.    An hour after the operation the following were the numbers of
 contractions given in one-minute intervals, the observations being taken
 at intervals of 10 minutes :— 15, 15, 12, 22, 14, &c.
    These experiments are of interest because tending to show that an

   apparently automatic action on the part of ganglia
                                                                  * is really due to a
   constant stimulation supplied by other parts of the organism.
      § 5. Effects of lessening the amount of Tissue adhering to a single Oan
  glion, — The results of the following very similar experiment would seem
  to point to a similar interpretation.            Excising an eighth-part segment
   of Aurelia containing a single lithocyst,        I   noted the rhythm manifested
  by this segment.    I then proceeded to pare down the contractile tissue from
  around    the lithocyst, and observed the effect of so doing upon the rhythm.
  I  found that this process had no very marked effect on the rhythm until
  the paring reached within an inch or two of the ganglion. Then, however,
  the effect began to show itself, and with every successive paring it became
  more marked.       This effect consisted in slowing the rate of the rhythm,
  though more especially in giving rise to exceedingly prolonged pauses ; but
  if during one of these pauses a stimulus of any kind were applied to the
  remainder of the contractile tissue, the rhythmic discharges of the ganglion
  at once recommenced, and continued for a short time at a slow rate.
     § 6. Effects of Temperature on the Rhythm. — The effects of temperature
  on the rhythm of Medusae are very decided.                For instance, a specimen
  of Sarsia which in successive minutes gave the following numbers of
  pulsations  — 16, 26,   0, 0, 26 — gave 60 pulsations        during the next minute
  while   a spirit-lamp was held under the water in which the Medusa was
  swimming.        Again, if hot water be added to that in which Sarsice are
  contained until the whole is milk-warm, the swimming-motions                 become
  frantic. If the' same experiment be performed after the margins of the
 Sarsice have been removed, the paralyzed bells remain quite passive, while
  the severed margins exhibit the frantic motions just alluded to.
     In the case of the covered-eyed Medusae, the greatest accelerating
 effect is produced by a more moderate temperature.                  For example, an
 Aurelia contracted with the greatest regularity 33 times per minute in
 water kept at 34° Fahr., while in water kept at 49° the rate varied from 37
 to 49 per minute.        On the other hand, an Aurelia wh'ose rhythm in water
 at 40° was regular at 1 8 per minute, was suddenly transferred to water
 at 80° : in the immediately succeeding jninutes the rhythm was 22, 20,
 14.     The latter rate continued for nearly half an hour, when the obser
 vation terminated.         The effect of moderately warm water (50°-60°),
 therefore, is to cause permanent quickening and irregularity of the
 rhythm ; while the effect of still warmer water (70°-80°) is temporarily
to quicken and then permanently to slow the rhythm,                as well, I may add,
as greatly to enfeeble the contractions.
     The slowing effect on the rhythm of a diminution               of temperature is
decided.      For instance, an Aurelia presenting            a regular rhythm of 20
    * Having now satisfied myself concerning the presence of ganglion-cells and nerve-
flbree in the marginal bodies of the Medusae, I feel at liberty to discard the term

per minute in water at 45° was placed in water at 19° : the rhythm
almost immediately began to slow and the strength of the contractions
to diminish, till the rate fell to 10 per minute (quite regular) and the
contractions ceased to penetrate the muscular tissue further than an inch
or two from the marginal ganglia ; pauses now became frequent, but
stimulation always originated a fresh bout of swimming.              Next only
single  contractions  were  given at long and   irregular  intervals, and these
contractions were so feeble that they were restricted to the immediate
vicinity of the lithocyst in which they originated.       Soon after this stage
irritability disappeared.    This process from first to last occupied rather
less than five minutes. On now leaving the animal for 10 minutes more,
and then transferring it to water at the original temperature of 45°, all
the above-mentioned stages were passed through in reverse order.
    Some specimens of Aurelia were frozen into a solid block of sea-water
ice.    On being released all their gelatinous tissues were seen to be
pierced through in every direction by an innumerable multitude of ice-
crystals, which had been formed by the freezing in situ of the sea-water
which enters so largely into the composition of these tissues.          Yet, on
 being thawed out, the animals recovered, although their original rate of
rhythm did not fully return.         Their tissues then presented a ragged
 appearance, which was due to the disintegrating effect produced br the
 formation of the ice-crystals.
    § 7. Effects of certain Gases on the EJ1ythm. — Oxygen forced under
pressure into sea-water containing Sarsue has the effect of accelerat
 ing the rate of their rhythm. The following observation on a single
 specimen will serve to render this apparent, the numbers of pulsations
 being recorded in five-minute intervals.     The progressive recovery from
 exhaustion during the last of the three observations deserves notice.
            In  ordinary water                        472, 527, 470.
            In  oxygenated sea-water                  800.
            In  ordinary sea-water                    268, 350, 430.
    Carbonic acid has the opposite effects to those of oxygen, and, if ad
 ministered in too large doses, destroys both spontaneity and irritability.
    Nitrous oxide at first accelerates the motions of Sarsia, but eventually
 retards them.     I omitted,  however, to push the experiment to the stage
 of complete   anaesthesia.
    Medusae are very sensitive to such slight carbonization of the water in
 which they are contained as results from their being confined in a limited
 body of it for a few hours.     The rhythm becomes slowed and the con
 tractions feeble, while the pauses between the swimming-bouts become
 more and more frequent and prolonged.        If  the water is not changed, all
 these symptoms become more marked, and, in addition, the rhythm be
 comes more    irregular.   Eventually the swimming-motions      entirely cease  :

but almost immediately after the animals are restored to fresh sea-water
they recover themselves completely.
                                III.   STIMULATION.
  §   1. Mechanical stimulation.   —When the paralyzed swimming-organ of
Aurelia aurita is stimulated with a single mechanical irritation, it often
responds with two, and more rarely with three, contractions, which are
separated from one another by an interval of about the same duration as
the normal diastole of the unmutilated animal.
   § 2. Chemical stimulation. — Dilute spirit, or other irritant, dropped on
the paralyzed swimming-organ of Aurelia aurita, sometimes gives rise to a
whole series of rhythmical pulsations, the systoles and diastoles following
one another at about the same rate as is observable in the normal swim
ming-motions of the unmutilated animal.
  § 3. Tlwrmal stimulation. — Eesponse to thermal stimulation may be
obtained by allowing a few drops of heated sea-water to run over the
excitable surface while the latter is exposed to the air.
   § 4. Luminous stimulation. — Light acts as a powerful and unfailing
stimulus in the cases of some species of naked-eyed Medusae. Sarsice,
for instance, almost invariably respond to    a single flash by giving one or
more contractions.     If the animal is vigorous, the effect of a momentary
flash thrown upon it    during one of the natural pauses is immediately to
originate a bout of swimming ; but if the animal is non-vigorous, it
usually gives only one contraction in response to every flash. That it is
light per se, and not the sudden transition from darkness to light, which
here acts as the stimulus, is proved by the result of the converse experi
ment, —viz. placing a vigorous specimen in sunlight, waiting till the middle
of one of the natural pauses, and then suddenly darkening.              In no case
      I
did thus obtain any response : indeed the effect           of this converse expe
riment is rather that of inhibiting contractions ; for if the sunlight be
suddenly shut off during the occurrence of a swimming-bout, it frequently
happens that the quiescent stage immediately sets in. Again, in a
general way, it is observable that Sarsice are more active in the light than
they are in the dark : it appears as though light acts towards these ani
mals as a constant stimulus.       Nevertheless, when the flashing method of
experimentation   is employed,    it is observable that the stimulating effect
of the flashes progressively declines with their repetition.              The time
during  which  the  deleterious  effect  of one   such  stimulus  on  its  successor
lasts appears to be about a quarter of a minute.            The period of latent
stimulation    is,
                judging by    the  eye, as  short  in the  case of luminous as in
that of other stimulation    ; but when the efficacy of luminous stimulation
 isbeing diminished     byfrequent repetition, the period of latency       is   very
much prolonged.      In this case the first effect of the flash to cause re
                                                                   is
traction of the tentacles and manubrium, as occurs with other modes of
feeble stimulation or stimulation of feeble specimens.            Lastly, that the

 470                         Mr. G.   J.   Romanes on the                  [Jan.      11,
 stimulating influence of light is exerted solely through the sense-organs,
 is proved by the fact that when these are removed the swimming-bell,
 though still able to contract spontaneously, no longer responds to lumi
 nous stimulation ; but if only one marginal body be left in situ, or if the
 severed margin alone be experimented              upon, unfa1ling response to this
 mode of stimulation may be obtained.
    Tiaropsis polydindemata responds to luminous stimulation in the same
  peculiar manner as it responds to all other kinds of stimulation, viz. by
  performing the spasmodic movements described in my previous paper.
  But the period of latency in this species is very much longer in the case
 of luminous than in that of other modes of stimulation ; for while this
 period   is,
            so far as the eye can judge, quite as instantaneous   as        it   is   in
 the case of Sarsia when the stimulus supplied       other than luminous, in
                                                             is
 response to light the characteristic spasm does not take place till slightly
 more than     second has elapsed after the first occurrence of the stimulus.
                a
 Now, as my experiments on Sarsia proved that the only respect in which
 luminous stimulation differs from other modes of stimulation consists in its
 being exclusively  astimulation of central nervous matter, we have evidence,
 in the case of Tiaropsis, of an enormous difference between the rapidity of
 response to stimuli    by
                         the contractile and            by
                                                  the ganglionic tissues re
 spectively.    The next question, therefore,    as to whether the enormous
                                                     is
 length  of  time occupied     by
                               the process  of stimulation  in the ganglia            is
 due to any necessity on the part of the latter to accumulate the stimu
 lating influence prior to originating     discharge, or to an immensely
                                               a
 lengthened period of latent stimulation manifested               by
                                                          the ganglia under
 the influence of light. To  answer   this question,   first allowed a con
                                                              I
  tinuous flood of light to fall on the Medusid, and then noted the time
  at which the responsive spasm first began. This time, as already stated,
  was slightly more than one second.       next threw in single flashes of light
                                           I
 of measured    duration, and   found  that,  unless the flash was of slightly
 more than one second's duration, no response was given. That            to say,
                                                                           is
 the minimal duration of     aflash required to produce      responsive spasm
                                                                  a
 was just the same as the time during which          continuous flood of light
                                                        a
 required to operate in order to produce          similar spasm. From this,
                                                    a
 therefore,
          I    conclude that the enormously long period of latent excitation
 in the case of luminous stimuli         not, properly speaking,     period of
                                      it is
                                                                       a
latent excitation at all, but that      represents the time during which a
certain summation of stimulating influence         taking place in the ganglia,
                                                     is
which requires somewhat more than           second to accumulate, and which

then causes the ganglia to originate an abnormally powerful discharge *.

whether the light employed be direct sunlight, diffused daylight, light

stimuli employed) has recently been described by Dr. Sterling, in the case of refles

to exert the smallest degree of stimulating influence.
    § 5. Electrical stimulation. (A) Latent period, and Characters of the Con
 tractions. — The period of latent stimulation in the case of Amelia, aurita
is much longer than it is in the case of Sarsia.          I have determined it with
accuracy    in   the former  case,  and  find  it to  be greatly modified by various
conditions.        To take, therefore, the simplest case first, suppose that the
paralyzed Aurelia has been left quiet for several minutes in water at 45°,
and that it is then stimulated by means of a single induction-shock : the
responsive contraction will be comparatively feeble, with a very long period
of latency, viz. £ of a second. If another shock of the same intensity
be thrown in as soon as the tissue has relaxed, a somewhat stronger con
traction, with a somewhat shorter latent period, will be the result. If the
process is again repeated, the response will be still more powerful, with a
still shorter period of latency ; and so on for perhaps eight or ten stages,
when the maximum force of contraction of which the tissue is capable
will have    been attained, while the period of latency       will have been reduced
to its minimum — viz. £ of a second, or, in some cases, slightly less.
    The first of these effects is identical with that which has already been
described by Dr. Bowditch as occurring, under similar circumstances, in
the case of the heart-apex.        There are, however, one or two points of dif
ference as regards this      summation     of stimuli in the case of the heart and
                                                                          "
in that of the Medusae ; for in the latter, after a " staircase             has been
built up by means of a series of        stimuli,   if a pause  of  not less than  one
minute be allowed to elapse and the stimulation be then again com
menced,     I  find that the first step is only of the same height as the first
step of a standard staircase.         The tissue has, as it were, completely for
gotten the occurrence of the previous series of stimuli. Now Dr. Bow-
ditch has found, in the case of the heart, that an interval of five minute
must be allowed to intervene between two series of stimuli before the
effect of the first on the second series is thus wholly abolished, or, in
the words of the metaphor just employed, the memory of the cardiac
tissue is about five times as long as that of the medusoid tissue.                But
in the case of exhausted u1edusoid tissue the difference may                 be  even
greater than this ; for in this case       I have observed all memory to fade in
the course of half a minute. Again, the medusoid tissue is more tolerant
than is the cardiac tissue of rapidity in the succession of the stimuli ;
for while Dr. Bowditch found that the maximum staircase effect could
be produced in the latter by throwing in stimuli at about 6-second in
tervals,  I  find in the case of the former that the shorter the intervals
between the successive shocks, the greater is the staircase effect.              And
in this connexion      I may also state that a staircase has more steps in it
if caused by a weak than if caused by a strong current, and that if the

strength of the current be suddenly increased after the maximum level
of a staircase has been attained by a feeble current, this level admits of
being slightly raised.         Lastly,   I find in Aurelia that the staircase action
is so pronounced that a stimulus which at the bottom of a staircase is
of less than minimal intensity, is able at the top of a staircase to give
rise to a contraction        of very nearly maximum intensity. In such cases
no response is given to the first three or four stimuli.
    With regard to this interesting staircase action, two questions natu
rally present themselves. In the first place, we are anxious to know
whether the arousing effect, which is so conspicuous in a staircase series,
is due to the occurrence of the former stimulations or to that of the
former contractions ; and, in the next place, we should like to know
whether, during the natural rhythm of the tissue, each contraction exerts
a beneficial influence on its successor, analogous to that which may be so
certainly shown to occur in the case of contractions due to artificial sti
muli. As regards the first of these questions, it is evident that the fact
 of invisible steps occurring at the bottom of a staircase (as just de
 scribed at the close of the last paragraph) proves that the staircase
effect, at any rate at its commencement, depends on the process of sti
mulation as distinguished from that of contraction ; for, as in this case
the process of contraction does not occur at all, it clearly cannot have
any part in the production of the effect. Nevertheless, that the process
of contraction does assist in producing the visible steps of the staircase,
is perhaps suggested by the result of the following experiment.                     Having
                                                      I
 built up a staircase in the ordinary way, suddenly transferred the elec
trodes to the opposite side of the disk from that on which they rested
while constructing the staircase. On now throwing in another shock at
this part of the contractile tissue, so remote from the part previously
irritated, the response corresponded in all respects with the one pre
viously given, i. e. it was a maximum response.                   This fact conclusively
proves that the staircase effect is a general one, pervading the whole
 mass of the contractile tissue, and not confined to the immediate seat of
irritation*.
    The second of the above questions was answered by cutting an Aurelia
into a spiral strip of small width and great length, and removing all the
lithocysts save one. It was then observed that after the occurrence of
 a natural pause of sufficient duration, the first discharge only penetrated
a short way through the strip, the next a little further, the next further
 still, and so on, till finally the contractile waves passed from end to end.
 On now removing the ganglion and stimulating with successive induc

tion-shocks,    the same progressive penetration was observed as that which
had previously taken place with the ganglionic stimulation.               From these
and other experiments (particularly those in which natural and artificial
stimuli were allowed to alternate in the same staircase) there can be no
doubt that during the natural rhythm of the Medusae every contraction
exerts a beneficial influence on its successor, which is the same, both in
kind and degree, as that which is exerted by a contraction due to an
 artificial stimulus.
     Eeturning now to the period of latent stimulation in Aurelia aurita,
 we have seen how profoundly this period is modified by the summation of
 stimuli. We have next to consider the other causes which modify this
 period. Of these causes the first which claims our attention is exhaustion ;
 for, as it is evident that the effect of exhaustion on the latent period
 must be in direct antagonism with that of the summation of stimuli, it be
 comes interesting to observe what will be the total effect on the latent
 period when these antagouistic influences are both present together.              Now
 tracings   show   that when   this is the  case  the  effect  of   exhaustion    even
 tually overcomes that of summation, and, further, that the supremacy
 of the former over the latter shows itself in lengthening the period
 of latent stimulation before it shows itself in diminishing the amplitude
 of the contraction.
     With regard to the effects of temperature           on this latent period, the
 following table, setting forth the results        of one among several experi
 ments, explains itself : —

     In the case of each observation'several shocks were administered before
  the latent period was taken, in order to decrease this period to its mini
  mum by the staircase action.         When this is not done, the latent period
  at 20° may be as long as 1| sec. ; but soon after this irritability disap
  pears.    Moreover, by cold the duration of the contractions          is enormously
  prolonged.
      (B) Tetanus. —When Aurelia aurita, whether or not paralyzed, is sub
  mitted to tolerably strong faradaic stimulation, more or less well pro
  nounced tenanus is the result.         That this tetanus is due to summation
  may be very prettily shown by the following experiment : — An Aurelia is
  cut into a spiral strip, and all its lithocysts are removed. Single induction-
   shocks are then thrown in at one end of the strip — every shock, of course,
  giving rise to   a contractile  wave.     If  these shocks are thrown         in at a
   somewhat fast rate, two contractile waves may be made at the same time
  to course, one behind the other, along the spiral strip ; but if the shocks

474                      Mr. G.   J. Romanes on the                [Jan.   1 1
are thrown in at a still faster rate, so as to diminish the distance between
 any two successive waves, a point soon comes at which every wave over
 takes its predecessor, and, if several waves be thus made to coalesce, the
 whole strip becomes thrown into a state of persistent spasm.        In such
experiments it is interesting to observe that, no matter how long the
 strip may be, or how complicated the time-relations between the succes
sive stimuli are made, whatever disturbances are set up at one end of the
 strip are faithfully transmitted to the other. This of course shows that
 the rate of transmission     is so identical in the case of all the stimuli
originated, that the sum of the effects of any series of stimuli is delivered
at the distal end of the strip, with all its constituent parts as distinct
from one another as they were at starting from the proximal end of the
strip.
    (C) Artificial rhythm.- — When the swimming-organ of Aurelia has been
paralyzed by removal of its lithocysts, and is then subjected to faradaic
stimulation of minimal intensity, the response it gives is not tetanic, but
strictly rhythmic.     The rate of the rhythm varies in different specimens,
but usually corresponds with that of rapid swimming.            The artificial
rhythm may be obtained with a portion of any size of irritable tissue, and
whether a small or a large piece of the latter be included between the
electrodes.
    Progressively intensifying the strength of the faradizing current] has
the effect of progressively increasing the rate of the artificial rhythm up
to the point at which the rhythm begins to pass into tetanus due to
summation of the successive contractions.         But between the slowest
rhythm obtainable by minimal stimulation, and the most rapid rhythm
obtainable before the appearance of tetanus, there are numerous degrees
of rate to be observed.
    The persistency of any given rate of rhythm under the same strength
 of current is wonderfully great ; for it generally requires more than an
hour of continuous faradization before the rhythm begins to become ir
regular, owing to incipient exhaustion.       At first only one systole is
 omitted at long intervals ; but afterwards these omissions become fre
quent and all the contractions irregular. Finally the contractions cease
altogether ; but a prolonged rest of half an hour or an hour restores the
irritability.
    The hypothesis by which     I explain this artificial rhythm (a rhythm
which in most cases is quite as regular as that of a heart) is as follows.
Every time the tissue contracts it must, as a consequence, suffer a cer
tain degree of exhaustion, and therefore must become slightly less sen
sitive to stimulation than it was before.       After a time, however, the
exhaustion will pass away, and the original degree of sensitiveness will
thereupon return.      Now the intensity of the faradaic stimulation, which
is alone capable of producing rhythmic response, is either minimal or
but slightly more (ban minimal in relation to the sensitiveness of the

1877.]                   Locomotor System      of Medusae.                    475
tissues when fresh : consequently, when the degree of this sensitiveness
is somewhat lowered by temporary exhaustion, the intensity of the sti
mulation becomes somewhat less than minimal in relation to this lower
degree of sensitiveness.          The tissue, therefore, fails to perceive
the presence of the stimulus, and consequently fails to respond.
But so soon as the exhaustion is completely recovered from, so soon will
the tissue again perceive the presence of the stimulation ; it will there
fore again respond, again become temporarily exhausted, again fail to
perceive the presence of the stimulation, and therefore again become
temporarily quiescent.        Now it is obvious that if this process occurs
once,  it may occur an indefinite number of times ; and as the conditions
of nutrition, as well as those of stimulation, remain constant, it is mani
fest that the responses may thus become periodic.
    In order to test this hypothesis,      I made the following experiments.
Having    first noted   the rate of the rhythm under faradaic stimulation of
minimal intensity, without shifting the electrodes or altering the strength
 of the current,   I discarded the faradaic stimulation, and substituted for
it single induction-shocks thrown in with a key.              I found, as   I  had
hoped, that the maximum number of these single shocks which               I  could
thus throw in in a given time, so as to procure a response to every shock,
 corresponded exactly with the number of contractions which the tissue
 had previously given during a similar interval of time when under the
influence of the faradaic current of similar intensity. For instance, to
take a specific case, it was found that under the faradaic current the rate
of the rhythm was one in two seconds. By now throwing in single shocks of
the same intensity, it was found that the quickest rate at which these
could be thrown in, so as to procure a response to every shock, was one
in two seconds.     If thrown in at a slightly quicker rate, every now and then,
at regular intervals, one of the shocks would fail to elicit a response. The
 length of these intervals, of course, depended on the rate at which the suc
 cessive shocks were thrown in ; so that, for instance, if they were thrown
 in at the rate of one a second, the tissue would only, but always, respond
 to every alternate shock.
    The following, and somewhat similar, experiment is still more conclu
 sive. As already stated, the rate of the artificial rhythm under faradaic
 stimulation varies with the strength of the faradaic current.          Well, by
 choosing at random any strength of faradaic stimulation between the
 limits where rhythmic response occurred, and by noting the rate of the
 rhythm under that strength,       I was generally able to predict the precise
number of single induction-shocks        I could afterwards afford to throw in
 with the same strength of current so as to procure a response to every
 shock — this number, of course, corresponding exactly with the rate of
 the rhythm previously manifested under the faradaic stimulation.
    Other experiments, which do not admit of being briefly detailed, have
likewise confirmed the above hypothesis ; so         I think the latter may be

considered almost as demonstrated.               Upon this hypothesis, therefore,        I
have constructed a theory concerning, the rhythmic action of organic
 tissues in general.      The details of this theory cannot be rendered in
 the present abstract ; but in its main outlines it is very simple, viz.
that all such rhythmic action is due to the alternate process of exhaus
tion and recovery of contractile tissues, which has just been explained.
Therefore the particular case of rhythmic action of gaugliouated tissues
is supposed by this theory to be due, not to any special resistance
mechanism on the part of the ganglioniu tissues, but to the primary
qualities of the contractile tissues.           In other words, the function of the
ganglia is supposed to be merely that of supplying a constant stimulation,
the rhythm being supposed due to the same causes as is the artificial
rhythm of Aurelia aurita. From this it will be seen that the essential
point of difference between the current theory of rhythm as due to
ganglia and the theory now proposed consists in this — that whereas both
theories suppose the accumulation of energy by ganglia to be a continuous
process, the resistance theory supposes the discharge of this accumulated
energy to be intermittent, while the exhaustion theory supposes it to
be constant.      According to the former theory, therefore, the rhythm
results because the stimulation is periodic ; according to the latter theory,
the rhythm results because the alternate process of exhaustion                       and
recovery, or the fall and rise of excitability, is periodic.
    Without here waiting to discuss the a priori merits of these rival
theories,   I will proceed at once to mention some further experiments
which were designed to test the new theory, and which have so far con
firmed it as to show that the causes which modify the natural rhythm of
Aurelia likewise modify, in the same ways and degrees, the artificial
rhythm.
    (a) Other modes of constant stimulation besides that supplied by faradaic
electricity likewise cause rhythmic action on the part of the deganglio-
nated tissues of Medusae. As stated in my former paper, the voltaic
current causes this action*; and, as stated in an earlier part of this ab
stract, dilute chemical stimuli, and even mechanical irritation, tend to
produce the same effect.             Again, the remarkably sustained rhythmic
motion which is manifested by the paralyzed bells of Sarsia in acidulated
water, which last year appeared so anomalous, is clearly to be referred to
the same category.
    (6) As regards the effect of temperature on the rate of the artificial
rhythm, it is only necessary to state the following details. With each incre-
mentof temperature the rate of the artificial rhythm increases suddenly, just
as  it does in the case of the natural rhythm. Moreover, there seems to be a
sort of rough correspondence between the amount of influence that any
given degree of temperature exerts on the rate of the natural and of the
   * Thus for the results are              similar to those obtained by Dr. Foster in the

artificial rhythm respectively.   Further, it will be remembered that in
warm water the natural rhythm, besides being quicker, is not BO regular
as it is in cold water : thus also it is with the artificial rhythm. Lastly,
water below 20° or above 85° suspends the natural rhythm ; and the
artificial rhythm is suspended at about the same degrees.
   (c) Oxygen accelerates, while carbonic acid retards and eventually sus
pends the artificial rhythm, in just the same way as these gases act on
the natural rhythm.
   (d) When the marginal ganglia of Sarsia are removed, the manubrium
shortly afterwards relaxes to five or six times its normal length.    There
can be no         doubt     that     this       effect    is due   to the   muscular     fibres of
the manubrium   having been previously kept in a state of tonic con
traction by means of a continuous ganglionic discharge from the margin.
Now physiologists are unanimous in regarding muscular tonus as a kind
of gentle tetamus due to a persistent ganglionic stimulation, and against
this opinion nothing can be said.    But, in accordance with the accepted
theory of ganglionic action, physiologists further suppose that the only
reason why some muscles are thrown into a state of tonus by ganglionic
stimulation, while other muscles are thrown into a state of rhythmic
action by the same means, is because the resistance to the passage of the
stimulation from the ganglion to the muscle is less in the former than
in the latter  case.  On the other hand, the new theory of ganglionic
action explains the difference by supposing a different degree of irrita
bility on the part of the muscles in the two cases ; for it will be remem
bered that in my experiments on paralyzed Aurelia, if the continuous
stimulation were of somewhat more than minimal intensity, tetanus was
the result, while     if    such stimulation              were but of minimal    intensity, the
                                                      I
result was rhythmic action. Now find in the case of Sarsia that the mus
cular tissue of the manubrium is more excitable than the muscular tissue
of the bell ; so that, for this and other reasons, the facts here accord more
closely with the exhaustion than with the resistance theory of ganglionic
action.   But, in conclusion,               I
                                  should like to say that as yet   regard the       I
former theory as of a merely provisional character, and that have pub                I

           (A) Reflex      action.   — The       occurrence of reflex action in the Medusa
isof  avery marked and unmistakable character.     For instance,   the                     if
manubrium of Sarsia or of Aurelia be irritated, the swimming-organ re
sponds to the irritation               by
                            giving one or more contractions;       the                     if
marginal ganglia be now removed, the swimming-organ no longer
responds even to the most violent irritation of the manubrium. Again, in

   activity of the latter, any part of the irritable surface of the swimming-
   organ be very gently touched, the resulting contractile wave does not
   start from the immediate seat of irritation, but from the ganglion which
   still remains in situ.
      (B) Nervous connexions in Sarsia. — When one of the four tentacles
  of Sarsia is very gently irritated, it alone contracts.      If the irritation be
  slightly stronger, all the four tentacles, and likewise the manubrium, con
  tract.    If one of the four tentacles be irritated still more strongly, the
  bell responds with one or more contractions.         In the latter case, if the
  specimen operated on be non-vigorous or partly anaesthesiated, it may
  be observed that a short interval elapses between the response of the
  tentacles and that of the bell.        Lastly, the manubrium is much more
  sensitive to a stimulus applied to a tentacle, or to one of the marginal
  bodies, than it is to a stimulus applied at any other part of the bell.
      These facts clearly point to the inference that nervous connexions
  unite the tentacles with one another and also with the- manubrium.           This
  inference agrees with the histological observations of Haeckel on Gery-
  onia, and with those of Schultz on Sarsia, as well as with the results of
  my own explorations        by stimuli already published.     But, to place the
 matter beyond doubt,       I tried the effect of introducing a minute radial
 cut between     each  pair of adjacent marginal bodies.     This operation,    as a
 rule,    completely destroyed the physiological connexions between the
 tentacles.
     But between the tentacles and the manubrium no such definite nervous
 tracts can be demonstrated        by section — that is to say, severance of all
 the four nutrient tubes,      in addition to the marginal incisions just men
 tioned, has no effect in destroying the physiological connexions between
 the tentacles and manubrium.          The nervous tracts in this case, therefore,
 appear to be more or less diffused in the form of a plexus over the sur
 face of the bell ; and that this is the case is further indicated by explo
 rations with graduated stimuli : for during such explorations it may
 very frequently be observed that the manubrium is more sensitive than the
 bell to stimuli applied to the latter ; and in such cases there is evidence
of the manubrium being more sensitive to irritation of certain tracts of
bell-tissue than to that of other tracts.       These excitable tracts, however,
are not constant as to their position in different individuals.

passage along their substance of what         I called " contractile waves."      I
must now introduce another term, viz. "physiological harmony," by
which     I mean such a condition of contractile tissues as admits of one
part responding to stimuli applied at another part, whether or not con
tractile waves are able to pass along the intervening parts. It will be
observed that the distinction between these terms has reference to the

 most fundamental quality wherein the function of nerve is distinguished
 from that of muscle — viz. the power of setting up responsive contrac
 tions at a distance from the seat of irritation. In my former paper           I
 described a number of experiments in section, which were devised in
 order to test the tolerance towards section of physiological continuity :
 similar experiments, having reference to the tolerance towards section of
 physiological harmony, are described in the present paper.         The experi
 ments just detailed in the foregoing paragraphs were really experiments
 of this kind ; but such experiments derive a special interest when con
 ducted on the general contractile sheet of swimming-organs.           They do
 so, because it will be remembered that the most interesting questions
 with which my previous paper was concerned were, first as to the presence
 of  a rudimentary nerve-plexus, and next as to the extent in which, if pre
 sent, it was differentiated from the muscular element.
    Now, as stated in my former paper, the contractile tissues of Sarsia
 will endure very severe forms of section without suffering loss of their
 physiological continuity ; but  I find that, as a rule, their tolerance is not
 nearly so great as regards maintenance of their physiological harmony ;
 for in general, though not invariably, the manubrium fails to respond to a
 stimulus applied to the bell if a cut of a millimetre or two in length
 intervenes between the base of the manubrium and the seat of irritation.
    § 2. Character of the Excitable Tissues of Aurelia.- — Widely different is
the case of Aurelw. As already stated, when a portion of the swimming-
organ of this animal is very gently irritated, a contractile wave does not
start from the point of irritation ; but the passage of a stimulus-wave
from that point is proved by the invariable discharge of a ganglion situ
ated at a distance from the latter.        It must now be added that the
passage of the stimulus-wave admits, in many cases, of being actually
 seen ; for it is a peculiarity of the innumerable tentacles which fringe
the margin of Aurelia, that they are more irritable than the neuro-n1us-
cular sheet of the swimming-organ.        Consequently a stimulus which is
too gentle to cause the latter to respond even when applied directly to
its own substance, nevertheless very often     causes a response on the part
of the former.     When this happens, the tentacles all the way along the
margin contract in succession, while the swimming-organ remains perfectly
motionless.    When this tentacular wave reaches a ganglion, it causes the
                            J
latter to discharge (after sec. or more for the latent period), and so to
give rise to a general contraction of the neuro-muscular sheet.      This most
beautiful expression of the passage of a wave of stimulation does not
occur in all, or even in most, specimens of Aurelia • and even in those
specimens where it does occur, it may be more readily started by stimu
lating some tracts of the neuro-muscular sheet than by stimulating other
tracts, although there is no constancy as to the position of these tracts in
different individuals.
    Now the severity of section which is required to cause blocking of these

tentacular waves varies in different                      casea ; but very             often the tolerance
of tentacular waves towards section is quite as remarkable as is that of
contractile waves described in my former paper.    Or, adopting our pre
vious terminology, section proves that in Aurelia aurita physiological
harmony is as difficult to destroy as is physiological continuity.  And
this fact  Iregard as the most noteworthy of all the facts to which the
present investigation has led —     indeed,     if,               it      is   not the moat startling and
significant that has yet been brought to light                            in the whole range of Inver

nenberg, that the functions of nerve and muscle are blended                                      in the same
cells, would seem to be conclusively shown by the additional facts, that in
some cases section blocks the stimulus-wave before    blocks the contrac              it

at the stage the inquiry has now reached there      no conceivable alterna     is

as inexplicable.
   Moreover this hypothesis    supported   is                        by
                                              the fact, that explorations                                     of
the swimming-organ of Aurelia with graduated stimuli reveals the pre

cannot here enter into particulars.   Lastly,      must be stated that we  it

naked-eyed Medusae stand midway between Sarsia and Aurelia in respect
 of the degree in which integration of their organs has proceeded and in                            ;

intermediate position, as we shall see while considering an interesting

brium of unusual proportional size.      I  have given to this animal the specific
          "
name of indicans," because of a highly interesting and important peculiarity
of function that is manifested by its manubrium.           This function consists
in the organ localizing, with the utmost precision, any point of irritation
which is situated in the bell. For instance, if any point in the irritable
surface of the bell be pricked with a needle, the massive manubrium moves
over towards that point, and applies its tapered extremity to the exact
spot where the prick has been inflicted. Now this apparent reflex action
is independent of the only ganglia that can be shown to occur in
the organism, — «. the pointing action of the manubrium
                    »'.                                           not at all inter
                                                                        is
fered with by removing the margin of the bell. Accordingly               removed
                                                                             I
the manubrium at its base, and found that by now irritating any part of
its own substance, the apex endeavoured to curve down towards the
seat of irritation.     Similarly, if  only  a portion of the manubrium were
removed, the pointing action of that portion resembled the pointing
action of the entire organ, while the stump that remained in, situ would
continue to move over as far as     it   could towards any point of irritation
situated in the bell. Hence there can be no doubt that every part of the
manubrium independently endowed with the capacity of localizing seat
               is                                                                a
of irritation either in its own substance or in that of the bell. And
in this we have           very remarkable fact
                          a                          for the localizing function
                                                      ;

which    is so very efficiently performed       the manubrium of this Medusa,
and which      if  any  thing  resembling      occurred   in the higher animala
would certainly have definite ganglionic centres for its structural cor
relative, is  here shared equally   by  every part of the exceedingly tenuous
contractile tissue that forms the outer surface of the organ. We have
thus in this case         general diffusion of ganglionic function, which
                          a                                                           is
coextensive with the contractile tissues of the organ.

                                                                             a
irritation in the bell may be completely destroyed by introducing                     a
short cut between the base of the manubrium and the seat of irritation
in the bell. The afferent connexions, therefore, on which this localizing
function depends are thus shown to be exclusively, or almost exclu
sively, radial. But although under these conditions the manubrium                no
                                                                                 is
longer able to localize the seat of irritation,       nevertheless continues able
                                                       it
to perceive, so to speak, that irritation         being applied somewhere for
                                                 is                              ;
every time the irritation     is applied, the manubrium actively dodges about
from one part of the bell to another, applying its extremity now at
this place and now at that one, as       if  searching in vain for the offending
body. This fact shows that after physiological harmony of                   higher

radial; or, perhaps still more correctly, that the stimulus escapes from
the severed to the unsevered radial connexions through the vicarious
action of the latter.       I therefore next tested the degree in which these
connexions might be cut without causing destruction of that physio
logical harmony of a lower order which it is their function to maintain.
I  found that this degree varied considerably in different specimens, but
that in no case did the physiological harmony continue after a spiral
section had been carried more than once round the circumference of the
nectocalyx.                                              I
                In these experiments, moreover, observed that the tracts
occupied by    the four radial tubes are tracts of comparatively high irrita
bility as regards the manubrium ; for the certainty and vigour with which
the random motions of the manubrium occur in response to irritation of
the part of a nutrient tube contained in a spiral strip, contrast
strongly with the uncertainty and feebleness with which these move
ments occur in response to irritation of any other part of such a strip.
Lastly, when a spiral section is carried only three fourths of the way
round the nectocalyx, so as to leave one of the four radial tubes intact,
I  observed that, on irritating any part of the strip, the manubrium usually
pointed to the single radial tube which still remained intact.                Now all
these facts together, as well as others which cannot be detailed in this
abstract, tend strongly in favour of the plexus theory — the radial tubes
being supposed here, as in the case of Sarsia, to coincide in their
course    with that of aggregations            of nervous  elements     analogous     to
nerve-trunks *.
   § 4. Character of       the Excitable    Tissues of Staurophora laciuiata. — In
my former paper        I   described certain spasmodic movements which are
performed by     Staurophora     laciniata.     The remarkable points concerning
these movements are, that they never occur except in response to stimu
lation, and that, in this particular species at any rate, they usually occur
only when either the margin of the nectocalyx or one of the four radial
tubes are stimulated    — stimulation of the general contractile tissue being
followed by an ordinary locomotor contraction.              Nevertheless stimula
tion of the general contractile tissue a couple of millimetres from the
 margin is followed by a local spasmodic contraction ; while if the
stimulus be applied within a single millimetre of the margin, the effect
is a general spasm. Cutting the whole nectocalyx of Staurophora laci
niata into a spiral strip does not in any degree prevent this spasmodic
action  ; for on irritating the marginal tissue at one end of the strip, a
 wave   of  spasmodic contraction passes along the entire strip.               Such a
 spasmodic wave has a much greater power of penetration than has an
 ordinary contractile wave ; for while the latter, in this species, may be
 very easily blocked by section, the former will continue to pass in spite
of the severest forms of section which it is possible to make. Now it
   * The plexus theory does not suppose any thing resembling nerTe-Cbres  to be present,
but merely tracta of functionally differentiated tissue.

 1877.]                 Locomotor System     of Medusa.                   483
is  a remarkable thing that the contractile tissues, although themselves
incapable of originating a spasm in response to irritation, are never
theless so wonderfully capable of conducting a spasm when this has
 been originated by irritation of the slender tissue tracts above named.
 It  is as though every fibre or cell of the general contractile tissues is
able to liberate energy in either of two very different ways ; and whenever
one part of the general mass is made to liberate its energy in one of
these two ways, all the other parts of the mass do the same, and
this no matter how far through the mass the liberating process may
have to extend.      Or, to employ a somewhat far-fetched but convenient
metaphor, we may compare the general contractile tissues of this Medusa
to a mass of gun-cotton, which responds to ignition (direct stimula
 tion) by burning with a quiet flame, but to detonation (marginal stimu
 lation) with an explosion.      Now to say that it is the ganglionic element
 of the margin or radial tubes which here acts as the detonator, is not
to explain the facts.        Doubtless it would be an interesting thing to
 know that a ganglion-cell may be able to originate two very different
kinds of impulse according as it liberates its energy spontaneously or
in answer to direct stimulation ; but this knowledge would merely serve
to transfer the questions which now apply to the marginal and radial
tube tissues in general to the ganglionic tissues in particular.       Again,
the supposition of the ganglia acting as detonators when themselves
directly irritated, would in nowise tend to explain why it is that the con
tractile tissues are capable of two such very different kinds of response.
    In conclusion,    I  may state that when a tonic spasm is being
slowly recovered from, one may often observe rhythmic locomotor con
tractions superimposed on the general spasmodic contraction.           Again,
anaesthetics block spasmodic waves ; but not till after they have sus
pended spontaneity,     and even destroyed muscular irritability as regards
direct stimulation.     Up to this stage the certainty and vigour of the
spasm is not perceptibly impaired ; but soon after this stage the inten
sity of the spasm begins to become less, and, later still, it assumes a local
character.     It is important also to notice that at this stage of anaesthe-
siation the effect of marginal irritation is very often that of producing
a general locomotor contraction, and sometimes a series of two or three
such.    During recovery in normal sea-water all these phases occur in
reverse order.
    § 5. Rate of transmission of Stimuli in Aurelia aurita.       (A) Contrac
tile  waves. — The  rate at which contractile waves traverse spiral strips of
Aurelia is variable.     It is largely determined by the length and width of
the strip. In the unmutilated animal the rate is from 18 to 20 inches
per second in water at 40° to 45°. Temperature exerts a wonderful
influence on the rate, as the following example will show : —

    Interdigitating cuts interposed in the path of the contractile wares
slow the rate of the latter considerably ; and submitting the uncut con
tractile tissue to slight strains has the same effect.                So likewise with
anaesthetics and a great variety of substances which have no anaesthetic
property, such, for instance, as strychnine, fresh water, &c. Lastly, it is
observable in a loug contractile strip that, after a rest of a minute or
more, the first wave that traverses it has a very slightly slower rate than
its successor, provided the latter follows the former after not too great an
interval of time. This fact is probably connected with the summation of
stimuli before explained.
    (B) Stimulm-waves. — The rate of transmission of tentacular wares
is only one half that of contractile waves, if the stimulation which starts
the former is so weak as not also to start the latter.            But if the stimulus
is strong enough to start both waves, the tentacular wave always keeps
an inch or two in advance of the contractile wave.

     § 1. Covered-eyed   Medusee.   — From    the fact that in the covered-eyed
Medusae the passage of a stimulus-wave is not more rapid than that of a
 contractile wave, we may be prepared to expect that in these animals the
 action of the locomotor ganglia is not, in any proper sense of the term,
 a coordinated action     ;  and this  I find to be the case.      For, as previously
 stated,  it may usually     be observed that one    or more of the lithocysts are
 either temporarily or permanently prepotent over the others — i. e. that
 contractile waves emanate from the prepotent lithocysts, and then spread
 rapidly over the swimming-organ.              Nevertheless in many cases such
 prepotency cannot, even with the greatest care, be observed ; but upon
 every contraction all parts of the swimming-organ               seem to contract at
 the same instant.      I   am inclined, however, to account for these cases of
 perfectly synchronous action by supposing that all, or most, of the gan
 glia require exactly the same time for their nutrition, and are of exactly
 equal potency in relation to the resistance (or excitability) of the sur
 rounding contractile tissues, and that, therefore, the balance of forces
 being exactly equal in the case of all, or most, of the ganglia, their rhythm,
 though perfectly identical, is really independent.

    § 2. Naked-eyed Medusa. — "With the naked-eyed Medusae the                       case     is
 more definite   for the mere fact of Sarsia being able to follow a moving
                  ;
  beam of light is in itself sufficient to prove coordination on the part of
 the locomotor centres *. From my previous observations on the physio
 logical   harmony             between the tentacles of Sarsia,
                          subsisting                             was led         I
 to expect that the coordination    of the locomotor ganglia is probably
 effected by means of the same tissue tracts through which the interten-
 tacular harmony is effected — viz. those situated in the margin of the
 bell.   Accordingly        I
                        introduced four short radial cuts, one midway
 between each pair of adjacent marginal bodies.  The coordination, how
 ever, was not perceptibly impaired.            I
                                         therefore continued the radial
 cuts, and found that when these reached to one half or two thirds of
 the way up the sides of the inner bell, or contractile sheet, the coordina
 tion became visibly affected, and this for the first time. These experi
 ments, however, did not satisfy me that the coordination was not chiefly, or
 exclusively, due to the marginal nerves; since, even if the coordination were
 destroyed by the short radial cuts, it might still appear to remain intact
 for the following reasons. Supposing the four quadrants to have their
 physiological harmony destroyed, and one of the quadrants to be slightly
 prepotent over the others, every time this quadrant of the margin dis
 charged, the other quadrants would immediately do the same           ; and as   t
 the bell of Sarsia is so small, and the  passage of contractile waves  in it so
 rapid, the mere presence of physiological continuity might, in the case where
 only very short radial cuts were introduced, give rise to the false appearance
 of coordinated or harmonious action.       Accordingly           I
                                                             tried the converse
 experiment of leaving the margin intact, and making four radial incisions
 from the apex towards the base of the cone.            I
                                                    found that these incisions
 might be carried quite down to the marginal canal without the synchro
 nous action of the four quadrants being impaired.       This proves that the
 marginal connexions are alone sufficient to maintain the coordinated
 action of the ganglia, and thus tends to substantiate                      the above   view
 concerning the results of the converse experiment.
   This view is still further confirmed by the results of the same                   experi
 ment in the     case of the Discophorous species of naked-eyed Medusae.
 In these species   the passage of contractile waves is not nearly so rapid
 as it is in the case of Sarsia ; and so in them it may be quite easily
 observed that the four short radial cuts in the margin have the effect
 of destroying the physiological harmony of the marginal ganglia*. Great
     * Removing the manubrium docs not interfere with this steering action ; but if any
  considerable portion of the margin be excised, the animal seems no longer able to find
  the beam of light.
     t Allusion is here made to the fact that when a contractile wave reaches a ganglion
  it causes the latter to discharge. See "Croonian Lecture," Phil. Trans. 1876, p. 311.

      As this abstract is already too long,      I will here only enumerate the
   poisons  I  have tried, without entering into the details of their action.      I
   may say,    however,   in general terms, that in almost every minute parti
  cular the effects of the various poisons     I  have hitherto tried are precisely
  identical in the case of the Medusae and in that of the higher animals.
  In my paper the effects of each of the following poisons are treated
   at length, viz. — chloroform, nitrite of amyl, caffein, strychnia, veratrium,
   digitalin, atropia, nicotin, alcohol, and cyanide of potassium. The details
  of this part of the inquiry are rendered particularly valuable from the
  fact that, in the case of Sarsia, we have the means of testing the com
  parative influence of any poison on the central, peripheral, and muscular
  systems respectively ; but it is needless on the present occasion to occupy
  space with a description of the methods — it being enough to say that the
  effects of the various poisons on these respective systems are uniformly
  such as occur in the case of the higher animals.         In one important par
  ticular, however, the actions of nearly all the above poisons on the Medusse
  differ from their actions on the higher animals ; for there is no poison in
  the above list which has the property, when applied to the Medusae, of
  destroying life till long after it has destroyed all the signs of irritabilitv.
  I  think this anomaly is to be explained by two considerations.             First,
  the Medusae present to the action of the central nerve-poisons no nerve-
 centres which are of vital importance to the organism ; and, consequently,
  such poisons are here at liberty, so to speak, to exert their full influence
 on all the excitable tissues, without having the course of their action
 interrupt«d by premature death of the organism.             Second, the method
 of administering the above-mentioned poisons to the Medusae was verv
 different from that which we employ when administering them to other
 animals ; for, in the case of the Medusae, the neuro-muscular            tissue is
 spread    out  in the  form  of an  exceedingly   tenuous  sheet,  so  that  when
 the animal is soaking in the poisoned water, every portion of the excitable
 tissue is equally exposed to its influence.           And that the action of a
 poison is greatly modified by such a difference in the mode of its ad
ministration, has recently been proved by Professor Gamgee, who found
that when a frog's muscle was allowed to soak in a solution of vanadium
&c. it lost its irritability, while this was not the case when the poison
was administered by means of the circulation.
     Fresh water acts as a deadly poison to the Medusae.               The naked-
eyed species usually cease their movements the instant they touch the
fresh water, and are killed by it, not, indeed, instantaneously as Agassis
supposed, but in the course of a few minutes.           The covered-eyed species

 1877.]            On some Phenomena connected with Vision.                       487
do not succumb quite so rapidly. The cause of this deadly influence
exerted by fresh water has been found to depend on the absence of the
 mineral constituents of sea-water, and not, as Agassiz also supposed,
 on the difference of density between the former and the latter. Chloride
 of sodium alone, dissolved in appropriate amount in fresh water, deprives
 the latter, to a great extent, of its deleterious influence ; but this is not
 the case with any other substance                I  have tried.   Brine acts as an
 anaesthetic, and, in respect of depriving the tentacles and manubrium of
their muscular tonus, exerts an influence the opposite of that which is
 exerted by fresh water.

                  1.   On the Physiological Effect of Eided Surfaces.
    Some months ago it occurred to me that an investigation of the rela
tion of the      shades produced by ruled surfaces (as in engravings) with
those produced by variations in the intensity of illumination (shadows)
would afford useful data in connexion with the physiological action of
light upon the retina.
    On examining        a number    of woodcuts and line-engravings       I found that
there are usually about nine different shades, which may be expressed by
the following fractions, which represent the ratio of black to white upon
                 —
the surface    :
                               013345678
                               8' 8'   8'  8'  8'  8'  8' 8' 8'
Such engravings, when seen at such a distance that every line makes a
distinct picture and can be separately perceived, exhibits a suff1ciently
gradual series of tints or shades passing regularly from white to black.
In   this case   I   assume that the intensity of the sensations produced by a
given    surface   is  directly as the number of retinal elements stimulated,
so long as the nature and intensity of the illumination remain constant.
   I next    endeavoured to determine the effect of variations in the intensity
of the stimulus in the following manner : —
   I   repeated Lambert's        well-known experiment, in which two candles
are placed at distances        D and D, from a screen, an opaque body being
interposed so that each        candle casts a shadow upon the screen, the light

being so arranged that each illuminates               the shadow      cast by the other.
I, however, added a woodcut, in which             I had previously      determined the
ratio of white and black in the shades by examining it with a microscope
and low-power objective.         This woodcut was so placed that it was illu
minated by the light from both candles ; by varying the distances of the
candles   I produced shadows of the same intensity as the shades in the
print, determining the intensity of the shadow by making it fall close to
the corresponding shade in the print without overlapping it. When the
two appeared continuous, viewed at such a distance that the ruled sur
face was still a ruled surface to the eye if attentively observed,                I  found
the proportion of the reserved white in the ruled surface varied as the
square root of the intensity to which the illumination of a wholly white
surface had to be reduced to match the other.
   I  found, for instance, in my first experiment, that when the candles
were    placed at the distances of two and four feet respectively, the
faintest shadow was somewhat brighter than that portion of the wood
cut in which     J was black and        i   white, and the darker was somewhat
darker than a half-black surface.
    Considering the light thrown on the screen by the nearer candle to
have the value of 100 units, that of the more removed gives 25 units.
The total illumination of the screen was, then, 125 units — that of the
darker shadow 25 units, and that of the brighter 100. The portions of
the screen, therefore, have the following ratios of illumination : —
                          100         :       80        :     20.
But the sensations produced             are nearly      equal to    those of    a   shaded
                              10          9      4*2*

                           10       :        9       :      4-2,
the square roots of the luminous intensities nearly.
    In every case    I  found the apparent illumination, measured by a re
ference to a ruled surface, varied inversely as the distance of the source
 of light.
    There is no difficulty in obtaining a very close approximation, as the
 eye easily detects a shadow differing by ^ of the whole light, as has
 been shown by Lambert, Arago, Helmholtz, and others.
    The experiments       made by the method indicated are vitiated to a
 certain extent by    the  difficulty of guarding against diffused light ; but
 when moderate precautions are taken a black surface differs in no per
 ceptible degree from the shadow cast by making the two shadows over
 lap, so that the diffused light may,        I  think, be neglected.

scope      I
         found the ruling had failed to give the proportion it should,
as    the lines           were        too    narrow,        and the engraver had removed the
centre of each line with                         a    diamond, so that, as accurately as could                          I

measurement               is   far the largest source of error.
     In    the second set         I          obtained              j^    and tqq as my results                  ;   and again I
found the ruling, which should have                                              been   \     black, was only, as nearly

sufficient to establish my law.
   In my earlier experiments     assumed that the number of retinal

is only the case when an accurate picture      made upon the retina of                  is
such     size that the lines and spaces fall on physiologically
          a                                                     distinct

always capable of being distinguished as lines by    mental act.                                  a
   Professor Stokes first pointed out to me the necessity of proving that
in my experiments such picture        actually formed, and of investigating

astigmatic eye appears lighter than when accurately focused ; and this
appears to be the case in surfaces of considerable extent, so that it could
not be due to the formation of a slightly larger picture. A distant news
paper scarcely differs in appearance from a corresponding sheet of white
paper, and two similar prints observed at suitable distances give dif
ferent tints ; the further one, when it no longer produces a distinct
picture of the individual line, appears lighter in tone. Still     I did not feel
quite satisfied until  I   succeeded in having the accompanying diagram
ruled for me.
    The squares a and 6, c and d have respectively      the same proportion of
black upon the surface : a and 6 are 5 black, c         and d half black.     At
suitable distances the following sensations result       : — So long as all the
lines are distinct there are four distinct shades     ;  6 and d appear darker
than a and c respectively.      When the diagram is seen at a distance of
from 15 to 20 feet, c and d become identical in shade and can no longer
be separated, but b  still appears much darker than a. At a still greater
distance there are but two shades ; and these remain distinct so long as
the diagram can be distinguished : the illumination is really different ; and
no distance makes the sensation the same.
 2.  On the Time required   to Produce or Obliterate an Image on the Retina.
    Much difference of opinion exists on this point, and many contra
dictorv statements have been made by the first authorities.         Schafhaiitl *
                             * Munch. Abh. \ii.  465.

1877.]                 Phenomena connected with Vision.                         491
states     that  the  time which elapses between intermittent luminous
impressions      without   producing discontinuity of sensation varies as the
square root of their luminous intensities ; but Helmholtz seems to regard
the statement as doubtful *.
    Herman says that the time required to perceive an impression varies
in arithmetical progression when the intensity of the stimulus increases
in geometrical progression, but does not give his authority. M. Del-
boeuf t, making experiments with revolving disks, neglected the rate of
rotation, and states that no difference occurs in the results whether it is
rapid or comparatively slow.
    I  made a series of experiments with revolving disks similar to those
made by MM. Delboeuf and Plateau.               A white card disk, 6 inches in
diameter, is set into rapid rotation by clockwork.           A portion of a sector
of the disk is blackened, so that a grey ring appears during rotation : by
reducing the breadth of this sector until the ring was no longer visible,
and making the experiment by artificial light,           I found that the breadth
of the sector at the time of disappearance varies as the distance of the
source of light, and that by varying the rate of rotation in the inverse
ratio of the distance of the light the ring remains just invisible.
    I  find that a disk with a portion of a sector, occupying ^^ of its
circumference, blackened, gives no grey ring with a single candle to
illuminate it 10 feet from it when it revolves from 5 to 6 times in a
second, but by halving the distance of the candle it must revolve from
10 to 12 times in a second before the ring entirely disappears.                   A
white sector on a black disk obeys the same law, but must occupy only
-frfffQ of the circumference
                                 of the disk with the same illumination.
    I  have concluded that when the grey ring ceases to appear the rotation
is sufficiently rapid to cause the sector to occupy the same space for too
short a time for it to be seen.         With a dull light a white streak on a
black surface must occupy the same position for about 50100 of a second
to be seen at all ; but the time varies inversely as the square root of the
illumination. A black spot upon a white ground must rotate much
more slowly to be seen.         In this case we have to deal with the duration
of an exceedingly faint after image — that of the white surface — during
the passage of the black spot. The rate of rotation necessary to
obliterate    the effect of the black spot varies also inversely as the distance
of the illuminating source.
         3. On the Relation of the foregoing Observations     to Fechner's law.
    A   very simple modification of Fechner's convention with regard to
sensations and their relation to stimuli will make the foregoing observa
tions accord entirely with his law, and would further change the arbitrary
measure of sensation in Fechner's formula into an equivalent measure of
                              * Helmholtz, Phys. Optiquo.

492            Mr. G. F. Dowdeswell         on the Changes   of      [Jan.  18,
physical nerve change, so that the expression would become a physio
logical instead of a psychical one.
   Fechner regards the liminal intensity of an increment of sensation as
an invariable  unit, whilst, as is clearly shown, the liminal increment of
the stimulus varies as a function of the stimulus already existing.        This
is an entirely arbitrary convention.     If  we regard the value of the liminal
increment    of sensation   as a variable    depending   for its value on   the
already existing sensation, we may take
                   2K
                       f^
instead of Fechner'  s expression

                                —  =
 where x represents the stimulus and S the sensation.
   This relation is further borne out by the beautiful experiments of Mr.
Dewar and Dr. McKendrick, which show that the electric variation in
the natural current of the eye varies as the square root of the intensity
of the stimulus ; although those authors have attempted to make their
results accord with Fechner's formula, they have only done so by the
erroneous use of one of M. Delboeuf s constants, which gives a very wide
range of arbitrary adjustment.

1877.]          the Cornea    in the Process of Inflammation.             493
observers have alleged that proliferation of the fixed corpuscles of that
tissue also occurs ; in other words, that the so-termed leucocytes are
not entirely immigrant, but that some of them are formed in the inflamed
tissues.   It is  stated by those who take this view of the process, that in
a few hours after the establishment     of inflammation the fixed corpuscles
begin to alter, that their processes are partially retracted and thickened,
their outline becoming more distinct, and that at a later period small
spherical bodies appear in their substance by a process of endogenous
cell-formation; that with the progress of inflammation these changes
increase, the corpuscles losing their stellate form, and assuming the cha
racter of endogenous mother-cells which divide by fission.
    These observations have all apparently been made upon corneas
excised and examined in serum or other fluid, or upon lamina) of corneas
prepared by the gold method.
    Cohnheim and others have denied that the changes are objective, and
attribute   all the appearances to an active immigration of leucocytes.
A   principal objection to this conclusion has been founded on the grounds
that the observations commenced too late, when the asserted changes had
already occurred.
    In  the ordinary methods of preparation, the appearances presented
during the second and third day of the inflammation are such as might
readily be conceived to arise from proliferation of the elements of the
tissue ; and it is unquestionably matter of great difficulty to determine
with certainty whether this does occur or not. The purpose of the pre
sent note is to describe a mode of investigating these appearances, by the
employment of which satisfactory evidence may be obtained that the
process essentially consists in the penetration of colourless corpuscles
(migratory cells), in a state of active cell-division, into the cell-spaces of
the cornea, where they overlie and obscure the cornea-cells in such a
way that, in preparations made by the usual methods, they appear to be
incorporated with them.        If, however, a method is employed by which
the ground-substance      can be destroyed (as, e.g., by potash) and the cor
puscles separated by teasing, it is shown that they are perfectly unaltered,
the migratory or wander cells only undergoing cell-division ; so that it
is by the presence of the latter alone that the difference between a nor
mal and an inflamed cornea can be recognized.
    The appearances presented by these corpuscles in corneas prepared by
the ordinary methods, when supposed to be undergoing proliferation,
have been so often described and figured that they need not be further
referred to here.
    Methods adopted in these experiments. — Inflammation was induced
either by touching the surface with a fine point of nitrate of silver in
the usual way (in which case the ensuing process arrives at its height in
about 48 hours, and then gradually subsides, so that by the fourth or
fifth day its effects have disappeared) or (when it was desired that the

494           Mr. G. F.      Dowdeswell on the Changes           of      [Jan.  18,
process should be of longer duration) by a seton of silk thread. The
animal having been killed at the proper period, and its cornea excised
and immersed in half per cent, solution of gold chloride for 60 minutes,
and exposed in a light warm place, when sufficiently coloured a small
portion of the inflamed part is placed in a solution of potash till the
ground-substance     is completely dissolved.       Care is requisite to hit off
the exact point for this, a few minutes too much or too little rendering
the preparation useless.      If  the time of exposure is too short, obviously
the ground-substance is not wholly dissolved, and nothing is seen ; if it
is too long, the potash begins to act upon the protoplasm, and the cor
puscles cannot be separated nor distinguished.           It was found that, if the
cornea was put into a 20 per cent, solution           of pure potash cold, and
then subjected to a temperature of 40° C., 50 minutes was the proper
time required for the action of the potash.
    When suff1ciently acted upon, the cornea is transferred to slightly
acidulated water, to stop any further action of the potash, then placed on.
a slide, if necessary teased out lightly, and preserved in glycerine.
    In a preparation   made by the above methods a number of migratory
cells will be apparent under the microscope, some of which are entangled
amongst the processes of the fixed corpuscles.          All these are in a state of
active cell-division and assuming diversified forms, but are very readily
distinguished from the fixed corpuscles by their being devoid of processes,
of somewhat darker colour, and by their presenting a more opaque and
 solid appearance*.     The fixed corpuscles, with their processes, show no
alteration whatever. As may be seen from the figures (Plate 10. group II.),
the processes radiate from the bodies in a natural and symmetrical manner,
and the ramifications are as perfect as ever. This would certainly not be so
 if segmentation had occurred ; for in that case one side at least of each
 newly divided corpuscle would be devoid of processes. Nothiug ap
 proaching to such a condition is ever seen.       In inflamed preparations, as
 in normal ones, fixed corpuscles are occasionally met with containing two
 nuclei or a double nucleus ; but this appearance is not often seen, and
 not more frequently in later than in earlier stages.
    In conclusion it may be stated that in the whole number of successful
 preparations of corneas which have been examined (amounting to upwards
 of twenty), no single instance has occurred in which any distinct ap
pearance of segmentation can be made out.              The most careful scrutiny
of the preparations fails to detect any difference whatever, as regards
their forms or aspects, between the fixed corpuscles of inflamed corneas
and those of normal corneas prepared in a similar way; nor would
it be possible to distinguish preparations of the two classes from each
other, were it not for the presence of migratory cells in the inflamed
structure.

  I.  The two following propositions are included under the law that
the effects of simultaneous electromotive forces are superposable.
   (a) If two jars be made of the same glass but of different thicknesses,
if they be charged to the same potential for equal times, discharged for
equal times, and then insulated, the residual charge will after equal times
have the same potential in each.
   (6) Eesidual charge is proportional to exciting charge.
   These propositions are verified experimentally within the limits of
errors of observation.
   II. Electric displacement through a dielectric may be supposed to
depend not only on the electromotive force at the instant, but also in
part on the electromotive forces at all previous times.      If we assume
that the effect of the electromotive force at any previous time decreases
according to some law as the time elapsed increases, and that these effects
are superposable, we may write

   Summary. — The experiments appear to verify the fundamental hypo
thesis, viz. that the effects on a dielectric of past and present electro
motive forces are superposable.            Ohm's law asserts the principle of
superposition in bodies in which conduction is not complicated by residual
charge.      Conduction and residual charge may be treated as parts of the
same phenomenon, an after effect as regards electric displacement, of
electromotive force.       The experiments appear to show that the principle
of Ohm's law is true of the whole phenomenon of conduction through
glass.

      Liquids falling vertically on a Horizontal Plate."              By
      A. M.     Worthington.          Communicated    by B. Stewart,
      F.R.S.     Received December 28, 1876.
   In  a previous  paper* which    I had the honour of submitting to the
Society, a method was described by which the later stages  of the oscilla
tion had been seen.        I  wish now to supplement that paper with an
account  of the  earlier  stages. The experiments of the sequel were, by
the kind permission of Professor Balfour Stewart, made this autumn in
the Physical Laboratory at Owens College.
   The arrangement that was found most successful for seeing the earlier

   1877.]            Forms assumed by D,"ops      of Liquids.                499
  stages was one by which the support was withdrawn from under a drop,
  so as to leave it free to fall, while at the same instant an electrical circuit
  was broken.
     The apparatus is drawn in the accompanying fig. 1 .
      A B is a wooden rod about 6 inches long, turning about a horizontal
  axis C C. When the rod is horizontal, a platinum wire D D, bound to
  the underside, rests with one end on a platinum wire E E E, forming a
  bridge, while the other end dips into a mercury-trough F, so that, with
  the rod in this position, a current can pass from E to F, and so on
  through the coils of the electromagnet of the relay described in my pre
  vious paper.
     The end B of the rod bears a little glass cup G- made of the central
  part of a watch-glass, covered with an adherent coating of smoke, ob
  tained by dipping the glass in paraffin-oil before smoking, on to which a
 drop of water or mercury can be lowered from the vertical tube H, so as
 to lie in the cup without adhering to it. A smart fillip with the thumb
  knocks up the end A, and sends down the end B with the cup, thus
 removing the support of the drop, and, of course, at the same time break
 ing the contact between D and E. K K is a wooden support bearing a
 slip of card   L, which acts as a spring-catch, and prevents the rod from
 rebounding.     The relay, described ia the last paper, is then adjusted, so
 that the primary spark of the Euhmkorff's coil is obtained, and the drop
 seen by it at any stage desired, whether in the air above the plate, at the
 moment of impact, or later.
     A few precautions are necessary.
     The cup G must be smoked even with mercury, as that liquid adheres
 slightly to glass, but not perceptibly to a smoked surface. With water
 or milk it requires frequent resmoking.
     With a very large drop a cup of much deeper concavity must be used,
 otherwise the drop lies flattened out on the cup ; and when the support
is removed, efficiency is given to the curvature at the sides, by the ten
 sion of which the lower part of the drop is driven downwards into a
column, which splits into two or more drops.
     I was also able to see the early stages with mercury by fixing the two
terminal wires of the electromagnet-current         close under the end' of a
 vertical tube, from which the drops were allowed to fall directly on to
 the plate.    The convex end of the liquid, just before the drop fell, joined
the two terminals and allowed the current to pass, and when the drop
fell contact was broken.
    But the time of the spark was not quite so constant as in the method
just described, nor was the plan applicable to water, the conductivity of
which, even when strongly acidulated, was too slight.
    I  noticed that, even when the spring of the relay was at its maximum
tension, and the point of the relay-wire only just in contact with the
mercury, the earliest spark that could be obtained showed that the drop

had already fallen about 20 millims.    This explains the failure of the
method described in my previous paper to show the earliest stages.

     78 millims.
   I will  speak  of variations afterwards.
Pig.  1.  Bays, too numerous to allow of an estimate of their number, shoot out from the
            point of contact.   The inner ends of these join, forming a continuous sheet
            of liquid, in which the upper part of the drop may be seen reflected.
Fig. 2. The liquid flows from above, over the rays, which shoot out still further.
Fig. 3. Main rays are seen, apparently symmetrically disposed about the centre, and
            connected    by a thinner sheet of either continuous liquid or very fine rays.
            Very often drops split off from the ends of the main rays, and were left on
            the plate in a more or less complete circle.  The number of these seemed to
            have been in most cases 24.      Often there was no doubt of this, and some
            times there may have been 21 and 28.     I have accordingly drawn the figure
            with 24 rays.
Fig. 4. The rays, having reached their maximum spread, are overtaken by the liquid,
            which rises in a conver ring and overflows them.
Fig. 5 shows the beginning of a transition from 24 rays to 12 arms. The liqu1d flows
            up and joins the rays in pairs.
Fig. 6 shows a later stage of the transition.
Fig. 7 shows the drop with 12 arms just beginning.

    The stages later than this were described in my previous paper.

Fig.    is a variation of fig. 2, Set 1, the rays being rather fewer and lobed at the ends.
           This was only seen once, and then no drops split off to be left on the plate.
Fig. . This is inserted here as a variation of fig. 4, Set 1, viewed from above, though
           it was really seen with a greater height of fall (205 millims.).        There is a
           slight convexity at the edge, and the rays are only visible there.
Fig. 8 is a variation of fig. 7, Set 1, where the figure had, as near a* could be
                                 '
           estimated,   8 lobes.

 Sit 3 shows    two early stages seen with a drop of milk 422 millims. in diameter
                  falling from a height of 30 millims. on to smoked glass.
    The early       stages     with milk (or, what was rather less convenient,
 water coloured white with finely powdered flint) did not differ markedly
 from those of mercury.
    By increasing the height of fall to 130 millims. the number of rays as
 indicated by the drops left on the plate was increased to 27, and with a
 height of fall of 270 millims. the number became 48, or sometimes some
 where about 60, the drops being smaller.
    By increasing the size of the drop the number of rays was increased
 also.     Thus with a drop of four times the cubical contents of those
 mentioned, and falling from a height of 78 millims., the number of drops
 left on the plate was often 36, and the drops were larger, and, indeed,
 the whole phenomenon was on a larger scale.

  In counting the drops on the plate, judgment is required in distinguish
ing drops that have split off the rays from those that have split off later
from the arms. Often the arrangement on the plate is so confused that
no estimate can be made ; at other times great regularity of the arrange
ment gives a probability almost amounting to certainty to the estimate.
   The number of arms, as in fig. 8, Set 1, was estimated by judging of
the angle between alternate arms. The estimate was sometimes con
firmed     by drops splitting off the arms and being left on the plate, as in
the    case of the rays. Thus          I
                                    am pretty certain that, with a height of
fall   of 270 millims., the number of arms was often 18.
   I   may mention that       Ihave obtained "patterns" on thinly smoked
glass, made by drops of oil and mercury falling in an approximate
vacuum of a pressure of 20 millims. of mercury.      The marks thus ob
tained differ from those made in air, the central spot of lampblack being
smaller in the case of air.           For low heights of fall the difference is not
perceptible, but it becomes           very marked as the height is increased from
100 to 500 millims.
  With a liquid which         wets the surface on which           it falls (as, for in
stance, milk on glass)    I
                          find that the earliest stages are very similar to
the first two of Set 1 ; but no well-marked main rays are seen, as in fig. 3.
The annular ridge of fig. 4 is seen to overflow the slightly protruding
rays, and form a figure like number 7, with slight undulations which do
not afterwards increase into arms.
   It    is, think, worthy of remark that in the case of mercury on
             I
smoked glass, where the adhesion      least, the main ridges appear early
                                             is
before the drop    much spread out.

        Organic Infusions."  By JOHN TYNDALL, F.R.S. Received

       beg leave to submit to the                brief preliminary note of

the results obtained in the further prosecution of my researches " On the
Optical Deportment of the Atmosphere, with reference to Putrefaction
and Infection."
   The very remarkable experiments of Dr. Eoberts, of Manchester, which
have been confirmed     by
                        Professor Cohn, of Breslau, have been both verified
and contradicted by my recent researches.   In some cases alkalized hay-
infusions have been completely sterilized            by
                                             boiling for five minutes, in
other cases they have withstood the boiling temperature for    far longer a
period.

504              Prof.   J.   Tyndall on the Development   of           [Jan.   18,
   Pursuing with scrupulous exactness the method of experiment devised
by Dr. Roberts, and in part followed by Professor Cohn,       Ihave found in
other infusions than hay an enormous resistance to sterilization.            A
single conspicuous example will serve as an illustration.         Cucumber-
infusion has been subjected, for intervals varying from   five minutes  to five
hours and a half, to the boiling temperature without losing its power of
developing life. Two days' exposure to a temperature of 90° Fahr., sub
sequent to this treatment, sufficed to develop in it swarms of Bacteria.
   The infusion which thus withstood, in one of Dr. Roberts's " plugged
bulbs," the temperature of boiling water for 330 minutes, was completely
sterilized in three minutes by boiling it in a small flask with a narrow
neck, and hermetically sealing the flask during ebullition.     In the case of
the  "  plugged bulbs
                      "
                        the observed resistance was due, not to the germs
of the infusion, but to those diffused in the air above it.
    I have also pursued my experiments with closed chambers, from which
the floating matter was removed by self-subsidence.     With certain new
infusions introduced into this inquiry failure after failure occurred, two
or three days generally sufficing to fill the boiled and protected liquids
with Bacterial life.    The vegetable infusions usually became turbid
throughout ;  but a characteristic feature of the life developed in all infu
sions during the last three months was the formation upon their surfaces
of a thick and deeply pitted fatty scum.       Precautions far greater than
those found successful a year ago failed to protect these infusions from
contamination.
    Iresorted to the mode of calcination by an incandescent             platinum
wire, applied with such uniform success in my last inquiry.             The wire
was brought close to its point of fusion, the period of incandescence was
doubled, and extraordinary care was taken to ward off infection by a ring
of cotton- wool. The care proved nugatory; for, in despite of     it,
                                                                 swarming
life appeared in the infusions afterwards.
I    tried to reproduce the results with animal infusions obtained with
such ease and certainty   a year ago.  Some of these old infusions, highly
concentrated by evaporation, remain with me to the present hour         they
                                                                          ;
are as clear as distilled water.   But in my recent experiments, where
the care bestowed far exceeded that found necessary in my last inquiry,
the animal infusions, like the vegetable ones, fell, for the most part, into
putrefaction.
    With hermetically sealed flasks, properly boiled and  sealed with due
care     would emphasize this condition), there was no difficulty in steri
        (I
lizing any of the animal infusions.
    By the scrupulous removal of every possible source of contamination
I  was able finally to maintain some of the most refractory of the liquids
operated on perfectly pellucid, in closed chambers from which the floating
dust had disappeared     by
                      self-subsidence.
  It to be noted that the earliest experiments
        is                                             of this inquiry were

quite in harmony with all the results of the former one, and that it was
only as time advanced that the singular discordance between recent and
former results showed itself in any marked degree. What was the cause
of this discordance?
     The question is to be answered by reference to the experiments with hay-
 infusions, which were begun early and were multiplied and varied later on.
 By practice such a mastery over these infusions was at length attained
 that, though the same method of experiment was undeviatingly pursued,
 I  could contradict or corroborate, at will, the observations of Dr. Eoberts
 and Professor Cohn.
     On analyzing these apparently irreconcilable results, it was found that,
 in almost every case where five minutes' boiling sufficed to sterilize alka
lized hay-infusion, the hay employed was mown in 1876, while in almost
 every case where the greater resistance to sterilization       was shown, the
 hay was mown either in 1875 or some previous year.              The hay found
 most difficult to sterilize was from Colchester, and it was five years old.
     To the drying and hardening of the germs of the old hay by time             I
  ascribe this singular result.
     An experiment on artificially dried      peas, as compared    with the same
  peas  undried, is not without instruction.      After boiling for an hour or
  BO, the undried peas became tasteless, while the dried ones retained a con
  siderable amount of flavour.       After a couple of hours' boiling the undried
  peas rendered the water     in which they were immersed thickly turbid, the
  liquid surrounding the dried peas remaining at the same time perfectly
  clear. The dried peas were rendered soft, but many of the green peas
  were reduced by two hours' boiling to a mere pulp, the mixture of which
  with the water rendered it muddy.
     The comparative tastelessness of the undried peas proved that their
  juices, which are an essential factor of their individuality, and probably
  also of their power of germination, had diffused into the surrounding
  water.    On the other hand, the clearness of the water which embraced
  the dried peas indicated a restriction of the exchange of matter between
  the peas and the medium in which they were immersed.           The experiment
  threw light upon    the  fact that  even  with four or five hours' digesting, it
  was impossible to make the specific gravity of the samples of my oldest
  hay sensibly greater than that of water.       The dryness and induration of
  the old hay thus indicated being shared by the germs attached to the hay,
  endowed them,     I doubt not, with their greater power of resistance.
      Experiments have also been made with new hay dried artificially at
  temperatures varying from 140° to 185° Fahr., an account of which shall
  be communicated in due time to the Eoyal Society.
      The different samples of hay employed in this investigation were intro
   duced in succession into the laboratory of the Eoyal Institution, and they
   ended by rendering the atmosphere of the place so virulently infective
  that precautions which, under ordinary circumstances, were more than

 sufficient to secure perfect immunity from external contamination, were
 found utterly ineffectual.
    Thanks to the friendly action of the President of the Royal Society,      I
 was enabled to escape from this atmosphere to a purer air.             I had a
 series of tin chambers constructed, which were not permitted to enter
 the Royal Institution at all, but were taken straight from the tinman to
 Kew Gardens.        They were mounted in the excellent laboratory recently
 erected there by the munificence of Mr. Jodrell. In this new position
 the insuperable     difficulties encountered in London disappeared, and the
 experiments    followed    the course of those described in my last investiga
 tion. Two of the chambers gave way; but on being scrutinized they
were found leaky.          Five sound chambers, on the contrary, remained
perfectly intact, and they embraced the particular substances which had
given me so much trouble in London.           Infusions exposed to the common
air at Kew became rapidly rotten.

Royal Society.                                         I

             1. Mean Directions and Distr1bution    of the Isobaric Lines.
    In    considering atmospheric variations, it is always desirable to know,
if possible, the mean values about which the others fluctuate : this ap
pears to be especially the case with reference to the direction of the
 lines of mean barometric pressure and of the atmospheric currents.            If
any common law exist connecting the statical and dynamical pressure of
 the air, this will probably show itself with some precision by an investi
gation in which, all the cases (the: observations of every day) being included,
 deviations from the law may be expected to neutralize each other, and
 the final results give absolute measures directly comparable with each
other.
    For any exact determination of the lines of equal barometric pressure
 it  is essential to possess observations   from stations whose heights above
 the mean sea-level are accurately known, and made with good instruments
which have been compared directly or indirectly with each other.           These
 conditions are well satisfied by the observations made at the Greenwich,
 Dublin, and Makerstoun Observatories in the eight years 1842 to 1849
 (both inclusive).      The barometers were all by the same maker, each
 having a tube of nearly 0'6 inch internal diameter ; they were all com
 pared directly or indirectly with the Eoval Society's standard; and the
 heights of the cisterns were determined by levelling from the sea in each
 case.      Under such circumstances the directions and intervals of the
 isobaric lines may be found with much more precision than from obser
 vations made at any number of stations where those conditions are not
 fulfilled.
    In    the following investigation  I  shall assume that, within the limits
 of the three stations, the mean directions of the isobars for each month,

   Although we may assume, when observations for a considerable period
of time are considered, that the isobars over the small space about the
three stations may be represented by parallel straight lines, yet this
assumption becomes           less probable when the observations for single
months are employed ; since in these occasional cyclones may produce
considerable irregularities.          I    have thought it desirable, however, to
calculate the values of 6 for each month by equation (4), in order to ob
tain some approximation to the probable errors of the directions deduced
from the whole eight years' observations.                 The values of 6 are given in
the following Table.

     Variations of Yearly Means. — The yearly                mean barometric            pressure
 does not seem       to vary according to any law (see last line of Table I.).
 The greatest pressure at all the stations occurred in 1842, and the next

1877.]              the      Lines of equal Barometric Pressure.                                                                              519
highest in 1847 and 1849, the least pressure being in 1848. There is,
however, an appearance of systematic change in the yearly mean values
of (3P /32, and of 0, which may be noticed on account of its partial coinci
dence with the decennial period of sun-spots and magnetic variations.
   The differences of pressure shown by the isobars passing through the
three stations was least in 1844, and greatest in 1847-48*. It does not
follow, however, that the tenth-inch isobars were really further separate
in 1844 than in 1847-48, since this depends also on the perpendicular
distance between the isobars, or on the angle 6 which they make with
the meridian ; thus we find the perpendicular       distances of the tenth-
inch isobars in geographical miles in the different years to be as follows : —
     1842.          1843.         1844.             1845.                 1846.               1847.                 1848.           1849.
      218            273              317            242                   273                 206                   281                330
   Thus the isobars were furthest separate in 1844 and 1849, and nearest
in 1842 [and 1845. The regular variation of #, and       was thus chiefly                                           /3a
due to the inclination of the isobars to the meridian.    Prom the last
line of Table IV. we see that the isobars were from 10° north of west
(W. by N. nearly) in 1844, and from 19° south of west (W.8.W. nearly)
in 1848. Though there         coincidence in these epochs with those of

     Annual Variation of Barometric Pressure in England. — In the discus
sion of the Makerstoun observations of barometric height for the years
 1842—19      I   sought to detennino this law, and found that the greatest
 pressures    occurred     in the months from May to September (both inclusive),
 while the least occurred in October and November ; the probable errors
 of the monthly means were, however, found to                  be too considerable           to
 give much value . to the secondary variations which were shown in the
 monthly mean values.               The mean for the six months April to Sep
 tember was one tenth of an inch greater than that for the six winter
 months*.        Yery similar conclusions were arrived at by Dr. Lloyd, in
 his discussion      of the Dublin observations         for 1S40 to ISoO, both as
regards the epochs of maximum and minimum pressure, as well as of
the probable error (or divergence) of the monthly meanst.                        Somewhat
similar conclusions may be deduced for Greenwich from the second
column of Table V., the maximum in December being slightly more
marked than at Makerstoun and Dubliu.
     If the isobars made the same angle with the meridian in all the months
of the year, and kept at the same interval, the annual variations would
be the same at all the stations.             This, however, it will be seen, is not
the case, and the annual variation of barometric pressure for any place
is a compound residt.
    I  have sought to determine the annual            law for the centre of gravity
of the three stations (a point         a little to the east of Liverpool) as derived
from the monthly means, reduced to the sea-level, for the three places ;
these are given below.

    The probable errors are least for the four months of June to Sep
tember, and greatest in the months of December and February.                               The
probable errors are much diminished if wo determine the means for
groups of months in each year. Thus we find : —

   The probable errors are here sufficiently small, when compared with
 the variations from group to group, to allow us to conclude that we
have obtained a considerable approximation to the law of change for the
centre of England.     It is not a little remarkable that the greatest
monthly mean pressure (that for September) is followed immediately by
the least, the probable errors leaving no doubt as to this fact*, the
difference of pressure from September to October-November being
0-173 inch.    It is not improbable that the pressure in December is
greater than in the months immediately following ; but a longer series of
observations is required to determine that question, since the probable
error for the month is very large.

53° 24' N. and 2° 48' W. of Greenwich is

   * The probable errors    given above and in Table V. have been obtained in the same
way as for the observations of a constant quantity.     There can be no doubt, however,
that tbe conditions are not strictly the same in the two cases. In the case of devia
tions of observations    of magnetic declination from the mean,          have shown, in the
                                                                         I
Materstouu Observations for 1844 (Trans. Roy. Soc. Edinb. vol. xviii. p. 351), that
they did not satisfy the hypothesis of positive and negative distribution employed in
the calculus of probabilities for the probable error. This            also true for various
                                                                         ia
meteorological phenomena. A consideration of the differences of the monthly mean
barometric height has ind uced me to believe that the formula for the probable error
gives such an approximation to the probable deviation of .any determination that           it
may be accepted as relative measure of the exactness of the result. It will be obvious
                            a
also that these differences cannot be called errors       they are due to a law.

     thus appears that the difference of pressure for 100 miles is greatest

   From the seventh column of Table V.                             it   appears that the isobars         run
most           from south of west in December (nearly from S.W.) and in
May           (S.W.     by

 only least  numerous,     but  probably   least  exact.    Mr. Buchan's charts show May to be
 the month of widest distribution for the northern hemisphere, as has been found here
 for England.

the directions        for February and March.           I shall   return to the results
for April and May in the next part of this paper.
     The directions here obtained from eight years' observations, made
under the most unexceptionable circumstances in three observatories,
will probably not be improved for some time*. On this account                        I have
thought it desirable to project the isobaric lines on small charts, so as to
show at a glance their general direction and distribution (see Plate 12).
 The results for the whole year have so small probable errors that                   I have
 projected      them    on  a larger  scalet (see  Plate  11).
      It should be here remarked that there is no ground as yet for affirm
 ing that the mean direction and distribution of the isobars for any series
 of years will be the same as for any following series; and the best
 determination that can be obtained for any given time may be of the
 greatest importance for comparison with another of equal value at a
 later period for the answer to this question.
    2. Relation of     the  Direction and Interval of the Isobars        to the   Direction
                                   and Force of the Wind.
      These relations       have been hitherto studied        chiefly with reference to
 cases of strong winds or storms.              The conclusions have been obtained
 directly from the projections on charts of the isobaric lines and wind-
  directions on particular days.           In the following part of this paper, as in
  the preceding, the results are sought from the observations made on
  every day throughout the series of years employed ; they may therefore
  servo as a base for the study of particular cases.
      * I have sought to obtain some confirmation for the directions of the isobars in
  Great Britain from the numerous observations mode in 1857 to 1867, employed by Mr.
  Buchan in the formation of his charts.       Mr. Buchan's object in the construction of
  these charts appears to have been to obtain the best possible approximation to the
 broad features of the distribution of the isobars for the whole e.irth ; and he has
  exercised his judgment in employing the mass of observations which he was able to
  collect (Edinb. Trans, vol. xxv. pp. 575, 576).       My examination of these for the
  months of April and May, in which the mean change of pressure for a distance of 100
  miles is only a few thousandths of an inch of mercury, has shown the difficulty of
  deducing from them any accurate determination, euch as is here attempted, for a small
  epace like England.
      t These charts are not projections, and were devised by me for another investiga
  tion, for which the true areas on the sphere were required ; they are, however, probably
   not new.    The following will give the most simple idea of their construction.      If we
   suppose the surface of a globe to be built up of series of rings of cylindrical wires laid
   on the parallels of latitude, and cut out the wires covering any part of the surface, then
   if these be laid out touching each other on a plane surface, in straight lines perpendi
   cular to a central or principal meridian, the external meridians will be curves of sines
   (straight lines for 20° squares on the scale of the chart for the year). The distances of
   any point perpendicularly to a circle of latitude and to the principal meridian are
   the true lengths of the arcs in latitude and longitude from these circles. For small
   spaces the distortion is inconsiderable. In the charts here given the principal meridian,
   that of Greenwich, is not in the middle, the direction of the iaobaric lines having been
   referred to that meridian.

524               Mr.   J.  A. Broun    on the Directions        cjc. of       [Feb.   1,
    Directions and Force of the Wind. — In most meteorological investiga
tions, and especially in those connected with climate, it is essential to
obtain the force and frequency of the winds for each point of the com
pass. It has been usual, however, in many researches to determine the
resultant direction and force for given periods by the known law of the
composition of forces.         It is quite possible that this resultant may be in
a direction from which no wind ever blows, but it does not the less re
present what all the other winds would have been equivalent to, both in
direction and force.         It may also be affirmed that in fact the resultant
direction thus obtained is generally that of the prevailing wind.
    In   questions such as the present, if auy general relation subsists
between the direction           of the isobars and that of the winds, the
mean direction       of the oue will probably           be   affected  in like manner
with that of the other *.            It occurred to me then to compare the
resultant directions of the wind with those of the isobars for each month
of the year.      Possessing these resultants for Makerstoun for each month
derived from four years' observations (184;>-184G) f, it was necessary to
compute the corresponding values for Greenwich and Dublin, and to
calculate the mean directions and intervals of the isobars for the same
years.
    The observations       at Greenwich      were made with an Osier's           anemo
meter, and only pressures which on the mean for an hour exceeded one
fourth of a pound were noted. At Makerstoun the instrument employed
was of a wholly different description and not self-registering ; observa
tions were made of the maximum pressures (if not less than one tenth
of a pound) within ten minutes at each observation hour (see the In
troductions to the Makerstoun Observations).                Observations of the direc
tion and force of the wind were not begun at the observatory of Trinity
College, Dublin, till 1845 ; but       I  have obtained observations for the four
years    in  question   from  the  volume of observations made at the Ordnance
Observatory, Phoenix Park, in a locality stated by Dr. Lloyd to be wholly
unexceptionable:!:. The instrument employed at the Phoenix Park obser
vatory was a WhewelPs anemometer, which always worked imperfectly,
so that the observed runs of the pencil differed from time to time for
the same wind-velocities §. The monthly resultants calculated from the
   *  It  is to be observed   that the mode in which the resultant wind-direction it
obtained    is not the same as that employed for the direction of the lines of equal
pressure ; but this difference can only affect results derived from periods during which
 the wind has blown frequently in very different or opposite directions; and even in
such cases the isobars should retain their relation to the predominating wind, if the
resultant force for that direction is considerable. A special investigation will show,
however, the amount of error which may be duo to this cause.

numbers of runs have been combined by me in the same way as for the
forces to obtain the means for the four years.
    The resultant forces cannot therefore be considered absolute measures
at any of the three stations ;          I  have, however, endeavoured to reduce
them to a common unit*.
     In order to determine the factor required to give approximately the
true wind-pressures,          I have assumed that the mean velocities of the
wind at Greenwich and Makcrstoun do not differ much from those
shown by Eobinson's anemometers at Kew and Oxford. Mr. Johnson
found that the mean velocities at Kew and Oxford were nearly the
samet; the mean velocity at Oxford, 110 foot above the ground, from
four years' observations (1857-61) was 10-2 miles an hour. This velocity,
                                                             V,
employing the generally accepted formula              P —-. „., gives a'constant    mean
 pressure of O52 lb. on the square foot of surface                i ; the mean of the
 observed pressures during          the  four  years 1843 to 1846 (without re
 ference to direction) was 0-46 lb. at Makerstoun and 0-48 lb. at
 Greenwich, an agreement which, considering all the circumstances, the
 difference of instruments,         modes of observation, and distances from
 the ground of the air stratum whose force was measured, must be quite
 accidental.
     The resultant forces for Makerstoun have then been multiplied by
 1'13 and those for Greenwich by 1'08 to reduce to the mean, 0'52 lb. at
 Oxford. In the case of the pencil-runs on Whewell's anemometer at
 Dublin they       have   been divided   by 50, which       gives an approximation to
 the mean pressures          at the other stations.         The means of the three
 resultant pressures found for        each  month from the four years' observa
 tions   may then be taken as           approximations         to the resultant mean
 pressure for the mean resultant direction over the space included by the
 three stations.
     The following Table contains the mean barometric pressure at Green
 wich,    with the differences (ftl and ft,) from the mean pressures at
 Makerstoun and Dublin (at mean sea-level), and the resultant direc
 tions of the wind at the three stations.
    * At Dublin and Makcrstoun the vanes were nearly 20 feet above the ground (at
Greenwich     I believe the height was greater).    I  do not know any objection to the
position of the vanes which could vitiate the observed directions of the wind at any of
the stations.   From my knowledge of the instrument used at Makerstoun and of the
 care with which the observations were made,      I   believe the means to bo very good
relative measures of the forces.

    J This formula is, believe, very far from being accurate ; the true relation between
the pressure and velocity of the wind, as shown by dilferent anemometers, requires an
 integrating pressure instrument, in which the sums of pressures may be shown by
 work done.

Makerstoun on the mean of four years, but the monthly directions differ
on the average 12° (without reference to sign).      The resultant direction
at Dublin  for  the four  years differs considerably (18°) from that at the
other two stations.     The mean of the three resultant directions (<£) is
given  in Table  VI., together with the differences (6 — <t>)-

wind in ten months of the year, the directions being nearly the same in

    It  has already         been stated that the resultant pressures of the wind
 are only rough approximations, yet these indicate very distinctly the same
annual law of variation as the diabars ; not only so, the results for each
 month show no great divergences                   from the ratio stated above derived
 from the mean for the four years.
    "When we remember that these resultant forces are obtained in some
 cases from winds proceeding from opposite directions,                         which destroy
each    other   to   a  great   extent,   and    that the mean   differences    of barometric
pressure are obtained similarly from pressures which increase in opposite
directions, it seems probable that the relation found always hold?,
though the ratio may vary somewhat with winds of different forces and
from different directions.               The variations including the greater diver
gences from the mean must also be the object of special investigations,
in which winds from the same direction, and with nearly the same mean
forces, must be considered alone.
    liatio of   the mean pressure         of   the wind (surface current), independent of
direction,   to the    resultant jiressure. — It       has been stated that the pressure
of the wind was            always     noted at Makerstoun whenever the maximum
pressure     within     an   interval   of 10 minutes at the hour of observation was
at least one tenth             of a pound on a square foot of surface, and that
although      the    absolute     mean pressures cannot bo derived directly from
these observations, yet that their relative values are probably determined
with considerable accuracy. We may then obtain a measure of the
variability of the wind, that is of the degree of opposedness of the masses
of air in motion at the earth's surface, from the ratios of the mean (31)
to the resultant (E) pressures. Those at Makerstoun for the four years,
1843 to 1846, were as             follow*:—

    We    see that the greatest         proportion of the surface current proceeded
from one quadrant in the winter months of December and January, and
in the summer months of June and July ; that the wind was most
variable in May, April, and September.                   We have already found (p. 521')
atmospheric surfaces with hills and valleys, into the latter of which the former are
supposed to flow.       On this account      I  should much prefer some other word (such as
diabar or barode), which would servo to indicato tho relation of the difference of
pressure to the unit of distance.

      In
      the preceding investigations we have employed the observations of
the direction of the surface current only.  We require greatly to know
to what extent the direction would vary in ascending from the earth.
The late Mr. Johnson, Director of the Oxford Observatory, found that
an anemometer at    height of 110 feet from the ground showed

with no observations, made at points free from all obstructions, which
can answer the question, whether the direction of the wind varies con

of investigating this subject must bo by comparisons of the direction of
the wind near the surface,                      in well-exposed        localities, with that of the
motions of the clouds.
   Such observations require in general mnch time  to bo of any use to      ;
science they should be made frequently and systematically. This can be
  *I    may remark hero that the variability of the direction of the wind and of the
intervals and direction of the isobars have no relation whatever to the diurnal varia-
tion of temperature, nor to the variation of temperature from day to day.         The
diurnal range of temperature was greatest in the mean of the four years in June and
August.    The difference of the daily mean temperature from the monthly mean wa»
least in August, May, and July; less in these mouths than half the mean difference
for January (5°). ("Results of Makerstoun Observation*," Trans. Boy. Soc. Edinb.

 630              Mr.   J.  A. Broun        on the Directions     fyc. of       [Feb.  1,
done well only at observatories            where assistants are continually on the
watch, during the day at least           ;  the employment of self -registering in
struments       has diminished      the number      of observers required in perma
nent institutions, and observations of cloud-motions                can now scarcely be
expected with the requisite            completeness.     On board ship these obser
vations are made with even more difficulty than on shore : rapidly
moving upper currents, especially those in which clouds are seen moving
from very different or nearly opposite directions, catch the eye at once,
and are most frequently recorded.                  No serious investigations can be
founded on observations when the most frequent motions are really not
 observed.
     Believing that any just conclusions            as to the atmospheric currents
could     be  obtained     only from long and careful observations of cloud-
 motion,    I began a series of observations in 1842 at Makerstoun, which
I   continued in the following years with my assistants, the late Mr. John
Welsh, F.E.S., and Mr. A. Hogg*.                  Four currents were distinguished
at different heights.       1st, the surface current observed by the wind-vane;
2nd, the current of loose cumulus (scud) and cumulus ; 3rd, the current of
cirro-stratus; 4th, the current of cirro-cumulus and cirrus t. The ob
 servations of these currents have been only partially discussed ;                I shall
give    here  some  of  the  results   which    bear upon  the  subject   of the present
 investigation, derived from the observations made in the four years 1S43
to 1846, for which the directions of the surface-wind and of the isobaric
 lines have been already obtained.
     Direction of the Cirn1s current. — Having found the mean direction in
 which     the cirri and cirro-cumuli moved for each day on which their
 motion was observed during the four years,              I   have combined these by
 Lambert's     formula (on the assumption that the velocity was the same on
each day) in order to obtain the resultant direction (v/<) for each month ;
these are given in Table VIII.
    * The motions of   the clouds were determined by seeking till a marked portion w»e
 found which seemed to run up or down one of the four corners of the observatory,
 the points of the compass relatively to which were marked on a surrounding paling;
 when no portion of cloud could be found that would pass or had passed through the
zenith, the vanishing-point of the motions of different portions of cloud in the same
stratum could generally be ascertained very nearly.        It is believed that in a great
majority of cases the directions were found to within half a point of the compass,
though the nearest point was always noted. In the year 1844 alone 4370 observations
were made of the directions of motion of the cloud-currents.
    t The same classification of cloud-motions was proposed by M. Poey to the Paris
Academy of Science in 1864 (Comptes Reudus, t. Iviii. p. 6C9), excepting that he sepa
rated the loose cumuli from the cumuli : this separation      I  had also made, especially
in the north-east quadrant, in which the loose cumuli have a much lower position
than in the other quadrants; but in taking the mean directions the two strata were
included in one. M. Poey has,        I believe, recommended this system of observation of
the atmospheric currents to the Meteorological Committee of the Royal Society, a
recommendation in which      I entirely concur.

   When we determine the resultant directions from all the observations
in each of the four years (see Table VIII.), we find that the difference of

Makerstoun only in two days out of five, whereas the direction of the
wind was observed on most days in each year. This fact may affect the
exactness of the differences for limited periods         but    will be shown      ;         it
that it affects little the final results.  There is, however, a correction re

 243°. Hence we have
     So many causes         may affect the direction of the surface current in
 certain places that      it cannot fail to appear possible, if not probable, that
 we have here a result depending on local conditions, contour of the
 country, or accidental causes. This possibility it is essential to consider.
    In  the first place it will have been remarked that the mean direction
 of the wind from the four years' observations, 27° south of west, is the
  same as has been deduced from the Greenwich observations.                         In the
 next place, the mean direction of the wind for Scotland, deduced from
 eleven years' observations (1857-1867) at 9 A.M. and 9 P.M., made at
Jifty-five stations, was 32° south of west*, while at Makerstoun, from
 observations at the same hours             in the four years, 1843 to 1846, it was
 29° south of    westf    —   a  difference   of only 3°, which would go to increase
 that of \fr— 0.
     Fortunately     I have been able        to confirm the result for the difference
 of directions     of the cloud and surface currents by observations made in
  a very different locality.           M. Quetelet observed the directions of the
 cloud-motions (without distinction of species) at the Brussels Observa
 tory during the years 1833 to 1846, and he found the resultant directions
 by Lambert's formula as follows +: —

 whereas by the wind-vane of Osier's anemometer (which was erected
  in 1842) the direction was found

     A comparison of the numbers of times the clouds and snrface-wind
  had moved from each point of the compass in the five years 1842 to
  1846 induced Quetelet to think that the clouds, as well as the re
  sultant surface-wind, had really proceeded from a more/ southerly point
  than in the preceding years.             Had the eminent director of the Brussels
  Observatory sought        the   resultant    directions for each year, he would have
  found that marked differences of the direction of motion existed in each
  of the five years.        I   have calculated these directions from Quetelet's
 numbers    ;  they are as follows       : —

   The agreement of the results for the last four years, which are the
same as in the preceding discussion, is very remarkable ; thus the direc
tion of the surface-wind at Brussels became 32° more southerly in 1845
than in 1844, and the direction of the cloud-motion changed exactly by
the     same       of degrees and in the same direction.
               number                                        A similar
though less marked result will be seen at Makerstoun (Table VIII.), the
cirri moving from a point 21° more southerly in 1846 than in 1845,
while the          current changed 18° in the same direction.

   It   has been remarked(p. 531) that the wind and cloud directions are
not exactly comparable, as the latter cannot be observed so frequently as
the former ; this fact has less weight in the results for Brussels than in
those for Makerstoun, since the former include clouds of all kinds,
which are observed much oftener than the cirri alone. There       however,             is,
another method of comparing the directions of motion which was em
ployed by me at first in the discussion of the Makerstoun observations
for 1843. The differences of the directions of the surface and cloud
currents when observed simultaneously were noted when several such      :
comparisons made at successive hours gave nearly the same difference,

siderably two or three results might be obtained in the same day. From
these results for the four years 1843 to 1846 the following mean
differences were obtained —          :

confirmation          is
the resultant directions does not affect the accuracy of the final values.
   It probable that this difference between the directions of the cirrus
      is
and surface currents will not take place per saltern, and that the obser
vations of cloud-motions at different heights should show some variation
in the value of —          If we should find that the lowest stratum of

  The difference   somewhat less than half of that between the cirrus

become smaller, and the relative number of negative results increases.

   We have no knowledge of the mean law according to which the velocity
of the air in motion varies with height above the ground. From previous
observations, while observing the aerial currents at Makerstoun,      had                   I
concluded that the maximum velocity occurred rarely at   greater height              a
than  6000 feet, and that the mean stratum of maximum velocity was pro
bably not above 5000 feet. From this height, then, the velocity diminishes
as we ascend and descend, but according to different laws. At the surface
of level ground the velocity is, on an average, probably not one third of
that at the maximum      the upper limit, where the motion ceases,
                              ;                                       in all                is
probability little above the average height of the  cirri.   had frequently     I
observed at Makerstoun that the angular movement of cirri passing through
the zenith was generally very much smaller compared with that of the
lower clouds than could be explained                      by
                                          the difference of heights had the
velocities been the same.

units of mass in the column into their velocities, then it seems probable
that the height h will not be higher than the stratum of the cirro-stratus,

shall have (4') — <p between 23° and 15°; and there cannot be any con

fact, that     if a mass of air changes its latitude, from whatever cause, it
will    not proceed in the direction in which it was originally propelled or
drawn ; but if it passes to a higher latitude the motion will be towards a
point more easterly, and if to a lower latitude towards a point more
westerly than the original direction ; that is, in our hemisphere the ulti
mate direction of motion will be positive of the original direction.
     The friction of the moving mass of air against the earth's surface is
always recognized as a cause which diminishes the amount of this dis
placement.        Thus Hadley, on the lower currents from the tropics towards
the equator:—" Before the air from the tropics can arrive at the equator,
it   must have gained some motion eastwards from the surface of the earth
 or sea whereby its relative motion will be diminished " *. The upper
 current moving towards the north is supposed by him to preserve its excess
 of velocity till it descends. So Sir John Herschel on the same hypo
thetical upper current : — " In flowing over to regain its level, it com
 mences its course relatively in a meridional direction, but really with the
 full amount of easterly velocity which the earth's equator has ; and since
 this, as it proceeds north or southwards, is in excess of what would suffice
 to keep it on the same meridian, it continually deviates to the westward
 [»'. «. the direction from which it appears to proceed] ; and when it again
 returns to the earth in its circulation, which it does on both sides beyond
 the tropics, it does so with a powerful westward tendency, and the more,
 as in its course it has been less under the influence of surf ace friction owing to
 the elevated region in which it has travelled t-
                                                      "    I  have put in italics the
 explanation of the difference of directions of the currents found by me.
      The theory of the trade-winds is so mixed up with unknown currents,
 ascending and descending, and presents so many other difficulties as
 usually stated, that it is not easy to determine what may be due to differ
 ences of latitude velocity, and what to other causes in the production of
 winds with definite directions in different parts of the globe. It is not
 a little remarkable, however, that no writer, as far as              I am aware, had
 perceived that if the difference of latitude velocity affected the direction
 of motion of a vertical mass of air, this fact should be observed at once,
 especially in middle latitudes, in the movements of the wind and of the
  clouds.
      If, as  Sir John Herschel shows, the lower stratum of a mass of air
 moving northwards         has its tendency to move eastwards most diminished,
 this diminution will be communicated gradually by the viscosity of the air
  from layer to layer till the upper stratum of the mass in motion is
 attained where

have    here       afc   once an explanation of the difference of directions found
by me, and a proof            of the conservation of the excess (or defect if pro
ceeding towards the equator) of the initial latitude velocity ; that is to
say, another proof of the earth's rotation.
   It is obvious that this explanation refers only to the mass of air set in
motion by the same cause; it is probable, however, that the lower and
upper strata arc frequently propelled in different directions.    This is evi
dent  in the case already noticed of the north-east winds and cirrus currents
(footnote, p. 531) ; and is shown without doubt in the cases for which
the upper currents proceed from points negative of the lower currents.                                   I
may also remark that the difference of direction of these currents will
depend on the nature of the surface and on the difference of latitudes
of the place from which the air originally started and the place over
which it is moviug.   It is probably due to this cause that the difference
(\p) —  <j>found

difference and its relation to will be considered in special investigation.

above and   flow   off in still more rapid  currents in directions for which
there was neither law nor reason.      It appears that the air does not pour
into these basins, but that                  it   moves as   a   whole in the directions of equal
pressure.

geography of the country, and then in combination with certain theore

heat and the kinetic theory of gases, occupies much space.
   Nearly half the memoir is devoted to the work of the Col aba Observa

other variations, and in throwing light by means of these upon the phy

time.
   In  the course of the work the author introduces several new modes of

then remarked that our best way to a real analysis of this music would
be to study the system of 22 and compare the results with those actually
obtained by Hindoo musicians.                The methods which have been employed
in the writer's former paper on the subject* are then extended to the
higher orders, which have not been before thoroughly discussed.                      The
system of     22  is a system of the second order ; and the nature and pecu
liarities of such systems, and of the system of 22 in particular, are
 discussed.
     A  classification of systems of the higher orders according to their mode
of forming thirds is advanced.              If the system be arranged in successive
series' of fifths, differing by one unit in pitch, then the system is said to
be of class X,     if the third of any note ia in the series x units below that
which contains the note itself.
     The system of 22 is shown to be of the second order and first class.
     A system of 34, also of the second order and first class, is pointed out
as being of considerable excellence, even from a modern                  practical  point
 of view.
     It  is shown that in systems of the second order and first class, modu
 lation through a third cannot be regarded as equivalent to modulation
 through any number of fifths.
     The notation is extended to systems of the rth order.
     The subject of the transformations of the generalized key-board is then
 entered upon.        It is remarked in the first instance that any form of ar
 rangement      whatever    can be constructed by rearranging a supply of keys
 of the ordinary patterns.
     The problem of inversion is then solved, and it is shown under what
 circumstances, by simply inverting the succession from end to end, a key
 board can be obtained in which rise corresponds to fall of pitch, and vice
  versd.
      The general transformation          of the rth order is then investigated, and
  a rule is given by which the key-board            of the rth order can be arranged
  with the ordinary keys.
      This rule is then applied to the construction of the key-board of the
  second order, and a diagram is given of a portion of a key-board so ar
  ranged.     Systems of the second order and first class, such as the systems
  of 22 and 34 above mentioned, can be controlled with facility by means
  of this arrangement.

II. " On      the Transport of Solid and Liquid Particles in Sewer
         Gases."   By E. Frankland, F.R.S. Received January 6,
         1877.
   The suspension of vast aggregate quantities of solid and liquid particles
in our atmosphere is the subject of daily remark.   Cloud, fog, and smoke
consist of such particles, whilst the observations made by the Astronomer
Royal for Scotland, on the Peak of Teneriffe, afford evidence of the oc
casional existence of abundance of dust in the air even at great altitudes.
I have already mentioned, in connexion with some winter observations in
the Alps*, that, by placing the eye in shadow and then looking into the
sunshine,    Irepeatedly saw at a distance of a few feet abundance of
snow-crystals floating in the air, when the atmosphere was apparently
perfectly clear and cloudless.
  A very large proportion of the suspended particles in the London
atmosphere consists of water and other volatile liquid or solid matter, as
was,     I
        conceive, proved by Professor Tyndall's observation, that the heat
of boiling water is sufficient to dissipate them. That this is the true ex
planation of the disappearance of such particles by the application of a
moderate degree of heat, and that it is not caused by the rarefied air from
the heated body ascending and leaving behind the suspended matter, as
suggested by Tyndallt, is,       I
                            think, conclusively proved by the following
experiments.
   Two large glass flasks were filled, the one with atmospheric air, the
other with hydrogen.     Two pieces of cotton-wool moistened, the one
with five drops of strong solution of ammonia and the other with eight
drops of strong hydrochloric acid, were plunged into each flask and
allowed to remain there for a definite period. The time required for the
settlement of the suspended particles of ammonic chloride was then
noted and was found to be as follows : —
    1.When the pieces of cotton-wool remained in the flasks for two
minutes, the ammonic chloride settled down in that filled with air in
eighteen minutes, and in that filled with hydrogen in ten minutes.
   2. "When the pieces of cotton-wool   remained in the flasks to the end
of the experiment, the settlement  in the air-flask required thirty minutes
for its completion, whilst that in the hydrogen flask was finished in
seventeen minutes.
  It is evident from these results that an atmosphere fourteen               times as

Simply this.   The  hot wire rarefied the air in contact withit,but it  did not equally
lighten the floating matter. The convection-current of pure air, therefore, passed up
wards among the inert particles, dragging them after itright and left, but forming be

rare as that of London still offers sufficient resistance to the subsidence
of minute suspended particles to prevent them from falling more rapidly
than one inch per minute, the globular flasks in which the experiments
were made being only about 8 inches in diameter.                  Such particles could
not therefore be left behind by an ascending current of the slightly rare
fied air produced by an increase of temperature to 100° 0.*                   .
    In addition to these aqueous and other volatile particles which dis
appear by a gentle heat, there are also others which consist partly of
organic and partly of mineral matters.             But the organic seem greatly to
preponderate in the air of towns, because such air becomes apparently
perfectly clear after it has been ignited.
    The processes of fermentation, putrefaction, and decay afford abundant
evidence that zymotic and other living germs are present amongst the
organic portion of the suspended matters ; whilst many analyses of rain
water, made by myself and others, show that the salts of sea-water are
amongst the mineral constituents floating in the atmosphere.
    Of the zymotic matters, those which produce disease in man are ob
viously of the greatest importance; and it was chiefly with the object of
ascertaining     the conditions    under which these poisons become suspended
in the air that    I undertook     the experiments, the results of which           I  have
now the honour to communicate to the Eoyal Society.
    The outbreak of Asiatic cholera in Southampton in the year 1866 was
traced by the late Professor Parkes, F.R.S., to the dispersion of infected
sewage through the air. The sewage became infected by the intestinal
discharges from some cholera patients who lauded from the Peninsular
and Oriental Company's steamship ' Poonah.'
    In   this case the dispersion was produced by the pumping of the infected
 sewage and its discharge, in a frothy condition, down an open channel
8 or 9 feet long. The effluvium disengaged from this seething stream
was described as overpowering, and was bitterly complained of by the
inhabitants of the adjacent clean and airy houses, amongst whom a viru
lent epidemic of Asiatic cholera broke out a few days after the sewage
received the infected dejections.         Nevertheless the discharge of the frothy
liquid was kept up day and night for about a fortnight, and 107 persons
perished.      At length a closed iron pipe was substituted for the open con
duit : from that day the number of cholera cases diminished, and within
a week of the protection of the conduit the epidemic was virtually over.
    * When this paper was read, Professor Stokes called my attention to the fact that
 the time of subsidence of solid particles in a gae depends upon the viscosity, and not
 upon the specific gravity, of the gas. The viscosity of gases is directly as their times of
 transpiration, and is increased when they are expanded by heat.     The time of transpira
 tion of hydrogen is nearly half that of air, and hence suspended matters ought to sub
 side twice as quickly in hydrogen as in air.       The slight excess of viscosity of the
 hydrogen used in these experiments was doubtless due to the almost unavoidable
 admixture of traces of air, for Graham found the transpiration time of hydrogen to be
  greatly prolonged by admixture with oxygen.

544              Prof. E. Frankland on the Transport of               [Feb. 8,
   In this example a potent cause of the suspension of the zymotic poison
in the air was obvious ; but in the many alleged instances of the propa
gation of typhoid fever by sewer gases, the condition of dispersion is not
so evident.    Does the flow of sewage in a properly constructed sewer
produce sufficient agitation to disperse liquid particles through the air
space of the sewer ?     I endeavoured to answer this question by violently
agitating a solution of lithic chloride in a glass cylinder 3 inches in dia
meter and 30 inches high, with a wooden rod, and ascertaining whether
the atmosphere at the mouth of the cylinder became impregnated with
the liquid, by testing it with the flame of a Bunsen burner ; but no trace
of lithium could be detected at the mouth of the jar, even after an agita
tion much in excess of what would ordinarily occur in a sewer. Before
making this and the subsequent experiments, it was ascertained that no
lithic chloride is carried off by aqueous vapour from a saturated solution
of this salt at ordinary temperatures, first, by placing a shallow porce
lain basin containing the solution under a bell-jar, and then spectroscopi-
cally examining induction-sparks passed through the atmosphere of the
bell-jar ; secondly, by burning a mixture of coal-gas and air under a venti
lating tube beneath the bell-jar in such a way as to cause a circulation
of air through the jar and then testing the effluent air for lithium as
before ; and thirdly, by passing air from a gas-holder over a saturated so
lution of lithic chloride contained in a Woulfe's bottle, and testing the
air as it issued from the bottle.
   The results of the experiment in the glass cylinder render it exceed
ingly improbable that the mere flow of foul liquid through sewers can
impregnate the circumambient air with suspended particles.
    There is, however, another kind of agitation to which sewage is sub
ject that may produce a very different result :      I allude to the develop
ment of gases during the processes of fermentation and putrefaction. It
is well known that the bursting of minute bubbles of gas at the surface
 of an effervescing liquid causes the projection of visible liquid particles
into the air to the height of several inches. Such visible particles are
 seen to fall back again immediately into the liquid ; but it appeared to me
 not unlikely that other particles, too minute to be seen, might be simul
 taneously projected, and, by reason of the smallness of their masses in
 relation to their sectional areas, might continue suspended in the air for
a long time.    To ascertain the truth or fallacy of this supposition   I made
the following experiments.
   A quantity of a strong solution of lithic chloride was placed in a shallow
basin and acidulated with hydrochloric acid ; fragments of white marble
 were then added, and a paper tube 5 inches in diameter and 5 feet high
was placed vertically above the basin.     So long as the   effervescence con
tinued, abundance of particles of lithium were visible     in  a Bunsen flame
held at the upper end of the tube. A tinplate tube 3       inches in diameter
 and 12 feet long was now placed in such a position as      to bring one of its

1877.]          Solid and Liquid Particles in Sewer Gases.                545
open ends over the top of the paper tube.       The tin tube was nearly ho
rizontal but slightly inclined upwards from the paper tube, so as to cause
a gentle draught of air to pass through it when it was slightly heated
externally near its lower extremity.      A Bunsen flame placed at the end
of this tube furthest away from the effervescing liquid showed that the
suspended particles of solution of lithic chloride were not perceptibly less
numerous than at the mouth of the paper tube ; neither were they much
diminished at the further end of the tin tube when the height of the paper
tube was increased to 9g feet.     There can,   I  think, be little doubt that
these particles, which had thus been carried along by a gentle current of
air for a distance of 21 feet, would be similarly conveyed to very much
greater distances.
    In   some of my earlier experiments   I had noticed that the suspended
particles in a current of air were diminished in number, or sometimes alto
gether removed, when the current had to pass a right-angled bend in a
tube ; and it therefore appeared to be not unlikely that a stratum of small
fragments of charcoal would arrest them.           This surmise, however, did
not prove to be correct ; for the particles of lithic chloride solution sus
pended in air, when the latter was moving very slowly, passed easily
through a stratum 2 inches thick, composed of fragments of charcoal
varying in size from ^ to 1 cubic inch ; and even when the thickness of
the stratum was increased to 5 inches, the particles still came through
although in greatly diminished numbers.
     The following conclusions as to the behaviour of flowing sewage may
 be drawn from these experiments : —
     1. The moderate agitation of a liquid does not cause the suspension of
liquid particles capable of transport by the circumambient air; and there
 fore the flow of fresh sewage through a properly constructed sewer is
 not likely to be attended by the suspension of zymotic matters in the air
 of the sewer.
     2. The breaking of minute gas-bubbles on the surface of a liquid con
 sequent upon the generation of gas within the body of the liquid is a
 potent cause of the suspension of transportable liquid particles in the sur
 rounding air ; and therefore when, through the stagnation of sewage or
 constructive    defects which allow of the retention of excrementitious
 matters for several days in the sewer, putrefaction sets in and causes the
  generation of gases, the suspension of zymotic matters in the air of the
 sewer is extremely likely to occur.
      3. It is therefore of the greatest importance to the health of towns,
  villages, and even isolated houses, that foul liquids should pass freely and
  quickly through sewers and drain-pipes, so as to secure their discharge
  from the sewerage system before putrefaction sets in.

      " On Stratified    Discharges. —  III.  On a Rapid Contact-Breaker,
         and the Phenomena of the Flow."              By WILLIAM SPOTTIS
         WOODE, M.A., F.R.S.        Received January 9, 1877.
     In   a paper published   in the Proceedings of the Eoyal Society, vol.
  xxiii. p. 455, I  have described a form of contact-breaker          designed for
 great rapidity and steadiness of action.          It consisted of a steel rod
  which vibrated under the action of an electromagnet.                 As regards
 sharpness    of break  and steadiness of  definition in the  striae,  this instru
 ment left little or nothing to be desired.     But, as explained in the paper
 above quoted, an alteration in the current not only affected the steadiness
 directly, but also reacted on the break itself. The effects due to an
 alteration of the current alone thereby became masked, and the study of
 the laws relating to such changes was rendered more difficult, or altogether
 impracticable.    In order to obviate this inconvenience     I  devised another
 form of contact-breaker, in which the vibrating rod and electromagnet
 were replaced by an arrangement       purely mechanical in its action, and
 therefore entirely under control.
     This instrument consists essentially of a wheel platinized at the edge,
 on which a platinum spring rests. In the circumference of the wheel a
 number (40 in the first instance) of slots were cut, and filled with ebonite
 plugs so as to interrupt the current.         The breadth of the slots was
 about -04 inch, and that of the teeth about -5 inch.             The wheel was
 connected with suitable driving gear, so as to give from 250 to 2000
 currents from the coil in each direction per second.             A 4-inch coil
 was found sufficient to produce the effects ; but the 18-inch coil by Apps,
 mentioned in former communications, was preferable.            With the wheel,
 as with the electromagnetic break, a very slight strength of current was
 required ; but, on the other hand, high tension in the primary was found
 necessary.    In many of the experiments accordingly from 10 to 20 of
the smallest Leclanche cells usually made were employed with the small,
and from 20 to 50 with the large coil. But these were afterwards
replaced by a double fluid battery suggested by my assistant, Mr. P.
Ward, and described at the end of this communication.
     For some time the experiments were conducted with the platinum
spring resting on the wheel ; and the effects were varied by altering
either the pressure of the spring or the velocity of the wheel ; but the
gradual abrasion of the platinum through friction proved to be a fruitful
source of irregular results. This irregularity of action, at all times difficult
to compensate, and sometimes insuperable, was fortunately removed by a
simple although delicate adjustment.        It was, in fact, found that actual
metallic contact between the spring and wheel was not necessary, pro
vided that a layer or cushion of conducting material were interposed.
Such a layer was formed by a thin film of liquid drawn out by a thread
leading from a reservoir and resting on the wheel.         Various fluids were

tried  ; but the simplest, and on the whole the best, proved to be dilute
sulphuric acid, in the proportion of 1 drop of acid to 6 drams of
water.     Generally speaking the better conductor the fluid is, the better
are the results obtained ; but, owing to the insulating slots being very
narrow in this instance, a comparatively weak mixture of acid and water
was necessary.      In one wheel, where the insulating slots are | in. wide,
a mixture     36 times as strong may as advantageously be used.                The
spring,   which  under these  circumstances   became   unnecessary,  was  replaced
by a point, the adjustment of whose distance from the wheel was simpler
and more accurate.       This arrangement gave excellent results, even when
the number      of currents per second was reduced in some cases to 250;
added to which the unpleasant and disturbing noise of the friction was
entirely avoided.
    Wheels having different numbers of teeth were also constructed, and
(what was perhaps of more importance) having teeth of different breadths,
so as to give with the same velocity of rotation contacts of different
duration.     The breadth of the ebonite plugs, or length of interruption of
the current, was immaterial, so long as the current was efficiently broken.
It did not appear, however, that with the same tube more could be
obtained with wheels having different numbers of teeth, than with the
same wheel at different speeds.       But it was found that for different tubes
different wheels occasionally gave better results.
    With the contact-breaker here described effects similar to those pro
duced by the rapidly vibrating break were obtained.              The striae were
formed in a regular manner, and advanced or receded, or remained at
rest,  in a column usually unbroken,      so  long as the velocity of the wheel
was maintained without change ;       and even in the longer tubes, where the
striae, of the double discharge, advanced or receded towards both ends at
the same time, and appeared sometimes compressed and at others dilated,
the phenomena always maintained their characteristic features.
    The condition of the  striae here described, whether    flowing or stationary,
may be comprised under the general term
                                                  " steady ; " and when there is
no motion in either direction, they may be specifically denominated as
" stationary."
    Two questions here presented themselves : — First, what are the con
ditions necessary for the production of steady striae ? Secondly, what are
the conditions and circumstances of the advance and retreat, in other
words, of the flow of steady striae ?
    With a view of ascertaining the nature of the distinction between the
ordinary and the steady striae, careful observations were made with the
revolving mirror.      It having been noticed that when the wheel break
moved slowly ordinary or irregular striae were produced, and that when
it moved rapidly steady    striae resulted,  it seemed   probable that the latter
effect might be due to the short time of contact, and to the consequent
absence of many of the features described in Part II. of these researches.

  This is, in fact, identical with the suggestion there made, that the flutter
  ing appearance was due to the unequal duration of the striae themselves,
  and to the irregular positions of the points at which they were renewed
  at successive discharges of the coil.      And such, in fact, proved to be the
  case ; for as the speed of the wheel was increased the duration of the
  discharges diminished ; the image as seen in the mirror became narrower
  and simpler in its configuration, until, when the steady effect was pro
  duced, each discharge showed only a single column of striae of a width
  proportional to the apparent width of the slit. The proper motion,
  implied by the inclination of the individual striae to the vertical, was still
  perceptible, and was directed, as usual, towards the negative pole.
     From a comparison of the number of striae as seen by the eye with
 those seen in the revolving mirror, it was found that the striae so formed
  were of the kind called     " simple " in former communications.         And the
 phenomena     of the flow may  therefore be  considered  to be due to the different
 positions taken up by the striae in successive discharges.         If in each dis
 charge   the  striae  occupy positions    in  advance   of  those   occupied in a
 previous discharge, the column will appear to advance ; if the reverse be
 the case, they will appear to recede.      If  the positions remain unchanged,
 the column will appear stationary.
     The following consequence of this explanation of the flow will readily
 occur to the reader, viz. that the rapidity of the flow will increase with
 the extent of advance made by the striae in each successive discharge,
 until that advance amounts to half the distance between two contiguous
 striae.  Before this is attained the flow will have become too rapid to be
 followed by the unassisted eye, and can only be observed by the aid of
 the mirror. When this rate of advance has been exceeded, the flow will
appear to be reversed.       If the rate of advance still continues to increase,
the rapidity in the reverse direction will appear to decrease until the
advance amounts to the entire distance between two contiguous striae,
when it will apparently be reduced to zero ; the striae will then again
appear stationary.       Experiments appear to conflrm this view of the case.
    Experiments were next instituted with a view of ascertaining the con
nexion between the flow and resistance.            Starting from a condition of
current and break for which the striae were stationary, it was found that
an increase of resistance, introduced generally in the primary circuit,
produced a forward flow, t. e. from the positive towards the negative
terminal, while under similar circumstances a decrease of resistance pro
duced a backward flow.       Furthermore, if after producing a forward flow
the resistance be continually increased, the flow after increasing in
rapidity so as to become indistinguishable by the unassisted eye, gradually
appears to become slower, and ultimately to reverse itself, in accordance
with the law suggested above.
    Another form of contact-breaker was also occasionally used.                 The
principle upon which it was based was the suddeu disruption of a thin
                                                                   2E2

film of conducting liquid by a discharge between the electrodes of a
circuit. The mode of effecting this was to make one electrode terminate
in a platinum plate fixed in a horizontal position, and supplied with a
uniform film of dilute sulphuric acid ; the other in a platinum point, the
distance of which from the plate is capable of delicate adjustment by
means of a screw.      Electromotive force required for this break is not
less than that of 5  cells of Grove.
   As soon as the current passes, the fluid between the plate and point
will be decomposed and electrical continuity broken.         This done, the
fluid flows back again, and continuity is restored.    By a proper adjust
ment of the supply of fluid and of the distance of the electrodes (the
latter varying from -05 inch to '001 inch), the number of disruptions may
be made to attain   1000 per second.
   The currents delivered by this form of break are exceedingly uniform,
and the effects produced are quite equal in delicacy to those produced by
the electromagnetic or by the wheel break.
   The elements used in the battery to which allusion was made in the
early part of this paper are zinc and carbon.     The zinc is immersed in
dilute sulphuric acid in the proportions of 1 volume of acid to 7 of
water ; and the carbon in a saturated solution of bichromate of potash
with 1 volume of sulphuric acid to 7 of the solution.       The carbon and
bichromate solution are held in a porous cell.
   The absence of nitric acid permits this battery to be used in a room ;
while the fact that the zinc is attacked only when the circuit is complete,
renders it unnecessary to lift the plates out of the fluid when not in use,
as in the bichromate battery.      The only limit to the time during which
this battery may be left untouched, appears to be the period when the
bichromate salt finds its way into the outer cell, so as to attack the zinc
independently of electrical action.    But this does not take place to an
extent materially to affect the action for some months.

   The authors announce that they have discovered the long-looked-for
lymphatics of striated muscle, and describe them as radicles, valveless
reservoirs, and valved efferent vessels. While describing their structure
and relations, they point out that the reservoirs are found on one plane
or side of a muscle ; the valved efferents are found on the other side, as,
for example, in the case of the diaphragm, transversalis abdominis, and
triangularis sterni muscles. In connexion with this, they have discovered

a dense plexus of valved vessels on the anterior surface of the abdominal
wall, corresponding to that on the pleural surface of the diaphragm.
    "Upon the lymphatics of muscle they find the peculiar serous cells first
 described by Ludwig and Schweigger Seidel, whose views they fully
confirm, in opposition to those expressed by Ranvier.              They deny the
existence of stomata in the Mammalia, but admit it in the case of frogs ;
and as the peritoneum of the latter is lined by crenated lymphatic
endothelium.'they admit its connexion with the lymphatic system ; but, on
account of the absence of the latter endothelium as well as stomata
from the serous cavities of mammals, they deny any connexion between
 these and the lymphatics.      While describing the structure of basement
 membrane, they discuss the facts adduced by Klein and Debove as bearing
on the question of absorption, and give their own views on this question.
They hold that the lower surface of the diaphragm is an exuding one,
and only an absorbent one when all the natural conditions are reversed.
    They describe the minute anatomy of the lymphatics of the intestine,
and show that it is the glandular structures, and not the muscles of the
wall, that regulate the amount of these vessels.           They also trace com
plete identity between these and the lymphatics of striated muscle.              In
either case they figure the connective-tissue            cavities as forming the
radicles of the lymphatics, but hold that these are not the only lymphatic
afferents, nor that that is their only function.             To prove this, they
discuss the nature of these cavities, as they have discovered them in
tendon and other gelatinous structures in different classes of animals to
be of the same structure as in the cornea. Unlike man, the small mammals
have no special vascular or lymphatic vessels in the peritoneal tissue,
being dependent on the muscles below for those structures.
    The authors finish by entering upon a minute description of the
technique   employed by them, and offer a series of about 60 camera-lucida
drawings of preparations        in their possession in illustration of their
researches.

   In  the cases of 3, 3a = 1, also of 487,   487a  = 486, we are unable to show
why the Period itself is, in     each   case, divisible by the Prime.     But we
can show, with little labour, that the period arising from           j<t~ is itself
divisible by 487, and therefore that       t^j = 486.

I. "On       Crookes's       Force."         By G. JOHNSTONE STONEY, M.A.,
       F.R.S., and RICHARD              J. Moss, F.C.S.          Received January 12,
       1877.
   In two     papers by one of the authors of the present communication,
which appeared in the Philosophical Magazine for March and April 1876,
it has been shown that the motion of the blackened disks of a Crookes's
radiometer can be explained by the known dynamical properties of the
trace of gas which is present, and the term
                                                            " Crookes's force " is pro
posed to designate the reaction which comes into play between the
blackened disks and the walls of the exhausted chamber when a difference
of temperature exists between them. Shortly after the first of these
papers    appeared we commenced an experimental investigation of the
subject with the view of learning, if possible, the laws to which the
force conforms.         The investigation is still in progress, and, being ex
ceedingly tedious, it will require a great expenditure of time before it is
completed; we propose, however, in this preliminary paper to describe
the apparatus and methods of observation employed, and to give some of
the results already obtained.
   If the pressure which is exerted on the blackened pith surfaces reacts
on the   sides    of the glass envelope, it follows that a transparent disk
delicately suspended close to a stationary disk of blackened pith ought
to move away from the pith, and therefore towards the light, when the

pith is illuminated.     This inference was submitted to the       test of   ex
periment by means of an apparatus represented in fig. 1 and        constructed
as follows :— A piece of elder-pith 2-5 centims. in length and      1-2 centim.
in breadth, blackened on one side, was fastened by one end to      the interior
surface of the bulb of an ordinary boiling-flask (of about 200 cub. centims.
capacity) in such a manner that the free end of the pith extended toware's
the middle of the bulb.      A light   glass rod with a small magnet on one
end, and a disk of thin microscope-glass on the other end, was so sus
 pended in the bulb that the glass disk could be readily balanced in a
 position nearly parallel with the surface of the blackened path, and a few
 millims. distant from it. The silk fibre from which the glass rod was sus
 pended hung from a fixed arm at the upper end of a tube, the lower end
 of which was hermetically fastened into the neck of the flask.             An
 elongation of this tube (not shown in the figure) with a contraction for
 sealing, served to connect the apparatus with the exhaust-tube of a
 Spreugel pump.      .The pump was set in action, and occasionally the flame
of an ordinary gas-burner      was held at a distance of about 10 centin1s.
from the blackened pith, while the microseope-glasa was
                                                            closely watched.

 When the gauge of the pump showed a tension of 7 millims., as com
 pared with the mercurial column of a barometer standing in the same
 vessel of mercury, the glass disk was distinctly repelled from the pith
 and towards the source of light.       As the exhaustion was continued the
 repulsion between the pith and the glass increased. The apparatus was
 sealed off from the pump when the mercury falling in the exhaust tube
 had for some days produced a metallic sound.         Feeble illumination now
 caused the glass disk to be forcibly driven away from the pith*.
    We now endeavoured to determine quantitatively the influence                of
 variations in the tension of the residual gas, and also the influence          of
 variations in distance between the reacting surfaces.          For this purpose
 we constructed the apparatus represented in fig. 2.
    On a wooden stand supported by three levelling-screws rests a glass
tube 20 centims. in length and 3'8 eentims. in diameter, having a tubular
opening at one side, into which is cemented horizontally a smaller tube
 1'5 centim. in diameter.      In the larger tube there is a circular disk of
elder-pith 2'3 centims. in diameter, having one side blackened with
lampblack ; it is supported in a vertical position on a movable stand of
iron wire.      By means of a magnet the pith disk can be moved up and
down the tube, and thus placed at any required distance (within
 12 centims.) from a delicately suspended circular disk of thin microscope-
glass, 3 centims. in diameter and 0'3 millim. in thickness.            The glass
disk is attached to the end of a glass arm, which is suspended in the
smaller tube by means of a silk cocoon fibre contained in a vertical limb
38 centims. in length and 9 millims. in diameter.            In order that the
torsion of the silk fibre may be conveniently regulated, there is a small
fl-shaped piece of iron wire attached to it a few centimetres below the
end from which it hangs.          A horseshoe magnet is suspended outside
(he tube with the piece of wire between its poles.               By turning the
magnet round torsion may be imparted to the silk fibre.           The balance of
the glass arm is adjusted by means of a small iron ring which it carries ;
the position of the ring can be altered at will by an external magnet.
There is a small silvered mirror attached to the arm at the point of suspen
sion ; this reflects the image of a narrow illuminated slit on to a scale divided
into degrees 2-5 millims. each.        An alteration in the position of the
index amounting to 0-5 millim. is readily observed ; this corresponds
with a change in the position of the outer edge of the glass disk amount
ing to 0-033 millim. One end of the large tube is ground perfectly flat
and closed by cementing to it a plate of glass 4 millims. in thickness ;
through this light is admitted to the pith disk by an arrangement to be
presently referred to. The other end of the large tube is contracted and
terminates in a narrow tube bent upwards, partly packed with gold leaf
(to intercept mercury vapour), and attached to the exhaust-tube of a

described  above were made in March.

 stopcock which        serves for admitting the gases            to be experimented
 upon.
     We found it necessary to avoid the irregular actions which                       arose
 when the incident light was allowed to shine on the inside of the glass
 tube.     This was accomplished by projecting on the disk the image of a
 uniformly illuminated circular aperture in a screen of copper foil
 placed outside the glass chimney of an Argand gas-burner. The lens
 employed for this purpose is permanently attached to a stand on which
 the lamp is secured.       When the position of the pith disk is altered, the
 position of the stand carrying the lamp and lens is altered to the same
 extent, so that the pith disk is always in focus.              The burner is automa
 tically supplied with coal-gas at the uniform rate of 3'2 cubic feet per
 hour, this being the quantity that gives a flame of the required size.
    We found that the torsion of a cocoon fibre furnishes a force which is
 too variable to admit of its being delicately controlled by the method
 just referred to ; but a very accurate adjustment was secured by a sup
 plementary arrangement.          It has already been mentioned that the arm
 which bears the thin glass disk carries a small iron weight by which its
 balance is regulated.        This weight was made to serve for balancing the
 torsion of the silk fibre. For this purpose a small bar magnet sliding in
a groove is so placed that one pole acts on the weight.                     With a little
care the distance of the magnet from the weight can be adjusted so as to
bring the index to zero, and thus exactly counterbalance the torsion of
the silk, the index remaining practically stationary.                  In this condition
the apparatus is sensitive to an extreme degree.
    It will be observed that in this apparatus the cooler                   of the heat-
engine consists of the swinging disk along with that part of the contain
ing tube which lies between the swinging disk and the disk of blackened
pith. By thus making a portion of the cooler freely movable, we hoped
to be able to ascertain the thickness of the layer of gas within which
Crookes's force exists.       It would not have answered for this part of our
investigation to have made the heater the part freely movable, as in all
apparatus of the kind that had been previously constructed, because the
heater cannot be placed far from the cooler in apparatus that is not in
conveniently large for the Sprengel pump, since when the containing
tube is of any moderate size its sides become the principal part of the
cooler* when the glass disk is at a distance.
   * It is  obvious, from the dynamical theory, that if the molecules tending in one
direction within a stationary gas are at one temperature, while the rest of the mole
cules of the gas am1 the surface of a solid with which they oome in contact are at
another temperature, then the Crookes's force which arises may be either normal to
that surface like the pressure of a gas, or tangential to it like friction, or in any way
compounded of these two, being in each case in the direction spoken of above.
   Accordingly the forces that act upon the containing vessel and the vanes of radio
meter! are in general partly tangential and partly normal ; so that in
                                                                            estimating the

     With the improved         apparatus repulsion at first appeared to exist at
all tensions in hydrogen, the distance between the disks being 1 millim.
This repulsion was not perceptibly increased by alterations in tension,
until the latter was reduced to about 200 millims., when                 a slight increase
of repulsion took place, and further reductions               of tensions were in each
case followed by an increase of repulsion.
      It was   observed that when repulsion was detected at ordinary tensions
the glass disk occupied the upper portion of the containing tube, and
that when the disk was made to swing in the lower portion of the tube,
 instead of being repelled it was attracted towards the pith when illumi
nated.        These results are obviously due to convection-currents.                   By
 carefully balancing the glass disk as nearly as possible in the centre of
 the tube the effects are greatly reduced ; but it would be very difficult,^
 not impossible, to balance the disk in a perfectly neutral position.
      In an atmosphere of hydrogen at ordinary atmospheric tensions there is
 no indication of attraction or repulsion when the distance between the pith
 and glass disks is 100 millims. and the time of illumination 15 seconds,
 a period which experience has led us to adopt.                   The first unmistakable
 indications of pressure on the swinging disk at this distance occur when
 the tension is about 50 millims., at which tension there is a very feeble
 repulsion.      As the tension is reduced the repulsion increases. An ex
 tensive series of experiments have been made for the purpose of deter
 mining the ratio in which the repulsion increases for given reductions in
 the tension of the residual gas. The accompanying Table exhibits the

  intensity of these forces the matters to be considered along with the directions of the
  motions in the intervening gas, are the proximity and extent of the opposed surfaces,
  and not the degree of their parallelism.     It is probable that all the phenomena of
  radiometers with crumpled or inclined vanes, which Mr. Orookes has lately investi
  gated, admit of explanation by these considerations.
     It is manifest that in the apparatus described in the text the chief part of the re
   action on the containing vessel, when the disks are at a considerable distance asunder,
  consists of tangential forces acting on the inside of the tube.

    In the above experiments it will be observed that the distance between
the pith disk and the swinging glass disk was constant, viz. 100 millims.
We have made several series of experiments with the disks at various
distances in atmospheres of various tensions.       The means of several of
these series are graphically represented in the following diagram.         The
ordinates represent the distance in millimetres through which the index
moved in a period of 15 seconds       ; the abscissas represent   the distance
in millimetres between the disks.
     Our expectation of being able to ascertain the thickness of the Crookes's
 layer has not been entirely fulfilled with the apparatus as at present con
 structed, owing to the presence of the exceedingly feeble force that
is represented by the horizontal portions of the diagram.            We have
 found this feeble force nearly constant at each tension when the
two disks are at any distances asunder exceeding 20 millims. So far
as we have been able to ascertain, it seems to arise partly from the sudden
expansion of the gas throughout the extent of the Crookes's layer as
 soon as the light is turned on, an expansion which acts on the swinging
 disk as if a feeble explosion had taken place in front of it ; and partly
 from a Crookes's force acting between the upperside of the tube and the
 swinging disk, caused by the inside of the tube becoming sensibly      heated
 by the convection-current   that commences as soon as the Crookes's layer
 is established.   We do not think that any appreciable part of it is due
 to the direct action of the convection-current.

    The rest of the diagram represents the forces which we found when
the disks were at distances of 10 and 5 millims. asunder.                The forces
which presented themselves at these distances are to be attributed
mainly to a true Crookes's reaction between the disks ; and they seem to
warrant the conclusion that Crookes's reaction was manifested at a dis
tance of at least 10 millims. in a hydrogen vacuum, when the outstand
ing tension was as much as 5 millims. of mercury.
    At distances of from 20 to 80 millims. the very feeble force acting on
the glass disk in our apparatus seemed to vary about inversely as the
tension.     As already mentioned, it appeared to be nearly independent of
the distance when the distance exceeded 20 millims.
    At distances of 5, 10, and 20 millims. the force on the swinging disk
made some approach to varying at each tension inversely as the distance.
But, so far as may be judged from our measures of such exceedingly
feeble forces, there is a sensible deviation from this law at most of the
tensions.
    Moreover the diagram, taken as a whole, seems to suggest, in con
formity with the dynamical theory, that the law changes with variations
of density.      For if the law were the same at all the observed tensions,
the converging lines in the diagram should converge to points in the
axis of abscissas, whereas they converge towards points lower down.
    We will postpone the further discussion of the observations already
made with this apparatus until we can supplement them by others.
II. "On       the Structure      of Magelona."          By W. C. M'!NTOSH,
       M.D., F.R.S.E., F.L.S. Communicated by G. BUSK, F.R.S.,
       V.P.L.S.     and Z.S.     Received January 23, 1877.
                                    (Abstract.)
    This annelid was first discriminated * by Dr. George Johnston, of
Berwick ; but as his description (under the name Mcea mirabilis) was not
published till 1865, the above-mentioned title, given to the same type,
from the Island of St. Catherine, off the coast of Brazil, by Dr. Fritz
Miiller, has the priority. It is a comparatively small form, its slender
body being divided into two well-marked regions; while anteriorly
two long papillose tentacles are attached to the base of a remarkable
spathulate, eyeless snout, which it dextrously uses to perforate sand near
low-water]mark at St. Andrews and other sandy shores on both east and
west coasts.
    The structure may be examined under the following heads : —
    Cuticle. —This cbitinous transparent layer is densest on the snout and
anterior region of the body, both being much exposed in the boring-
operations.     Throughout the rest of the body it attains its maximum
 thickness over the nerve-cords in the ventral median line. No cilia occur
        * From   specimens procured by the distinguished botanist, Dr. Greville.

 560                        Dr. W. C. M'Intosh on                      [Feb. 22,
 anywhere on its surface, and only faint indications of pores exist in cer
 tain regions. Fine motionless palpocila abound all over the cuticle.
    The Hypoderm forms a very large proportion of the tissues of the
 flattened snout, the whole region outside the four muscular compartments
 being occupied by it ; so that, in transverse section, it assumes on each
 side the shape of a long lanceolate process, which much resembles a leaf
 with its midrib and veins. Throughout the anterior and posterior regions
 of the body it forms a complete sheath, with various thickenings, and at
 the tip of the tail ends in two lateral styles, the glandular tissue of which
 (as in the dorsal and ventral processes) is arranged in a very regular
 manner. In minute structure the hypoderm much resembles the Nemer-
 tian cutis, presenting under pressure in the fresh animal a series of
 flask-shaped glands or cells, from which the contents escape as clear or
granular globules. Moreover, it contains a vast number of bacillary cells,
some of which have pigment and a large clear globule. In the hypoderm
lie the nervous system and neural canals.
    Muscular System. — The four longitudinal muscles         of the spathulate
 snout are arranged within a curious framework of chitinous basement-
tissue, which in section assumes various shapes — in front being like a
 pair of spectacles, then   a figure of eight, and for a considerable distance
 very much resembling a crown.         This framework exercises an important
 influence on the functions of the part.       The central pair of muscles are
 confined to the snout ; the lateral pass behind the mouth to constitute the
 ventral longitudinal pair. In the preoral chamber are a strong transverse
 muscle (acting as the chief approximator of the sides) and a vertical muscle.
 The muscles of the body-wall (besides the pair mentioned) are circular,
 longitudinal dorsal, vertical, oblique, external or lateral vertical and trans
 verse ventral.    Anteriorly all are powerfully developed for the peculiar
 functions of the region, viz. the compression of the blood-channels and
the thrusting out of the proboscis.        The muscles of the ninth body-seg
 ment are modified so as to form great constrictors, which have a slightly
 spiral arrangement.     In addition to those of the body-wall, anteriorly, are
 the long and short retractor muscles of the proboscis, and various bands
acting on the buccal and pharyngeal regions.         In the posterior division
of the body    the  transverse   ventral  muscles become   atrophied ; but the
dorsal aud ventral longitudinal muscles, though constricted at the ninth
segment, extend throughout ; and the other muscles of the body-wall are
likewise present.
    Digestive System.  — A T -shaped slit   leads into the buccal region, then
follow pharynx, cssophagus, ventricular division, and intestine ; while to
the junction of the first and second is attached the proboscis.       The pha
ryngeal   division is  furnished  with   complex  muscular   layers and  convo
luted internal surface, and it is thrust into the base of the proboscis in
full expulsion.    It is probably the homologue of the proventricvdus in such
Annelids as the Syllidae. The proboscis, again, is an instance of the separa

tion and modification of a part of the digestive canal to aid in the cease
less perforations in the sand.     Its internal surface is covered by a thick,
transparent chitinous layer, devoid of pores.       The relaxation of its own
retractors, and the contraction of the muscular anterior region of the body,
cause it to yield readily to a powerful stream of blood sent from behind ;
and it smoothly unrolls from the margin of the lower lip like a very supple
membrane.       This extrusion goes on until the brownish mass of the pha-
ryngeal region approaches the front of the first body-segment, when its
muscular coil slips into the base of the proboscis, like a plug, assisting to
retain the blood therein, and giving firmness to the whole organ. Thus, in
its progress forward, the flattened snout of the annelid is thrust amongst
the fine sand which it haunts (with an undulating and insinuating motion)
 till it has advanced about its own length ; then the proboscis is ejected
to its full extent like an india-rubber dilator, so as to make a suitable
 channel for the occupation of the body, while again pressing onward the
exploratory snout. All the retractile arrangements are next brought into
 play ; the fan-shaped vertical muscular fibres pull in the last extruded
region, the short and long retractors act on the entire organ, and the
 withdrawal of the pharyngeal protrusion makes an open channel for the
backward stream of blood, which rushes into the vessels of the anterior
 region of the body out of the returning organ, further constricted by its
 own circular muscular coat. There is no differentiation between the suc
 ceeding oesophageal and ventricular regions, the glandular internal tunic in
 each being alike. The latter ceases, after a marked constriction, at the be
 ginning of the tenth body-segment ; and thereafter the intestine, which
 has much more lax glandular tissue and abundant fatty globules, proceeds
 to the dorsal anus near the tip of the tail. The walls of this region are
 richly furnished with capillaries ; and cilia are very evident on the
 internal surface near the tail.
     Circulatory System. — An interesting feature is the fact that the blood
 is a densely corpusculated fluid, the corpuscles having a pinkish colour.
 There are two large dorsal vessels which arise, near the tip of the tail,
 from the bifurcation of the ventral trunk. They pass forward along the
  dorsal arch of the alimentary canal, receiving in each segment a large
 branch from the ventral trunk and numerous capillaries from the intestinal
  wall, until the posterior border of the tenth segment is reached.         At
 this part their dilated walls are supplied with powerful muscles, which,
 on the relaxation of the great muscles of the ninth segment, enable them
 to perform the functions of contractile chambers or " hearts," and by
 vigorous systole send the blood forward in a swift stream along the single
 dorsal vessel of the anterior region.    On arriving at the base of the snout
 the vessel ends in the efferent branch to the tentacle on each side. The
 current rushes along the latter (nearly at right angles to the dorsal trunk)
  to the tips, sending off in each a web of circumferential capillaries
  throughout the greater part of its length, and terminating in the afferent

 vessel,  which    proceeds backward, collecting, as it goes, the capillary
 streams, and then ends by turning forward at the base of the snout as
 the efferent cephalic vessel. The latter has no evident capillaries, but
 bends round at the tip of the flattened organ to terminate in the afferent
 cephalic vessel.     A curious change takes place in the majority of those
 Magelonce     which    are   provided    with the convoluted lateral organs
 of the body, mentioned        further on, in autumn.       The cephalic vessels
 are much abbreviated, and the direction of the current at the base of the
 snout is somewhat modified.           The blood from the head and anterior
 region collects into a series of large vascular meshes which occur in the
 anterior region of the body, and in which the current is for the most part
 under the control of the greatly developed muscles of the body-wall.
 Thus it happens, as formerly indicated, that the contraction of the latter,
 and of the special muscular apparatus which closes the communication
with the posterior region at the ninth segment, drives the blood forward
to unroll the proboscis. This muscular arrangement in the anterior region
and the muscular walls of the vessels themselves at the posterior part of
the same division of the body send the current through the relaxed barrier
at the ninth segment into the muscular ventral blood-vessel of the pos
terior region, and onward to the tail, where the trunk ends by bifurcating
into the two dorsal vessels.        In each segment a lateral branch leaves the
ventral trunk at the anterior dissepiment, turns round and proceeds back
ward to the next dissepiment, and terminates in the branch to the dorsal
 vessel. Further, as first observed by Dr. Fritz Miiller, a sac-like dilatation
takes place shortly after the commencement of the latter, and it fills at
intervals, the distention being followed by a contraction which sends the
blood onward by the branch to the dorsal vessel.
    In vigorous specimens, the currents of the blood are as swift and
beautiful as in the tails of young salmon and other translucent verte
 brates.   When examined in the liquor sangvinis of the living anitnn.1 (as
in  a favourable view of a healthy tentacle) the blood-corpuscles show a
pale nucleus.
   Nervous System.    — The central    mass   of the nervous system lies in front
of the preoral chamber in the fork of the median muscles, and consists
of the ordinary ganglion-cells with connective-tissue bands. No eyes
or other sense-organs exist, though the animal is extremely sensitive to
light and other stimuli, and lives in regions where there is abundance of
sunshine. Two main nerve-trunks proceed backward in the hypoderm — at
first outside, then under, and finally to the inner border of the ventral
longitudinal muscles.       At the commencement each is accompanied by a
neural   canal        " tubular  fibre

the oblique muscles of the body-wall being attached to a transverse band
above them, or to the summit or sides of the area containing them.

connate)      ventral or other longitudinal muscles which overlap the
nerve-area.

hollow contractile process furnished with a series of large cylindrical

    The systematic position of Magelona, with its peculiar external form

 puzzled was he that he placed it (as MOM mirabilis) at the end of his Cata
 logue for the British Museum, under a family specially constituted for
 itself (viz. Maeadoe).     In the Catalogue of the Fauna of St. Andrews it
was located between the Chaetoptcridae         and the Spionidue      ; but the results

      Prof. Casey communicated to     me the  MS. of the foregoing memoir, and
  he has permitted      me to make to it the present addition, containing
  further developments on the theory of the bicircular quartic.
      Starting from his theory of the fourfold generation of the curve, Prof.
   Casey shows that there exist series of inscribed quadrilaterals, ABCD,
   whereof the sides AS, BC, CD, DA pass through the centres of the four
   circles of inversion respectively ; or (as it is convenient to express it) the
   pairs of points (A,B), (B, C), (C, D), (D, A) belong to the four modes
   of generation respectively, and may be regarded as depending upon cer
   tain parameters (his 0, 0', 0", B'", or say) w,, w,, <a}, u respectively, any
   three of these being in fact functions of the fourth.      Considering a given
   quadrilateral  ABCD, and giving to it an infinitesimal variation, we have
   four infinitesimal arcs,  AA', BB', CC', DD' ; these are in fact differential
   expressions, AA' and BB' of the form M/?<ti,, BB' and CC' of the form
           , CC' and DD' of the form M,dw,, DD' and AA' of the form M</« ;

M^u,, BB' in the two forms Mldul and M,rfw, &c., the identity of the
two expressions for the same arc, of course, depending on the relation
between the two parameters.             But any such monomial expression Mrfw
of an arc AA' would be of a complicated form, not obviously reducible to
elliptic functions. Casey does not obtain them at all ; but he finds geo
metrically monomial expressions for the differences and sum BB'— AA',

 sideration of the relations which connect the parameters.
    I  propose to complete the analytical theory by establishing the mono
 mial equations AA'=M(fo)=M,rfw,, &c., and the relations between the
 parameters w, w,, w,, us, which belong to an inscribed quadrilateral ABCD,

         Diurnal Variation of the Earth's Magnetic Force."                By  J. A.
         BROUN, F.R.S.           Received January 25, 1877.
    In    a paper   in the Society's Transactions on the earth's          magnetic
 intensity at Bombay, Mr.          C. Chambers has examined the question of the
 influence of height on the diurnal inequality of the horizontal force*.
 Two instruments were observed simultaneously at Oh 22m and 2h 29m
 P.M. : one, a bifilar magnetometer, was 6 feet above the ground ; the
 other, a unifilar absolute-intensity instrument, was 38 feet above the
 ground.
    Mr. Chambers has found that, in the interval between the two times
 specified, the change of horizontal force given by the bifilar magnetometer
 was rather more than one third (0'37) of the mean diurnal range, and
 that the absolute- intensity instrument showed a change about one fifth
 less than the bifilar. This difference he does not think instrumental ; and
 hfi considers    that,   if true, " it suggests the attribution of    a very  con
 siderable    magnetic      influence  to the state of the medium intervening
 between the upper aud lower places of observation," &c.
    The mean changes of horizontal force between Oh 22m and 2h 29m P.M.
 by the two instruments were as follow : —

 where   X  is the whole horizontal magnetic force.
    Having occupied myself at different times during the last thirty years
with questions relating to the magnetic and meteorological variations at
different heights in the atmosphere,       I have examined my observations of
the horizontal magnetic force, as far as they have been reduced, with
reference to    Mr. Chambers's conclusion.
    In 1847   I made two series of    simultaneous observations on the highest
point of the Cheviot range of hills, and at Makerstoun in Scotland,
about 30 miles distant : the difference of height of the two stations is
2440 feet.      The first series was made in June with a bifilar at Makers-
toun, and an intensity unifilar on Cheviot*. The difference of the daily
range of horizontal force at the two stations, as deduced from hourly
observations during three days, was certainly less than one twentieth
of the whole daily range ; but part at least of this difference was probably
due to instrumental      causes.
    For  a second expedition     in August of the  same year (1847)    the same
instrument was employed/m Cheviot ; but a second intensity unifilar was
observed at Makerstoun, in addition to the bifilar magnetometer.            The
observatory on the first expedition was under a tent, on the second it
was under ground, a deep cutting having been made for this purpose.
The result for the horizontal intensity at Makerstoun showed such
differences between the two instruments used there (in the same room),
that it was evident the unifilar intensity instrument could not be
depended on for small differences in the amount of the variations.
   In the years 1855 to 1858 two bifilar magnetometers of precisely the
same construction in every way, devised by me expressly for these com
parisons, were placed, one in the Agustia Malley Observatory, 6200 feet
above the sea, the other in the Trevandrum Observatory (lat. 8° 31' N.),
200 feet above the sea (about 24 miles from the former station).
   The first year's observations of the bifilar in the peak observatory
were found to be valueless for this question, as it was discovered that
the thermometer, though in the same box, did not show with sufficient
exactness the temperature of the magnet : this was due to the magnet
being within a pasteboard box, to protect it more completely from cur
rents of air, while the thermometer bulb was outside this inner box.
This source of error was avoided by placing two thermometers with
their bulbs on opposite sides of the magnet and within the inner box.
The series of hourly observations after the middle of August 1856 is

expedition was given to the British Association immediately afterwards (eee Brit.
AMOC. Bep. 1847, p. 19).

believed to be free from all error.      The unit-coefficients were determined
with the greatest accuracy for both the instrument on the peak and that
on the plain, verified by different methods, giving results which did not
differ by one five-hundredth of the whole value. The temperature-
coefficients were also found with much exactness ; and, as hard steel
magnets were chosen expressly for these instruments, the temperature-
coefficients were small.
   The following results from the hourly observations, made during the
last four months of 1856, will be sufficient for my present object.
Taking the observations <U+2666>at the hours nearest to those for which Mr.
C. Chambers has obtained his result (namely, 0h 30m and 2h 30m p.m.),             I
find the mean change of horizontal force from the former to the latter
time —
   On the plain, 200 feet above the sea                     =  — 0-0009760   X,
   On the mountain, 6200 feet above the         sea         =  — 0-0009724   X  ;
so   that    the    change on the mountain-peak          was less than on the
plain by one two-hundred-and-seventieth.              In each of the months
October and November the change was exactly the same at the two
stations.
   If  we take double the interval,       so as to keep the same     hours in the
middle,   I find   the mean change from 11"      30m a.m. to 3" 30"1 p.m. —
   On the plain, 200 feet above the sea                     =  — 0-0016556   X,
   On the peak, 6200 feet above the sea                     =  — 0-0016510   X,
The change was therefore one three-hundred-and-sixtieth               less on the
peak than on the plain. The mean of the diurnal ranges for the four
months was 0-00215       X.
   It will  be seen that   in the interval of four hours the change was as
great as the    whole  mean diurnal range at Bombay ; and if the quantities
had been given to five places of decimals only as for Bombay, the move
ments would have appeared exactly the same at the two stations.
                                            \
   It will thus bo seen that instead of less for a difference of 32 feet in
height,  I  do not find more than ¦%$-$ for a difference of 6000 feet when
the change during four hours is considered ; nor, till       I have made a more
searching investigation of tho whole series of observations, can          I vouch
that this difference (which is very much less than the probable error of an
observation at either station) is not accidental.
   Another     series of observations was made at the same two stations in
1864, when      a unifilar horizontal-force magnetometer, on Dr. Lamont's
construction,     was employed, as well as the bifilar instrument. These
observations     are not yet completely discussed ; and on that account      I do
not enter at    presont into the question as to what difference may exist in
the laws of magnetic variations when the height differs by 6000 feet.
Meanwhile it will be useful,      I believe, to those who may attempt investi

the sunny plain, will also show the degree of accuracy attainable when
the requisite precautions are taken, and accurate methods of correction
and reduction have been employed.

    MY DEAB     HUXLEY, — In     my
                                     " Preliminary Note," communicated to the
Eoyal Society on the 18th of January, various infusions were referred to
as manifesting an astonishing resistance         to sterilization by heat.       This
resistance was traced to its source ; and       I have  been   since informed that
you were good enough to express at the time a very favourable opinion as
to the significance and value of the results indicated.
              I
    It will, think, now interest you to learn that the most obstinate of
the infusions referred to in the " Note have been since rendered tract
                                              "
 able by the application of very simple means. Following up the plain
 suggestions of the germ theory,        I have been able, even in the midst of a
 virulently infective atmosphere, to sterilize all the infusions by a tempera
 ture lower than that of boiling water.
    It is known that the prolonged application of a low temperature is
 often equivalent to the brief application of a higher one ; and you may
 therefore be disposed to conclude that in the experiments here referred
     I
 to have substituted time for intensity. This, however, is not the case.
 The result depends solely upon the manner in which the heat is applied.
 For example,      I boil an infusion for fifteen minutes, expose it to a tem
 perature of 90° Fahr., and find it twenty-four hours afterwards swarming
 with life.     I submit a second sample of the same infusion to a tempera
 ture lower than that of boiling water for five minutes, and it is rendered
 permanently barren.
     The secret of success here is an open one.        I  have already referred to
 the period of latency which precedes the clouding of infusions with visible
  Bacteria.     During this period the germs are being prepared for their
  emergence into the finished organism. They reach the end of this period
  of preparation successively — the period of latency of any germ depending
  upon its condition as regards dryness and induration. This, then, is my
  mode of proceeding: — Before the latent period of any of the germs
  has been completed (say a few hours after the preparation of the infu
         I
  sion), subject it for a brief interval to a temperature which may be

under that of boiling water.  Such softened and vivified germs as are
on the point of passing into active life are thereby killed ; others not
yet softened remain intact.                I
                             repeat this process well within the interval
necessary for the most advanced of those others to finish their period of
latency.  The number of undestroyed germs is further diminished by this
second heating.   After a number of repetitions, which varies with the
character of the germs, the infusion, however obstinate, is completely
sterilized.
  The periods of heating need not exceed a fraction of a minute in
duration.  Sum them up in the case of an infusion which they have
perfectly sterilized ; they amount altogether to, say, five minutes.   Boil
another sample of the same infusion continuously for fifteen or even
sixty minutes, you fail to sterilize                  it,
                                       although the temperature      higher           is
and its time of application more than tenfold that which, discontinously
applied, infallibly produces barrenness.
  In few weeks hope to bring this entire subject under the notice of
      a               I

        Temperature as recorded at the Kew Observatory."                      By

    1. There are reasons for supposing that differeuces of temperature in
the various portions of our globe and of its atmosphere are, in whatever
manner these may be produced, the chief primary causes of meteorolo
gical activity. Such differences of temperature produce differences of
atmospheric pressure, and these in their turn produce winds.
     For this reason the daily range of atmospheric temperature has been
chosen as an element which serves well, in many respects at least, to in
dicate the varying meteorological activity of the place, and 'also because,
if it be found capable of indicating useful results, it has the advantage of
being observed with little labour, while the observations are compara
tively easy of reduction.
     The records of the Kew Observatory have been chosen because there
 the atmospheric temperature has been observed for a long series of years,
 particular attention being paid to the construction and exposure of the
 stand containing the thermometers t. Twenty-one years of these records
 have been reduced, beginning with the year 1855, a year just preceding
 the minimum of sun-spot activity, and ending with 1875, which may also
 be reckoned a minimum sun-spot year.
     Two complete sun-spot periods are thus embraced            in these obser
 vations.
                   A. Annual Variation of Temperature-Range.
     2.  It is already well known that the daily range of atmospheric tem
  perature is greatest in summer and least in winter. The following Table
  exhibits the various monthly means of the daily temperature-range : —
     * Bead June 15, 1876.    See fltttf, p. 156.
     t The writer is indebted to the kindness of the Kew Committee for giving him
  access to the record* of the maximum and minimum temperatures taken at the Kew
  Observatory.

                                 B. Variations of Long Period.
         3. It will be seen from Table I. that the various yearly means exhibit
      considerable differences amongst themselves.
         Thus the first two years (1855 and 1856), as well as the last year (1875),
      exhibit comparatively small values, and suggest the interesting question
      whether the yearly mean daily range does not depend, among other
      things, on the state of the sun's surface with regard to spots.                   There are
      three minimum sun-spot years in Table I., say 1856, 1866, and 1875,
      and two maximum years, say 1859 and 1870; and accordingly we find
      that the three former correspond to small ranges, namely 12°-69, 13°-61,
      13°-25, and the two latter to large ranges, namely 14°-52, 15°-63.                       But
      on the other hand, and against this evidence, Table I. records a tempera
      ture-oscillation between 1859 and 1866               as great, or nearly as great, as
      any  which   apparently corresponds         to  sun-spot variation.
         4. Before discussing this point further, it will be desirable to recon
      struct the elements of Table I. on a somewhat different principle.
         To perceive this let us assume that the influence of the sun upon the
      daily range of temperature is really greater during years of maximum
      than during years of minimum sun-spot frequency.                    Now if this influ
      ence is identical with or follows laws similar to the heating-influencv                     of

                              Range          of Atmospheric Temperature.                                             579
  the sun, it will of course be least in winter and greatest in summer.   A
  given increase of the range in winter will thus denote a greater relative
  increase in the power of the sun than the same absolute increase of range
  in summer.     Thus if the sun's influence were doubled, the range for De
  cember (Table I.) might be supposed to rise from 9°-17 to 18°-34, and the
  range for July from 18°-49 to 3G°-98.      In fine, what we have to do in
  order, according to this hypothesis, to obtain the apparent increase in
  solar activity is to find in what proportion the normal monthly range is
  increased.   This is done in Table II., in which the normal range for each
  month is reckoned = 100.      But here we must bear in mind that while
  Table II. is constructed in conformity with a certain hypothesis regard
  ing the solar action, it does not necessarily follow that this hypothesis is
  correct    ;    indeed Table          II.
                             is only to be regarded as exhibiting                                        a different
  way of arranging the results.

  7.   If
        we still regard it as most likely, though not proven, both from
the evidence herein recorded and from collateral considerations, that there
is some connexion between the daily temperature-range and the state of
the sun with regard to spots, then we may suppose that the redundant
temperature-oscillation   between 1859 and 18C6, already alluded to, is a
local phenomenon which will disappear when a sufficient number of sta
tions are discussed.    There would seem, however, to be another possible
mode of explaining      the circumstance, and allusion will be made to this in
another part of this paper (art. 17).
                          C.   Lunar Annual Variation.
  8. It will be of interest to determine whether the temperature-range
has any reference to the relative position of the sun and moon.     For this
purpose the whole period of observation has been portioned out into lu
nations, beginning with new moon.     Each lunation is divided into 8 parts,
entitled :— (0), (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7)— (0) denoting new and (4)
full moon.
   The various lunations with tho corresponding values of the tempera
ture-range are exhibited in Table III.    It will, however, be here neces
sary to state how these values have been obtained.      Take the dates (civil
time) of the four quarterly phases of  the  moon   as given by tho Nautical
Almanac, and under each of these dates, as a centre, group seven ob
servations.   Each value in Table          III.
                                         corresponding to (0), (2), (4), (6)
is thus the mean of seven separate observations of daily range.
  * This is only   a rough comparison, and must not be regarded               as indicating      that
meteorolog1cal  phenomenu precede    cert,in corresponding solar phenomena with which
they are supposed to bo connected.   — [Added March       ;>,

      The half-quarterly phases (1), (3), (5), (7) are then interpolated in
 point of time, so that sometimes their date will fall upon a given civil
 day, and sometimes between one civil day and another.                              In the former

a series which presents the appearance                     of a double period. It will also
be noticed that the sum of the four left-hand numbers is larger than that
of the four right-hand numbers, the former being 56-62 and the latter
55-99.
    If    we now divide           the     whole    series into two parte, we obtain                     as

perhaps conclude that, taking the whole year, the lunar variation presents
the appearance of a curve with a double period superposed upon one of a
single period.       The range of this variation is not, however, very great.

200, 208-213, 220-225, 232-237, 245-250, 257-259, we obtain the fol

But before making use of these numbers, we must apply to them the fol
lowing small correction : —
   The winter lunations represent observations of which new moon cor
responds, we may say, on an average to the beginning of the various
winter months, while full moon corresponds to the middle and (7) to a
few days before the end. It is possible, however, that the sum of the
various new-moon observations for any six winter months (inasmuch as
they occur at dates preceding those of the corresponding full-moon ob
servations, or observations for other phases) may be affected differently
from the latter by the annual variation which is indicated in Table I.
    The correction applicable on this account has been obtained in the fol
lowing manner: — The mean monthly values of Table I. have been em
bodied in a curve, and from this curve has been tabulated the values of
temperature-range corresponding to the eight divisions of each of the six
winter months.
    By this means it has been found that the following correction is ap
plicable to the numbers of (D) : —

   1   2.   If we
             look at Fig. 1, which represents the lunar variation for the
whole year, we shall observe, as already remarked, that it seems capable
of being represented by a curve of double period superposed upon one of
single period, which latter has its left-hand values greatest, or, in other
words, is similar to Fig. 3.              If
                                we now look at Fig. 2, which represents the
lunar variation for the summer months, we perceive an irregularity as if
two variations were superposed on each other, one a double variation and
another a single variation of opposite nature to that of Fig. 3. Fig. 3
Bpeaks for itself ; the variation is here extremely marked ; and if we sup
pose it due to the superposition of two curves, a double and a single one,
we must suppose the single curve to be much more pronounced than the
double one.
  13. The hypothesis of a double curve common to both periods of the
year, and a single curve going in one way and very marked for the winter
months, and in the opposite way and not so marked for the summer
months, would appear to be one which would at any rate enable the re
 sults to be presented to the eye in a more simple manner. Let us now
deduct the variation implied in Fig. 1, or the whole annual variation,

     E. Possible Variation of          the  Lunar Effect with  the Sun-spot     Period.
    15.   In  order to determine this point as well as we can from the ob
servations, let us consider as minimum solar years the years 1855-57,
1862-67, 1873—75, and as maximum solar years the years 1858-61,
1868-72,      and we thus obtain two values for the winter variation, one
corresponding to minima and the other to maxima 6olar years.                           Sub
tracting from these the mean winter variation (F), the residual difference,
if any, may be supposed to represent an effect possibly due to the solar
period.
    By these means the following results have been obtained                  : —

There would thus appear to be, judging by the winter observations, two
effects of a solar minimum and maximum.
    The first of these is a general decrease for minimum years and increase
for maximum years of the temperature-range,                  a result already indicated
by   Tables    I. and   II.
    The second of these is a general decrease for minimum years and in
crease for maximum years of the difference in temperature-range caused
by the varying positions of the moon.
    Thus it will       be seen     from (N) that the minimum range lags most
behind the average range at the point (1), for which the average range
is highest ; while it lags least behind the average range at the point (5),
for which the average range is lowest. (P), of course, indicates a beha
viour of exactly the opposite description.
    16. Let us now direct attention to the prominent character of the
winter lunar effect.
   Gathering together the various values of this effect, we obtain as
follows : —

 Judging from these results, we would remark that the great and per
 sistent effect of the lunar winter variation renders it difficult to entertain
 any doubt of its existence.
     17. It will now be desirable to indicate one result of the supposition
 that the lunar effect is somehow connected with the state of our lu
 minary *.
     Mr.  J.  A. Broun, in a series of very interesting investigations, has in
 dicated the possibility that the sun is one-sided in his action on the earth,
 in other words, that a certain heliocentric longitude or section of the Bun
 is especially influential. From the results of this paper it may likewise
 be imagined that a        particular configuration of the sun and moon is espe
 cially influential in a meteorological point of view.
     Suppose now, that, although not a year of maximum sun-spots, there
 are yet a great number, and that the influential solar longitude is turned
 towards the earth when the moon is in her most favourable position.
 This favourable conjunction may occur several times in succession, inas
 much as the period of the sun's rotation does not differ greatly from the
lunar period, and thus we might have a meteorological effect produced
even rivalling that of the solar maximum sun-spot period.
     In fine, without confining ourselves to a particular hypothesis,                     it is
evident that      if   the  sun   and  moon      have     both   to be   taken    into account
as regards meteorological action, the meteorological influence may not
be always proportional to the sun-spot area.                           It may perhaps be
thought to militate against the hypothesis of a connexion between the
lunar effect and the sun period, when we see, as above, that the first
eleven years of the series, taken consecutively, exhibit a less lunar effect
than the last ten years.           To this, however, it may be replied that un
doubtedly the last ten years, embracing the maximum of 1870, represent
greater solar activity than the first eleven years.
    Again, if the range of temperature for different years were merely a
solar effect, having no connexion with the moon, we might expect
the summer        range     and the winter          range to be increased            and dimi
nished in the same or nearly the same proportion. Now, if in Table I.
we regard the years 1858-61, 1868-72 as representing both years of
solar maximum and years of maximum temperature-range,                                 we shall
find that the sum of the mean ranges                     for   the  six   winter months of

trial magnetism.

 these years is 67'22, while the sum of the mean ranges for these months
for the whole series is 64-92. On the other hand, the sum of the mean
 ranges for the six summer months of the maximum years is 104-87,
while the similar sum for the whole series is 103'13.   Thus the increase
for the winter months of the maximum years is not only relatively but
even absolutely greater than that for the summer months.
   18. It may be remarked, in conclusion, that the method of dealing with
meteorological observations herein indicated may be applied in various
ways to the elements of the same station and also to those of different
stations.
   The author forbears to mention these various ways, which will occur
to every meteorologist,      lie cannot, however, help thinking that an
extension of the present method of investigation is likely to lead to
interesting results.
