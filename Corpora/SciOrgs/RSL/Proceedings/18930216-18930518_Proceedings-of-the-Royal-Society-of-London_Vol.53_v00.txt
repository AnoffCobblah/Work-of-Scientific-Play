 L " On a Portable Ophthalmometer."           By Thomas Reid, M.D.
     Communicated by Lord Kelvin, P.R.S. Receive'd January 1,
     1893.
   The object of the instrument about to be described is to measure
the curvature of the central area of the cornea, the polar or optical
zone ; or of any spherical reflecting surface of from 6 to 10 mm. of
radius.    In its present form the instrument can only be applied to
the measurement of the corneal surface in the visual line.       As this
is the area of the cornea utilised for distinct vision, this instrument
furnishes all the data practically requisite for the diagnosis and
measurement of corneal astigmatism.
   The theory of its construction is based on a particular application
of the following well-known optical law : that when two centred
optical systems are so combined that their principal foci coincide,
the ratio of the size of the object to the size of the image formed by
the combined systems is equal to the ratio of the principal foci of the
two optical systems, adjacent respectively to object and image. The
two optical systems in this case are the convex lens of the instrument
and the cornea as a reflecting surface, with the object in the prin
cipal focus of the adjoining optical system.
   Thns:— (vide fig. 1).
   Let MM' be the convex lens of known focus, A the corneal surface,
and P' the point where their principal foci coincide.

    Let SP  be an object situated at the principal focal distance of    MM',
and let   XX'  be the principal axis of the system.
    Then a ray SM parallel to the axis will, after refraction, be
directed to the principal focus P' of the curved surface of the cornea,
and therefore be reflected in the direction IB parallel to the axis XX'.
IB prolonged will meet the ray directed to the centre C at the point
S' ; therefore S' is the image of S, and S'P' the image of SP, and
S'P' is in the principal focus of the convex reflecting surface.

                        Description of the Instrument.
     The essential parts of the instrument are an aplanatic convex lens
  of known focus, a rectangular prism neutralised in its centre by a
 smaller prism, one side of the rectangular prism being adjacent to the
  lens and a circular or other disc being opposite the other side in the
  principal focus of the lens.   When the instrument is held in front of
  the convex reflecting surface   with the disc turned towards    a luminous

  source, a  virtual image of the disc will be formed at the virtual focus
  of the   convex reflecting surface.           This image will only be seen
  distinctly by the emmetropic eye through the neutralised portion of
 the prism, when the focus of the lens in front coincides with the
 virtual focus of the convex surface.             The ratio of the object to the
 image    will  be as shown above.           If now a double-image prism be
 inserted behind the neutralising prism, which exactly doubles this
 image, its power with the combination is easily determined, and
 therefore the exact size of the image can be measured.                The size of
 the object being known, we have the three elements fnecessary for
 determining tho fourth proportional, the curvature of the convex
 reflecting surface.
     The instrument in this simple form presented a number of prac
 tical difficulties in its manipulation, which were overcome by the
 introduction     of a short telescope       behind, with double-image      prism
fixed   in front of its object-glass.

    In its present form the instrument           consists of the following parts
(vide fig. 2*) :    — An aplanatic lens 06, a rectangular prism P ueu
tralised in the visual axis by a smaller prism P2 and a telescope,
with the double-image prism BP fixed in front of the object glass of
the telescope Ob2.        The focal length of the object-glass 06! is pre
cisely the same as that of the aplanatic lens 06, and cross wires CW
at its principal focus are viewed by a Ramsden eye-piece.
    Before using the instrument it is necessary and sufficient that the
cross wires should be distinctly seen at the punctum remotum of the
observer.      The adjusted instrument is held in the observer's left
hand, which rests on the forehead of the patient, the disc being
directed to a luminous source to the right of the observer. The point
of coincidence of the principal foci is found by moving the instrument
to and fro.        When tho observed eye is directed to the central or

through which it passes, the corneal image doubled and inverted
ought to be seen in the centre of the field.       Instead of using circular
discs of different dimensions, the size of image required to produce
exact contact in any meridian is conveniently and quickly obtained
by making the required change in the size of a carefully constructed
iris diaphragm.     By using a circular object, the circular, elliptical,
 or irregular form of the image reveals at once the condition of the
 surface. When the image is elliptical, the meridian of greatest
 curvature is easily found by rotation of the telescope, and a rotation
 of 180° gives a controlling observation.         By a similar process the
 meridian of least curvature is determined.

     The index is divided into two parts, outer and inner.         The outer
  registers the size of the image, and the inner the corresponding
  dioptres.
     The degree of refinement with which the measurements may be
  carried out depends entirely on the degree of exactness of determina

tion of the constants, especially     I  and F.   I  has been determined
exactly to 1 /500th inch, and can be estimated to abont l/1000th.
The focal length of the object-glass can be determined by Cornu's
method, bat in general it is more convenient to measure two curved
surfaces whose radii are exactly known, and within the limits of the
instrument.
   The index error is found by taking the number of dioptres at suffi
ciently great intervals within the limits of the instrument.         In this
instrument, if we take the extremes of the index, 0 = 12 mm. and
0 = 16 mm., we find the corresponding dioptres are 38-9 D and
51 84 D. The index being graduated in thirds of a millimetre, the
index error of each division is nearly 0-08 D, which is positive.
    If the double prism be now removed, the image being single, and
the pupillary opening generally distinctly visible, it affords a means
of determining whether the visual axis passes through the centre of
 the pupil.
    It will be seen that this instrument    differs from the ophthalmo
 meter of Helmholtz, the most perfect instrument theoretically and
 practically which has been devised for this purpose, in which, while
 the object is constant, the image varies with the curvature of the
 surface, but always covers the same angular interval of the surface.
 It resembles the ophthalmometre pratique of Javal and Schiotz, in
 which the doubling is effected by means of a double-image prism in
 serted between two achromatic lenses of equal focus, so that while
 the image is constant the object is made to vary. With this instru
 ment, when the difference of curvature of the principal meridians is
 considerable,   amounting to 3 or 4 dioptres, in order to obtain
 approximately accurate results it is necessary to insert birefractive
 prisms of different powers, giving images of from 1 to 3 mm.             In
 the present  instrument  the image   of 2 mm.  has been selected as  giving
 sufficiently accurate results for most practical purposes, measuring
 with precision, as it does, a difference of refraction of half a dioptre.
 For cases outside the limits already referred to (6 to 10 mm.) prisms
 of suitable powers can be substituted.

    The paper of which this communication is an abstract gives the
 particulars of an investigation which was commenced in the year 1887,
 and extended to the cTose of 1892.            The object of the enquiry is
 sufficiently indicated on the title page.
    The values of the mechanical equivalent obtained by Joule in his
 later determinations differ amongst themselves by as much as 1 per
 cent., and the differences amongst the results obtained by succeeding
 observers are, with the exception of Rowland's in 1880, still greater.
 The harmony amongst the values obtained by Rowland is marvel
 lous ; but, since his manner of investigation was the same throughout
the whole series of his experiments, his conclusions stand in need of
 confirmation by different methods of observation.            Other observers
 who have attempted to obtain the value of the mechanical equivalent,
by means of the work done by an electric current. have been hampered
 by constant perplexities as to the absolute values of the electrical
 nnits adopted. The science of electrical measurements has now
arrived at such a stage that its units may be regarded as sufficiently
established,* and, therefore, the time seems particularly appropriate
for an enquiry into the relation between those nnits and the
 mechanical ohps.
    The difficulties of such an investigation are, of course, great, as is
shown by the discrepancies amongst the results obtained by those
observers who, in recent years, have adopted electrical methods. One
cause of inaccuracy has been present in all determinations               I have
examined, viz., the increase in temperature of the conductor above
the temperature of the medium in which it was placed, and the
consequent undetermined alteration in its resistance.                Rowlandf
writes as follows : " There can be no doubt that experiments depend
ing on the heating of a wire give too small a value of the equivalent,
seeing that the temperature of the wire during heating must always

I    have defined the             thermal unit as the quantity of heat required
to raise unit mass of            water through 1° C. of the- air thermometer at
15° C., and so much              confusion has arisen from ambiguity as to the
value of the unit, as            ordinarily defined, that have given reasons in

support of the suggestion              that this definition       shoulds be generally
adopted.
     Throughout the whole of this enquiry           I   have been ably assisted by
Mr. G. M. Clark, B.A., Sidney College, Cambridge, and this                         com
munication should, in justice,           be regarded as a    joint contribution.
     The value of     investigation of this kind depends, in a great
                        an
measure, on the attention given to matters of detail.  It is, therefore,
impossible, in a short abstract, to produce the evidence on which our
results are based, and we content ourselves with a brief outline of
the method adopted and the conclusions arrived at, without attempt
ing to justify those conclusions.
   If a calorimeter     suspended in a chamber, the walls of which
                             is
are maintained at      cons' ant temperature, we can, by observations
                             a
over small range across that outside temperature, deduce the rate of
          a
rise due to the mechanical work done in the calorimeter, when the
supply of heat         derived from stirring only.
                       is                             By repeating the
observations in a similar manner over ranges whose mean tempera
ture     differs from that of the surrounding walls Oo, we obtain the
          0,
change in temperature due to the combined effects of the stirring,
radiation, conduction, and convection at all points of our whole range
of temperature. As the success of the method depends (1) on the
possibility of maintaining the exterior temperature unchanged, and
(2) on the regularity of the supply of heat due to the stirring, we
briefly indicate our method of securing those conditions.
     1.The calorimeter* was suspended within an air-tight steel
chamber.      The walls and floor of this chamber were double, and the
space between them filled with mereury.         The whole structure was
placed  in  a tank  containing about  20 gallons of water, and was sup
ported in such a manner that there were about inches of water both

It   was made of

with a considerable thickness of gold.       All metal surfaces within the calorimeter
were thickly gilded.

gas regulator of a novel form, -which            controlled the supply of gas to a
large number of jets. Above those jets was placed a Bat silver tube,
through which tap water was continually flowing into the tank, all
parts of which were maintained at an equal temperature by the rapid
rotation of a large screw. Thus, the calorimeter may be regarded as
suspended within a chamber placed in the bulb of a huge thermometer
— the mercury in that bulb weighing                 70 lbs.     A  change of 1° C. in
the temperature of the tank water caused the mercury in the tubes of
the regulating apparatus to rise about 300 mm. Special arrange
ments were made by which it was possible to set the apparatus so
that the walls surrounding the calorimeter could be maintained for
any length of time at any required temperature, from that of the tap
water (in summer about 13° C., in winter 3° C.) up to 40° C. or 50° C.
We know by observation that the temperature of the steel chamber
(when once adjusted) did not vary by 1/500° C, and we believe the
variations were much less.
     2. We experienced great difficulty in devising a suitable form of
stirrer; and we attribute the failure of our earlier experiments to
defects in the ordinary forms.                 We find it impossible, without a
lengthy description, to give a clear idea of the stirrer ultimately
adopted.        We can only state here that it was completely immersed
when the depth of the water exceeded 1 cm., that its bearings were
 outside the steel chamber, and that the water was thrown from
 the bottom to the lid of the calorimeter.
     More than 100 experiments were performed (many of them last
 ing several hours) in order to determine the value of «•+ /> (0i— 0O),*
 when the calorimeter contained different masses of water.                          The
 harmony amongst the results was satisfactory.
      These experiments proved that over our range of temperature,
  t, +
       />(0i— 0O) was a linear function of 0i— 0O, and Newton's law of
 cooling appeared to hold strictly true over a range of 6° C. below
 to 6° C. above the temperature of the surrounding walls, i.e., from
  14° C. to 26° C. ; and our experimental results were of such a nature
  that a very small departure would have been apparent.f
      We found that with our form of stirrer a = r'k where r was the
  rate of revolution, and k some constant. This relation held true for
  all values of r between 26 and 34 revolutions per second, and, as
  during our       J   experiments we proposed to maintain a rate of as
  nearly   as   possible    30 revolutions per second, we were able to make
  the necessary correction for small deviations from the normal rate.

term of this equation, and thus, by direct observation of       we were
able to obtain the value of

where R' is the resistance of the coil, and At' the capacity for heat of
the calorimeter and its contents at a temperature 9\.
   We have now to indicate the methods by which we ascertained the
electrical value of the energy supplied by the current.
   E. — The extremities of the wires CA, CB will (when the galvano
meter G shows no deflection) be maintained at a difference of poten
tial equal to that due to the cells at C.
   Let K be an adjustable resistance placed in the circuit which
communicates with S (the storage cells), and let R be the resistance
of the calorimeter coil AB.     Whatever variations may take place in
R and in the potential difference at S, it is always possible (provided
the adjustment of K is sufficiently under control) to maintain, by
close attention to the indications of the galvanometer, the points A
and B at a constant difference of potential.
   A  special rheochord was designed by means of which it was found
possible, in spite of variations in the resistance of AB, to maintain
the potential difference unchanged throughout each experiment, and
we believe that in no case did the variations exceed 1/10,000 of the
mean difference of potential during each experiment.
   The Clark cells (which were placed at C) were constructed by us
according to the directions of Messrs. Glazebrook and Skinner, and
have, on several occasions, been directly compared with the Cavendish,

would have greatly simplified both the experimental work and the
calculations.  In the year 1890 we devoted mnch time to the exami
nation of the various copper-manganese-nickel alloys, and we per
formed a series of determinations with a coil whose temperature
poefficient was practically zero. The reasons which led us to reject
these alloys and adopt a platinum wire will, we think, be found
sufficient.
  The value of R was first determined by a dial-box (legal ohms)
constructed by Messrs. Elliott.f Mr. Glazebrook has been so kind as
to perform a complete standardisation of this box by means of the
B.A. standards. The resulting corrections have been applied, and the
values of R expressed in true ohms, as defined by the
                                                      '

few sentences the manner in which we determined the value of                                        /3,

however their values alter, since they are traversed by equal currents
and their capacities for heat are the same.      Equilibrium can, how

therefore again at the temperature 0,; thus the value of 0 = 0, — 0t.
By changing E, the potential difference of the ends of the coil, we
can find values of /3 corresponding to values of E. By applying to
the ends of the coils the potential balance previously described, the
potential difference at the extremities of S can, by increasing the
E.M.P. at the ends of the bridge, be raised to that of I, 2, &c., Clark
cells.                                                                            a
    The following table gives the results obtained by this method.
During our observations, the rate of stirring was the usual one, but
 we also investigated the effect of small changes in the rate.           The last
column gives the values deduced from the parabola SB, = 0-00422n2
 (where n is the number of Clark cells), as we found it convenient to
express the differences in temperature by the corresponding differences
in R. A difference of O-OOIO between the last two columns corre
sponds to a change of 1 in 8600 in R.
    The correction is a most important one, and the neglect of it by
previous investigators sufficiently accounts for their failure to obtain
satisfactory results by observation of the heat developed in a wire by
an electric current.

   0i,    Temperature.    — At the time of writing (December, 1892) our
thermometry is based on measurements made by platinum thermo
meters.       We propose to make, at an early date, a direct comparison
of our standard thermometer with the air thermometer by means of
the apparatus described by           Mr. Callendar,* who        has been so   kind   as
to promise his assistance.
   In a previous paperf the details             of a careful comparison of the
platinum and the air thermometer have been gi ven. It was then shown
that the platinum-air difference curve ^(i[100|2 — i]100) gave values
of t at all temperatures from 0° to 100° C. accurate within 0-01° C.
of the real value of t, and that discrepancies appeared to have an
experimental origin. The experience of two years' work with
platinum thermometers has but increased our confidence in them.                       J
Should a direct comparison with the air thermometer modify our
determinations of differences of temperature (and it is only differ
ences which are important               to us), our results will be modified
accordingly.         This will not, however, necessitate any repetition of
the      experimental work, as the corrections involved will be of a
numerical order only.
   A mercury thermometer by Hicks (labelled E,s§) was standardised
by direct comparison with different                 platinum thermometers, the
observations        being taken under conditions similar to those prevalent
                    J
during our " experiments," and the temperatures corresponding to
the readings given in column 1, Table XVII, were thus ascertained.
   We fonud it necessary to calibrate the mercury thermometer not
only for irregularities in the bore, but for certain ntrictly recurrent
changes in
                 " lag," which we have found to be invariably associated
with a rising mercury thermometer. We are unable to briefly describe
the method adopted, and we confine ourselves to stating that it was
based on observations of time.               The results of this investigation,
which extended over several months, prove that a calibration of the
ordinary kind is insufficient if accurate observations have to be ob
tained      with a rising mercury thermometer. As an illustration we
 give the following table, which shows the difference in the value of
 certain ranges on thermometer Es, when steady and when rising at
the normal rate of our experiments.

Thus, although we differ by 0 015° C. in actual elevation at 14° C., our agreement as
to the value of the above ranges is close.          Want of time has prevented a complete
comparison, and the observations have been somewhat hurried. They serve, however,
to indicate that our thermometric errors are small. — E. H. &.]

find  J  without first ascertaining        the values    of /, g, or the water
equivalent of the calorimeter, and by repeating the observations
over different ranges we can find              / without previously obtaining
J; or, having obtained /, we can find w» and g, and then by                      *
equation (4) deduce the value of          J   from a single experiment.     We
have adopted both methods as a check              upon the calculations, which
involve   much arithmetic.         The latter method is the more convenient,
as it enables ns to ascertain the results of separate experiments, but
it cannot be applied nntil the values of /, g, and w» have previously
been obtained by observations on two different weights at two different
temperatures.
   The following table shows a few of the results given in Table XL
of   our paper.     We have divided our experiments into Series I
and II, and we have given reasons why more weight should be at
tached to the latter series.         We here give a summary of the values

production of heat was increased          9  times. The agreement amongst

    Still maintaining the same general views as were put forward in
 my preliminary statement on the Lycopodinae and Ophioglossaoeae
 ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 50, p. 265), I have now investigated other
types from among the Vascular Cryptogams as regards the develop
ment of their spore-producing members.          As some considerable time
 most still elapse before these and other results can be laid in full
before the Society, a    further preliminary statement will now be made
of the more important facts recently obtained.          It is assumed that
readers will bear in mind the views put forward in the paper above
qnoted, as regards sterilisation of potential spore-prodncing tissue,
the possible partitioning of an originally continuous sporogenous mass
by bands of sterile tissue, and as regards the elaboration of external
form which may follow on such        partitioning. This will be specially
necessary for the appreciation of the facts relating to the Psilotaceae.
    Taking first the Equisetaceae, the development of the sporangia has
been closely followed      by Goebel (' Bot. Zeit.,' 1880-81) ; I find it,
however, difficult to accept his conclusions as to the hypodermal
origin of the archesporium.
    On following the early phases of development in Eq. arvense, the
sporangium is found to be eusporangiate, but the essential parts of
the sporangium may be traced in origin to a single superficial cell,
the cells adjoining this laterally contributing only to form the lateral
portions of the wall.      The first division of this cell is periclinal : the
inner resulting eell forms only a part of the sporogenous tissue; the
outer cell undergoes further segmentation, first by anticlinal, then
by   periclinal, walls, and the inner cells thus produced are added to the
tporogenous tissue, and take part in spore-formation.    The archesporium
of Eq. arvense is thus shown to be not of hypodermal origin in the
strict sense ; the same appears to be the case in Eq. limosum. Similar
additions    to the sporogenous tissue by early periclinal division of
saperficial cells is commonly to be seen in Isoetes, and occasional cases,
which are difficult to explain in any other way, have been observed
in some species of Lycnpodium.         It would thus appear that Goebel's
generalisation, that in all the Vascular Cryptogams which he investi
gated a   hypodermal archesporium exists (' Bot. Zeit.,' 1880, p. 569),
cannot be    retained in the strict sense.
   The tapetum is derived from the series of cells immediately sur
                                                                  C  2

rounding the sporogenous mass; it is, however,         to be carefully dis
tinguished from certain cells of the sporogenous mass, which also
undergo an early disorganisation ; for about one-third of the cells of
the sporogenous mass do not form spores, but serve physiologically as
a diffused tapetum, yielding up their substance to nourish the other
young developing spores.       This is another form in which sterilis
ation of sporogenous tissue may appear. A similar arrest of some of
the sporogenous cells is found also in the Psilotaceae.
     I have already suggested a theory (loc. cit., p. 273) of the mode of
origin of the whole strobilus of Equisetum from a sporogonial head,
and have no reason to alter my opinion on this point.
     The synangia of the Psilotaceae have given rise to voluminous dis
cussions ; one view, which is now very widely adopted, as to the
morphology of the parts which bear the synangia of these plants is,
that the synangium is terminal on an abbreviated axis, which bears
in addition two foliage leaves.     It will be seen that the investigation
of the internal details  of development will support a simpler and more
probable explanation of the nature of these peculiar parts, that which
was indeed generally held by the older botanists, viz., that the whole
of each lateral appendage (sporangiophore) which bears the synangium
 is a single leaf. This conclusion had already been arrived at by
 Graf Solms, after examination of the external form of the developing
 organs in Psilotum, for he found the synangium to arise below the
 apex of the whole lateral appendage. No sufficient examination has,
 however, yet been made of the internal details of the development
 of these parts in the Psilotaceae, excepting a few observations by
  Goebel on Psilotum ('Bot. Zeit.,' 1881, p. 688), which were, however,
 incomplete, through insufficiency of material.
      Tmetipteris being the genus with the simpler structure, it may be
  described first.    In their earliest stages of development, as lateral
  outgrowths from the axis, the sporangiophores are not readily dis
  tinguishable from the foliage leaves in form or structure, while they
  occupy a similar position upon the axis. In either case, a prismatic
  or wedge-shaped cell occupies the apex, as seen in radial section, but
  the tissues of the whole leaf are not readily referable to the seg
  mentation of a single initial. The first appearance of a synangium is
  as an upgrowth of superficial cells of the adaxial face of the sporangio-
  phore, immediately below its apex ; meanwhile the cells of the abaxial
  side also grow strongly, while the apex itself does not grow so
  rapidly ; so that the organic apex is soon sunk in a groove between
  these stronger growths.      The superficial cells which are to form the
  synangium undergo periclinal and anticlinal divisions, to form about
  four layers of cells ; all the cells of this tissue are at first very
  similar to one another, but, later, two sporogenous masses become
  differentiated ; they are not, however, clearly defined while young

from the sterile      tissue which forms the partition of the synangium,
or from    the wall, while the cells which form the partition are similar
in their origin to the sporogenons cells.      From the arrangement of the
cells of these sporogenons masses it seems not improbable that each
mass    may be referable in origin to a single cell, bat this has not been
proved to be constantly the case.         All the cells of the sporogenous
tissue do not arrive at maturity, but here, as in Equuetum, a con
siderable number, serving as a diffused tapetum, become disorganised
without forming spores.          There is no clearly-de fined tapetum in
Tmesipteris. The leaf lobes begin to be formed almost simultaneously
with     tho synangium, and appear as lateral growths immediately
below the apex of the sporangiophore ; their further development
presents no characters of special note.
     The synangium of Psilotum originates in essentially a similar
manner, being formed from the upper surface of the sporangiophore,
immediately below its apex.         The details are different in accordance
with the trilocular character of the synangium : but, as regards the
structure of the wall and septa, the absence of any strict external
limit of the sporogenous masses, and of any definite tapetum, as well
as in the fact that a considerable proportion           of cells of the sporo
genous masses become disorganised          without forming    spores, Psilotum
 corresponds     to Tmesipteris. Each sporogenous mass appears to be
 referable in origin to a single archesporial cell.
     On the ground of the observations of internal development, of
 which the above are the essential features, I agree with the conclu
 sion of Solms that the whole sporangiophore is of foliar nature, and
 that the synangium is a growth from its upper surface. The presence
 of the two lateral leaf-lobes need be no obstacle to this conclusion,
 shile they serve an obvious purpose in protecting the synangium
 when young, more completely than a leaf of the form of the sterile
 leaves of these plants could possibly do.
      For purposes of comparison with allied forms, Tmesipteris should
 be taken first :     and the correspondence is most close with Lopido-
 •lendron, a fact which has a special interest since this genus and the
  Psilotaceae are both very ancient types.             In Lcpidodendron the
 Bporangium is very large ; it is narrow and elongated in a radial
  direction, extending a considerable distance along the upper surface
  of the leaf.     I  have already communicated to the Society the fact
  that trabecules    extend in Lepidodendron from the base of the sporan
  gium far up into the mass      of spores (loc. cit., p. 272), and have com
  pared these   with   the trabecules in the sporangium of Isoetes. Neither
  of these sporangia        are, however, completely partitioued.       I now
  suggest that comparatively       slight modification of the condition in
  Lepidodendron would produce the state of things seen in Tmeaipteris :
   if the sterile trabecules of Lipidodendron were consolidated into a

.11             Morphology of Spore-producing         Members.      [Feb.   16,
transverse septum, and the apical growth of the sporopbyll arrested
and taken up by two lateral lobes, the result would be such as is seen
in Tmesipteris. This is not a mere imaginative suggestion : it pro
ceeds from the observed fact that the septum in Tmesipteris is undis-
tingnishable at first from the sporogenous masses : here, as in other
cases, it seems to me probable that a partial sterilisation of a
potential    archesporium has resulted in a partitioned sporangium.
Psilotum itself illustrates, in its abnormal forms, the possible pro
gression from two to four or five locali. It may further be noted, in
connexion with the above comparison between Lepidodendron and
 Tmesipteris, that the vascular tissues of some of the former appear to
correspond more closely to those of Tmesipteris than to any other
living plant.
    Looking at the whole plants of the        Psilotaceae from the point of
view above     indicated, they are to be regarded as lax strobili, bearing
 sporangiophores (sporophylls) of rather complex structure.           Branch
ing, which is rare    in  Tmesipteris, is common     in Psilotum, and is to be
compared with the branching of the strobilus in many species of
Lycopodium.       In both there are irregularly alternating sterile and
fertile zones,   not unlike those of some species of Lycopodium (loc. cit.,
p. 270) ; at the limits of these, arrested sporangia are frequently
found. It is not difficult to imagine how such plants as the Psilotaceae
may have originated from some strobiloid type, not unlike that of the
genus Lycopodium.
    Those who accept the above suggestion will be prepared farther to
admit the comparison of the synangium of the Psiloiaceae with the
 " fertile frond " of the                        which has been made by
                             Ophioglossaceae,
various other writers — Mettenius, PrantI, Strasburger, Celakovsky.
        I
 This believe to be a true homology ; I should, however, add to this
 the hypothesis that, in either case, we see the result of elaboration
in size and form, together with partitioning, of a sporangium of an
originally simple Lycopodinous type. In the Psilotaceae the result
 may be 2 — 5 loculi ; in the Ophioglossaceoe the number may be in the
 simplest cases as low as six, or may rise to many hundreds in the
 larger species of Ophioglossum or Botrychium.             It may further be
 remarked that every fresh case such as the above, where the de
 velopment supports the hypothesis of partial sterilisation of a poten
 tial archesporium, and resulting partition, as exemplified among
these lowest vascular plants, is of importance.              A large body of
evidence, to which       I am now adding by the investigation of the
Marattiaceae, leads me to conclude that such partitioning of originally
simpler sporangia has played a very important            part in the evolution
of vascular plants.

IV. " Further Experiments on the Action of Light on Bacillus
       anthracis." By H. Marshall Ward, D.Sc, F.R.S., Pro
       fessor of Botany, Royal Indian Engineering College.
       Received February 13, 1893.
   On December 15, 1892,         I  read to the Society a short account of
my experiments* proving          that   the light of a winter sun and that of
the electric arc rapidly destroy the life of the spores of the anthrax
bacillus, and showed that the bactericidal action is really direct, and
not due to elevation of temperature or to any indirect poisoning or
starving process incident on changes in the food materials.             I also
mentioned that the evidence goes to prove that the effect is chiefly if
not entirely due to the rays of higher refrangibility in the blue-
violet of the spectrum.
   The experiments have been continued with special reference to
these     latter points, and confirm the general conclusions in every
detail. Not only so, but the further results prove that the inhibitory
and deadly effects of direct insolation are not confined to Bacillus
anthracis, but also extend to other bacteria and even to the fungi ;
and throw some light on several problems which have presented
themselves during previous investigations.
                 Experiments with Screens of Coloured Glass.
    I will first  describe some experiments made during December to
February      with  coloured screens of various kinds ; premising that the
methods employed in preparing and exposing the plates, &c., have
 been   the same as those referred to in the previous communication.
    Ten pieces of glass of various colours were selected, and each care
 fully examined as to thickness, transparency, and spectroscopic pro
 perties, and labelled so that all notes could be readily compared and
 contrasted.
    Perhaps the best method of presenting the comparative peculi
 arities  of these glasses is that employed in the following table (p. 24).
    These pieces of glass were all of a size convenient for clamping
 over the outside of the stencil plate put on to the Petri's dish, and in
  which the letter or figure is cut (see p. 394 of previous paper).

 1893.]          Action of Light on Bacillus anthracis.                25
   Table   II  (p. 26) summarises the results of a series of experi
 ments made with these glass screens, and shows at a glance all the
 essential points brought out in the experiments.
   The first column merely gives the number of the experiment.
 Column 2 is occupied with the tabular number of the particular glass
screeu employed, and is more fully elucidated by reference to the
properties summarised in Table I. In column 3 we have the kind of
plate employed.      In all cases the ripe spores were used, and it only
remains to add that it makes no essential difference to the result
whether agar, or gelatine, or a mixture of both, supplies the food
material, except that agar is, of course, much the most convenient
medium for incubation.       With regard to Experiments 11 and 12 in
this table, the backs of the lids of the Petri's dishes were slightly
blackened in the smoke of a candle, in order to reduce the internal
reflection, and I ought to state that numerous trials have shown that
this does not seriously affect the results.
   It has the disadvantage, however, of sometimes causing black
spots on the plates, owing to the condensed water drops carrying off
some of the soot ; of course this spoils the neatness of the cultures,
and, I confess, I was surprised that nothing worse happened in spite
of the slight acidity of these drops.
   Columns 4 and 5 simply give the dates of making and exposing
the plates.    Data are given in the column of remarks, from which
the reader can judge of the hardships to which the plates are often
exposed    in the intervals — during sunless days and at night — and
these will be referred to later on.
   In column 6 we see how long each plate was exposed to the direct
rays of the clear sun, and it is only necessary to add that four
hours of really bright sunlight is usually quite sufficient; indeed, as
reference to the previous communication shows (p. 394), excellent
results have been got with exposures of two hours to a December
-un.
   In column 7 are given the number of days that the plates were
incubated at 20° C. after exposure.       In those cases where a positive
result was obtained, the time when the letter was distinctly visible is
recorded : where no letter, and therefore no bactericidal action, was
observed, the plates were incubated until the growth of the anthrax
was thick and decisive.
   Then   comes   the column summarising the results, and showing at
the same time what      letter was employed.    It only remains to point
out that no bactericidal action was detected behind the screens of
experiments No. 2 (olive), No. 4 (ruby), No. 6 (ruby), No. 7 (olive),
 No. 9 (orange), No. 11 (ruby), and No. 12 (green), and if we com-
 pare the data in Table I, this can be put as follows : —
   There is no perceptible bactericidal action behind any of the glass

28               Prof. Marshall Ward.             Experiments on     the    [Feb.   lt>,
screens which transmit the red, orange, and yellow, but cut off the blue
and violet, rays.
    The green screen (No. 12) will have to be considered separately,
and remains doubtful for the present.
    On the other hand, distinct positive results were obtained in the
following experiments : — No. I (violet), No. 3 (blue), No.              5 (ordinaiy),
No. 8 (blue), and No. 10 (ordinary) ; in other words —
    The bactericidal action is marked behind the glass screens which
transmit most or all of the blue and violet rays, whether they cut off the
red, orange, and yellow rays or not.
    These results may be expressed still more shortly by saying that
the bactericidal action of the sun's rays is due to those in the blue-
violet half of the spectrum, a result perfectly in accordance with the
evidence obtained by working with the spectrum thrown on the plates.
    As is well known, however, it is possible to test such a generalisa
tion by using screens of other kinds, and my experiments with these
are interesting, as showing not only the accuracy of the above con
clusions, but also that the light is effective after passing through con
siderable thicknesses of water.
               Experiments with Screens of Chemical Solutions.*
    1 employed saturated solutions of ammoniated               cupric oxide and of
potassium bichromate : as is well known, the first cuts off all the red,
orange, and yellow rays as far as the line b (in the green), while the
second outs off the blue- violet from the line b onwards.
    On January 10,       I  made two plates of spores in agar, poured from
the same tube, and alike in all respects : they remained at 8 — 10° C.
till the 12th, when each was exposed.                  One was covered with a
0tencil in which the letter T was cut, put behind a screen of am
moniated cupric oxide, the glass faces of which measured each -jsf inch,
and the solution -fa inch ; the other, with an exactly similar letter T,
behind a screen of potassium bichromate, measuring ^ inch in thick
ness of each glass, and        -/j inch of the solution.
    They were exposed to the south, side by side, on the 12th and 13th,
both dull days, with a gleam of sunshine for about one hour and two
hours respectively.         A large concave mirror was also placed so as to
 throw more light on each, as equally as possible.                 The temperature
rose to 20° C. occasionally, but not beyond.               On the 14th they were
 exposed      for three hours        to dull diffuse     daylight, there being no
 sunshine.
    •  Such screens have been used, e.g., by Janowtki (" Zur Biologie der Typhus-
bacillen," 'Centralbl. f. Bakt.,' vol. 8, 1890, p. 167), but both his methods and
results eere different.    It is inferred that the red rays are active, but his screen
 (a  solution of fuchsin)  probably  allowed transmission of violet rays, as I have con
 vinced myself by spectroscopical     examination.

1893.]         A ction of Light on Bacillus anthracis.                    •29
   On January 16, the plate behind the thick blue screen showed an
extremely faint letter; that behind the thinner and much more trans
parent orange screen, a letter, perhaps as distinct, but also extremely
faint. The inhibition here was very slight indeed, and the effects
were obliterated after a few hours' further incubation ; moreover, I
found that with a stronger solution of the potassium bichromate than
I could use in the very cold weather, the inhibiting rays are kept
out altogether.
    On January 14 an agar plate of anthrax spores, made the previous
day and kept for twenty hours at 5 — 7° C., was exposed for five hours
to brilliant sunlight behind a thick screen of ammoniated cupric oxide ;
the light had to traverse the two glass faces of the screen (each
•Jj- inch), and that of the plate — the bottom of a Petri's dish —as well
as the solution, which was        inch thick. When held up to the sun,
                                   y7,
the latter was just plainly visible through the deep violet blue solu
tion but the letter
    ;                     of the stencil plate covering the culture was
                            T
perfectly invisible.
   On the same date, and exposed for the same time, side by side
.with the above culture, an exactly similar plate poured from the same
tube, Ac., was put behind a screen of potassium bichromate, which was
so transparent that the letter (also       T) of the stencil plate was
                                              a
distinctly visible through it. Moreover, this screen was only ^\ inch
thick, and each glass face TV inch.
   On January 16, i.e., after little more than twenty-four hours' in
 cubation, the plate from behind the blue screen, showed a perfectly
 sharp letter T, whereas there was no trace as yet on that from behind
 the orange screen     the latter plate, however, showed an extremely
                        ;
faint letter after two more days' incubation, proving that the rays
transmitted   through        the potassium bichromate solution were slightly-
inhibitory, though          very much less so than those passing the am
moniated cupric oxide.
   Further experiments, in which the two screens were interchanged,
only confirmed these results, and carried them step further, showing
                                                     a
that the light passing through the blue solution, whether in the thick
or the thin screen, always gives a sharp and clear letter, whereas that
through the orange solution, exposed side by side, and for the same
time,    always very faint,
         is                     comes out at all, and
                                  if     it               only appeared
                                                             it
 in my earlier experiments, when, owing to the low temperatures, the
 bichromate solution was too dilute.       Not only so, but the very dim
 blue light (as estimated by the eye) which traverses the thick screen
 of copper salt     far more bactericidal than the much brighter orange
                   is
 light transmitted through the thinner screen. In other words, the
 more refrangible blue rays are the effective ones in destroying the life
 of the spores.

  30               Prof. Marshall Ward.          Experiments     on the   [Feb. 16,
       Experiments with Spores and Food Material on Separate Plates.
     In order      to test   still further the accuracy of my previous conclu
  sions, that the bactericidal action of the sunlight is direct, and not
  due to secondary effects, owing to changes in the food material,                  I
  carried ont the following modifications of the experiments.
     Agar tubes of anthrax, cultivated for several days at 25" C, were
  selected and examined for spores ; those were selected which exhibited
 a rich crop of thoroughly mature spores.                As is well known, it is
 possible to remove from such cultures the thick, yellowish, creamy
 layer of spore material without taking any appreciable quantity of
 the agar, and great care was employed to accomplish this successfully.
 Having shaken up these spores in sterile distilled water in a test-
 tube,  I   poured a few drops of the infected liquid into each of several
 Petri's dishes at 70° C., in a hot-air oven at that temperature, and
 replaced the dishes to allow the water to evaporate into the hot air
 during the cooling down of the whole. After two or three hours
 the water had evaporated completely ; or, if not, the oven was heated
 up again to 70°, and the drying completed, leaving a thin film of dry
 spores sticking to the bottom of the glass dish. All bacilli and
 immature spores were of course killed by the high temperature, and
 only the thoroughly ripe and resistant spores left alive.
    These plates were then wrapped up with suitable stencil plates, &c.,
 exactly as in my previous experiments, and exposed to sunlight, as
 before described.
    For    each plate of spores alone thus prepared,          I also made a corre
 sponding plate of agar alone, and exposed these side by side with
 the plates of spores.
    Obviously, if the bactericidal action was direct, it ought to be
manifested on the cultures of spores alone, if those spores not killed
by the light could be made to develop in a thin layer of fresh agar
poured on the plates after exposure ; whereas, if indirect, and due to
changes in the agar, the effect ought to be visible by spreading a thin
layer of fresh spores over the agar which had been insolated.
    If both effects occur, then both sets of plates should show the
positive results.
    Of course this was a case where negative results with both plates
conld not be used for any useful conclusions; for it is quite con
ceivable that the destructive light-action might not occur in dry
spores, or that some volatile body* might be formed in the agar,
which was rapidly dissipated in the water used for the sowing of
fresh spores after insolation ; or again, the agglutinated layers of dry
spores might shelter one another from the sun's rays, and so inter-
   • E.g.,  it is not inconceivable that hydrogen peroxide might be formed from the
moisture in the agar.

1893.]           Action of Light    on  Bacillus anthracis.             31
fere  with the results obtainable when the spores are distributed
through a matrix of agar. Finally, it was possible that the aerobian
dry spores would not germinate with a layer of agar .poured over them,
althongh I employed the thinnest coverings possible.
   On the other hand, positive results with the dried spores would be
conclusive as to the main point at issue ; the actual results seem to
me to set the matter at rest, for they prove that the action of the
solar rays is direct on the ripe spores, and that the food material of the
culture media is not appreciably concerned at nil (see Table III).
   Passing over a number of experiments where gelatine was em
ployed, and which were rejected because this medium is too soft and
rnns too easily to yield good prints, I select the following: —
   On January 20 two plates of plain agar were made as thin as
possible; one (Table III, A) had a stencil C, the other (Table III, B)
an H, for its letter.     On January 22 two plates were also made as
follows :— Two Petri's dishes were heated to 130° C. in the hot-air
oven : when the temperature of the oven had fallen to 90° C., each
plate received a few drops of sterile distilled water strongly infected
with anthrax spores, and the fluid was distributed as evenly as possible
over the base of the hot dishes. The whole was then left to cool,
when each dish had a thin film of the dry spores sticking to it. One
(Table III, C) was covered with a stencil letter H, the other
(Table III, D) with a small B.
   All four plates were exposed daily till January 27, but the weather
was so dull that they received practically no sun on the 20th to the
26th inclusive : the 27th was very bright, however, and each plate
had at least five hours' good insolation       that day.    At sundown   I
distributed spores in water on the two pure gelatine plates, and a
thin layer of gelatine over the two plates of pure spores.
   On the 29th the letter H was clearly visible on the one plate of the
dried spores (Table III, C), and the B faintly marked and blurred on
the other (Table III, D), proving that spores had been killed over
the area — H and B — exposed to light, but not elsewhere ; whereas
the two plates made with agar only were uniformly covered with the
anthrax growth, showing that the spores had germinated equally all
over, and therefore that the agar exposed to the sun (on the areas C
and H) was not rendered incapable of supporting their growth.
   On January 27      I  made two thin plates of agar only, without
spores, and two plates of spores only, dried at 70° C., as described
above.
   Two of these plates (Table     III, E and G) were exposed forthwith
at  1 p.m., and received over two hours' direct sunlight.       Each was
then — about 3.30 P.M. —put in the incubator, after receiving a charge
of gelatine (on the spores) and of spores in water (on the agar)
 respectively.

    On the 29th the spores had germinated all over on both plates, and
the results were negative.           This was probably in part due to the
exposure being too short.           Nothing was gained by keeping the agar
plate another day.
    Of the other two plates, the agar preparation (Table III, F) was
exposed again daily till February 1 inclusive : this latter date was
the first sunny day ensaing, the intervening ones being dull or wet.
The other spore plate (Table III, H) was not put out till January 28,
as it was not quite dry on the 27th ; it received the same exposure
otherwise.
    On February 1 there were at least four hours' good bright sun
shine — more probably, only I allowed for interruptions by clouds.
Other details may be seen by referring to Table III, E to H.
     On February 3 no trace of a letter could be detected on the agar
plate (Table III, F), and the spores sown thereon were germinating
evenly all over ; whereas a perfectly sharp and distinct C was visible
on the spore plate (Table III, H), although it had only been in-
solated for four hours instead of six.
     It is not necessary to detail all the confirmatory experiments, and
I   will conclude with the following : —
     On January 29 I made three plates of agar alone and three of
spores (Table III, I to N), drying off the latter at 70° to 60° C. All
were left till January 31, because the 30th was a very dull day.
 They were all put out on the 31st, but did not receive more than
 15 — 30 minntes of interrupted sunshine at midday.          February 1 was
 a bright day, and each plate had at least four hours' direct sun. One
 of each of the plates (Table III, I and N) was then incubated, after
 receiving      its reciprocal charge — agar on the spores, spores on the
 agar.     The others were left for further exposure.
     On February 3 the agar plate showed no trace of its letter (a
 small B), whereas the spore plate showed a beautifully sharp +, the
 shape of the area exposed, and over which the dry ripe spores were
 killed.    February 2 was a dull day, and the 3rd rainy, so that the
 remaining        plates got no sun until February 4, which was a beauti
 fully bright day, giving me at least five hours' clear sunshine.
      Two more plates, however (i.e., one of each kind, Table III, K
 and M), were put into the incubator at 8.30 a.m. on the 4th, and
 had therefore only received the four hours' real sunshine credited
  to the preceding plates, though of course they had been exposed to
  two more days' diffused daylight.         See Table III.  I havo recently
  modificd this procedure, however, to try to obviate the following
  difficulty.
      I found     that it is very difficult to pour the agar, Ac., over the
  film of insolated spores without sweeping some of the non-insolati-d
  ones over the area left uncovered, and vice versa ; and, again, it is not

34             Prof. Marshall Ward.           Experiments on     the   [Feb. 16,
easy to wash a perfectly even          layer of spores over the insolated agar
or gelatine.     Further,    a  critic might object that sowing spores on the
upper surface only of the insolated agar might yield negative results,
because the light-action does not extend through the entire thickness
of the plate, or because some volatile body is formed which is
washed off with the sowing.
   My new procedure is as follows : — I make, for instance, two plates
of dried spores only, and two of agar only, all as before.                 I then
expose   one  plate  of  each   kind,  and  keep  the others in the  dark.
   After exposure I remove the stiff and moist film of non-exposed agar
from its own plate, and superpose it on the exposed film of dried spores
                             I
in situ. Reciprocally, remove the film of exposed agar, and superpose
it on the non-exposed     film of dried spores.
    This prevents any wash or displacement, and ensures at the same
time that the agar shall present in contact with the spores that face
which was next the source of light.
    So far I have been unable to observe any appreciable effect on the
agir, though the dried spores exposed for an equal period are killed
in abundance. Whether exposure to more intense sunlight will make
it necessary to modify this must await experiment.
                Preliminary Results with       the Spores of Fungi.
    Results substantially the same as the above are obtainable with
other Schizomycetes, but it was interesting to see whether anything of
the kind occurs with the spores of true Fuugi. The time of year has,
for many reasons,      been    unfavourable for very numerous experiments,
but the results so far are extremely encouraging, and should, I think,
give a stimulus to close enquiry into the whole subject.
    I have so far employed the following species : — Penicillium crus-
 taceum,   Aspergillus glaucus, Botrytis cinerea, Chalara mycoderma,
 Oidium    lactis, Nectria cinnabarina, ifucor racemosus, Saccharomyces
                      " Stysanus" conidial form met with some months
pyriformis, and a
 ago as a saprophyte on Pandanus.
    On making agar and gelatine plates of these as before,                 I have
 obtained positive results with Oidium (5 cases), Chalara (1 case),
 Saccharomyces (4 cases), Stysanus (2 cases), and negative results with
Aspergillus (5 cases), Penicillium         (2 cases), Mucor (2 cases), Nectria
 (4 cases), and Botrytis (2 cases).
    It seems worth      noting that, in all the forms which have given me
a positive    result right off, the spores, as seen in masses, are either
hyaline and colourless, or, in the case of the Stysanus, with a faint
tinge of buff ; whereas those which gave negative results are either
of some very pronounced colour, as Aspergillus, Penicillium, and
Nectria, or (Hucor and Botrytis) of a dull, yellow-brown             hue.

     It remains to be seen whether any explanation can be given that
meets     all the facts. The following suggestions seem fairly deducible
so   far.
     The spore      is,   in its fully ripe condition,   a remarkably passive body,
and   contains a smaller or larger                  store of reserve food materials,
generally of an oily or fatty nature.
   It   commonly conceded that tbe ripe spores of bacteria contain
          is                                                                            a
highly refringent substance like oil, and we know from the almost
universal occurrence of fat-like oils in the spores of Fungi and other
plants, including pollen grains, that such bodies constitute a very
common form of reserve material.      Not only so, but the resistance of

ligible     they
               ifcontain fatty substances.    This, of course,  does not
exclude the importance of the membrane and the other contents of a
spore in regard to its power of resistance.
   It appears at least possible that the bactericidal action of the
light is due to its destructive influence, in presence of oxygen, on the
fatty matters or other oxidisable substances forming the reserve
materials of the spore.        Dnclaux* has at any rate shown that
vegetable oils, such as olive and palm oils, are rapidly oxidised
ifexposed to light, and, although we ougbt to be very careful in de
ducing any explanation of physiological phenomena directly from
chemical   experiments, we have here the significant fact that       the      it   is
rays known to be so commonly concerned in promoting chemical
changes which are concerned in destroying the spores.        The spores
are, in their passive resting state, to   certain extent comparable to a
                                                    a
flask of oil exposed to oxidation in the sunlight.        Moreover, the
bacilli, which contain little or no fat, and the protoplasm of which                    is
far more accessible to the light, are found to resist the bactericidal
action of the light to a much greater extent than the spores.
   Of course,    may turn out that the action of the light
                    it                                        more pro   is
found than the simple explanation offered assumes, and that the
physiological properties of the protoplasm are deeply concerned, but
I cannot help thinking that      this were the case we ought to obtain
                                        if
more evidence of the action with the actively growing bacilli than
seems to be forthcoming from the results of the experiments.     In any
case,    must be allowed that the solar action
          it                                        direct on something
                                                                  is

    The assumption that the action is direct on some oxidisable body,
like   a fat, in the spore would help us to explain a good many facts,
and among others the death of the protoplasm, if insolation is com
plete, because we know how intolerant of traces of acids Bacillus
anthracis is, and inhibition and attenuation if the insolation is incom
plete, and the protoplasm not so far injured that it cannot work up
the remnants of reserve materials left.
    That this point is one well worth further investigation is too ob
vious to dwell upon here, and I hope to succeed yet in discovering
what is the body destroyed.

     There are, so far as can discover, very few statements to hand a=
 to the influence of light on spores other than bacteria,* and their
 germination ; and, indeed, as shown by Elfving's excellent summary
 of the literature in his ' Studien uber die Einwirkung des Lichtef-
 auf die Pike,' as to the influence of light on Fungi in general. It has
 been the custom to regard the effects of light on the Fungi as not
 essentially different      from those on other plants ; in accordance with
 De Bary's general statement to that end on pp. 352 — 353 of his
 ;
   Comp. Morphol. and Biol.,' Engl. Ed., 1887.
     Zopf (' Die Pilze,' 1890, p. 199) believes that light, as a rule,
 exerts no influence whatever, either on the germination of the spores
 or on the development of the mycelium, though he himself quotes De
 Bary's and Wettstein's statements to the contrary, and I have myself
 observed similar cases.
     De Bary (' Ann. des Sc. Nat.,' vol. 20, 1863, p. 40) found that the
zoospores of certain Peronosporeae               are inhibited by light in their
germination, e.g., P. maerocarpa and Phytophthora infestans, a fact I
should correlate with their delicate walls and want of protective
colour screen.        On the other hand, L)e Bary ('Ann. des Sc. Nat.,'
IV Series, vol. 20, 1863, p. 54) showed experimentally that the
pustules of Uromyces appendiculatus appear preferably on that side of
the leaf which receives most light, and this is indicated by their
occurrence on the upper faces of these organs, facts quite in accord
ance with the deep orange-red colour of this fungus.
    In Uromyces and others of these orange Uredineae, the colouring
matter is associated with fatty drops (Bachmann, " Spectroskop.
U liters, von Pilz-farbstoffen," in ' Progr. des Gymnas. zu Plauen,'
Ostern, 1886, pp. 9, 21), and shows two absorption bands, one on the
boundary between the green and the blue near F, the other in the

Zopf        (' Die Pilze,'
                    p. 145) showed.
   In short, the whole series of red, orange, and yellow pigments of
fungus spores and flowers are at least calculated to act as screens
which cut off more or less of the blue end sf the spectrum, and they
agree remarkably throughout in this particular.
   Hoffmann (' Pringsh. Jahrb.,' II, p. 321) observed that the spores
of Uredo destruens germinated as well in light as in dark, whereas
those of Agaricus campestris, in one case, germinated better in the
dark than in the light —both cultures side by side.*    Light did not
interfere with the germination of Fusarium heterosporium (a red form
on   Rye), Triehothedum roseum, Penicillium- glaucum, Uredo destruens,
and U. segetum.     Herer again, we have the red-yellow pigments pre
dominating,    and,           I
                     suggest, acting as screens^ With regard to Peni-
rillium, it must by no means- be concluded that the peculiar bluish-
green hue gives us any information as to the rays transmitted to the
interior of the conidium : the spores of Aspergillus appear yellowish
by transmitted light, though, like Penicillium, they are blue-green by
reflected light, when seen in large masses.
   Low (' Verhandl. d. Zool.-bot. Gesellsch. in Wien,.' 18G7) also finds
no effect of light on Penicillium and Mueor stolonifer : so far as Peni
cillium is concerned, this confirms Hoffmann, and my own attempts
with  it and with Aspergillus glaucus are- in accordance.
   Wettstein (' Sitzungsb. d. Wiener Akad.,' 1885, B. 41, p. 39) found
that light inhibits the germination     of the very delicate conidia of
lihod<miyces Kochii,&  parasite in the human   alimentary canal.
   As regards my own older experiences with germinating spores, I
hare a vivid recollection of the great difficulties experienced in 18So-
with the conidia of Phytophthora infestans, and although the meaning
of the facts observed was not then, clear to me, reference to my paper
on  this fungus in the ' Quart. Journ. Micr. Sc.,' vol. 27, N.S., 1867,
p. 422, proves that the idea of increased oxidation under the influence
of intense light had already suggested itself to me.
   During my investigations into the biology of the orange-yellow
Uredine. Hemileia vastatrix, the fungus of the Coffee-leaf disease, on
the other hand, the impression is equally clear that little or no
difficultyoccurred with germinations of any of these orange-coloured
spores, even in the intense tropical light of Ceylon.
   Many similar, but less vivid, impressions of the connexion between
light and germination occur to me, but little can be said as to their
value         now.
      L. Klein (' Bot. Zeit.,' 1885, No. 1, p. 6) found that, as Rindfleisch

      * At the same time, there is
                                   possibly a slight confusion here, for De Bary states
     (p.
           352) that the   germination of A. campestris   has never been certainly observed.

  conidial branches are not completed before suurise, the whole process
 stops till the darkness comes on again, and this, no matter when the
 sowings are made. Klein also proved that this inhibition is due to
 the blue-violet rays, and is in abeyance in proportion as they are
 removed.
     Here, then, we have the light action effective in preventing the
 storage of the spore materials, just as it is in germination in prevent
 ing their return into the area of metabolic activity.
     Sorokin found (' Botan. Jahresbericht,' 1874, p. 214) that if fresh
 horse-dung is placed under screens of white glass, bichromate of
 potassinm, and ammoniated cupric oxide, in the light, for twenty-five
 days, and compared with one another and with specimens in the dark,
 the feeblest crops of fungi were obtained in the blue light.
    Laurent (* Comptes Rend. Soc. roy. de Bot. de Belgique,' T. 28 (2),
 1889, p. 162) exposed spores of Ustilago carbo in glass flasks to
 direct sunlight, in July, and found eight hours' insolation killed them ;
 whereas the controls were all right, and sixteen hours' insolation
 behind a screen of quinine sulphate, cutting off the ultra-violet, did
 not prevent their germination.       The spores of Aspergillus niger, A.
 glaucus, Botrytis    cinerea, and  Cladosporium proved much more re
 sistant.    The spores of Penicillium were also found to succumb to
 insolation.
    Elfving found (' Studien Uber die Einw. d. Lichtes auf die Pilze,'
 1890, p. 105) that intense sunlight in summer inhibited the germina
 tion of Aspergillus, but even several days or weeks of insolation did
 not kill the fully ripe spores.    If they had begun to germinate, how
ever, the first germinal stages were very sensitive to sunlight ; and
they were equally sensitive when just developed, i.e., just before
ripening.
    The whole tenor of Elfving's work, which is more particularly con
 cerned with the vegetative myoelia and the weight of substance
developed, is to show that light inhibits the metabolic processes the
younger the tissues are, and the more the absorbed food materials ap
proximate to the raw state. This is not contradictory of my idea that
the light destroys such substances as oily reserve materials directly
in presence of oxygen, and there is nothing surprising in the
action being facilitated on the germination of the spore — no doubt
the most dangerous moment is that when the material begins to pass
into the area of metabolic activity in the germinal hypha.
    The consideration of the above and other facts led me to formulate
to myself the following hypothesis : —
    No plant exposes a reserve store of fatty food materials to the danger
of prolonged or intense insolation without a protective colour screen,
calculated to cut out at least the blue-violet rays, as these rays would

tion.
                                    Colours of Fungi.
    One of the most interesting           cases for our purpose is the colours of
the spores     of Fungi.* I find very little information as to the correla
tion between the habits of Fungi and the colour of their spores ; but
a somewhat hurried examination of the matter has yielded the follow
ing information       : —
    Taking the higher Hymenomycetes first, since more attention has
been     paid to the colour of their spores, as is well known, the large
genns of Agaricus is usually broken up into five groups, according to
the prevailing colour of the basidio-spores.               I confine myself to the
British species.
    Of the white-spored Agarics (Leucospori)               I find that Stevensonf
mentions about 400, and of these the vast majority are found in
woods, and many of those occurring in pastures seem to me to be
probably well sheltered by the herbage.                CookJ notices that they are
in contrast with the dark-spored groups in not growing on dung or
in rank places.
    As regards the next set, the Hyporhodii or pink-spored forms, it
appears not withont significance that, while some grow in open
 woods, about two-thirds are found in more exposed situations.                      Mr.
 Plowrigbt     was   under     the   impression   that  the  spores  of    these Hypo
 rhodii germinate easily ; if this is so the fact is significant.
     The Dermini, with yellowish to clay-coloured spores, present mixed
 features ; it seems to me that not quite half grow in more or less
 woodland places, often very open,            while a little more than half grow
 in more      exposed     situations.     It must be noted, however, that the
 colours of the spores in this group vary more as to shade than in any
 of the others.
     The fourth group of Agarics are the Pratelli, with spores of very
 various shades of purple tinged with black or with fuscous hues,
 and passing into brown, violet, slaty, and even pink hues.                        The
 majority by far grow in exposed places.
     There is a curious remark in Stevenson, regarding these Pratelli :
 "
    It is to be observed that the spores vary in colour according to tho
  colour of the ground on which they are deposited."                        This seems
  clearly to   indicate     that   these   spores respond    to  the   kind    of light
  they receive, and seems worth pursuing further.
     Lastly, we have the black-spored Coprinarii, none of which are
     * Elfving
               (loc. eit., p. 53) suggests that the coloured pileus of some Hymeno

typically wood-fungi, and nearly all of which grow in                     open exposed
situations, on dung, &c.
   If I sum up the foregoing remarks about the genus Agaricus, it
amounts to this : There are nearly 800 British species described, and
of these 400 or so are white-spored, and nearly all grow in the shade
of woods, the remainder chiefly in the long grass of meadows, Ac.,
the remaining moiety, a little short of 400 more, have spores of
various colours (pink, yellow, brown, purplish, and black, &c.)> and
grow for the most part in places more exposed to the light.
   Generally speaking, the same seems to hold good for the other
genera of Agaricini.               Coprinus has black spores, and grows in
exposed places on dung, and similarly with the rusty-spored Bolbitius.
Lactarius, Russula, and Cantharellus have white to yellowish spores,
and grow in woods.
   At   the same time there are difficulties.              The genus Cortinarius is
a large     one, of about 130 species, with yellowish spores, and all, or
nearly all, grow in woods ; whereas Hygrophorus, a white-spored
genus, comprising a little over fifty species, has half of them growing
in " grassy places."           It may be that a closer examination of the
habits and spores will help us to explain several points, and it is in
teresting to note the following remark anent H. leporimis (Fr.), a
form growing on the downs : " The spores have a pale umber tint,"*
and Stevenson says the same.f
    Again, summing up, the other genera of Agaricini number about 400
 species, of which somewhat more than half are white-spored, and all
typically woodland forms, except about twenty-five species of Hygro
phorus : the other moiety have coloured spores, principally tawny,
 and it is not easy to generalise about them, except that most grow in
 the shade.
    I  have been able to get very little information about the colour of
 the spores in Polyporei, but in the genus Boletus there are about
 forty species, the spores of which vary in colour considerably.                     Most
 of them are shade forms, but at least five occur in the open : their
 spores are ochre, yellow-brown, and green-brown.                      I   can only find
 one form with white, or rather sub-hyaline, spores — it grows in pine
 woods.
    As regards Polyporus, the colour of the                 spores is rarely known.
 P.   ccesius  is said to have pale blue spores ;J it grows on dead firs.
 Several have white spores — all wood species.
    Passing over a number of forms which need investigating in this
 connexion, we may glance at the genus Clavaria.                    Out of more than
 forty species,    I  find fifteen with white spores, and these seem pretty

equally divided       between woods and pastures.             It seems likely that
the    bright colours (often yellow)            of   the  hymenophores standing
upright among the blades of grass are of importance in this genus,
but the     matter requires looking into.
    Uredineae are all orange to orange-brown, and remarkably brilliant
and    well screened. Moreover, we have information as to the optical
properties      of their colouring matters, &c., as already stated.*             It is
surely    a  significant  fact that   these  bright orange     Fungi   are especially
leaf parasites, exposed to the full sunlight, direct or reflected, during
their whole course of spore formation, &c.
     Ustilaginem are all dark spored ; they look black in the mass, but
the colour is oftener a warm brown, and seems admirably adapted to
their habits.        The conidial     forms   are   developed     in shade on the
ground.
    Ascomycetes require more examination            as regards the colours of the
spores,     but it is well known      that many asco-spores are dark-coloured
or tawny, and the Nectrias             aud Pe»izas show how thoroughly well
screened the developing asci          are.
    The reds of the Nectrias           have been examined by Bachmann and
Zopf ; these colours may well be correlated with the exposure of the
perithecia and conidia in winter.
    The dark colours of the Sphaeiacem and their allies are also probably
of use as screens, and the similar coatings to Sclerotia, which con
tain large stores of reserves, may also be mentioned.
    There are certainly many more cases which seem to be explained by
the hypothesis ; but        I will now turn to a few difficulties.
    I suppose the yellow stroma of Epicldoe sufficiently shields the
asco-spores in the sunken perithecia, but it seems difficult to explain
the purple stroma of the allied genns Claviceps ; nor can I explain
some other cases of purples and blues as yet.
     Bachmann, whose work on the spectroscopic analysis of fungus
pigments I have already referred to, investigated these colours from
all parts of the plants concerned, and dealt with spores only, or
 almost only, in the case of Uredineae.             Consequently     I  cannot utilise
 his other results directly.         At the same time it is worthy of notice,
 that on      looking over Bachmann's forty-two absorptiou-spectra of
 colours     of   Fungi — including reds, violets, and orange hues — it is
 significant that the extreme blue-violet, from the line G onwards, is
 cat ont entirely in all but two cases, in each of which the absorp
 tion begins on the violet side of G.
     The extreme red, near the line           A,   seems   always to be absorbed
 also.
     Then we find differences.         The red pigments of Russula, Cladonia,

42             Prof. Marshall Ward.        Experiments on  the   [Feb.  16,
Agaricus peziza, Oomphidius cut out most or all of the blue and green
entirely, and in some cases, in fact — e.g., Peziza sanguined — only allow
red and a little orange to pass at all.
   Now comes a curious point with regard to the violet pigments of
Cortinarius, Agaricas, and Lactarius.       According to Bachmann, they
cut out all the red below the line B, and all the indigo-violet beyond
the line G, together with more or less of the blue-green.         Stranger
still, the violet pigment of Lactarius deliciosus cuts out everything
beyond the line D except a little blue between F and G, and trans
mits most of the red-orange and yellow.
   Bachmann himself points out that two colouring matters, a yellow
and a violet, occur side by side, and he also refers to the transient
nature of some of these violet colours, which turn yellow with age.
   Since such cases may be common, we must not accept a violet pig
ment without close examination, for it may be due to a mixture, or to
superposition, or to other causes, and is by no means necessarily a
colour screen in the sense that the orange and red pigments of others
are.
   The orange-yellow pigments of the spores of several Uredineae show
spectra very uniform in type. The indigo-violet from G onwards all goes
out, and strong absorption bands are formed in the blue between F and
G, and again at the line F. Most of the red, orange, and green are
transmitted.     Bachmann shows that the oily masses in these spores of
Uredineae are true fats, and the orange colouring pigments are
associated with them. In connexion with the easy germination of
such spores, it is interesting to note that these    orauge-coloured fatty
drops pass into the germinal hyphae.
   As regards the colours in Phycomycetes, we know almost nothing of
use   in the present connexion. The spores and sporophores are often
coloured with yellow or orange pigment, e.g., Pilobolus, Mucor, Chytri-
diacem, but, although Zopf says (' Die Pilze,' p. 148) these colours are
also associated with fats, they still require spectroscopic investigation.
                                   Pollen.
   Another very interesting case is that of pollen, the microspores of
the flowering plants.    It is obvious that the pollen grains are often
exposed for many hours to intense insolation in the concave cup of
the corollas of many flowers and on the bodies of bees and other
sun-loving insects. Now a pollen grain is just such a storehouse of
fatty oils as, according to my view, ought to be protected from the
destructive rays, and in the vast majority of cases the deep orange
colours of these spores accord well with the purpose suspected.
   Even in the very few references to the colours of pollen that      I can
find, however, there are cases which at first sight seemed to present
great difficulties.

1893.]              A ction of Light  on   Bacillus anthracis.            43
    Fischer (' Beitr. zur Vergl. Morphol. d. Pollenkorner,' Breslau,
1890) says that most colours can be found in pollen, and that the
pigment usually, but not always, occurs in the exine, i.e., the outer
coat of   the spore, and not in the contents, a fact very well in accord
ance    with the view that the colour acts as a screen, though Fischer
regards the coloured oily body as a sticky medium to facilitate the
adherence of the body to the insect.
    Among the comparatively rare pollen which is not yellow or orange
the following may be mentioned          : —
    Pollen is white in Actaea, Bichardia, and other Aroideae, and some
species    of Iris, as Professor M. Foster informs mo. In the last cases,
however, Professor Foster adds that the white is a dead one.           Actaea
 8 a shade plant, and in Aroide®            the rule is for the pollen to be
formed and        remain in the tube of the spathe, whence these cases
may     not really be exceptions.
    The red pollens of LiUum chalcedonium and some other Lilies, Ver-
 bascum, Clerodendron cermum, and C. Thomsoni (Fischer), and some
Geraniums, and the red-browns of other Lilies and of JEscwlus, passing
into deeper browns       in some Poppies,     are not inconsistent with their
 being screens against blue      light.
    The cases which promise serious trouble, however, are the blue
 pollens of certain Irises, Epilobiums, some Polemoniacaea, Scilla sibi-
rica; some Poppies (e.g., Papaver orientate and P. bracteatum)             are
 almost pure blue, according to Fischer.
     Certain species of Linum, Anemone, Althaea, Agapanthus, Gilia,
 Echium, and a few Caryophyllaceae            are also said to be of various
 shades of blue or violet, and they appear as wituesses against the
 above generalisation.       At the same time it must be borne in rnincl
 that   blue pollen is rare, that we know little or nothing of the
 spectroscopic      and other optical properties of these pigments, and
 that it may turn out that special peculiarities in the biology of the
 plant are correlated with this colour.
     Fischer mentions (loc. cit., p. 10) some species of Geranium,
 the pollen of which appears steel-blue ; this colour is due to the
 presence    of a very volatile blue oil, which rapidly disappears as the
  pollen   is exposed, and leaves the latter dark yellow in colour.          If
  many    such cases occur, blue pollen may turn out to be easily
  explained.
                                  Other Instances.
     It is obvious, however,    that if the foregoing explanation of colour
   screens is true, it will have a much wider application than I have as
   Jet given it.    The following are probably examples in point : —
      Sporangia and spores of all kinds among the vascular Cryptogams
   are usually some tint of orange or sienna — e.g., Ferns, Lycopodium,

44                   Action of Light       on  Bacillus anthracis.          [Feb. 16,
Selaginella, &c.        The tufts of archegonia and antheridia in Mosses*
are often orange to red.
   Nor are Algae wanting in good examples. I take it the oogonia
and antheridia of the Characeae are cases in point ; and the yellow
pigment accompanying the antherozooids and oospheres of Fucus as
they ooze from the conceptacles at low tide probably serves as a
colour screen.
   The red stigmas of Corylus would also seem to be one of many
similar    cases   in point; but, unless the Gramineoe have their plumose
stigmas rapidly withdrawn into the shadow of the paleae, they would
seem to be witnesses against me.
    The matter will probably not end with snch cases as I have cited,
and I am strongly inclined to regard chlorophyll as serving the part
of a colour screen in the sense indicated, as well as that of an instru
ment! of assimilation.             This is by no means the same as Prings-
heims's screen theory of chlorophyll, but it may well be that the
great absorption in the blue and violet has a screen effect.
                       Some    Practical Bearings of      the Results.
    The establishment of the fact of the bactericidal and fungicidal
action of light, dating from Downes and Blunt to now, enables us to
see much more clearly into the causes of several phenomena known
to practical agriculturists, foresters, hygienists, &c.
    It helps to explain, for example, why the soil of a forest should
 not be exposed to the sun, a dogma long taught in schools ; it will
 also affect our way of regarding bare fallows.                  It has already been
 shown how important is its bearing on the purification of rivers, and
 the reasoning obviously applies to dwellings, towns, &c.                  I regard it
 as probably explaining many discrepancies in the cultures of Sehizo-
 mycetes and Fungi in our laboratories, and as having a very im
 portant bearing indeed on the spreading of plant epidemics in dull
 weather in the summer, and no doubt this applies to other cases on
          I
 which can speak with no authority.
    That sunshine has something to do with the rarity of bacterial
 diseases in plants now seems quite as probable as the currently
 accepted view that the acid nature of the latter accounts for the
 fact.
     If that part of the chlorophyll which absorbs the blue- violet is a
 screen to prevent the destruction of easily oxidisable bodies, as they
 are formed in the chloroplasts, we may reconcile several old experi
 mental discrepancies — e.g., the behaviour of plants under bichromate
 and cupric oxide screens.
    * The calyptra may be of service      as a screen in another way.
    t Elfving   also (loc. cit., p. 54) hints that the chlorophyll may serve as a screen
 in  so far as to prevent certain destructive metabolic actions in synthesis.

        cated by Professor E. Ray LANKESTER, F.R.S. Received

                                       (Abstract.)
    The object of this investigation is to study the changes undergone
by the species of a small group of Butterflies as they are traced from
one locality to another, and to ascertain the bearing of these facts
upon the theory of mimicry.
    We find the representatives of the Indian Hypolimnas bolina
in a long list of localities in Malaya, Polynesia, and Africa : the
local representatives differ from each other and from the Indian form,
but they agree in possessing in one or both sexes a more or less
superficial resemblance to some conspicuous species belonging to a
specially defended group and inhabiting the same locality; the same
is true of the three forms of the female of Hypolimnas misippus.
    The facts afford the most convincing evidence of the truth of the
 theory of mimicry enunciated by H. W. Bates.
    The study of these numerous but closely-related forms belonging
 to   the genus Hypolimnas          also throws light upon such interesting
 questions as     :—
     (1.)   The special liability of the female to become mimetic.
     (-2.)  The ancestral form from which the various mimetic varieties
 have been      derived.
     (3.) The     mimetic     resemblance     to different   species in the same
 locality.
     (4.) The divergent         conditions   under   which mimicry     appears in
  closely-related    species.
     (5.) The relation between selection and          variation in the production
  of mimetic resemblance.

                                     (Abstract.)
     Bacterium      Zopfii was accidentally discovered by Kurth, in Zopf's
  laboratory,    in  the alimentary canal of the fowl.       He showed it to be
  pleomorphic, and observed its radiate mode of growth, and, in addi
  tion, its great tendency to form spirals.             It was rediscovered by
  Crookshank      in  Johne's laboratory   in Dresden    ; this observer obtained
  it from the air, and likewise noted the characteristic pinnate mode of
  growth.      He named it Bacterium figurans, on account of its figured
  appearance upon the solid nutrient media. We obtained it from a
  case of otitis media in the cat, in London.         These observations show
  that the organism is probably widespread.
     Mode of Growth of the Bacterium. — On gelatine it forms, under
  certain circumstances, a feather-like or pinnate growth upon the
  surface and in the gelatine, the branches of which are directed
  upwards at about an angle of 43°. Under no circumstances (accord
 ing to our observations) does it form a pinnate growth upon agar or
 potato.
     Action of Gravity. — The symmetrical pinnate growth could not be
 obtained in gelatine tubes which were kept horizontal or nearly so,
 whilst similar tubes kept vertical or nearly so exhibited the character
 istic growth.        A certain scale of symmetry could be obtained by
 placing the tubes at various angles between the vertical and hori
 zontal.     If a tube in which a pinnate     growth had been obtained was
 completely     reversed, a new pinnate growth         might be seen to cross
 the first, but it was not so marked as the latter. These observations
showed that Bacterium Zopfii was markedly susceptible to position,
and that the pinnate growth could only be obtained in or about the
vertical.      They pointed strongly to the influence of the action of

    Behaviour on the Clinostat. — If the force of gravity acting upon the
culture tube in the one position were prevented by slowly revolving
the growth in the vertical at rates from one revolution in one minute
to one in one hour, then the pinnate growth could not be obtained.
We assumed, therefore, that Bacterium Zopfii was subject to the
action of gravity, and that it was negatively geutropic.           But if it were

negatively geotropic, then         it ought also to     assume a centripetal direc
tion   if rapidly revolved.
    Action                               —
             of Centrifugal Fnrce. We repeated Knight's experiment,
communicated to the Royal Society in 180C, and revolved the culture
tubes iu the horizontal at the rate of three to five revolutions per second,
and we obtained most perfect pinnate growths, similar to those ob
tained by growing in the vertical.
    The Cause of the Pinnate Growth. — The growth is very rarely ortho-
geotropic ; there is a force hindering this, which we believe to be the
resistance   of the gelatine. Although the pinnate growth appears super
ficial, this is not so   ; the filaments tend to dip slightly or deeply into
the substance of the gelatine.          It is observed that where they penetrate
deeply into the gelatine they are almost horizontal at the bottom of the
gelatine, whilst nearly vertical at the top of the gelatine column.
These     differences are      still more accentuated when the tubes are
centrifugalised.
    Circumstances    which Favour or Retard the Symmetrical Growth. — It
is essential that the gelatine be not too stiff ; if it is hard, an irregular
superficial or an imperfect pinnate growth obtains.                     We employ a
freshly prepared        8   to   10   per   cent.  nutrient    gelatine.     A slight
variation in the reaction on the acid or alkaline side of neutrality
makes no appreciable difference.              Temperature has a very important
effect ;  symmetrical growths are with difficulty obtained at low tem
peratures ; the most suitable is that between 20° C. and 21° C.
Carbonic acid hinders the symmetrical growth ; oxygen favours it.
Thus, if a streak culture on gelatine is placed in an atmosphere of
CO», at the end of three days there is only a thick streak along the
line of inoculation       ; if  the   tube is then transferred to oxygen, a
(•yrametrical growth develops in the course of twelve to twenty-four
hours.     We have not yet observed any difference in the growth in the
colours   of the spectrum.
    Not only has the hardness of the gelatine a marked effect upon the
pinnate growth, but in addition the thickness of the gelatine sub
stratum is important.          Thus, we never obtained pinnate growths in
oar method of plate cultures on microscope slides.                      Even in Petri
boxes, with a thickness of gelatine varying from               j  inch to 1 inch, the
growth upon the surface often tended to be irregular, but in these cases
 the filaments    which grew deeply into the gelatine assumed the pinnate
 form, with the exception, as before mentioned, that the lowermost
 branches were more horizontal than those at the top.                  Thus, to obtain
 a pinnate growth      upon     the  surface,  the   test-tube   is  the best culture
 glass.
    Microscopic Characters of the Growth. — The organism is pleomorphic ;
 filamentous, bacillary, bacteroid, spiral, and coccal form phases being
  met  with.    There is also a motile stage, in which bacillary, bactoroid,

50      Upon the Action         of Gravity     on Bacterium Zopfii.        [Feb. 23,
and coccal forms predominate ; there appears to be an absence cf the
motile spiral form.         In the motile phase there is a very slight lique
faction of the gelatine, but for the rest there is no liquefaction
of the gelatine.          In addition to the differences of form of the
separate    elements,    there     appear certain phases in the grouping of the
bacteria.       Thus,    following        Billet,  we   divide   our growths into
filamentous,     di-associated,     skein, and zodgleaform    phases.   The filament
ous form is especially met           with in gelatine, and in the pinnate growths
the filaments are at         first   very long and hyphal-like, and are rapidly
growing, but segmentation follows early.                    If branching occurs it
appears to take place as in Cladothrix, by displacement of segments.
In the disassociated phase the segments break away from one another,
and may become motile. The skein phase is met with on hard gelatine
 and on agar ; it is a very superficial growth, and the filaments form
dense     plaits   ;  it is not met with in geotropic                 growths.    The
zodgleaform phase is very            characteristic, and usually rapidly follows
 upon   the  filamentous.        In   the filaments and segments multiplication
occurs either at scattered points in the chain or throughout its
 length, and the segments remain united by a common cementing
 substance ; the forms assumed by these aggregates are very beautiful,
 and are to be met with in the geotropic growths.
     The Spirillation. — The undivided or segmented filaments and the
 zoogleaform masses have a marked tendency to twist, especially in
 the pinnate gelatine cultures.              The majority of the twists are in the
 opposite direction of the hands of the clock.                     Kurth noted the
 spirillation, and attributed it to the resistance of the gelatine ;
 but as in the higher plants, perhaps here, the action of gravity is
 also a factor.       This consideration also opens up the meaning of the
 spiral form in the bacteria.
     Methods of Fixing and Staining employed. — Our preparations, from
 which the micro-photos were taken were obtained from plate cultures
 made    in the following manner : — A micro-slide in a large sterilised
 test  tube  is coated with a thin surface of sterilised gelatine by means
  of a balloon pipette.          After solidification the surface is inoculated
 with a streak. The growth may be examined either unstained or
  after fixing and staining.             To fix, the slide is withdrawn from the
  test-tube and placed in dilute alcohol, and then dried ; any stain can
  then be employed, and the preparation mounted in Canada balsam.

   The Function     of  the Pitchers. — The pitchers contain living ants and
acari, small     quantities    of insect remains, considerable amounts of
earth, humus, and water        ; but all these bodies and substances are not
found     in  each   pitcher.    The    earth   and   humus, though partially
brought to the pitchers by the agency of rain-water,             are mainly con
veyed    thither  by ants,  which    nest within   the pitchers. That the roots
within the pitchers utilise these solid matters is suggested by the
following facts, observed on living plants in the Botanic Garden,
Singapore : — -1. The roots are well developed in pitchers containing
a rich store of earth and humus.          2. Sometimes these solid substances
are arranged up the whole of one side of the cavity of the pitcher, in
which case the roots are more strongly developed on the same                side ;
these    phenomena, in some cases at any rate, could not have been
occasioned by water having previously been distributed in the pitcher
in the same manner.          3. Particles of earth are found clinging closely
to the root-hairs, which are always well developed in the presence of
solid substances.       Actual experiments on living plants prove that the
pitcher-roots can absorb liquids.           The pitchers are not mere water-
reservoirs ; they are depositories for solids from which, by means of
the roots within the pitchers, the plant derives part of its nutriment.
Probably the evolution of the pitchers has been, to a great extent,
determined by the myrmecophilous habits of the plant.
    Structure of the Roots. — In the young state there is an epidermis,
many of the cells of which grow out to form root-hairs.              The hairs of
the climbing roots are more numerous on the side towards the sup
porting stem or branch of the host-plant               (" ventral side "), where
they form a mycelium-like           weft.    The hairs of the roots within the
pitchers are more      uniformly distributed, but are numerous and short
at regions    where the root is in contact with the pitcher- wall or with
another root.       The hairs of the pitcher-roots, and those on the
ventral side of the climbing roots, persist for a long time, and are
cnticularised : elsewhere the epidermis disintegrates.               The epider-
 moidal layer or exodermis is made up of cells, the walls of which are
cnticularised    and lignified.      The outer walls of the passage-cells of
this   layer  are  thick,   often   possess pits, and are traversed by what
may be either radial canaliculi or radial rods of a substance differing
from the rest of the wall.       Close beneath the exodermis of the pitcher-
 root, usually separated from it by one layer of cells, are about six
 bands of sclerenchyma ; these bands are absent from the climbing
                                                                       £ 2

roots, or only feebly developed on the dorsal side.           The cortical layer
next to the exodermis constitutes itself into a cork-cambium ; and in
the pitcher-roots a secondary cork-cambium             arises within the bands
of sclerenchyma.          Cork is not formed on the distal parts of the
pitcher-roots, nor within the most ventral portion of the climbing
roots.     Sometimes there is a group of large wood-vessels in the
ventral portion of the vascular cylinder.
   The points especially        worthy    of note in    the roots of Dischidia
Rajiesiana     are —
   1.   The early cuticularisation of the root-hairs, and the long persist
          ence of these structures, which, in climbing roots, remain to
          function as anchoring      threads.
   2.   The curious passage-cells of the exodermis, which do not possess
          thin cellulose-walls.
   IJ.  The precocious development of cork to prevent excessive loss of
          water.
   4. The radial       structure    and large sclerenchyma-bands of the
          pitcher-roots.
   5.   The dorsi-ventral structure of the climbing roots, as revealed in
          the formation of root-hairs and cork ; also aa seen in the
         structure of the cortex and even of the vascular cylinder.

                                    Introductory.
    The stone under notice was not seen to fall, but the following de
 scription regarding the site of its discovery, its mineral character, and
 structure can leave no doubt of its being of meteoric origin.
    Towards the end of the year 1886, when a large party of mining
 prospectors were preparing, with Government aid, for departure to
 the Big Bay district, west coast of Middle Island, Mr. Th. Fenton, a
 student of the Dunedin University School of.Mines, was sent to Inver
 cargill, where the party assembled, to instruct those of the men who
desired it in rough assaying for gold and the use of the blowpipe.
 On the occasion of one of his lectures, he received from a Mr, Arch.
Marshall, for examination, a piece of stone which, from its weight
and appearance, was supposed to be something out of the common.
Mr. Fenton made a rough qualitative analysis of a sample of the
stone, and on     finding strong reactions for nickel, thought it of suffi
cient interest to preserve the several small fragments remaining of
the piece received from Marshall and to bring them with him to
Dunedin,    where he placed them at my free disposal.             One of theso
fragments    I devoted   to  the  preparation of a number of thin sections

           found at Makariwa, near Invercargill, New Zealand.               55
 sliced in different     ways, and the microscopic       examination  of these
 convinced     me at once of the meteoric character of the stone.        After
this,   I   made   every   endeavour, by correspondence and ultimately
travelling to Invercargill, to ascertain the exact locality where and
nnder what circumstances the stone was found, and to obtain more
of it if possible ; for the surface ontlines of the remaining fragments
clearly indicated      that it must originally have been of considerable
siie.    The results of my investigations in these directions are the
following : — In the year 1879, at the completion of the connexion of
the railway line Invercargill — Winton and the branch lino Makariwa
— Riverton, two workmen, the brothers Archs and I. Marshall, while
engaged      in removing   a clay bank at  Makariwa Junction, found in the
clay, about 2§ feet from the surface, a roundish stone, which at once
attracted their attention, on account of its weight and because of the
fact that     in the clay-covered plain surrounding Makariwa Junction
stones of any kind are a great rarity.        They broke the stone with the
pick and, finding the inside of different aspect from the outside,
took the fragments home, and, experimenting with them, discovered
that they affected the magnetic needle.          With the intention of having
the stone some      day further examined, the pieces were kept as curio
sities;    but, being unsightly, they were kicked from one corner of the
room    into the other, and specimens were also occasionally knocked off
for friends interested      in the find. Mr. Arch. Marshall, who gave me
these particulars, told me, on further inquiry, that the stone, when
originally found, had a knobby, roundish shape, was of the size of a
large man's fist, or perhaps a little larger, and might have weighed
between 4 and 5 lbs.         The exact place of the find was about half way
between the railway station on the Winton line and the station master's
house, some      20 feet from the line of rails.   A search by Mr. Marshall
for another piece of the stone which he thought was still somewhere
about the premises at the time he gave the one to Mr. Fenton proved,
unfortunately, unsuccessful, and the only secured remnants of this
meteorite are the two pieces sent with this paper and another small
piece   divided between the Dunedin and Wellington Museums.
                       Macroscopic Character of the Stone.
    All   the fragments show portions of a yellowish-brown, rather soft,
 and   earthy decomposition-crust, from 2 to 3 ram. in thickness, which
 evidently enveloped the entire stone when fonnd.           The undecomposed
 rock beneath      this crust is very finely granular, rather hard and firm,
 and in fresh fracture dark greenish-grey, finely-mottled, light brown,
 and most nearly        resembles fine-grained picrite in appearance ; it
  slightly darkens, however, on exposure to the air, and shows on old
  fracture planes a dark brown, ferrnginous       glaze.   Even uuder a strong

 fi<S          Prof. G. H. F. Ulrich.     On a Meteoric Stone
 magnifying glass the nature of the minerals composing the rocky part
 of the stone cannot be determined, bnt tin-white metallic particles,
 abundantly present, can easily be distinguished ; one also sees small,
 irregularly shaped pores or cavities, some partially filled with a brown
 ferruginous substance. After the fragments had lain untouched for
 pome time in a closed box, there were also observed under the magni
 fying glass, on parts of the fresher-looking surfaces, very small drops
 of a dark brown fluid, which, however, spread and dried up before a
 micro-chemical test could be made.         This flnid seems to originate
 the ferruginous glaze before mentioned, and may possibly consist of
 chloride of iron.
                      Microscopic Character of the Stone.
     For the purpose of microscopic examination, seven thin sections
were available, which proved the stone to belong to the " chondrites,"
or, according to Wadsworth, to the variety " saxonite " of the peri-
dotites, and to be composed of the following minerals : — Olivine,
enstatite, glass, a substance resembling glass, nickel-iron, troilite,
and black opaque grains, probably magnetite.          All the sections are,
besides, more or less strongly flecked and stained     with brown hydrous
ferric oxide, originated,     no doubt, through oxidation of the iron
minerals.
     Olivine. — This is the predominant mineral, and has a faint green
ish-yellow colour in common transmitted light, but shows brilliant
polarisation-colours     between crossed nicols.      It appears partly in
well-defined chondrules, partly in larger and smaller grains of crystal
like or irregular outlines, closely packed together — the larger ones in
some cases much, in others little, fractured ; also in columnar bodies,
some short and stout, others long and narrow, and sometimes curved,
and all generally much fractured transversely — most fractures running
at right angles to the length of the crystals, others obliquely, and
from both sides.        The extinction between crossed nicols of these
columnar bodies is mostly parallel to their longitudinal extent, in cases
more or less oblique, and it is rarely quite complete throughout, as
small brightly coloured specks are generally observable here and
there within the darkened body. The chondrules show various modes
of internal structure.     One kind is very fine granular, of dull-greyish
or dusty aspect, and extinguishes pretty uniformly throughout, only
some promiscuously distributed bright grains shining out.          Around
these chondrules large clear olivine grains, sometimes all of uniform,
sometimes each of independent, optical orientation, are frequently
arranged ring-like, and so that the divisional joints stand rudely
radial (see figs. 3 and 6). This radial arrangement of the joints
respecting grains is also observable, however, around groups of
several larger grains as . centre. A rare and pretty variety of the

          found at Makariwa, near Tnvercargill, New Zealand.                 57
kind of chondrule under notice is shown in fig. 1 (only one example
was   found in the several sections). In this the mass of the chondrule
is constituted partly of fine granular           dusky olivine, partly of an
assemblage of large clear grains of this mineral, and has a ring of
small clear grains of the same surrounding the fine granular part,
whilst there is a border of dark grains of iron minerals aronnd the
whole. In another kind of chondrule the mass is divided or fractured
by strong dark cracks into rudely parallel, columnar, and much cross-
fractured portions, which generally extinguish between crossed nicols
parallel to their length.        The divisional cracks are sometimes so close
together as to impart to the whole a coarsely fibrous structure. Some
large chondrales occur also, exhibiting several systems of parallel
cracks which meet at various, generally obtuse, angles, and in others,
again, the cracks       are eccentrically radiating.      All the sections show
patches    of  ronndish    or  quite irregular outlines,  which have a striking
 porphyritic structure, arising from the prevalence of an extremely fine
 granular    dusty base, through which are distributed comparatively
 large   clear  crystals and irregular grains of olivine, and also occa
 sionally enstatite ; the base is probably also composed of a mixture of
 granules of these two minerals.           Serpentinisation of the olivine was
 not observable     in any of the sections.
    Enstatite.  — Besides appearing in the porphyritic mode just           men
 tioned, this mineral        occurs also sparingly distributed amongst the
larger olivine grains       and  more abundantly in well defined chondrules.
 In the first case, it forms either columnar bodies, sometimes broad,
 but mostly narrow, or irregularly outlined grains — in fact, its forms
 are very similar to those of the olivine ; and, as its colour is also next to
 identical with that of the latter — if anything, that of enstatite being
 fainter — the two minerals can hardly be distinguished in common
 transmitted     light.    In polarised light, between crossed nicols and on
 rotation of tho stage, the difference is, however, very marked in that
 the   colours of the enstatite are of a low order — only various shades
 of yellow   and grey — contrasting strongly with the brilliant red, blue,
  and green colours of the surrounding olivine.              One has to guard,
  however, against mistakes in this respect, as olivine grains cut at, or
  nearly at, right angles to one of the optic axes — of which there are
  examples in every section — show similar colours on rotation of the
  stage.    The employment          of convergent polarised    light solves this
  question at once, and, in most cases, strongly marked cleavage-cracks
  are seen   in enstatite, parallel to which extinction takes place, whilst
  generally, also, a finely fibrous structure becomes apparent on slightly
  lowering the polariser with its top lens. Tbe chondrules are of rather
  dnsty aspect     throughout, or in cases only aronnd the circumference,
   and have   mostly an eccentric or fan-like fibrous structure, as shown
   respectively in fig. 2, lower margin, and fig. 5, upper margin.           On

58            Prof. G. H. F. Ulrich.        On a Meteoric Stone
rotation    of the stage, the extinction is undulating, approximately-
parallel to the fibre-lines, but a multitude of minute granules and
lath-shaped bodies always shine out brightly along the darkened
fibres. As in the case of the olivine, none of the sections show altera
tion of the mineral to serpentine.
    Glass and a substance resembling          Glass. — These require   to be
described together, because     of their mode   of occurrence and their like
ness in common transmitted light.          They are both perfectly colour
less, transparent, and occur pretty abundantly, though mostly in small
particles, filling generally larger and smaller crevices between the
grains of olivine or of olivine and enstatite ; their limpidness, com
bined with absence of colour, rendering them easily distinguishable
 from these minerals.        The difference between the two substances
                       —
 consists in the one the glass — being perfectly isotropic, the other
 anisotropic.    The large finely-dotted patch near the centre of fig. 5,
 and the similarly dotted belt, enclosing several clear spaces, which
extends in fig. 6 from the lower edge through the centre towards the
upper edge, consist largely of the real glass.          They show between
crossed nicols a dark background, as it were, speckled with in
numerable bright granules, polarising in fine colours, therefore, no
doubt, olivine ; and though on rotation of the stage the dark ground
brightens up granular-like in many places, still there are numerous
spots which remain perfectly dark throughout a complete rotation.
In fig. 4 a large rather ill-defined olivine chondrule is delineated,
in which the clear (undotted) parts on the right and left of, and also
within the main part of the olivine near the upper edge, consist all
of the anisotropic glass-like substance. For whilst between crossed
nicols each separate particle shows dark and light spots— the light
ones extinguish and the dark ones brighten up on rotating the stage—
the extinctions are not, however, sharply defined, as in the former
case, but cloudy or undulating, and there is also no chromatic polar
isation. All things considered, it is very probable that the anisotropic
substance simply represents glass in various stages of devitrification.
    Nickel-Iron. — This is indicated in the figures by the dotted and
 cross-shaded areas, and is easily recognisable in the sections in re
 flected light by its metallic silvery-white lustre.        As seen by com
 parison  of  the figures, it occurs  in relatively large proportion, but is
 rather unequally distributed through the stone.           The particles are
 highly magnetic and vary from very minute specks to such as
 approach a grain in weight.         One such, for instance, was found on
 grinding a sample of the stone for chemical analysis. Larger particles
 sometimes enclose small grains of olivine, as shown in fig. 2 near the
 left-hand edge, and there occur also portions in some of the sections
 in which the iron forms a kind of rude network the meshes of which
 are occupied by olivine.

           found at Makariwa, near Invercargill, New Zealand.                    59
   Troilite. — Rather small, yellow, and bronze-coloured                  metallic
specks observable in the sections in reflected light belong, no doubt,
to this mineral, but they are very scarce, and the aggregate per
centage indicated by them, as present in the stone, would be very
small indeed.        According to the quantity of sulphur obtained in a
preliminary chemical examination by Mr. James Allen, a former
Btudent of the Royal College of Science, London, the stone should,
however, contain an appreciable percentage of troilite ; and it is,
therefore,     very probable that some of the black grains, without
metallic lustre, observable in the sections, belong to it, being partly
oxidised and coated over by hydrous ferric oxide.                 Dark dull spots
on the surfaces of many particles of the nickel-iron, or closely joined
therewith, are very likely also due to this process.
   Magnetite. — The majority of the rather abundant dark grains, some
of which show square, others hexagonal, outlines, belong doubtless to
this mineral.       The distribution of the grains is very irregular ; in
some    parts they are abundant, in others rather scarce ; their closest
aggregation is generally in the borders they form around chondri of
olivine.     Chromite may also be present, but only in very small
quantity,     as the chemical examination           of the stone afforded only a
trace of chromium.
                                   Specific   Gravity.
   The specific gravity of the stone, determined from several small
fragments, varied between 3-31 and 3-54 : the variation is, no doubt,
due to the     unequal distribution of the metallic particles.
              Ttesults of  the Chemical Examination        of the Stone.
   A   chemical      examination     has    since been undertaken by Mr. L.
Fletcher,     of the Mineral Department,                British Museum.        The
examination is not yet finished, but the results already obtained by
him indicate that the percentage mineral composition is approximately
expressed by the following numbers : — nickel-iron, 1 ; oxides of nickel
and iron, 10 ; troilite, 6 ; enstatite, 39 ; olivine, 44.           The details of
the  examination will be communicated later.
                             Description of   the Figures.
   All   the figures are    drawn in ordinary light from thin slides cut in
different directions      from one of the fragments of the stone.* The
nickel-iron     particles,   as seen in reflected light, are indicated          by
   • The
           small pieces remaining after the slicing were used for my preliminary
 chemical  examination and the determination of the specific gravity.

fig. 6 is magnified 50 diameters.
    Fig. 1. — This shows a nearly circular chondrule — the finest seen
in any of the sections. It consists throughout of olivine : the upper
very fine-granular part is somewhat dull or dusty, the lower coarse-
granular part is clear, but some of the cracks are filled with dull-
brown ferruginous matter.         Around the circumference of the fine-
granular part there is a rim of small clear grains of olivine, the
divisional joints of which stand mostly radial ; and around this
rim again,     also surrounding the coarse-granular        part, there is a
border of small, black grains of magnetite.          The fine-granular part
and its encircling rim of radial grains, as well as most of the
grains of the coarse-granular part, have the same optical orientation,

as they show pretty uniform simultaneous extinction between crossed
nicols.    In one of the grains of the coarse-granular part at the point
indicated by a dotted line and the letters (oa) an optic axis is visible
in convergent polarised light. What is seen outside the chondrule con
sists of an aggregate of larger and smaller grains, and several very
fine granular patches of olivine showing aggregate polarisation and
enclosing a number of particles of nickel-iron and dark grains, some
of which, of dull-bronzy lustre, may be troilite. The two large parti
cles of nickel-iron near the upper edge of the figure are so connected
 by and with a dull dark substance as to render it very probable that
 this substance is also nickel-iron, which, through oxidation, has lost
its metallic lustre.
    Fig. 2. — This shows on the lower margin, a little to the right, part
 of a large chondrule of enstatite rendered fibrous by fine eccentric
 strias, and rather densely filled with fine dark dust.     Between crossed
 nicols on rotation of the stage its polarisation      colours are of a low

           found at Makariwa, near Invercargill, New Zealand.               61
order, varying between light yellow and bluish-grey, and extinction
takes place in an undulating manner, mostly parallel to the fibration.
In reflected light it looks yellowish and opaque. The remainder of the
section consists of olivine, in part finely granulated, in part in larger
and smaller grains, sprinkled with particles of nickel-iron and dark
groins of iron ore. At the left-hand margin, nearly enclosing two
panicles of nickel-iron, is a large grain of olivine which is divided
                                       Fig. 2.
 into columnar      portions by rudely parallel fractures in the line of
 which extinction takes place between crossed nicols. In the finely
 granulated centre of the figure, scattered larger grains of olivine
 produce quite a porphyritic appearance which becomes more pro
 nounced through        the different optical orientation and the fine polar
 isation-colours of these larger grains.        The largest particle of nickel-
  iron encloses a grain of olivine in the centre ; and a deep indentation
  of another particle of the metal, seen close above the enstatite
  chondrule, is occupied by an olivine grain showing an optic axis (oa)
  in convergent polarised light. Some particles of the nickel-iron have
  narrow, dark margins, produced, no doubt, by oxidation.
      Fig. 3. — Near the centre of the figure is represented a fine   granular
   chondrule    of olivine surrounded by a rim of clear grains of this
   mineral, the divisional joints of which stand generally radial.         The
   optical orientation of this rim and that of the centre part are different,
   the latter uniformly extinguishing       bets een crossed nicols when the
   rims of the grains are bright, while all the grains become dark simul
  taneously when the centre part is bright.         Below this chondrule, near
   the lower right-hand margin, is a rather       rudely-radial arrangement of
   olivine grains around a      centre part consisting of four grains of this
   mineral, but in this case the centre      grains extinguish simultaneously
    with the surrounding      ones,  thus proving the whole to bo a large

 grain cracked in the manner shown. The oblong grain near the lower
 margin indicated by a dotted line and the letter e is enstatite. It
shows strongly marked cleavage-cracks oblique to its outlines, polar
 ises in low colours, ranging between light brown and grey, and
extinguishes parallel to the cleavage-cracks.          The remainder of the
 section is constituted of finely and coarsely granulated olivine, polar
ising aggregately, and enclosing        a number of particles   of nickel-iron
and dark grains, the largest one of which, near the centre of the sec
tion, is probably oxidised nickel-iron, as it shows minute metallic spots
in reflected light. A porphyritic structure, similar to that noticed in
the previous section, is seen in the finely granulated olivine portion
along the left-hand margin, the larger olivine grains, each of indepen
dent optical orientation, shining out brilliantly in polarised light from
the duller fine-granular     part.    In a grain, indicated by (oa), near the
upper    margin,  a  fine optic  axis   is disclosed in convergent polarised
light.
    Fig. 4. — This shows a large chondrule,       mainly composed of olivine,
rather rudely defined by a border of particles of nickel-iron and dark
grains, most of the former occurring around the left-hand margin.
The portions of this chondrule left clear, i.e., unshaded, consist of the
water-clear, doubly refracting substance, resembling glass. A large
amount of this occurs along the right-hand margin, smaller portions
around the left-hand margin, and within the mass of the olivine, and
it also fills the large rudely-parallel longitudinal fissures, and some
large irregular transverse cracks by which the latter is divided.
Whilst portions of it are perfectly clear between crossed nicols, others
are dark ; but on rotation of the stage the extinction travels in an
undulating or cloudy manner over the light portions, and those dark
before   become    light. The contrast between it and the olivine is
especially   well  marked duiing the rotation, as the latter mineral,
though much stained with hydrous ferric oxide, polarises in splendid

colours, and when its extinction takes place — which is in the line of
the fissures dividing it into columnar bodies — the glassy substance in
most of the fissures and cracks shows out perfectly clear and bright.
The very finely granular part which bounds the chondrnle on the right-
hand margin and contains a number of larger grains, is also olivine,
judging     from the polarisation-colours.    Some of the nickel-iron
particles show dark spots and narrow dark rims, due to oxidation of
the metal.
   F-uj. 5. — On the upper margin of this is shown part of a large
chondrule of enstatite, which is finely fibrous, with the fibre-lines dis
posed    in a fan-like manner. Around the margin it looks minutely
granular and somewhat dusty ; in the centre it is clear. Between
crossed    nicols it polarises in shades of yellow and grey, and ex
tinguishes in the clear centre part parallel to the fibre-lines, whilst in
the marginal dim part the extinction is cloudy.        The large, finely-
dotted patch near the centre of the section consists of a mixture of

clear, isotropic glass and granularly devitrified anisotropic glass, and is
full of minute, dark grains, probably of iron ore. The poriion below
the dotted part., near the edge of the figure, is mo-tly true glass aud free
from oxide of iron, but encloses a few small grains of olivine.         The
remainder of the section is occupied by finely and coarsely granulated
olivine, strongly stained in places by brown hydrous ferric oxide, and
there are also scattered dark grains — some rather large — in one of
which, on the left of the centre of the figure, reflected light reveals
numerous fine silvery-white metallic specks of nickel-iron.          This is
the only direct evidence of the presence of this metal in the section,
but it is very probable that amongst the other large dark grains one
or more consist of it to some extent, being rendered dull non-
 metallic-looking by oxidation.
    Fig. 6. — This is drawn under twice the magnifying power used
 for the other figures, in order to show more clearly an occurrence of
 intermingled isotropic and devitrified anisotropic glass. The mass
extends from the lower margin of the figure between a particle of
 nickel-iron on the right and an olivine chondrule on the left, upwards
 through the centre to the large particle of nickel-iron at the upper
 margin, being wider both at the top and bottom than in the centre.
 It is crowded with small, yet well-defined, grains of olivine, but
                                    Fig. 6.
 adjoining   the lower particle  of nickel-iron, and near the upper one,
 there are irregularly outlined portions quite free, or nearly free, from
 these grains, in which the true glass can plainly be distinguished
 from the granularly devitrified material between crossed nicols, on
 rotation of the stage of the microscope. Besides this mass of glassy
 substance, the particles of nickel-iron, and a few black grains, only
 olivine is represented in the section ; the fine granular chondrule on
 the left having for the greater part a rim of larger grains,             the
 divisional joints of which stand closely radial.

       Temperature."        By Lieut-General R. Strachev, R.E.,
       F.R.S. Received January 20, 1893.

     This paper is    a discussion   of the results of the computations of
 the harmonic constants contained in a volume recently published by
 the Meteorological Office. The tables in this volume give the con
 stants of the harmonic components of the first four orders, for each
 month for twenty years, of the daily curves of temperature and pres
  sure at Greenwich ; and the constants for the first three orders, for
 the temperature and pressure, for each month for twelve years, at the
 seven observatories maintained by the Meteorological Office.
     The tables supply the values of the coefficients of the cosines and
  sines of the several terms of the usual harmonic series, representing
  any hourly value : —
                 -A*  = Po+Pi  cos n  . 15°  + 9i sinn  . 15° + &c             (1).
     They also give the amplitudes of the several components, and the
 epoch of maximum derived from the formula

1893.]          of Observations of Air Temperature and Pressure.                67
          A.=f>0 + P1sin(n.l5° + T1) + P2sin(2re.l5e + T,),&c.            .. (2).
   In these tables, and the present discussion,            the coefficients of the
cosines  of the arcs for the several components            are designated by the
letter p, and those of the sines by the letter             q. The amplitude for
the several components is designated by P,                 and the epoch of the
first maximum that occurs aftor midnight                   is designated by the
letter /t.
  By the introduction of the epoch of maximum, the connexion of
the  component with the hour of the day and the sun's place is
directly indicated, which for the purpose of these discussions is more
convenient than the method usually adopted, of stating the valne of
the angle T in formula (2).
   Reference is made to difficulties and uncertainties that occasionally
arise in computing the mean values of some of these constants.
Where there are periodical variations of value which lead to changes
of sign, the arithmetical  mean will tend to obliterate variations
which may,            in truth,
                        be strongly marked.    Also difficulty at times
arises in respect to the epoch of maximum, from uncertainty, in deal
ing both with casual irregularities, and periodical changes, in saying
whether the epoch has been thrown forward or backward.
   The absolute magnitudes of the coefficients p and q indicate the
amplitude of the component, and their signs the phase, or the epoch
of maximum.               It will
                            readily be seen that the combinations of
coefficients, +p+q; —p + q; —p—q;         +p—q, correspond respec
tively to epochs of maximum in the first, second, third, and fourth
quadrants of the period of the component ; and the mutual destruc
tion of a series of positive and negative values of p and q in a mean
value will therefore only signify that there is no true mean epoch of
maximum, and that all positions are alike probable or uncertain.
   The foregoing remarks apply to the whole series of computations ;
what follows refers only to the temperature tables, to which the
 present communication is limited.
                                  1.   Greenwich Temperature.
      The examination   of the tables shows that, with very considerable
 variations   of absolute magnitude, there is on the whole very marked
 consistency in the main characteristics of the components.
    Taking as a test the position of the epoch of maximum, which may
 be regarded    as more directly dependent on the sun's action, and cm
 his position, it will be seen that the values of /t indicate very clearly
  the closeness of this connexion.
     In all the components a truly periodical variation of the value of ft
 is apparent,          and the period of maximum always travels backwards,
  that    is,   it   becomes earlier as the year passes from winter to summer,
                                                                        r   2

while it returns in the opposite direction in the change back to
winter.
   For the first component the variation of the five years' mean of n
from the twenty years is in no month more than 2£° or ten minutes
of time, and the average for all months is less than half that amount.
   In the second component the epoch of maximum, which during the
winter months is always after midnight, falls back in the summer,
 when it is at times before that hour.       The variation of the five-year
mean from the twenty-year mean is in no month more than 6°, and
the average is only 2°"3, or nine minutes of time.
   In the winter months the maximum of the third component is always
between 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. ; in March it changes rapidly, in the
summer being found invariably between midnight and 1 a.m., while
after September it returns to its winter position.         The variation of
the five-year from the twenty-year mean in no month exceeds 5°, and
the average in all months is only 2°"1, or 8£ minutes of time.
   The fourth component shows double maxima and minima, the
former at the equinoxes, the latter at the solstices. The largest varia
tion of the five-year mean of any month from the twenty-year mean
is 10°, and the average for all months is 4°-3, or seventeen minutes.
Considering how small are the absolute values of the coefficients p 4
and q,, on which the value of fit depends, the average being a little
less than -ntth of a degree Fahrenheit, it is rather a matter of surprise
that the variations should bo so small than that they should reach
their actual amounts.
   It may be noticed that the total amplitude of the components beinp
 </(p2 + q2), a considerable variation of its value is quite consistent
with invariable or slightly varying values of fi, which depend on the
ratio p/q.
   The component of the       first order, which in the winter is more  than
double the magnitude of       any of the others, and in summer more     than
ten times as great, gives    the dominant character to the daily curves
of temperature.      In the   series of twenty years variations in different
years  of  as much    as 100  per cent. are to be found for almost every
month, but for the       most   part even these irregularities disappear in
the mean of a series of five years, and the monthly means for the twenty
years are remarkably consistent.
   The progression of the value of P, in the course of the year, follows
approximately the sine of the sun's meridional altitude, and the
empirical formula
                               P = 10cos«-0-91
gives a close approximation to the values shown in the tables, if a
"lagging" of eight or ten days is allowed in reckoning the sun's
place.

    The second component               has two clearly marked maxima about the
time of the equinoxes, and a principal minimum at midsummer.
  The component of the third order varies in a converse manner,
having two well-marked minima at the equinoxes, with a principal
maximum at midsummer.
  The component of the fourth order appears to combine the cha
racters of the two previous ones, having two maxima about the time
of the equinoxes, and a principal minimum in the winter.
   The following empirical formulae give close approximations to the
values of P9 and P3 :

                   Pt = 0-42+016        cos (X + 260°) + 0-10 cos    (2\— 172°),

    In the fourth order, there               some doubt as to the manner in
                                              is
which the change of epoch of the summer and winter maxima                               is
brought about. From March, when the first maximum occurs about
60° after midnight,         or    a.m., there
                                  4               a continued retrogression till
                                                    is
June, when the maximum                  at
                                         is16° after midnight, or      h.   1m. a.m.
                                                                                   4
 This    is followed by a progression from June till October, when the
maximum again occurs at about 60°, or                a.m.4
     In passing from October to November, a sudden change takes place
 by   which the maximum               established at about 10° after midnight.
                                       is
 There    is  a like sudden change between January and February in
 the opposite direction,          which again brings the maximum to 60°
 after midnight. From the component in November and February
 being very small,          it    not improbable that these sudden changes
                                 is
 may    coincide    with  the  component becoming zero.
      Remembering that the fourth component includes four series of
 undulations, the most probable explanation of these changes is to be
  found in a change of the position of these undulations, during which,
 between January and February, the first recedes, and its place                         is
  taken by the second, which leads to sudden appearance of a maxi
  mum about 60°, or           4a.m.   A similar change between October and
  November in an opposite direction would introduce the maximum at
   10" after midnight.
      In the summer months (May, June, and July) the temperature
   curve during the day hours, from           a.m. to
                                                8        p.m., hardly differs from

a curve of sines, the first component being more than ten times as
large as any of the others, which therefore influence the temperature,
relatively, very little.
   The relation of the epoch of the first maximum of the component
of the third order to the time of suurise is decidedly marked, the
former occurring, on the average, about 12", or 48 m. after suurise ;
the mean deviation of tho interval from that amount being only 7°,
or 28 m.
   The periodical variation in tho position of the maximum leads,
during the winter months, to a positive maximum of this component
about 1 p.m., which is combined with negative maxima four hours
earlier and later, which correspond to the reduced temperature in the
mornings and afternoons of the shorter days.       In like manner, in the
summer months, when this component has a negative maximum about
1 p.m., instead of a negative minimum, as in winter, there will be two
positive maxima, one four hours earlier, the other four hours later,
corresponding to the higher temperature in the mornings and after
noons of the longer days.
   It will be seen that these positions of the midsummer and mid
winter maximum phases correspond respectively to days of 16 hours
 with nights of 8 hours, or days of 8 hours and nights of 16 hours,
and that at these seasons, when the variations of temperature, due to
these differences, are greatest, the amplitudes of this component are
also the greatest. At the equinoxes, with 12-hour days and nights,
the component becomes a minimum; and at this season the change
in the position of the maximum takes place as already noticed.
   It might be supposed that an analogous relation between the
 fourth component and the occurrence of days of 18 hours, combined
 with nights of 6 hours, and vice versd, is likely to arise. But the data
 are not forthcoming to test this.
   Although the several components of the temperature curve cannot
 be regarded as indications of specific physical efficient causes, the
 examination of the graphical representations of the various curves
presents points to which attention may usefully be drawn.       The chief
of these are the following : —
   In the summer months the time of mean temperature is nearly
 where the first component becomes zero, the second and third com
ponents then balancing one another.
   In the winter the time of morning mean temperature is later than
in summer, and occurs when a positive value of the first component !s
equal to a negative value of the second.
   The time of afternoon mean temperature throughout the year is
somewhat either      before or after 7 p.m., and almost exactly coincides
with the time when the first and      second   components are equal, with
opposite signs.

1893.]      of Observations of    Air  Temperature and Pressure.          71
   In the summer the time of absolute minimum is between the
hoars of 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.,     during which the whole of the components
are  negative.
   Suurise in December is about an hour and a half before the time
of mean temperature ; while in June it is more than four hours
earlier.
   Sunset    in December    is rather   more than three hours before the
time of mean tomperature       ; in June it is about half an hour after that
 time.
   The rationale of some of the empirical rules for obtaining the mean
daily temperature from a limited number of observations is supplied
by reference to the harmonic expressions for the hourly deviations of
temperature from the mean value ; it being borne in mind that the
relative magnitude of the fourth component is very small.
   In the first place, it will be seen that by adding together the
harmonic      expressions for any two hours twelve hours apart, the
whole of the odd components disappear, and that the sum is twice
the mean value, added to twice the sum of the even components of
the selected hours, which are equal.          Disregarding the components
above the fourth order, if the selected            hours are such that the
component of the second order is zero, which will be the case at
hours corresponding to fi2+4&" or |*t+135°, then half the sum of the
temperatures at the selected hours will be the true daily mean added
to the fourth component for the selected hour, which at English
stations will never amount to          and on the average is less than i°.
   At Greenwich the mean between the observations at 4£ a.m. or
 10^ a.m.
             and the corresponding afternoon hours in January, will
differ by less than -Jj" from the true value, and similar results
will be obtained for June by the mean of observations made at
3 a.m. or 9 A.M. and the corresponding hours in the afternoon.
   By taking the mean of observations at any four hours, at intervals
of 6ix hours, both the odd components and those of the second order
will disappear, and the result will only differ from the true mean by
the amount of the fourth component for the selected hours.
   As this component disappears when m + 22j° = 0° or 180°, the
hours at Greenwich that will give the best result are 2, 8, 14, and 20,
or 5, 11, 17, and 23.
    So,  if the mean of any three hours at equal intervals of eight
hoars be taken, the sums of the first, second, and       fourth components
sill disappear, and the result will only differ from the true       mean by
the amount      of the third component for the selected hours, which in
no case can be so    much as °.f
   By adopting hours when /i3+30= 0" or 180°, the third component
disappears, and this result will be obtained at Greenwich           by com
 bining observation at 3, 11, and 19 hours, or 7, 15, and 23.

                   2.   Temperature at the Seven Observatories.
   The examination of the tables will show that in their main charac
teristics the results closely resemble those for Greenwich, and it will
not he necessary to discuss them in any detail.
   The amplitude of the component of the first order       however,
                                                                  is,         in
all cases less than that observed at Greenwich, the lowest values
being those for Valencia and Falmouth, no doubt due to their posi
tion on the sea coast, for which stations the means for the years are
2°-28 and 2°-35 compared with 5°-10 at Greenwich.
   The Kew values most resemble those at Greenwich, but the mean
maximum at Kew         more than 1° less, and the mean for the year
                         is                                                   \°
less.
  The mean values of ai for the seven observatories lie between 205°
and 220°, that for Greenwich being 214°.      The means of the summer
values are about 3° or 4° less than the mean of the year, and of the
winter values as much above       as in the case of Greenwich.
                                     it,
  The amplitudes of the first components conform approximately,
but not so closely as at Greenwich, with the sine of the sun's
meridian altitude, but with a flattening of the curve in the summer
months, and a tendency at some of the stations to a maximum value
in May.
   The components of the second and third orders, beyond which the
analysis   isnot carried for these observatories, conform in all im
portant respects to those for Greenwich, the numerical values of the
latter being, however, in all cases somewhat higher.    The epochs of
maximum follow the same laws, with an increased divergence of the
summer epoch from that of the winter at the more northern stations.
   Making allowance for their smaller amplitude, the empirical
formulas expressing tho mean values of the P2 and P3 components
differ little from those obtained for Greenwich.
     In order to                  degree throw light on the character
                   test, and in some
and significance of the harmonic components of temperature that
have been     under discussion, and bearing in mind that they
cannot be considered to represent separate effects of physical forces
operating at the assumed periods of the components,       have, at the

suggestion of Professor G. Darwin, calculated the harmonic com
ponents that would produce a curve representing an intermittent
heating action such as that of the sun, continued only during                  a
portion of the day, and commencing and ending abruptly at sunrise
and sunset.
   Such a procedure disregards all cooling effects, and only deals
with the sun's direct heating action, which       have assumed to be
                                                     I
proportional to the sine of his altitude.  Also with a view of obtain

1893.]        of Observations of   Air   Temperature and Pressure.     73
ing figures in some degree comparable with those derived from
actual observation,       I
                    have assumed (following the empirical formula
before given) the power of a vertical sun to be 10. Having calcu
lated the sun's altitude for each hour of the day, for midwinter, the
equinox, and midsummer, for certain selected latitudes, the corre
sponding heating effects have been computed, to which the usuals
method of analysis having been applied, the following results are
obtained (pp. 74 and 75).
  These figures represent the values of the components at  midnight.
The signs indicate that the maximum of the first component is in all
cases at 180°, or noon ; of the second component the maximum in all
cases it at 0°, or midnight ; of the third component in all latitudes
the maximum in the winter is at 60°, or 4 a.m., in the summer at 0°,
or midnight, the change taking place at the equinox, when the com
ponent becomes zero ; of the fourth component in the lower latitudes
up to 40°, the maximum is at 45°, or 3 a.m., at all seasons ; in the
higher latitudes the maximum is at 0°, or midnight, in winter and
summer, and at 45°, or 3 a.m., at the equinox.
   For comparison, the following results from actual observations at
latitudes specified are also given in similar form.
    The close correspondence of the main features of these two tables is
obvious.
    The                             that, although both in the actual
           conclusion is unavoidable,
and hypothetical cases the harmonic    components when combined are
truly representative of the  peculiar forms   of the curves from which
they were derived, this affords no evidence of the existence of recur
ring cycles of action corresponding to the different components, but
that the results are, to a great extent, due to the form of the
analysis.
   The diurnal curve of temperature is not symmetrical in relation to
the mean    value, the maximum day temperature being much more in
excess than the minimum night temperature is in defect.         To adjust
the first component, which is symmetrical about its mean value, to
the actual unsymmetrical      curve, it must be modified by the other
components.      That of the second order which has one of its maxima
not far removed from the minimum of the first order supplies the
chief portion of the compensation due to this cause.
   Further, from the character of the analysis, when the diurnal curve
is symmetrical on either side of the hour half-way between noon and
midnight, that      is,
                     when the day and night are equal in length, the third
component     becomes  zero. Any departure from thi3 symmetry intro
duces     component of the third order, with the result that with a day
          a
shorter than 12 hours one maximum will fall in the day between
6  a.m. and    p.m., and the other two in the night between
               6                                                6 p.m. and
6   a.m.; while with a day longer than 12 hours, two maxima will

negative portions of the component correspond with the reduced

 II. " The    Effects of Mechanical Stress on the Electrical Resist
       ance of Metals."       By James H. Grav, M.A., B.Sc, and
       James B.      Henderson,      B.Sc, International Exhibition
       Scholars, Glasgow University. Communicated by LORD
       Kelvin, P.R.S. Received February 10, 1893.
                                 (Abstract.)
    This investigation   was begun for the purpose of obtaining an
 easily worked method of testing the effect of any mechanical treat
 ment on the density and specific resistance of metals.
    For alteration of density, copper, lead, and manganese copper
 wires were tested.     The effect of stretching was always to diminish
 the density, the alteration being small however : for copper about
\  per cent., and for lead A per cent. The effect of drawing through
 holes in a steel plate was somewhat greater, showing at first an in

 1893.]     Effects of Mechanical      Stress on Electrical Resistance.      17
crease   of  2 per cent.  ; and, when the drawing was continued,            the
density began     to  diminish   till,  after drawing  from   diameter   2 mm.
to 1*3 mm., it showed an increase on its original value of                  per
3ent.    Several other interesting results on alteration of density were
obtained.
   The most important part of the investigation, however,            relates to
the alteration of specific resistance of copper, iron, and          steel wire
dne to stretching ; and, in connexion with this, the authors         wish par
ticularly to emphasise the advantages to be gained from              using the
unit of specific resistance introduced by Weber, who always defined
it in weight measure, that is, as the resistance of a length of the
metal numerically equal to its density and section unity.
   Taking the expression for the resistance R of a wire, of section a>,
length I, and volume specific resistance <r„ R = a,(ljw), we have R =
o,p(lju>p) (where p is the density of the wire) = arp(t2jlwp) = a,p(J,jw)l
 = aK(ljw)l, w being the weight of the length I, and <rw the weight
specific resistance of the wire. We have thus obviated the necessity
of making the troublesome and uncertain measurement of the section
of the wire, and only require to measure the length and tho length
 per unit of weight, both of which can be done with great accuracy.
 Moreover, the weight specific resistance is found to be more nearly
constant than the volume unit. Also, when only a comparison of
 specific resistance is required,    it is not even necessary to weigh the
 wires,  but only to measure lengths, thus making it possible to detect
 very small changes with great ease and accuracy.
    The method used was a modification of what is known as Thomson's
 (Lord Kelvin's) Double Bridge Method ("New Electrodynamic
                                                            '
 Balance for Resistance of Short Bars or Wires,"              Phil. Mag.,' 4th
 series, vol. 24, 1862).    The method being a zero one, the galvano
 meter could be made so sensitive as to be almost unstable, so that a
 change of 1 in 10,000 could be easily detected.
    The tests showed that the maximum permanent stretching pro
 duced a permanent alteration in the weight specific resistance of
 copper of 1 per cent. After the maximum stretching had been pro
 duced, it was found that there was no permanent alteration                   of
 weight specific resistance due to renewed application of stress.
    In the tests of steel wire no permanent stretching was obtained,
 but the effect of applying weight was to cause a very small per
 manent    decrease  of specific resistance,    0"06 per cent.   at first, and
 when    additional weight was applied there was found           to be an in
 crease of 0-06 per cent.      These values are very small however, com
 pared with the temporary alteration of 1*6 per cent.
    In the tests on soft iron wire the permanent alteration due to per
 manent stretching was found to be £ per cent.           After the maximum
  stretching had been obtained stress was again applied, and it was

78                                Present*.                          [Mar. 2,
found, as in the copper wire, that there was no permanent alteration
unless there was permanent stretching.
   Hitherto the results on specific resistance have been given by all
investigators on this subject, except Lord Kelvin, in volume units,
but, as the alteration in density is in every case very small, the results
obtained in the present investigation are in very good agreement with
those of former experimenters.
   The conclusions arrived at are that for practical purposes any me
chanical treatment, however severe, does not affect the electrical pro
perties of the metals tested. As contrasted with this, it is interesting
to note that the smallest impurity in the metal produces a greater
change than the most severe mechanical treatment.           For example, an
impurity of $ per cent. lowers the electrical conductivity by 13"5 per
cent. while an impurity of * per cent. lowers it as much as 30 per
cent.

   In  a communication    made early this year (1892) to the Geological
Society, the author showed that in the South of England, besides the
superficial drift deposits of river, sea, and glacial origin, there was
yet another which could not be refered to any of these agencies, and
which he was led to conclude was the result of a submergence of not
less than 1000 feet at the close of the so-called Post-Glacial Period.
This drift, unlike the others, does not contain either fluviatile or

 1893.]            Submergence    of  Western Europe, §c.                 81
marine remains, nor does      it exhibit any traces of glacial action. Its
component materials are always derived from the adjacent hills, and
none from a distance, so that they have undergone little or no wear,
whilst the only organic remains are those only of land animals and of
land shells.    While possessing these characters in common, this drift,
to which the anthor gives the general term of
                                                    " Rubble-drift," assumes
a variety of forms or phases.          Another peculiarity of this drift is
that it is dispersed from many centres in a manner such as would
result, on the hypothesis of the late Mr. W. Hopkins, of Cambridge,
from divergent currents,     if a considerable area at the bottom of the
sea were    elevated at a given rate, and under certain depths of water.
   Some forms of this drift, especially the one overlying the Raised
Beaches of the Channel, have long attracted attention.          The origin of
that unstratified rubble has been attributed to, 1st, an excessive rain
fall and great cold   ; 2nd, suow and ice slides on slopes ; 3rd, waves of
translation ; 4th, flood and fluviatile action during a period of great
cold.    The author has already stated the objections that occur to
him to these several explanations, some of which no doubt meet
certain of the required conditions, but none of them embrace the
whole,    and   they all involve consequences incompatible          with the
other phenomena.        They all also depend on agencies that involve
an amount of friction and weathering which is conspicuously want
ing in the Rubble-drift.       There is the further objection that this drift
often exhibits results due to a force of propulsion for which the sug
gested   causes are manifestly    inadequate.
   The object of this memoir is to show that there is evidence of drift
beds having the same origin extending over Western Europe and the
coasts of the Mediterranean.          In generalising phenomena so widely
spread, the author has to depend to a great extent on other observa
tions than hiR own. Owing to their number, only the more prominent
cases   have been selected, and only such particulars can be given as
will serve to prove that, howsoever they may differ in detail, they all
point to a common cause and agree in showing that all are explicable
on the    hypothesis proposed by the author, namely, of the submerg

                                                     " head " by Sir H. de la
Beche, overlies a raised beach, the section being in almpst every
respect   identical with that at Brighton. The rubble is derived from
the  adjacent Chalk and Pliocene strata, and has, as at Brighton, the
appearance of having been shot over the old cliff in lenticular masses
— the most massive and prolonged being the one projected on the top.
This rubble contains the remains of Mammoth and some entire land
shells. Near Abbeville, a very similar drift about 40 feet thick follows
the   slope of the hill, but here    it forms four divisions corresponding

 with the main movements of upheaval. The last is remarkahle from
 the circumstance that the edges of the beds are turned over and
 reversed in the same way that the " head
                                                " over the raised beach at
 Portland is reversed.
     Passing on to the Channel Islands, a Raised Beach surmounted by
    "      "
 a head surrounds both Jersey and Guernsey, showing that in the
 later glacial times, as now, those islands were separated from the main
 land.   As the materials of the " head " — which is not a mere tains —
 are all of local origin, they must have been carried down by an agent
 acting in a quaquaverscl direction from the centre of the islands,
 where the hills form plateaux 300 to 400 feet high, often covered by
 loam or loess.    As there are no rivers to have originated the required
 flood waters, this loess cannot have had a flnviatile origin, nor, as
 there are no higher grounds, could it be the result of rain-wash,
 neither can it bq the result of the disintegration of the surface rocks.
 It must therefore have had an origin different from that usually
 ascribed to the loess, and which the author attributes to the deposi
 tion of sediment from the turbid sea-waters during submergence,
 whilst the "head" results from the surface debris together with a
 portion of this previously deposited sediment, swept off by divergent
 currents during upheaval.
    The Loess. — After further reference to the phenomena on the west
coast of France, the author resumes the question which has given
rise to much controversy, namely, that of the origin of the loess,
which extends over such large tracts in Western and Central Europe.
That a certain section of it within valleys is due         to  river floods,
there can be no doubt, but there is another section, recognised as
such by most Continental geologists, to which it is not possible to
assign that origin. The latter is not confined to the river valleys,
but is found on the dividing water-sheds and on the high plains
separating the river basins. In the North of Prance it attains a height
of 400 to 600 feet, but in the neighbourhood of Lyons it reaches to
1300 feet, whilst in the great upper valleys of the Rhine and Danube it
attains to an altitude of 1500 feet, which is even exceeded further to
the east.    It there covers the high plains of Hungary and Southern
Russia, and is by no means restricted to valleys and depressions on
the surface. Various theories have been proposed to account for this
wide dispersion of the loess, the two principal of which attribute
its formation : — 1, to a depression of Central Europe whereby the
gradient of the upper valleys was greatly reduced, while no change
of level occurred nearer the sea ; 2, to the advance of the great
northern ice sheet, blocking the large rivers of Eastern Europe, and
damming back their waters ; 3, to storm-winds acting upon disinte
grated rock-surfaces.      The author points out the objections to these
several views, and shows that such an accumulation of silt would

necessarily         of the consequences of the submergence he suggests
               be one
— that    it is such   a sedimentation as wouldfall from the turbid waters
as they slowly advanced or rested, whilst 'as they retreated those
portions of this sediment most exposed to the effluent currents would
be again swept away.      As with the other phases of the rubble-drift,
the organic remains of this loess are those of a land surface only.
   In the South of France and inland, the author refers the Ossiferous
breccias of Nice, Antibes, Cette, Pedemar, and Santenay to one phase
of the Rubble-drift.     At all these places, the breccia, which contains
the remains of the Mammoth, Woolly Rhinoceros, and other Quatern
ary animals, occurs in fissures on isolated hills.       In explanation of
their presence, it has been suggested that the bones are those of
animals which fell into the fissures while still open, or else that they
were remains brought together by prodaceous animals.         But neither
of these opinions can be correct, for no skeleton is found entire, no
bones  in place, and none of the bones have been gnawed by Carnivora.
As Monsieur Gaudry also asks in discussing the facts presented by the
fissure on the " Montague de Santenay — a flat-topped hill near
                                            "
Chalons-sur-Sa6ne — " Why should so many Wolves, Bears, Horses,
and Oxen have ascended            a   hill isolated on all sides ? "        The members
of the Geological Society present at the reunion at which this remark
was made seemed to agree that the animals had met their death by
drowning, but in what way was left indeterminate.
   Now in all these cases the fissures are in isolated hills with lower
lauds around.    At Nice the hill    132 feet high, at Antibes, 250 feet,

the hill rises 355 feet above the sea-level.  Still more formidable are
the   hills inland.     Mont Pedemar rises             to a height of 1128 feet,     whilst
Santenay      is   1640 feet high.       Among the animal remains found              in the
assures are those of —

    sible to suppose that animals of such different natnres, and having
    such different habitats, could in life ever have herded together.
    Difficult as the alternative is, the author sees no other explanation of
    the phenomena than that of a wide-spread temporary submergence,
    accompanied by strong earth tremors.             In such a case it is easy to
    conceive that as the waters gradually advanced over the low lands,
    the animals of the plains would naturally seek safety on the higher
    grounds and hills.      Flying in terror, and cowed by the common
    danger, the Ruminants and other Herbivores, together with the
    Carnivores, would, as in the case of the flooding in our days of large
   deltas, alike seek refuge on the same safety spot.           Where that spot
   was an isolated hill, they would, if it wcro not out of reach of the flood
   waters, eventually suffer the same fate. Subsequently the detached
   limbs and bones, carried, together with the surface debris, by the
   effluent currents into the open fissures, were subjected to the clashing
  of the rubble and the fall of large fragments of rock from the sides
  of the fissures, and were crushed and broken in the way they are
  always found.       All the results noted are in accordance with the con
  sequences that would ensue under these conditions.
      The author then describes how that portion of the Rubble-drift,
  wluch was not caught in fissures or hollows, was swept down the
 sides of the hills during upheaval of the land.             Amongst the most
  illustrative instances of these, is that on the slopes of Mont Genay,
 near Semur.        This hill, which is 1430 feet high, is capped by a
 characteristic Oolitic bed, and it is the debris carried down from this
 bed that forms on the slopes a breccia containing similar remains to-
 those of the fissures at Santenay, together with land shells and flint
flakes of human manufacture.            Another such mass was cut through
 by    the  railway  to the  east   of Mentone,   where the base of the lime
 stone cliffs, in which are situated the noted Mentone bone-caves, are
 covered by a breccia in which were found the remains of Hycena,
 Cave Bear and other animals, together with flints worked by Man.
      Belgium. — The author recognises the Rubble-drift in the angular
                                    "                  "
 debris termed by M. Dupont argile a blocaux             which partly masks, as
 with the Gower caves, some of the celebrated bone-caves near Dinant.
 It forms a thin layer between the cave deposits and a deposit of the
 Stone Age, thus defining clearly its geological position.           It contains,
 when fronting      the   caves,  the  remains   of  Reindeer,  Ox, Horse, >fcc.,
 which has led to its being classed with the cave deposits, but the
 author thinks that those remains have been derived from the beds
 which it overlies and has partly denuded.
     Gibraltar.  — The Atlantic waves    have  left few traces of raised beaches
and     "head" on the western coasts of Spain and Portugal, but on the
Rock of Gibraltar there are traces of several raised beaches, covered
in places by local angular rubble (or head). This rubble extends

      1893.]           Submergence   of Western Europe,        fyc.              85
    ever the lower slopes of the Rock on both sides.         On the western side
     it attains a thickness of 100 feet, and is projected       550 yards seaward
    at an angle      of 9°. It  is clearly   not a tiilus, nor is it a cone of
    dejection.    Sir Andrew Ramsay and Professor James Geikie referred
    its origin to two periods of severe cold and suow slides. The objection
    to this is the great volume of the detritus, the size of some of the
    blocks (some being 12 feet in diameter), and the distance to which it
    is   projected compared to the very limited suow-collecting surface,
    1400 feet in height, and the small angle of slope.             The remarkable
    Ossiferous Fissures of Gibraltar, which are placed by the authors
    between the two agglomerates           or breccia — referred by them to
   different periods— -contain remains of three species of Felis, of Hyaena,
   Bear, Rhinoceros, Wild Boar, Ibex, Ox, Horse, Beer, Hare.             The bones
   are, as usual, much broken and splintered, and none belonged to
   one entire skeleton.      A human molar and some worked flint flakes
    were also found.
        It has been suggested    that the remains     are those of animals     that
.  had lived and died on the Rock, and were afterwards             washed into the
   fissures by heavy rains.     But this is difficult to conceive, and besides,
   there is the same incompatibility in the habits and resorts of the animals
  thus associated as in the other fissures before mentioned. The Hyama;
  Felidce, and Bears might have frequented the dens and crags of the
  Rock, but the Deer, Bovidce, Horse, and others could only have lived
  in the surrounding plains, and it has not been suggested that they
  were carried there by the Carnivora.            A great and common danger
  alone could have driven together the animals of the plains and of
  the crags and caves.         As the Rock was upheaved the divergent
 currents swept down on both sides of the Rock the debris of the
 limestone, disintegrated by the previous long glacial cold, together
 with the scattered animal remains ; and that the propelling force
 was great, and, consequently, the rise rapid, is shown by the distance
to     which the breccia extends from the       base of the Rock.        The scale
is different, and the materials are different, but       in all essential respects
                                                                       " head " at
the phenomena are analogous           to  those  presented by the
 Brighton and at Sangatte. There is the same restriction to local
debris with blocks, the same absence of wear, the same traces of rude
hedding, and the same occasional presence              of Mammalian       remains.
All this points to a common origin.
      Sicily. — Traces of similar phenomena      are shown to exist   in Sardinia,
 Corsica, Italy, and the coast of Dalmatia.            The remarkable caves of
 Sicily next arrest attention from the extraordinary quantity of bones
of Hippopotami (belonging to hundreds of individuals) which were
 found in connexion with them. Twenty tons of these bones were
shipped from the cave of San Ciro, near Palermo, within the first six
months of working, and they were so fresh that they were sent to

               " for use in tbe sugar factories."        How could this bone
 breccia have been accumulated P No predaceons animals could have
brought together such a collection, unci, though Hycence lived at the
time, they have left no traces of their presence, nor marks of their
teeth, in this wonderful mass of bones. These have been classed with
the contents of bono caves, but the author shows that there are
objections to this.     The only other suggestion made is that the bones
are those of successive generations of Hippopotami which went there
to die.    But this is not the habit of the animal, and, besides, the
bones are those of animals of all ages down to the foetus, nor do the
bones show any traces of weathering            or of variable exposure. The
author   suggests    an  explanation    founded    on the local topographical
features. The plain       of Palermo    is  encircled  by an amphitheatre of
hills rising to the height of 2000 to 3000 feet, and presenting mural
precipices towards the plain.         The caves are situated near the base
of this escarpment,      and  at   San Ciro the breccia not only faces the
cave, but extends to some distance in front and on either side.
When, therefore, the island was submerged, the animals in the plain
of Palermo would naturally retreat, as the waters advanced, deeper
into the amphitheatre of hills until they found themselves embayed as
in a seine, with promontories running out to sea on either side, and a
mural precipice in front. As the area became more circumscribed
the animals must have thronged together in vast multitudes, crush
ing into the more accessible caves, and swarming over the ground at
their entrance, until overtaken by the waters and destroyed. A few
of the more agile animals may have escaped, for though the remains
of Deer, Ox, Bear, and Felidae occur, they are exceedingly scarce ;
but the unwieldy Hippopotami perished in hundreds.                  As the land
afterwards emerged by intermittent stages, first the rocky debris,
and finally large blocks from the sides of the hills were hurled down,
 crushing and smashing the bones, which are, with few exceptions,
 broken into thousands of fragments.             The author accounts for the
 numbers    of   Hippopotami     by the   fact that after the formation of the
 Raised Beaches there was, as he has previously shown, a considerable
 elevation of the coast, which, no doubt, led, as in more western Europe,
 to a large increase of the land area : so that the plain of Palermo may
 then have been of great extent.
    Malta. — The drift deposits of Malta present on the whole the same
 general features as those of Sicily, but, owing to its peculiar popula
 tion of dwarf Elephants with the small Hippopotamus, and the
 absence of other larger Quaternary Mammalia, the faunal remains
 have a distinct local colouring.        They indicate that, like the Channel
 Islands, Malta had been long isolated before the spread of tbe Rubble-
 drift ;  but,   nevertheless,   it is evident    that  it did not   escape the
 catastrophe which affected the adjacent lands.            On the south side of

1893.]              Submergence   of Western Europe,     S.c.              87
the island escarped rocks rise abruptly to       the height of 200 to 300
feet.     The lower part of these slopes is covered by a consolidated red
breccia consisting of angular fragments of the local rocks, mixed
with the red earth which covers the hill tops, and containing in places
remains of the pigmy Elephant.         The author takes this breccia to be
the representative of the head at Brighton and Sangatte, only that in
this instance the height of the escarpment has prevented its being
entirely swamped, as are the old cliffs at those places.        It resembles
closely the breccia on the Mentone slopes.         It is probable that this
island, no part of which exceeds a height of 800 feet, was entirely
 submerged, for not a single species nor even one genus of its
 Quaternary Mammalia are now found living on the island, nor did
 any of its peculiar forms pass to the adjacent lands.
     Greece. — The   surface deposits of Turkey and Southern Russia are,
 seemingly, in general accordance with the views here expressed. The
 rubble beds are, however, better developed in Greece, and are there
 associated with an osseous breccia.      This angular rubble forms great
 sheets extending to the shore, where they are worn back, and form
 cliffs 30 to 40 feet high, whilst the present torrents cut through and
 carry down this drift, spreading it out on the const in the form of
 cones   of dejection, which often    becomes re-cemented like the older
 breccia.    On   the adjacent island of Cerigo ossiferous fissures, said
 to contain human remains, occur on the summit of an isolated flat-
 topped hill.
    In Crete there are, in places, immense accumulations of angular
 detritus, and at one spot a Raised Beach is overlaid by a calcareous
 breccia analogous to the head of the coasts of the Channel.           In the
 island of Rhodes is a breccia which is said not to be distinguishable
 from that of Greece.
    Asia Minor. — M. de Tchihatchieff says that Quaternary deposits
 are much less common in Asia Minor than in Europe, and that there
 are detrital deposits of local origin on the slopes of the hills which
 may be Quaternary or modern, and remarks on the absence of
 organic remains in these superficial drifts.
    A raised beach, 5 to 30 feet above present sea level, surrounds
 Cyprus, but it does not appear to be accompanied by a head, though
 a sandy bed, "like loess," overlies it in places.          Nor is there any
 record of ossiferous breccia or fissures. This may be owing to the
 submergence here having been small.
    On the coast of Palestine raised beaches range up to the height of
 220 feet, but the author cannot find any record of an overlying
 rubble or head. Traces of a bone-breccia of nncertain relations have,
 however, been found near Beyrout, and detrital deposits are alluded
 to  ; but the only   bone cave described appears to be of Neolithic Ago.
 No    ossiferous fissures nor remains of Quaternary Mammalia have

88            Prof.  J. Prestwicb.    On the Evidences   of a    [Mar. 9,
been   noticed.   The author concludes that the submergence of the
district (if any) must have been small, but of its extension further
eastward he has no means of judging. Monsieur L. Lartet states that
stone implements of the Palaeolithic type have been found on the
surface near Bethlehem, and in some other places.
   North Africa. — The coast of North Africa presents confirmatory
evidence. It is fringed by raised beaches — one in particular, 10 to
40 feet above the sea-level, is very constant.    Ossiferous fissures are
met with on the coast at Tetuan, Oran, and other places in Algeria.
They present the same characters, and contain the remains of similar
animals, as those at Nice and Gibraltar. The fissures do not, how
ever, seem to extend beyond Algeria, for none have been recorded in
the province of Constantino, though there is a breccia which is
suggestive of a Rubble-drift.
    Eastward of Tunis, the country has been described as consisting of
rolling hills of cretaceous rocks in a sea of Quaternary drift, which
from the account of it closely resembles a rubble-drift, but osseous
breccias and fissures seem absent. It would appear, therefore, that,
as on the north shores of the Mediterranean, there was a decrease in
the depth of submergence as we proceed from west io east.
    Egypt. — It may in fact be a question whether the submergence
extended in this direction beyond the Libyan Desert.         The escarped
limestone hills and long lines of quarries in Eprypt show no ossiferous
fissures, nor does there seem to be any Rubble-drift overlying the
fluviatile terraces of the Nile, or underlying the river alluvium.
Nevertheless there is reason to believe that Palaeolithic Man did exist
there, for flint implements of the same type as those of the Thames
and Somme Valleys have been fonnd, but they wereall on the surface,
 and none are from any deposit of well-ascertained Quaternary age.
 It may further be noticed that several of the animals which dis
 appeared with the rubble-drift in the more western districts, such as
 Lion, Panther,     Spotted Hyaena, Hippopotamus, African       Elephant,
 Caffir Cat, survived in the Nile Valley to historic times.
    In conclusion, the author   deals  with certain objections which     he
 foresees  may be raised to the proposed hypothesis,       especially that
 respecting the absence of marine remains on the submerged lands.
 This, however, he attributes to the short duration of the submerg
 ence, which neither allowed time for ordinary marine sedimentation,
 nor for the migration and establishment of a marine fauna on the sub
 merged area, and also to the turbid condition of the waters.        To the
 objections based on uniformitarian grounds to the rate of upheaval,
 he does not attach so much weight, as it seems to him that uniform
 ity of energy in dealing with a body like the globe cannot be
 admitted.    The question should be judged by the evidence of facts
 and not decided by an uncertain postulate.

   The facts, on the other hand, show that    all the phases of the Rubble-
drift are such as may be due to the agency of a common cause.
Briefly, whether it be the head over the raised beaches, the osseous
breccia on slopes, or the ossiferous fissures, they all present a complete
absence of that wear which must result from river, sea, or ice action ;
ail the materials are of local origin, while all the faunal remains of
these, and of one section of the loess, are such as might come from the
wreck of a land surface, and a land surface only.         The bones of the
animals have evidently been subjected to considerable        but not lasting
violence, for they are  broken and splintered, yet not worn ; and though
these remains are associated together       in as it were a common grave,
it is impossible to suppose that under the ordinary conditions of
animal existence, such dissimilar orders could have been associated
in life, nor, as the bones are free from all traces of gnawing, could
those remains have been collected and left by beasts of prey.         These
concurrent conditions, together with the mode of distribution of the
Rubble-drift   from many independent centres, seem to the author —
howsoever srartling may be the conclusion — to be only explicable
npon the hypothesis of a wide-spread and short submergence.
   Another consequence the author draws from the position of the
Rubble-drift, and one that confirms a conclusion which he had drawn
from very different data, is that it affords grounds to believe that in
estimating the time elapsed since the so-called Post-Glacial Period,
instead of a measure of 80,000 to 100,000 years, one of 10,000 to
12,000 years would be a closer approximation.         For it will have been
observed that, where present, only a few feet of that peculiar drift
separates the deposits of Quaternary Age from those of the newer
Stone or Neolithic Age, and that nowhere have there been found
between the   two any sedimentary beds representing the work of any
long  period of time. Further, the surface configuration has remained
since then comparatively    unaltered.
   Nevertheless, the author is fully alive to the difficulties attendant     •
npon the hypothesis he ventures to put forward. Some of these con
cern naturalists  rather than geologists, and the opportunity for their
discussion  has not hitherto arisen.     He invites younger geologists to
follow up the enquiry, and submits that, so far as the actual phe
nomena are concerned, the hypothesis satisfies, on the whole, all the
more important conditions of the problem.

       F.R.S., Cavendish Professor of Experimental Physics in
       the University of Cambridge. Received February 18, 1893.
    It is well known that steam is split up into hydrogeu and oxygen
when an electric discharge passes through it. A very careful ex
amination of the laws of this phenomenon was made more than thirty
years ago by Perrot;* as his results are very remarkable, and seems
to be not at all well knowu,        I  will describe, as briefly as possible, his
apparatus, and the results he obtained with it. The apparatus used
by Perrot in his experiments is represented in fig. 1, taken from his
paper.     The spark passed between two platinum wires                    sealed into
                                        Fig. l.t
glass tubes, cfg, dfg, which they did not touch, except at the places
where they were sealed ; the open ends, c, d, of these tubes were about
2 mm. apart, and the wires terminated inside the tubes at a distance
of about 2 mm. from the ends. The other ends of these tubes were
inserted under test-tubes e, e, in which the gases, which passed up the
tubes, were collected.        The air was exhausted from the vessel A, and
the water vapour through which the discharge passed was obtained
by heating the water in the vessel ; special precautions were taken
to free this water from any dissolved gas. The stream of vapour
arising from this water drove up the tubes the gases produced by the
passage of the spark ; part of these gases was produced along the
length of the spark.              Part of the gases so collected has been
decomposed by causes which would not be affected by reversing the
electrical conditions of the electrodes, e.g., by such causes as the heat

produced by the sparks.             We should not expect to find any simple
relation between the amount of decompositions from these causes and
the quantity of electricity which had passed through the gas.                        The
hydrogen and oxygen produced by such causes would, however, be
driven up the tube in chemically equivalent proportions, and could
therefore be eliminated by sending a spark through these gases, when
they would recombine and form water.
   When the sparking had           ceased, the gases which had collected         in the
test-tubes    e and e were analysed ; in the first place they were exploded
by sending      a strong spark through them ; this at once got rid of the
hydrogen and oxygen which existed in chemically equivalent propor
tions, and thus got rid of the gas produced by heat, &c., along the
length of the spark.          After the explosion, the gases left in the tubes
were the hydrogen or oxygen in excess, together with a small quantity
of nitrogen, due to a little air which had leaked into the vessel in the
course of the experiments, or which had been absorbed by the water.
The results of these analyses showed that there was always an excess
of oxygen in the test-tube in connexion with the positive electrode,
and an excess of hydrogen             in the test-tube connected with the nega
tive  electrode,   and, also, that the amounts of oxygen and hydrogen in
the respective tubes were very nearly chemically equivalent to the
amount of copper deposited from a solution of copper sulphate in a
voltameter placed in series with the discharge tube.
   The results of some of Perrot's experiments are shown in the
following table : —

   Thus    in Perrot's experiments the          excess of hydrogen appears at the
 negative    electrode, the excess of oxygen at the positive, and these
 excesses are very nearly chemically equivalent to the amount of Cu
 deposited in a copper sulphate voltameter placed in series with the
 discharge tube. Ludeking* confirmed the result that when sparks
 pass through steam there is an excess of oxygen at the positive,                    and
 of hydrogen at the negative, electrode.

charge passes through gases, and seem to have special reference to a
view which     I have long held, that the discharge through gases is
accompanied by chemical changes analogous to those which take place
in electrolytes conveying currents, I was anxious to repeat and, if
possible, extend them. On attempting to do this,            I met with very
considerable difficulties, and it has taken more than a year's work to
overcome these, and to arrange the experiments so as to get definite
and consistent results.     For this reason, as well as from the fact that
my results differ very materially from those obtained by previous ex
perimenters, I shall enter at greater length into the details of the
experiments than would otherwise be necessary.
   The form of apparatus which        I  now use, though similar in its main
features to that used by Perrot, differs from it in some respects.
Before describing the apparatus in detail, I will indicate the chief
points of difference between it and Perrot's.
   One source of doubt in Perrot's experiment seemed to me to arise
from the proximity of the tubes surrounding the electrodes to the
surface of the water.       These tubes were narrow, and, if they got
damp,    the   sparks, instead    of passing directly through the steam,
might conceivably have run from one platinum electrode to the film
of moisture on the adjacent tube, then through the steam to the film
of moisture on the other tube, and thence to the other electrode.           If
anything of this kind happened, it might be urged that, since the
discharge passed through water in its passage from one terminal to
the other, some of the gases collected in the tubes might have been
due to the decomposition of the water and not to that of the steam.
To overcome this objection,        I  have (1) removed the terminals to a
very  much    greater distance   from   the surface of the water, and placed
them in a region surrounded by a ring burner, by means of which the
steam can be heated to a temperature of 14U° or 150° C. ; (2) have     I
got rid of the narrow tubes surrounding the electrodes altogether by
making the tubes through which the steam escapes partly of metal,
and using the metallic parts of these tubes as the electrodes.
             I
   Though prefer this method of arranging the electrodes as being
somewhat more convenient than Perrot's form of the experiment, in
which the electrodes were wires surrounded by glass tubes,            I  have
repeated the experiments described below, using wire electrodes ; the
results, however, were precisely the same as those obtained when the
tubular electrodes were used.        One great advantage of these tubular
electrodes is that the quantity of metal in them is large enough to
keep them quite cool during the discharge ; while, when wire elec
trodes are used, the end of the negative terminal becomes red hot if
any considerable current passes through the steam.
   Instead of following Perrot's plan of removing the mixed gases
from the collecting tubes e, e, fig. 1, and then exploding them in a

  1893.]                  The Electrolysis     of Steam.                        93
  different vessel, I have collected the gases on their escape from the
  discharge tube in graduated eudiometers provided with platinum
 terminals by means of which the mixed gases were exploded in situ
 at short intervals during the course of the experiments.               This plan
 avoids the trouble, waste of time, and risk of error incurred in
 moving the mixed gases from the collecting tube to the eudiometer.
 Its greatest advantage, however, is that it enables us to see with very-
 little delay at which terminals the excesses of hydrogen and oxygen
are appearing.      As I shall have to explain below, the sides at which
the excesses of hydrogen and oxygen appear can be reversed by
altering the character of the spark, and it very much facilitates the
investigation of the laws of this reversal to be able to tell, with as
little loss of time as possible, at which terminal the excess of hydrogen
is appearing.
                         Description of the Apparatus.
    I will now pass on to describe the form of apparatus which, after
many trials, was found to be tho most convenient.
    This is represented in fig 2. H is a glass bulb, 1*5 to 2 litres in
volume, containing the water which supplies the steam. A tube, L,
about 0-75 cm. in diameter and 35 cm. long, is joined on to this.               In
many    cases this was  fused directly  on  to the bulb ; I   do  not think, how
ever, that this is necessary, and     I have found no     ill  effects arise from
                                     Fio.  2.

94                         Prof.  J. J.  Thomson.                    [Mar. 9,
 making this connexion by placing1 a rubber stopper in the prolonga
 tion of the bulb, and pushing the tube L throngh a hole in this
 stopper, care being taken to push the tube right through the hole.          I
 may remark in passing that it is very desirable to adopt a form of
 apparatus which is easily constructed ; the life of these tubes is by
 no means long, as they are exceedingly liable to crack, especially when
 cooling, at the end of an experiment.          The apparatus I am now-
 describing is one which was designed with special reference to easy
 construction, and fused joints are done away with in those places
 where I have found by experiment that this course could be taken
 without injury to the accuracy of the experiments.        I have, however,
 repeated  the experiments,   using  apparatus  in  which all the joints were
 fused.
    The top of the tube L is fused on to the horizontal discharge
 tube CD ; this tube is blown out into a bulb in the region where the
 sparks pass, so that when long sparks are used they may not fly to
 the sides of the tube.     The top of the tube L, near its junction with
 CD, is encircled by a ring burner K, and this part of the tube is
 surrounded by an asbestos case ; by these means the steam may be
superheated to a temperature of 140° to 150° C.
    The details of the electrodes between which the sparks pass are
shown in fig. 3. For the metal parts a, 6, it is necessary to use some
metal which is not oxidised by the steam, as a very small amount of
oxidation would be sufficient to render the results nugatory.

    I have used as the electrodes, (a) brass tubes thickly coated with gold
with their sparking ends carefully rounded- off,, or (6) tubes made by-
winding thick platinum wire up into a coil.               These tubes are
placed in pieces of glass tubing, e, e, to hold them in position.         To
facilitate the expulsion of air from the apparatus, it is desirable that
the metal tubes should not fit so tightly into the glass ones as to pre
vent the steam from passing between the two.          If they fit too tightly
to allow this, air is apt to lodge between the metal and glass tubes,
and if this gets driven out into the delivery tubes F, G (fig. 2) when
the sparks pass, it will vitiate the experiment.
    The glass tubes e, e stop short of the places /, g, where the delivery
tubes join the discharge tube.       The discharge tube is closed at the
ends by two pieces of tube, h, h, which have their ends inside the tube

fnsed up    ;   wires connected to the electrodes c, d are fnsed throngh the
closed euds of these tubes.        It is desirable that the closed ends of the
tubes h, h should come up as close as possible to the exits /, g, as air
is very apt to remain in the tube if there are any places throngh which
the steam does not rush.          The tubes h, h may either be fused on to
the spark tube or fastened to it by rubber tubing.
    The delivery tubes V, G (fig. 2) are fused on to the discharge tube
at/, g (fig. 3). These tubes are about 5 cm. in diameter and terminate
in narrow openings.          It is essential that the steam and the mixed
gases    should     escape through the tubes F, G at approximately            the
same rate     ; to ensure this, the narrow extremities of these tubes should
 be equal both in length and width.             This was attained by drawing
out a piece of tubing which was originally of the same diameter as
 F, G, and then cutting it at the middle of the narrow part ; the two
 halves were then either fnsed or fastened by rubber tubing to P, G.
The narrow ends of F, G are turned up and placed under mercury
 in the vessel M (fig. 2). Over these ends, graduated eudiometer tubes
 are placed ; these are filled with mercury at the beginning of the
 experiment, but the mercury soon gets displaced by the water pro
 duced by the condensation        of the steam rushing through the tubes.
    The heat produced by this condensation serves a useful purpose ; it
 raises the temperature of the water in the eudiometer tubes over
 which the gases are collected to over 80° C, and thus, since hot water
 absorbs oxygen but not hydrogen much less readily than cold, dimin
 ishes the disturbing effect due to the greater absorption of the oxygen
 than of the hydrogen by the water over which the gases are collected.
    The effect produced by electrification on the condensation of a jet.
 of steam is shown in a very striking way by this apparatus.              When
 the delivery tubes are open to the air, the steam, after escaping from
 the nozzles, goes some inches before it condenses sufficiently to form
 a cloud ; as soon, however, as the coil is turned on and the sparks
 pass,  brownish clouds reaching right down to the nozzles are at once
 formed.       The cloud is denser in the steam which has gone past the
 negative    electrode   than in that which has gone past the positive.
     Precautions which it is necessary     to take to ensure Correct Results.
    These    can, perhaps, best be realised by considering that what we
 have to measure is the excess of hydrogen          or oxygen, as the case may
 be, left after exploding the mixed gases.         Now,  if we consider, firstly,
 that this excess is a small fraction of the original volume of the
 mixed gases — the exact proportion between the two varies greatly
 with the length of the spark, but in some cases the excess did not
 amount to more than 5 per cent. of the mixed gases; secondly,
  that only a very small portion of the steam passing through the

96                        Prof. J. J. Thomson.                     [Mar. %
 discharge tube is decomposed by the spark, so that the volume
of the mixed gases bears a very small proportion to that of the
steam — certainly nothing like I : 100 in my experiments — it is
evident that if the steam contains anything like 1/10 per cent. of
air, the oxygen in this air will be comparable with that produced by
the sparking, and its presence will prevent any reliable results being-
obtained.
    This air may come from two sources — (1) it may be present in the
tube originally ; and (2) it may have been absorbed by the water.
    To get rid of the air from the first source, the tube was so con
structed that there were no blind alleys ; every part of it was a
thoroughfare for the steam. In addition to this, the vessel H (fig. 2)
was, at the beginning of the experiment, filled so full of distilled water,
by dipping one of the delivery tubes under the water and connectings
the other to a water pump, that when the water was heated its ex
pansion was sufficient to cause it to fill the whole of the tube and
overflow.
    To get rid of the air dissolved in the water, I found no plan so
efficacious as prolonged boiling. In the earlier experiments, in addi
tion to the boiling, I tried to absorb the oxygen by mixing oxidising
agents with the water ; finally, however, I dispensed with these and
trusted entirely to the boiling to remove the air.
    The distilled water was boiled vigorously for six or seven hours with
the ends of the tubes P, G open to the atmosphere.        The eudiometer-
tubes filled with mercury were then placed over the ends of the de
livery tubes F, G, so that, if any air were mixed with the steam, it
would be collected in these tubes. The steam was then allowed to
run into the eudiometer tubes for about an hour, when the tubes were
examined to see if they contained air.     If any air was observed, the
eudiometer tubes were removed and vigorous boiling maintained
until, on repeating the experiment, the air was found to have dis
appeared.
   As the excess of hydrogen obtained in the hour by sparking through
the steam would have been at least I c.c., and in many experiments
much more, while the air did not form a bubble large enough to be
visible, we may, I think, conclude that there was not enough            air
present to affect the result appreciably.
                     Method of Producing the Sparks.
   The sparks were produced by means of a large induction coil,
which would give sparks about 5 cm. long when the current from
five large storage cells, which was the usual battery power employed,
was sent through it.      The break used was, generally, the ordinary
electro-magnetic break supplied with these coils, but in some expert
ments a slow mercury break was employed.

  On   trying to             in the ordinary way, the current obtained
                   use the coil
was exceedingly small, so small that the hydrogen liberated in a water
voltameter placed in series with the discharge tube only amounted
to about 0-25 c.c. per hour.   As it is inconvenient to work with such
small currents, on account of the time which has to elapse before a
quantity of gas can be obtained sufficient to enable accurate measure
ments to be taken, I endeavoured to increase the current from the
coil. I found that, as I believe is the case with all induction coils, the
condenser supplied with it had not nearly enough capacity to enable
the coil to give out its maximum current.       When I added to this
condenser a large paraffin paper one, with a capacity of about
6 micro-farads, the current from the coil was increased more than
twenty times, and I found no difficulty in getting from 4 to 6 c.c. of
hydrogen liberated per hour in the water voltameter in series with
the   discharge tube.
   In order to measure the quantity of electricity which passes through
the spark tube, a well-insulated water voltameter was placed in series
with     and the quantity of hydrogen liberated in this voltameter
       it,
observed.    The gases liberated in this voltameter were repeatedly
tested, in order to see whether there was any mixing up of the
hydrogen and oxygen in the collecting tubes over its electrodes.
Such admixture      seemed possible, as the electromotive          force produced
when the circuit        is   " made   "
                                    in the opposite direction to that pro

occurred.   As, however,          very difficult to get a mixture of hydro

                        Method    of   Making   the Experiments.
   After     had been ascertained, in the way previously described, that
             it
all the air had been expelled from the vessel, the eudiometer tubes
were filled with mercury and placed over the ends of the delivery
tubes, and the spark tube connected up with the coil.
  The next step was to see       the rates of flow through the delivery
                                      if
tabes were approximately equal.      This was done by turning on the
coil and collecting the mixed gases in the eudiometer tubes          the ;   if
volume of these gases in the two tubes was not the same, the appa-

ratus had to be readjusted.       When everything was fused togethej,
and there were no flexible joints, this bad to be done by letting the
delivery tubes F, G dip into separate basins filled with mercury, and
then to raise or lower the level of the mercury in one or other of
these basins until the rates of flow of the gases into the two eudio
meter tubes were approximately equal.
    It is not, however, necessary to have two vessels if the narrow
portions of the exit tabes are connected with the main portions by
flexible rubber joints turned under the surface of the mercury, as in
this case it is very easy to raise or lower the end of one or other of
 the tubes without interfering with the rest of the apparatus.
    These flexible connexions do not, as   I have found by direct experi
 ment, introduce any source of error, and add greatly to the longevity
 of the tube. When everything is fused up and the connexions are
 rigid, the shocks due to the explosion of the mixed gases are exceed
 ingly liable to break the exit tubes from off the main tubes, while
 they are comparatively harmless when there is a flexible connexion
 between the piece of the exit tube immediately under the collecting
 tube and the rest of the apparatus.
    When the exit tubes had been adjusted so that the rates of flow
 through the two tubes were the same, the mixed gases were emptied
 out of the collecting tubes, which were refilled with mercury ; the
 water voltameter was placed in series with the steam tube, and the
 coil again set in action.
     The steam which came up the collecting tubes condensed into hot
 water which soon displaced the mercury; the mixed gases collected
 over this hot water, and were exploded at short intervals of time by
  sparks from a small Wimshurst machine.          The gases did not dis
  appear entirely when the sparks passed; a small fraction of the
  volume remained over after each explosion, and the volume which
  remained was greater in one tube than in the other.
     The residual   gas which had the largest volume was found on
  analysis  to be hydrogen ; the other was oxygen.    Thus, by comparing
  the volumes of the residual gases in the two tubes it could readily be
  ascertained next to which electrodes the excesses of hydrogen and
  oxygen were appearing.
     There are other differences in the behaviour of the gases in the two
  tubes which, though less obvious than the difference in volume, are
  quite as characteristic.    One of these is the difference in the ease
  with which explosions      take place ; the gases explode much more
  readily  on the side at which the oxygen is in excess than on the
  other.   Another very characteristic difference is that when sparks
  pass in rapid succession through the tube in which the oxygen is in
  excess bright spangles often appear floating about in the gas, due,     I
  imagine, to the ignition of small pieces of platinum torn from the

1893.]                  The Electrolysis of Steam.                      99
electrodes.   I have never observed these     spangles on the hydrogen
side.
   When a sufficient quantity of the residual gas had been collected,
which   generally happened when the sparks had been passing for an
hour or an hour and a half, a considerable volume of the mixed gases
was allowed to accumulate, so as to make sure of an explosion when
the   spark from a Wimshurst passed through them.           The coil was
then stopped and the mixed gases exploded, and the quantity of
hydrogen in the water voltameter determined.
   The residual gases in the. collecting tubes were then analysed; the
first step was to cool these gases, which while the steam had been
rnshing into the tubes had been at a temperature of more than 80° C.,
down to the temperature of the room.       After this had been done, the
nature of these gases was determined by adding known volumes of
oxygen and hydrogen, prepared electrolytically from water, and
observing the contraction which took place when      a spark passed  ; the
addition of the hydrogeu or the oxygen, as the        case  might be, was
continued until no further contraction took place     on sparking.
    The result of these analyses was that when the    sparks were not too
long the residual    gas in one tube was found to be pure hydrogen,
that in the other pure oxygen ; if any other gases were present their
volume was too small to be determined by my analysis.          This result
was only attained after considerable experience with the experiments
and with the precautions necessary to obtain correct results ; in the
earlier experiments there was always a considerable quantity of some
other gas   (which,  I suppose, was nitrogen) present.
   When the sparks passing through the steam were very long               I
never succeeded in getting rid of this nitrogen ; indeed, in some cases
it amounted to more than 30 per cent. of the oxygen.        I am not sure
what the source of this nitrogen is ; it may have been absorbed by
the electrodes and given out when the sparks pass, or it may have
come from the walls of the discharge tube, as these long sparks have
a tendency to occasionally jump to the walls, and when they do so
they may liberate    air which would otherwise adhere to the glass.
                                  Results.
   The results obtained by the preceding method varied greatly in
their character with the length of the spark ; I shall therefore con
sider them under the heads "short sparks," "medium sparks," and
"
  long sparks."
   The lengths at which a spark changes from " short-" to " medium,"
and then again to " long," depend on the intensity of the current
passing through the steam, and therefore upon the size of the induc
tion coil and the battery power used to drive it.           The limits of
                                                                H 2

" short," " medium," and " long sparks " given below must therefore
be understood to have reference to the particular coil and current
used in these experiments.        With a larger coil and current these
 limits would expand ; with a smaller one they would contract.
                                Short Sparks.
    I shall  begin by describing the experiments with short sparks, i.e.,
sparks   from   l o to 4 mm. long. Here the appearance of the spark
 shows all the characteristics of the arc
                                         "    " discharge.
    The discharge passes as a thickish column with ill-defined edges,
and when placed in a wind it is blown out to a broad flame-like
appearance.
                                            I
    For these short sparks or " arcs," as prefer to call them, two very
important laws were found to be true —
    1. That within the limit of error of the experiments the volumes of
         the excesses of hydrogen in the one tube, and of oxygen in the
         other, which remain after the explosion of the mixed gases,
         are, respectively, equal to the volumes of the hydrogen and
         oxygen liberated in the water voltameter placed in series with
         the steam tube.
    2. The   excess of hydrogen appears in the tube which is in con
         nexion with the positive electrode, the excess of oxygen in the
         tube which is in connexion with the negative electrode.
    The second of these results surprised me very much when I first
 observed it, as both Perrot and Ludeking had found that in the
 electrolysis of steam, as in that of water, the excess of hydrogen was
 at the negative and that of oxygen at the positive electrode. Accord
 ing to my experiments, however, the electrode at which the hydrogen
 appears in the electrolysis of steam is of the opposite sign to that at
 which it appears in the electrolysis of water. So that, if a water
 voltameter    is placed in series with the steam tube, the gases are
 liberated in the way shown in the accompanying diagram (fig. 4), in
                                    Fig. 4.

 which    it will   be   seen    that the electrodes at which the hydrogen
 appears are next       each     other, as are also these at which the oxygen
 appears,    instead of being arranged alternately as they would hare
 been if two water voltameters had been placed in series.
    A very large number of experiments were made to test the truth of
 this law, platinum as well as gold electrodes were tried, and I replaced
 the metal tubes which serve as the electrodes in my apparatus                by
 wires   surrounded      by glass tubes ; so as to make the form of the
 apparatus    approximate as closely as possible to that used by Perrot ;
 the results, however, were all perfectly           definite and uniform ; the
 hydrogen always appeared in the tube next the positive electrode, the
oxygen in the one next the negative electrode.
   A good method of showing the way in which               the hydrogen follows
the   positive electrode is to keep the coil on one way until about 2 c.c.
of hydrogen have been collected in the tube next the positive and
about 1 c.c. of oxygen in the tube next the negative electrode, then
 reverse the coil ; the volume of residual gas will be found gradually to
 diminish as the mixed gases are exploded, and this diminution goes
on until the hydrogen and oxygen previously collected have quite dis
appeared, and      the water       reaches right to the top of the collecting
tubes.      After   this,  if   the sparking is continued, oxygen begins to
appear where hydrogen            had previously been, and vice versd.
   The reversal of the coil supplies a very useful means of telling
 whether the apparatus is properly adjusted.               If the rates of flow
through the two delivery tubes are very different, hydrogen may
appear in one of the tubes, and oxygen in the other, from some cause
which is not electrical       ;  this can be detected at once by reversing   the
coil.
   The following table (p. 102) contains the results of some measure
ments of the relation between the excesses of hydrogen and oxygen in
the collecting tubes attached to the steam tubes and the quantity of
hydrogen liberated in a water voltameter placed in series with the
discharge tube.       The ordinary vibrating break supplied with induc
tion coils was used,            except when the nature of the break is
indicated.
   The results tabulated above show that the excesses              of hydrogen
and   oxygen are approximately equal to the quantities              of hydrogen
and oxygen liberatad in the voltameter.
                                    Medium Sparks.
   When the spark leugth is greater than 4 mm., the first of the pre
ceding results ceases to hold.          The second of these, that the hydrogen
comes off at the positive electrode, remains true until the sparks arc
some 11 mm. long ; but, instead of the hydrogen from the steam being

     This increase in the ratio of the hydrogen from the steam to that
 from the voltameter does not continue when the length of the spark
 is still further increased.          When the spark length has got to 8 mm.
 this ratio begins to fall off very rapidly as the spark length increases,
 and we soon reach a spark length at which it seems almost a matter
 of chance whether hydrogen or oxygen appears in the collecting tube
 connected with the positive electrode.
     When the sparks are at this critical length the kind of thing which
 happens is somewhat as follows :— For some time an excess of hydro
 gen (say) comes off in the tube next the positive electrode, and
 accumulates        as    the mixed       gases    are explodod    ;   then some      slight

change takes place        in the action of the coil, and an excess of oxygen
begins to appear; this gradually wipes out the accumulation                   of
hydrogen, and if it goes on long enough makes the residual gas in
the tube entirely disappear ; then the oxygen begins to accumulate,
only, however, to be wiped out later, when another change in the
action of the coil has caused hydrogen to appear in excess in this
tube.     Thus, in this case, the residual gas in the tuhe does not, as
before, steadily increase with the time of sparking, but is continually
waxing and waning, sometimes being oxygen and sometimes hydrogen.
                                   Long Sparks.
    When the spark length is increased beyond the critical value            the
excess of hydrogen, instead of appearing as with shorter sparks               at
the positive electrode, changes over to the negative; the excess              of
oxygen at the same time .going over         from the negative  to the positive
electrode.      Thus the gases when the spark length is greater than
its   critical value, appear at the same terminals as they do when
released from an ordinary electrolyte, instead of at the opposite ter
minals, as they do when the sparks are shorter.
    The length of spark at which this reversal takes place depends, to
a   very great extent, upon the current sent through the steam: the
smaller the current the shorter the critical spark length.                   By
diminishing the current by inserting a liquid resistance         I  reduced, on
one occasion, the critical spark length from 11 to 8 mm. This critical
length, too, seems to depend upon a number of small differences not
easily specified      it will even vary greatly in the course of one after
 noon, though apparently nothing has been changed.             I   have found,
 however,     that this caprieiousuess disappears either altogether, or to
a  very great extent,       if Leyden jars — very small ones will do — are
attached to the terminals of the steam tube, or if an air break is
placed in series with that tube.             Under these circumstances the
 critical length will, if the same coil is used, remain constant from
 day to  day.
    It will   be noticed   that my results, when the length of the spark is
 greater than the     critical length, agree with those obtained by Perrot
 and  Lndeking,     as these observers found    that the hydrogen appeared
 at the   negative,    the oxygen at the positive, electrode. Ludeking
 worked with long sparks only, so that his results are quite in accord
 ance with mine.        In Perrot's experiments the spark length was about
 0 mm.      I  have never been able to reduce the critical length quite as
 low as  this, even though I diminished the current to the magnitude
 of that used by Perrot; I have, however, got it as low as 8 mm., and
 it is probable that the critical length may not be governed entirely
 by the   current.

      I was not able to detect any change in the appearance of the spark
  as the spark length passed through the critical value.              My observa
  tion on the connexion between the appearance of the discharge and
  the electrode at which the excess of hydrogen appears may be
  summed up in the statement that when the discharge is plainly an
  arc the hydrogen appears at the positive electrode, and when the
  hydrogen appears at the negative electrode the discharge shows all
  the characteristics of a spark.          However, before the spark length
 reaches its critical value the discharge looks much more like a spark
  than an arc.
     With regard to the quantity of hydrogen liberated from the steam
 in comparison with that set free in the voltameter, I find that when
 the spark    length  is a few millimetres     greater than the critical length
 the amount of hydrogen from the steam is very approximately the
 same as that in the voltameter.         The following table contains a few
 measurements on this poir.t : —

     When the sparks are longer than 14 mm. the amount of hydrogen
 from the steam was no longer equal to that from the voltameter.
 The results, however, were irregular, and, as mentioned before, there
 was a considerable quantity of nitrogen (?) mixed with the hydrogen
and oxygen.
     When the sparks are very much longer, say about 22 mm., the
 electrode at which the hydrogen appears reverses again, i.e., the
hydrogen comes off at the positive electrode, just as it does when the
 sparks are very short.         With these very long sparks the current is
extremely small, and it takes several hours to liberate 1 c.c. of
hydrogen in the voltameter.
     The proportion of hydrogen from the steam to that from the volta
meter was with these long sparks too irregular to admit of any con

     The preceding results show that in the electrolysis of steam, as in
that of water, there is a very close connexion between the amounts of
hydrogen and oxygen liberated at the electrodes and the quantity of
electricity which has passed through the steam, and that this rela
tion for certain lengths of sparks is the same in steam as in electro
lytes.     There is, however, this remarkable difference between the
electrolysis of steam and that of water, that whereas in the case of
    * In thi- experiment there was an air break 9 mm. long in series with the steam
tube.

water the hydrogen always comes off at the negative, the oxygen at
the positive,  electrode, in the case of steam the hydrogen and
oxygen come off sometime at one terminal, sometimes at the other,
according to the nature of the spark.
   The result obtained with the arc discharge, viz., that the oxygen
appears at the negative electrode, the hydrogen at the positive, is
 what would    happen if the oxygen in the arc had a positive charge,
the hydrogen    a negative one.    As this is contrary to the commonly
received views of the electro-chemical       properties of these gases, I
endeavoured to see if I could obtain any other indications of this
peculiarity.   With this object I have made a series of experiments on
the properties of various gases when the arc discharge passes    through
them.    I  began these merely with tho idea of elucidating the par
ticular point mentioned above, but one experiment has led on to
another until they form a series too long to be described here ; 1 shall,
therefore, limit myself to those experiments which seem to have the
most direct bearing on the electrolysis   of steam.
   The apparatus used for these experiments is represented in the
figure.   The arc discharge between the platinum terminals A, B was
produced by a large transformer, belonging to the Cavendish Labora-
                                  Fio. 5.

tory, which transforms up in the ratio of 400 to 1 ; an alternating
current of about 35 amperes, making 80 alternations per second, was
sent through the primary of this. A current of the gas under examina
tion entered the discharge tube through the tube C, placed underneath
the arc, and blew the gas in the neighbourhood of the arc against the
platinum electrode E, which was connected to one quadrant of an
electrometer, the other quadrant of which was connected to earth.
To screen the electrode E from external electrical influence, it was
enclosed in a platinum tube, D, the end of which was made of fine
platinum wire gauze, which, though it served as a screen for electro
static action, yet allowed the gases in the neighbourhood of the arc to
pass through it. This tube was connected to earth.            After passing
out of the tube, the electrode E was attached to one end of a gutta-
percha-covered wire wound round with tin-foil connected to the
earth  ; the other end of this wire was connected to the electrometer.
   The experiments were of the following kind : — The quadrants of
the electrometer were charged up by a battery ; the connexion with
the battery was then broken, and the rate of leak observed.           When
the arc was not passing the insulation was practically perfect, the
spot of light reflected from the mirror of the electrometer hardly
moving appreciably in the course of three minutes.           As soon, how
ever, as the arc was started, and for as long as it continued, the insu
lation of the gas surrounding E in many cases completely gave way.
 There were, however, some remarkable exceptions to this, which we
now proceed to consider.
                                   Oxygen.
   We shall begin by considering the       case when  a well-developed   arc
 passes through oxygen : —
    1. When the electrode E is charged negatively. In this case it loses
         its charge very rapidly, it does not, however, remain uncharged,
         but acquires a positive charge, increasing until the electrode E
         has acquired a potential V. V depends greatly on the size of
         the arc and the proximity of the electrode ; in many of my ex
         periments it was from 10 to 12 volts.
    2. When the electrode is charged positively.        If the potential is
         very high, the electrode leaks until the potential sinks to V ;
         after reaching this potential the leak stops, and the gas seems
         to insulate as well as when no discharge is passing through
         it. If the potential to which E is initially raised is less than V
         (a particular case being when the electrode is entirely with
         out charge to begin with), the positive charge increases until
         the potential of E rises to V.
    Thus wc    see (1) that an electrode immersed in the arc oxygen can

1893.]                      The Electrolysis   of Steam.                   107
insulate a small positive charge perfectly, while it instantly loses a
negative one ; (2) that an uncharged electrode immersed in this gas
acquires a positive charge.
    If the spark length is increased until the discharge passes as a
spark, then the electrode leaked slowly, whether charged positively or
negatively ; the leak in this case is, however, very small compared to
that which exists when the discharge passes as an arc.
                                     Hydrogen.
    When similar experiments are tried in hydrogen, the results are
quite different.
    When the arc discharge passes through hydrogen the electrode E
always leaks when it is charged positively ; it does not merely lose its
positive charge, hut acquires a negative one, its potential falling to
U, where U is a quantity that depends on the size of the arc, and on
its proximity to the electrode ; in my experiments A or 6 volts was a
common value for U.            If the electrode E is initially uncharged, it
acquires a negative charge, the potential falling to U, while if it is
initially charged negatively it leaks if the negative potential is greater
than U, until the negative potential falls to U, when no further leak
occurs ; if the negative potential is less than U, the negative charge on
 the electrode increases until the potential hecomes equal to U, when
 it remains steady.
     It is much more difficult to get a good arc in hydrogen than in
 oxygen, and, as it is essential to the success of the preceding experi
 ments     that the discharge should pass as a well-developed arc, the
  experiments with hydrogen are a little more troublesome than those
 with oxygen.
     These experiments show that the oxygen in or near the arc dis
  charges a negatively electrified body, hut not a positively electrified
  one, while the hydrogen in or near the arc discharges a positively
  electrified body, but not a negatively electrified one.         And also that
  an unchanged electrode becomes          positively electrified in the oxygen,
  negatively electrified in the hydrogen.
     I next endeavoured to see if this charging up of the electrodes is
  dne to an electrification     developed by the contact of the gas in the
  arc with the electrode, or whether this gas behaved as if it possessed
  an independent       charge of electricity.
      If the electrification is due to the contact of the gas with the elec
  trode, then it ought to disappear when the electrode is covered with a
  layer of a non-conductor ; if, however, the gas in the arc behaves as
  if it were charged, then, even though the electrode is covered with a
  non-conductor, the electrostatic induction due to the charge on the
  gas ought to produce a deflection of the electrometer in the same
  direction as   if the electrode were uncovered.

   108                       Prof.  J. J.  Thomson.                  [Mar. V.
      I tried, therefore, the effect of covering the electrode with glass,
  with mica, with ebonite, and sulphur.          I found that, in all these
  cases, the electrometer was deflected as long as the arc existed, and
  that the deflection was in the direction corresponding to a positive
  charge when the arc was in oxygen, and in that corresponding to a
  negative one when the arc was in hydrogen.          The deflection, though
  not so large as when the electrode was bare, was quite unmistakable.
  It disappeared almost entirely as soon as the arc stopped.
     Another experiment which I tried was to surround the arc by a
  large glass tube, coated inside and out with a thin layer of sulphur to
  prevent conduction over its surface.         A ring of tin-foil was placed
  outside the tube, so as to surround tho place where the arc passed ;
 this ring was connected with one of the quadrants of an electrometer.
 As a further precaution against the creeping of the electricity over
 the surface of the tube, two thin rings of tin-foil, connected to the
 earth, were placed round the ends of the tube. In this case, when
 the arc passed through oxygen the quadrants of the electrometer
 connected with the central ring of tin-foil were positively charged by
 induction, while when the arc passed through hydrogen these quad
rants were negatively charged.            These experiments show that the
oxygen in the arc behaves as if it had a charge of positive electricity,
while the hydrogen in the arc behaves as if it had a charge of negative
electricity.
    The electrodes in the preceding experiments were so large that
they were not heated sufficiently by the arc discharge to become
 luminous.
     Elster and Geitel found that a metal plate placed near a red-hot
platinum wire became positively electrified if the plate and the wire
were surrounded by oxygen, negatively electrified if they were sur
rounded by hydrogen.         If we suppose that the effect of the hot wire
is to make the surrounding gas in a condition resembling the ga3 in
the arc, Elster and Geitel's results would be explained by the preced
ing experiments, for these have shown that when this gas is oxygen
it is positively electrified, and when hydrogen negatively electrified.
    The following explanation of the results of the experiments on the
electrolysis of steam seems to be that which agrees best with the
preceding investigation.
    When an electric discharge passes through a gas the properties of
the gas in the neighbourhood of the line of discharge are modified.
Thus,     as Hittorf and Schuster have shown, the gas in the neighbour
hood     of the discharge is no longer an insulator, but can transmit a
current under a very small potential difference.         Faraday's remark,
that when once a spark has passed through a gas the passage of
anothor following it immediately afterwards is very much facilitated,
is another example of the same thing.           We have thus good reasons

 1893.]                    The Electrolysis of  Steam.
for believing      that when a spark passes through a gas it produces
a   supply   of  a modification of the gas, whose conductivity is enor
mously greater than that of the original gas.         I have shown (' Phil.
Mag.,' November, 1891) that the conductivity of this modified gas is
comparable with that of strong solutions of electrolytes.         When the
discharge stops this modified gas goes back to its original condition.
If now the discharges through the gas follow each other so rapidly
that the modified      gas produced by one discharge has not time to return
to its   original condition before the next discharge passes, the succes
sive    discharges will pass through this modified gas. If, on the
other     hand, the gas has time to revert to its original condition
before the       next discharge passes, then the discharges pass through
the    unmodified gas ; we regard this as being accomplished by means
of successive decompositions and recombinations           of its molecules,
analogous to those which, on Grotthus' theory of electrolysis, occur
 when a current passes through an electrolyte.
     We regard the arc discharge as corresponding to the first of the
 preceding cases where the discharge passes through the modified gas,
 the spark discharge corresponding to the second when the discharge
 goes   through the gas in its unmodified condition.
     From this point of view, the explanation of the results of the ex
 periments on the electrolysis of steam are very simple.       The modified
 gas produced by the passago of the discharge through the steam con
 sists of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, these gases being in the
 same condition      as when   the arc discharge passes through hydrogen
 and oxygen respectively, when, as wo have seen, the hydrogen       behaves
 as if it had a negative charge, the oxygen as if it had a positive one.
 Thus, in the case of the arc in steam, the oxygen, since it behaves as
  if it had a positive charge, will go to the negative, while the hydro
 gen, behaving as if it had a negative charge, will go to the positive
 electrode.      We saw that this separation of the hydrogen and oxygen
  took place.
     The correspondence between the quantities of hydrogen and oxygen
  from the electrolysis of the steam and those liberated by the electro
  lysis of water shows that the charges on the atoms of the modified
  oxygen and hydrogen are the same in amount, but opposite in sign to
  those we ascribe to them in ordinary electrolytes.
      In the case of the long sparks where the discharge goes through
  the steam, since the molecule of steam consists of two positively
  charged hydrogen atoms and one negatively charged oxygen one, when
  the molecule splits up in the electric field the hydrogen will go towards
   the negative, the oxygen towards the positive, electrode, as  in ordinary-
   electrolysis.    We saw (p.    103) that for  long sparks through steam
   the hydrogen appeared at the negative, the oxygen at the positive,
   electrode.

                                   (Abstract.)
   Nature of Mycetoma. — A very chronic, locally spreading inflamma
tion of the foot, much less commonly of the hand ; characterised by
the destruction of the tissues, great overgrowth of granulation tissue,
and by the presence of very numerous brown-white, fish-roe-like par
ticles, or more rarely of black particles.
   Views held concerning Mycetoma. — In 1874, Carter held              that the
" fungus foot " was a veritable parasitic disease, due to the            growth
and extension, within the tissues, of an " indigenons mould."          He came
to the conclusion that it was one species, the Ghionyphe                 Carteri.
Lewis     and   Cunningham       (1888)    concluded    that   mycetoma      was
" essentially a degeneration of the fatty tissues, independent of the
local presence or influence of any parasites whatever."          Bassini (1888)
met with a case in Italy, the only one, as yet, observed in Europe,
and concluded that the parasite was allied to the higher Fungi, either
the Aspergilli or Mucorini.         Most recently, Dr. Kanthack brought
forward evidence to show the identity or close affinity of the parasite
with that of actinomycosis.
    Our Views. — That the black particles represent a curious metamor
phosis of a large, branching, septate fungus ; whilst the white particles
consist largely of caseous material and of the remains of a lowly organ
ised fungus, presenting in very many instances some of the character
istics of the fungus of actinomycosis. That both fungi are pathogenic.
The following observations in support of these views are based upon an

1893.]     Existence   of more than   one  Fungus in Mycetoma.           Ill
examination of seven specimens of the black variety and of eighteen
of the white, obtained from Bombay and from the various museums
throughout the United Kingdom.
    Black Variety. — Sections of the particles, free or in situ in the
tissues, show that they are composed of tufts of a deep brown colour,
and apart from    a faint radiation or the presence of   a  slight venation
or of holes, they give very little indication of    a vegetable structure.
By boiling the particles for from a few minutes to one hour in concen
trated caustic potash, the brown colouring matter is very slightly
removed, but this is completely discharged upon transferring them to
distilled water; the fungus can then be readily studied.        The animal
tissues are however, destroyed by this process.          If, however, the
tissue containing the particles is embedded in collodion, washed for
about one minute in
                         " eau de Javel," and then stained, the
                                                                   colouring
matter is removed from the fungus, and its relationship to the tissues
around can be readily seen.       The fungus appears the same in all the
specimens of the black ; the hyphae radiate and branch, the segments
vary very greatly in size ; they may be spherical and reach a very
great size, or long and slender    ; a pseudo-parenchyma    may be formed
in the centre of a tuft, or a palisade at tho periphery.     We have seen
no organs of fructification. Tissue reaction. — The tufts are embedded
in granulation tissue or necrosed material, and the presence of very
large giant cells and other phagocytes is characteristic.       The hyphae
may penetrate the vessels and run in their .interior. The metamorphosis
of the fungus appears to take place very early and affects equally
 the various hyphae throughout the tissues.       The nature and meaning
of the change is very obscure.          The dried particles burn with a
 luminous flame. Incinerated, there is a slight smell of burnt feathers,
and in the ash, which is very little, there is a brown coloration, owing
to the presence of iron ; the presence of the latter may be confirmed
in the unclarified and clarified specimens by the Prussian blue test.
The iron is, however, limited to the periphery of the tufts, and appears
 wholly derived from the animal tissues. The particles give a red
reaction with dilute nitric and hydrochloric acids: little impression
 is produced upon them by boiling in the various fat solvents ; they
 give no special reactions with ferric chloride or cupric acetate (resin
 test) .
    White Variety. — Sections of the particles are characteristic.     In the
centre are usually numerous small reniform deeply- staining masses,
 surrounded by a deep radiate zone.       In the central bodies a very fine
 reticulum may occasionally be made out ; more usually, stronger
evidence of the fungus is obtained by the presence of dwarfed club
 like hyphae, which form an irregular fringe to the reniform bodies.
 It is exceedingly difficult to ascertain what gives rise to the deep
 radiate zone; the leucocytes in it are compressed, yet the compressing

hyphae    remain for the most, part unstained.           The fungus undergoes
very early degeneration.          Tissue reaction. — The particies are sur
rounded by leucocytes and are either embedded in granulation tissue
or lie free in the abscess cavities or sinuses.
   In both varieties the spread of the particles and inflammation goes
hand in hand, and a recurrence of the particles and of the inflamma
tion has been observed by one of us in the scar left after amputation
for the black variety of fungus foot.

    It  is now nearly ten years since this illustrious Society con
ferred on me the unexpected honour of electing me one of its Foreign
Members.         Not only so, but last autumn it held me worthy of a
further honour, in awarding me the Copley Medal, — a sign of the
highest      recognition of my work, the significance of which far
exceeds      the distinctions   which the passing favour of political
powers     is  accustomed   to  bestow.   Nevertheless, deeply as  I appre
ciated this mark of its constant and increasing esteem,              I  was
not in     a position    to offer my thanks personally to the Society.-
Numerous duties, official and private, the weight of which has
increased with each year, kept me to continuous work at home,
and even during the vacations the freedom of my movements has
been for some time past restricted by international engagements,
which yearly become more numerous and more pressing.
    With great indulgence, which I fnlly know how to appreciate, the
Council has allowed me to postpone the date of my appearance in
your midst.        Hence, it is only to-day that you see me among you,
and that I am able. to tell you in person how very grateful I am to
this Society, and how great an incentive to new efforts your recog
nition has been to me.
    Who of us is not in need of friendly encouragement in the
changing events of life ?          True, happiness is not based on the
appreciation of others, but on the consciousuess of one's own honest
labour.      How otherwise should we hold our ground in the midst of
the turmoil of the day ?           How should we preserve the hope of

  1893.]             Pathology among Biological Studies.                115
  progress and    of final victory, in face of the attacks of opponents and
 the insults which are spared to nobody who comes before the public ?
  He who daring a long and busy life is exposed to public opinion,
  certainly learns to bear unjust criticism with equanimity, but this
 comes only through the confidence that his cause is just, and that
 gome day it must triumph.          Such is our hope in our wrestlings for
  progress in science and art. Such is our hope in our struggles for civil
 and religious liberty, and in this hope we gradually become hardened
 against malicious attacks.       It is a kind of immunisation which,      I
 acknowledge,      has also great drawbacks, for this hardening against
 unjust attacks leads very easily to a similar indifference towards just
 attacks, and, owing to the tendency to contradiction         rooted in the
 nature of human thought, it finally leads also to indifference to praise
and recognition.      We withdraw again and again into ourselves, discon
 tented with the world and with ourselves also ; but who can so com
 pletely retire within himself that the consciousuess of the insufficiency
of human thought, and that the criticisms of opponents are justified,
cannot     penetrate the crust of even the most hardened reserve ?
 Happy is he who has courage enough to keep ap or regain his re
 lations with other men, and to take part in the common work ! Thrice
happy he who does not lack in this work the flattering commendation
of esteemed colleagues      !
    Such were the thoughts which filled my mind, as, looking forward
to the    present occasion,   I reviewed my own life and the history of
science, or, to use another expression, the fortunes of our predecessors.
 How often have      I found myself in a state of despondency, overcome
by   a feeling of extreme depression ! And the history of science — what
long periods of stagnation and what numerous interruptions has it not
experienced      owing to the victory of erroneous doctrines ! What has
saved ine is the      habit of work, which has not forsaken me even in
the days of outward misfortune — that habit of scientific work which
has always appeared to me as a recreation, even after wearying and
useless efforts in political, social, and religious matters.
    That which has saved science is identically the same ; it only
appears to be different, because the co-operation of many is necessary
to secure    its advance ; hence, the exalting and consoling thought that
one nation after another comes to the front, to take its share in the
work.     When the star of science becomes dim in one country it rises
sooner    or later, to yet brighter glory, in another, and thus nation
after nation becomes the teacher of the world.
    No science, more often than medicine, has gone through these
waxings and wanings of brilliancy ; for medicine alone of all the
sciences has, for more than 2000 years, found ever new homes in the
course   of a progress which, though      often disturbed,  has never been
wholly arrested.
                                                                  i 2

 116             Prof. Rudolf Virchow.         The Position    of    [Mar. 16,
    It would  lead us too far to illustrate this with examples drawn from
 the entire past. It is enough for my present purpose to take the out
lines of modern medicine as the object of our consideration.             Such a
sketch, cursory as it must be, ought at the same time to throw some
light on the intellectual relations of both nations, English and
German, for these have taken a prominent part in establishing the
principles of modern medicine.
    The downfall of the old medicine, the so-called humoral pathology,
was brought about in the beginning of the 16th century.                 We, in
Germany, are inclined to attribute to ourselves a decisive rote in this
 memorable struggle.
    It was a man of our race, Andreas Vesalins (or of Wesel), who
transformed anatomy into an exact science, and who thus, at one
stroke, created for medicine a solid foundation, which it has retained
ever since and which, let us hope, it will never again lose.
    But the principal blow to the old medicine, was struck by his
somewhat elder contemporary Paracelsus, that charlatan, yet gifted
physician, who removed from among the beliefs of mankind the
doctrine of the four humores, which, gttasi-chemical in its construc
tion, formed the basis of the old pathology.            Strangely enough, he
accomplished this with weapons borrowed from the armoury of the
Arabs, the successors of the Greeks, and the chief representatives of
the mediaeval humoral pathology.           From them, also, he borrowed
alchemy, and, at the same time, the fantastic spiritualism of the
East, which found a clear expression in his doctrine                    of the
" Archasus," as the determining force in all living beings.
    In this way, the new medicine, at its very birth, absorbed the
germs of that ruinous antagonism, which, even up to the present
century, has kept up the embittered strife of the Schools.
    To Vesalius is due the exact spirit of inquiry which starts from
the observation of actual conditions, and which, without further
definition, we may call the anatomical.
    Paracelsus, who pronounced the        anatomy of the dead body to be
useless, and sought for the basis of     life  as the highest goal of know
ledge, demanded "contemplation"           before all else; and, just as he
himself arrived in this way at the       metaphysical construction of the
archaei, so he let loose among his        followers   a  wild and absolutely
 fruitless mysticism.
    Nevertheless there lay hidden in that " contemplation
                                                                    "  of his a
 healthy  kernel,  which  would  not  allow   the intellectual  activity which
 it had stirred up to sink to rest. It was the idea of life, which formed
the ultimate problem for all future research.              Strangely enough,
this idea, which always existed       in  the popular mind, and which is
in an unmistakable form present even amongst primitive nations, had
in scholastic medicine     been  driven   far into the background.         Ever

 since the     time of Hippocrates, it bad         been    the custom to use,
 instead    of life, the obscure expression         0s<ri9,  n itura ; but it is
 vain to seek     for a more   exact  definition of  the  term.    To Paracelsus
 nature was living, and the basis of his life was that very
                                                                        "
                                                                          archaeus/'
 a force differing from matter, and separable from it, or, as he himself
 expressed    it, in the  sense of the    Arabs, a spirit, "spiritus." In the
 compound       organism of man, the mikrokosmos, each part, according
 to him, had its own "archaeus," but the whole was ruled by the
 "
    archreus maximus," the
                                  " spiritus rector." From this premiss has
 proceeded that long succession of vitalistic schools, which, in ever-
 changing forms, and with ever new nomenclature, introduced into
 the notions      of physicians    this idea of a fundamental          principle of
 life.
     If the sagacious George     Ernest Stahl, whose services to the develop
 ment     of chemistry are now universally acknowledged, substituted
 the soul  for the " spiritus rector," and so created a system of animism,
 the last vestiges of which have only within our own time disappeared
 from the school of Montpellier, so also in turn did the pure vitalists
 build up on the dogma of specific dynamic energies, maintained so
stoutly by the physicists, that notion of the vital force, the half
spiritualistic and half physical character of which has contributed so
much, even in our day, to puzzle and mislead men's minds.
    The doctrine of the vital force found its strongest support in the
"                                        in that which, on German ground,
    Natur-philosophie,"     especially
soon obtained universal       sovereignty.
    This summary exposition          of mine has greatly anticipated the
historical progress of the evolution of medicine.              It is now time to
pay proper homage to the great investigator who made the more
exact method the ruling one, and at the same time to award to this
country, which brought him forth, its important share in determin
ing the new direction of our science.
    Nearly 100 years had passed since Vesalius and Paracelsus had
                                                                     '
begun their work when William Harvey published his                     Exeroitatio
an a to mica de    motu cordis et sanguinis in animalibus.'         Here, for the
first   time, the anatomical examination of living parts was carried
through, in an exemplary way, according to experimental methods.
All the objections founded on the doctrine that anatomy concerned
itself with dead parts only were thus at once set aside ; living action
became the object of immediate observation, and this was done on one
of the most important organs, one absolutely necessary to life, the
varying activity       of which constantly calls for the attention of the
practical physician.       Not only so, but a new mode of observation —
the experimental method — was thus brought into use for research ; a
method by means of which a new branch of medical science, physio
logy, has been laboriously       built up.

 118            Prof. Rudolf Virchow.      The Position    of    [Mar. 16,
    The influence of this one wonderful discovery of Harvey's on the
ideas of men of his time, and of his successors, was memorable.
     Among the men of his time the last support of Galenism disap
 peared with the proof of circulation ; upon his successors the com
 prehension of the causation of local processes dawned for the first time.
Very ancient and highly difficult problems, such as inflammation,
could now be attacked ; a goodly piece of life also became intelligible;
 since one of the vital organs themselves could now be subjected to
 experiment, and, to the astonishment of all, the action of this organ
showed itself to be an absolutely mechanical one.         The revnlsion of
thought was so complete that it has since become an almost insuper
 able difficulty to enter even in imagination into the ideas of the older
 physicians, to whom the circulation of the blood was unknown.
    Nevertheless, in spite of such striking results, the craving of men
 for more complete understanding remained unsatisfied.         The action
 of the living heart could be seen, but how did the heart live ? What
 was this life, the action of which was so clearly visible ? In the
heart itself, the essence of life could not be recognised.
    Harvey turned his attention to another object ; he tried to observe
the very beginnings of life in the incubated egg of the fowl and
in the embryos of mammalian animals. He thereby soon arrived
at the question of the significance of the egg in general, and enun
 ciated the celebrated dictum, " Omne vivum ex ovo."        Owing to the
more extensive researches of modern investigators, this dictum, as is
well known, proved too narrow for the whole animal kingdom, and
no longer exact when applied to plant life.             Its validity for
the higher animals, on the other hand, cannot be questioned, and
it has formed one of the firm standpoints from which researches
on sexuality and on the propagation of life have proceeded.            But
Harvey,    on account  of the defective character  of his  optical instru
ments, was unable to see that which he was labouring to discover,
namely, the process of organisation as such, just as in former times he
had been unable to see the continuity of the capillary flow. This imper
fection lasted for a long time afterwards ; and thus it happened that
even Albrecht von Haller and John Hunter considered the formation of
the area vasculosa in the incubated egg of the fowl as the commence
ment of organisation, and indeed, as the type of organisation itself.
    I will return to this point later ; but I should like first to
draw your attention to a man whose importance for the further
development of the doctrine of life has always appeared to me
to have been uncommonly great and highly significant, but who,
nevertheless, has sunk into unmerited oblivion, not only among pos
terity in general, but also, I think I may be allowed to say, even
among his countrymen.          I mean Francis Glisson, who was a
contemporary of Harvey, and whose works        appeared almost simultaa

1893.]               Pathology among Biological Studies.                       119
neonsly   with those of his more celebrated colleague ; but the brilliancy
of Harvey's discoveries        was so great that the light which shone from
Glisson's work-table almost disappeared. I rejoice that on so auspicious
an occasion     I  may recall the memory of the modest investigator, and
may    offer  him     the tribute of gratitude which science ought long
since   to have awarded to him.
   When, thirty-five years ago, I published my little essay on
"                                   "
  Irritation and Irritability          (' Archiv f iir Pathologische Anatomie
nnd Physiologie,' 1858, vol. xiv, p. 1), I did not know much more about
Glisson than what every student of medicine learns, namely, that
there is in the liver a
                             "
                               capsula communis Glissonii," and, what was
even less known, that this anatomist had written a small work on
'Rachitis,' which, indeed, was tho first of its kind. In my own paper
on this disease {ibid., 1853, vol. v, p. 410) I had tried to demonstrate
the circumspection and accuracy which are noticeable in this book,
and which make it a typical model for all collective investigations ;
bat even at that time I overlooked the fact that this was only the
smallest merit of this wonderful man.              It was only in the further
course of my studies on the history of the doctrine of irritation and
irritability that I made the discovery, astonishing to me, that the
idea of irritability did not, as is generally thought, originate with
Haller, but that the father of modern physiology, and the Leyden
School in which he had been brought up, had borrowed this idea from
Glisson. I then stumbled on a series of almost forgotten publications
of this original scholar, especially his ' Tractatus de natura substan
tia energeticae, sen de vita naturae ejusque tribus primis facultatibus,
perceptiva, appetitiva et motiva,' which appeared in London in 1672,
wherein      the ideas were further worked               out, the outlines       of
which had already been brought forward in his ' Anatomia hepatis,'
published in 1654.          In this work (p. 400) the newly-coined word
                  "
"irritabilitas appears, so far as I can find out, for the first time in
literature.      It  may   be   noticed, by the way, that the expression
"             "                     I find it already in Celsus, but with an
   irritatio is much older.
exclusively pathological signification.          It appears, also, occasionally
in later writers, and to this day it has not, speaking accurately, lost
this original signification.        It is otherwise with Glisson ; to him,
irritability is a physiological property, and irritation merely a
process of    life dependent on the natural faculties of living matter.
    Thus he was led, through a process of " contemplation,"              to main
tain tho existence of the " biarchia," the " principium vitre," or the
"
   biusia," the
                    " vita substantial vel vitae substantia."       And in order
to allow of no misunderstanding as to the source of his             " contempla
tion," he adds distinctly that this is the " archams
                                                              " of Van Helmont
— the " vis plastica " of       plants   and animals.
    In the further course of his philosophical discussions,        he is betrayed,

120              Prof. Rudolf Virchow.       The Position   of    [Mar.  16,
nevertheless, into the same by-path, into which, even iu the most re
cent times, so many learned men and even excellent observers have been
misled.     This is the path of unlimited generalisation.       The human
mind is only too prone to render intelligible what is unintelligible in
particular phenomena, by generalising them.          Just as even  in recent
times an attempt has been made to render consciousuess intelligible by
representing it as merely a general property of matter, so Glisson
thought he might attribute to the active principle (" principium
energeticum ") which according to him is contained in all matter, the
three faculties of living matter which he considered as fundamental,
namely, the facultas perceptiva, appetitiva et motiva.           All matter
was sensitive, was thus stimulated to develop impulses, and moved
itself as a consequence of these impulses.
    It is not necessary for the purpose of our present enquiry to carry
these    quotations   further, since they are quite, in the Paracelsian
sense,    contemplative   in their nature ; and especially as, in their
generalisation, they do not appear to be important for the history of
advancing knowledge.
    That which is full of significance for us is concerned with actual
life only, in the narrower sense of analytic science. It was not the
"                              "  set up by Glisson,  which stimulated
   principium energeticum                                                 his
successors again to take up the thread of his observations, but rather
this process of irritation described by him, together with the
 fundamental faculties of living matter on which it depended. Id
 this way he has really led up to a more exact study of the actions of
 life and the properties of living matter.
    Unfortunately, there intervened a mistaken conception, which led
 his followers again into a series of most serious errors. Glisson, fol
 lowing on this point also the example of Van Helmont, was convinced
 that nerves contracted when irritated. He added to this the idea
 that, through the contraction of the nerves, or even of the brain, the
 fluid contained in them was propelled towards the periphery.
     This notion, shared by Willis and many other physicians of that
 time, furnishes the reason why irritability was identified with con
 tractility. Even the great master Hermann Boerhaave, and after
 him his pupil Gaubius, the first special writer on general pathology,
 considered    sensation   and   motion  as common properties      of, at all
 events, all the solid parts of the body.           The former thought it
 proved that hardly a single particle of the body existed which was
 not sensitive and did not move; and thus it becomes compre
 hensible how Haller himself carried this idea, that irritability had
 the same significance as contractility, from his school days in Leyden
 to his professorship in Gottingen.         It was in this sense that he
 understood the irritability of the muscles, and in the same sense he
 denied this property to the nerves.

    This dispute about the irritability of muscles has continued far
into the present century ; its long duration becomes intelligible only
when we bear in mind that, without the most exact knowledge of its
historical development, even the very statement of the question is
liable to be misunderstood.
    As a matter of fact, so far as we know, the nerves are not contrac
tile,  like the muscles ; on the other hand, the muscles are not only
contractile, but are also irritable. Irritability and contractility are
not identical, even when they occur in the same part.                   The nerve
current,    on  the  other   hand, cannot   be compared   with  the blood stream ;
it does not consist in the movement of a fluid, but is of electrical
nature, and hence        there is no need for its production of a contraction
of the nerve-tubes.
    It  was also an erroneous conclusion that every irritated part con
tracted.     Instead of contraction, secretion, or, under certain circum
stances, a more vigorous nutrition, may occur as the final result of
irritation.      Hence we use a more comprehensive term in order to
express    this   final result, and call all forms of it "actions."         While
 Glisson defined all      "  actio propria sic dicta
                                                      "
                                                        as
                                                           " motus activus," we
 distinguish different kinds according to the nature of the effects, or,
 otherwise    expressed, according to the direction of the activity (nutri
 tion, formation, and function) ; but we agree with the above thinker
 in the opinion that no vital energy is ever set free without stimulus :
 and that, consequently, every action is of an irritative nature.          In this
 irritation, according to my idea, consists the " principium dividendi,"
 according to which we must distinguish between active and passive
 processes of life, and in this way we gain also a basis for the funda
 mental division of pathological           elementary processes.       How much
 work has been necessary in order to render this conception possible !
 And how great, even now, is the number of our colleagues who
 have not fully accepted it !            The reason for this difficulty is two
 fold.
     Most of the vital actions of life, whenever they manifest themselves
  by visible events, are of a compound nature.            As a rule, parts very
  various,  at times   wholly    unlike,  each with its specific energy, combine
 to produce them.          Not unfrequently it thereby happens that in the
  visible sum of final effects one part behaves in an active, the other in
  a passive,  manner.       It is only the most minute analysis of the pheno
  menon, tracing it right back to the elementary parts, which allows
  the total result to be resolved into its components ; such an ana
  lysis cannot, as a rule, be expressed in current language, except
  at great length.      No language in the world is rich enough to possess
  special expressions for each such combination.              Only too often we
  help ourselves out of the difficulty by regarding the compound
  phenomenon       as a simple one, and by expressing       its character accord

iug to some chief trait, which stands out in a commanding manner
from the general picture.        This is the practical difficulty.
   With it, however, a theoretical difficulty is very often combined.
The human mind, owing to a natural impulse, seeks in the phenomena
indications of their determining cause.               The more complex the
phenomenon, the more busy is the imagination, in order to convert
it into a simple one, and to find for it a unitary cause. So has it
been in respect to life, so also in respect to disease.           The course of
thought followed by Glisson is opposed to such an explanation.              Ho
had no scruple in dividing the unit of life into a large number of
individual lives. Although the knowledge we now possess of the
arrangements of the body was absolutely foreign to him, yet he arrived
quite logically at the vita propria, the proper elementary life, of the
several parts.    To be sure, this expression, as far as I can see, is not
to be found in his works, and occurs first in those of Gaubius ; but
Glisson says distinctly :* " Quod vivit per se vivit vitam a nulla
creatura praeter se ipsum dependentem.             Hoc enim verba vivere per
se sonant."
    The unitary efforts of the following period relentlessly passed
over the tendency of which I have just spoken.               Some returned to
the old Mosaic dictum, "the life of the flesh is in the blood"; others
gave the nervous system, and the brain especially, the first place in
their consideration.      Thus once more began the old struggle, which
for thousands of years had divided the schools of medicine into
humoral and solidar pathology.          Even when we ourselves entered on
scientific work, haemato-pathologists stood in hostile attitude to neuro
pathologists.
    In England, humoral pathology found a strong support in the great
and legitimate authority of John Hunter. Although this distinguished
practitioner never shared the one-sidedness of the later pathologists,
but rather attributed to the solid parts the living principle the exist
ence of which he assumed, yet, in his investigations, the blood took
 precedence over all other parts as the chief vehicle of life.
    One must, however, recall to mind that Hunter laid special stress
 on the fact that life and organisation are not bound to each other,
 since animal substances which are not organised can possess life.
 He started,  as has already been noticed, from the erroneous conception
 that eggs are not organised, and that it was not till after incubation
 that the first act of organisation, namely, the formation of vessels,
 took place.     He considered his " diffuse matter " (" materia vitae
 diffusa ") as the actual carrier of life ; and this was to be met with not
 only in the solid parts, but in the blood also. This matter, according to
 him, existed in the brain in a remarkable degree of concentration, but
               * Glisson, '
                            Anatomia hepatis,' " Ad lectorem," N. 17.

 its presence     was quite independent of all nervous structures, as is
 shown by the example of the lower animals which possess no nerves.
 In the posthumous writings of Hunter, which Owen has collected,
                                 "             " is met with, a state most
 the very striking expression      simple life
 clearly to be recognised in plants and the lowest animals. This simple
 life was in Hunter's view the ultimate source of all living activities,
 pathological as well as physiological.
    Hunter was out and out a vitalist, but his materialistic vitalism, so
 to speak, differed toto cmlo from the dynamic vitalism of the German
 schools.    If living matter existed independently of all organisation,
 such living matter was beyond the scope of anatomical investigation ;
 but, on the other hand, if it were present in non-organised parts, such
 as an egg, it was in itself the ultimate source of the organisation
 which subsequently makes its appearance in these parts.          It must,
 therefore, to adopt a later mode of expression, be of a plastic nature.
 Here   Hunter's notion fell in with that of the plastic lymph, as de
 veloped    by Hewson ; and it was only logical that Schultzenstein
 at last applied it to the blood, and designated as "plasma" the
 material of life present in the blood.    In this way the formative and
 nutritive matter necessary to physiological life, as well as the plastic
exudations occurring in diseased conditions, could be attributed to
the same material — a highly satisfactory result in appearance, and
one providing a most convenient basis for interpretations.         The ex
ponents of this notion had no scruples in going one step further, and
in providing this material of life with a technical name. They called
it " fibrin."    Evidently this did not quite correspond with Hunter's
ideas, for we know of no such matter, either in the egg or in the plants
or the lower animals, as that to which he attributed simple life ; but
the exigencies of pathology overcame all such scruples, and the plastic
exudations were received as undoubted evidence that fibrin possessed
the power of becoming organised.       They formed, in the crasis doctrine
of the Vienna School, the bright spot in the history of this newest
kind of haemato-pathology.
    Wherever fibrin failed, blastemata were brought to the fore. Ever
since Schwann had given the name of cyto-blastema to the organising
material of the egg, the way had been open for assuming, in other
places,  the existence of material with this ambiguous name.
   But of course through these steps the one simple matter of life
predicated by Hunter was replaced by many " matters of life," and
thus the entire advantage gained by the exposition of a unitary theory
of life was at once lost.
   Even when, finally, the cell-contents were designated as protoplasm,
and thus the one requisite of Hunter, namely, that the material of
life must also be contained in the individual parts, appeared to be
fulfilled, yet no single specific material was thereby arrived at. No

124             Prof. Rudolf Virchow.          The Position of    [Mar. 16.
one dreamed of regarding protoplasm as fibrin, and least of all did
any one consider it a simple chemical body.
   By the conception of the blastema, however, there had been re
awakened a thought which had occupied men's minds from the
earliest times.    If a plastic matter capable of being organised really
existed in the body, then the organisation of the same must present the
first reliable example of epigenesis.       The problem of the " generatio
aequivoca," so long fought over, now appeared to be solved. What
Harvey had taught concerning the continuous descent from the egg
became temporarily obliterated when the theory of descent through
exudation made its appearance. Several generations of young medical
men have been        educated    in this belief.     I myself remember my
"epigenetic" youth,      with  no  little regret, and  I have had hard work
to force my way through to the recognition of the sober truth.
    Meanwhile, the attention of other bodies of inquirers had been
directed to the tissues of the body. Among these, in view of their
importance, the nervous tissues, and especially the mass of nervous
tissues in the brain and spinal cord, rank highest.
    Hunter also had acknowledged the importance of the brain, and
hence called it the
                      " materia vita? coacervata." It was easily seen that
it contained no fibrin, but experimental research showed also that
neither the brain nor the spinal cord was of the same value through
out all its parts.      The more accurate the experiments, the smaller
became the region which, in the strictest sense, is the vital part, until
Flourens limited it to one single spot, the knot of life (" noeud vital ").
Was the unity of life found in this way ? By no means. The brain is
no more and no less vital than the heart ; for life is present in the
egg long before the brain and heart are formed, and all plants,
together with an immense number of animals, possess neither the
one nor the other.       In the highly compound organism of man, the
brain and spinal cord have a certain determining action on other parts
necessary to life.      Their disturbance may immediately be followed
by the disturbance of other vital organs, and sudden death may
ensue.
    But the collective death of a compound animal no more implies the
immediate local death of all its special parts than the local death of some
of the latter is incompatible with the continued collective life of the
animal. As has been well said, at the death of a compound organism
there is a " primum moriens," one part which first ceases to live ; then
follow, sometimes at long intervals, the other organs, one after the
other, up to the " ultimum moriens."              Hours and days may pass
between the total death of the individual and the local death of the
parts.    The fewer nerves a part contains, the more slowly usually does
it die ; I therefore consider the process of dying in the compound
organism as the best illustration of the individual life of the several

constituent parts, which is in its turn the first axiom necessary for
the study and the understanding of life.
  A long time, however, elapsed before it was possible to return
to this starting point,   and to obtain a considerable     number of
                                   "                  The attention of
supporters for the doctrine of the   vita propria."
many observers was drawn to a totally different side of the question.
In the last decade of the past century, about the same time that John
Hunter, starting from careful anatomical investigations and exact
observations of surgical practice, worked out his idea of the material
of life, a new system of medicine was founded in Scotland, the so-
called Brownian system, which was based on quite different pre
misses.   Brown also was a vitalist ; he, too, constructed, not merely
a pathological  and therapeutic system of vitalism, but a physio
logical one, though this doctrine was dynamic in its character.
There is but little to be noticed therein of the material anatomical
foundation of exact medicine.       It is principally concerned with
contemplations of the forces of the living organism.   One can under
stand to some extent how this happened, if the history of the deve
lopment of this extraordinary personality is kept in view ; I cannot
go into this here, but anyhow the remarkable fact remains that the two
contemporaries, Brown and Hunter, worked near each other without
any evidence in their writings that they were acquainted with one
another.  Brown struck out his own line, and stuck to     without         it,
troubling himself about the rest of the medical world. And yet even
his first work,   Elementa Medicinae,' had the effect of an earth

   quantity of which, in the form of energy, every living being is
   endowed at the beginning of its life.
      The division of diseases, according to the amount of vital force
   visible in them, into sthenic and asthenic, has never since been
   abandoned, though acknowledged perhaps in a less precise manner;
   it has sometimes been brought more prominently forward, and some
   times thrown into the background.      In Germany, Schonlein was the
   one of all others who took this doctrine as the foundation for his
  opinion on special cases of disease, and of his choice of treatment.
      But the application of the Brownian principles to physiology has
  been of   far greater importance.      If life itself were dependent on
  external stimuli, the notion of the spontaneity of vital actions,
  a notion still in force, must lose all significance.      Certain stimuli
  would in that case prove to be necessary conditions               of vital
  activity, without which life could at best be carried on in a latent
  form only. Certainly even for this latent life the question remained
  open : How does it come to pass, and in what does it practically
  consist ? Brown avoided this ticklish question, not without great
  skill, by drawing the whole attention to active life and to the stimuli
  which call forth action.      To speak freely, science has since then
 deflected little, if at all, from this guiding notion.          Even now,
  we cannot say what latent life is.      We simply know that through
 external stimuli it may be converted into active life, and hence irrit
 ability is considered by us as the surest sign of life, not of course of
 the general life of all matter in the senRe of Glisson, but of the real and
 individual life of special living organisms.       Brown remarked, with
 reason, that through irritability the living substance is differentiated
 from the same substance in its dead condition, or from any other
 lifeless matter.    Nevertheless, neither irritability nor incitability,
 neither irritation nor incitation, explains the essence of the living
 substance, and therefore neither explains the essence of life.
     In Germany especially, the physiologists took up this question.
Among the first was Alexander von Humboldt, who in his various
writings, especially in his celebrated treatise on the irritated muscle
and nerve fibre, entered into the question.        In the end he held fast
to the assumption of a vital force.      The majority of pathologists and
physicians followed in his footsteps, and long and fierce controversies
were necessary before, nearly half a century later, the belief in a vital
force was destroyed. When du Bois-Reymond had demonstrated the
electrical current in muscle and nerve in all its characters, and, at
the end of his work, had also disclosed the inadmissibility of vital
force, then the venerable Humboldt formally and expressly renounced
the dream of his youth, with the masterly submission of the true
naturalist to the recognised natural law.
     The hypothesis of a particular force of life had, however, in regard

1893.]               Pathology among Biological Studies.                  127
to  Brown's theory neither a positive nor a negative value.        Johannes
Muller rescued for general physiology, in which it has ever since kept
its place, that which was valuable in Brown's system, the doctrine of
the integrating life stimuli.        The occasional stimuli which produce
disease have found their place in etiology ; their significance           has
become more and more         sharply defined, the more accurately we have
learnt to distinguish between the causes and the essences of disease,
a distinction which became more difficult as the
                                                          " causae vivae " of
diseases became known in ever-increasing numbers.            And now a new
task has arisen, namely, to draw into our sphere of observation the life
of the causative agents themselves.
    The way in which pathology has tried to approach the desired
goal, to fathom the living substance in its diseased conditions,
has   led us a great step forward. Pathological anatomy, especially,
has opened      this road. The more numerous its observations, and
the more it penetrated into the details of the lesions, the smaller
became the field of so-called general diseases.          The first steps of
medieval anatomists had the effect of drawing the attention
to local diseases.         In the first and longest period, which we
may     define as that of Regionism,          the pathological    anatomists
sought the cause of disease in one of the larger regions or cavities of
the body — in the head, chest, or abdomen.            In the second period,
ushered in by the immortal work of Morgagni, shortly before the
time of which       I  last spoke — the time of Brown and Hunter — they
 endeavoured to find in a certain region the actual organ which might
 be  considered as the seat of disease. On this foundation arose the
 Parisian school of Organicism, which, until late in this century, held
a dominant position in pathology.           In this school, already, they
 recognised    that not the organ, nor even a portion of it, could be the
 ultimate object of research.        Xavier Bichat divided the organs into
tissues, and showed that in the same organ sometimes one and some
times another tissue might be the seat of disease.
    From that time forward the eye of the pathological anatomist was
 directed   chiefly   to the changes in the tissues, but it soon became
 apparent    that   even   the tissues are not simple substances.       Since
 the third decade of this century, the microscope has disclosed the
 existence of cells, first in plants, and very soon afterwards in animals.
 Only living beings contain cells, and vegetable and animal cells show
 so much similarity of structure that one can demonstrate in them the
 actual product     of organisation.   This conviction has become general,
 since through    our embryologists, especially through Schwann, proof
 has been afforded that the construction          of embryonic tissues is
 derived from cells both in the highest animals and in man himself.
    In the fourth decade of this century the science of pathological
 anatomy    had already begun to be directed towards cells.        These re

   128            Prof. Rudolf Virchow.       The Position   of     [Mar.   1G.
  searches very soon encountered great difficulties.      Many tissues, even
  in their developed state, appeared     to contain   neither cells nor their
  equivalents ; nevertheless,   I have been able to demonstrate their
  existence in those tissues in which their presence appeared to be
   most doubtful, viz., in bone and connective tissues. At the present
  time we are so far advanced as to be able to say that           every living
  tissue contains cellular elements. We go a step further        even, for «u
  require that no tissue should be called living in which        the constant
  occurrence of cells cannot be shown.
     A still greater difficulty then appeared, namely, to         discover in
  what way new cells originated.     The answer to this question had been
  very heavily prejudiced by      the  so-called cell-theory of Schwann.
  Inasmuch as this very trustworthy investigator asserted that new
  cells originated from unformed matter, from " cyto-blastema,"
  there was opened up a wide road to the old doctrine of the " generatio
  aequivoca," which afforded all partisans of plastic materials an easy
 way of reviving their dogma. The discovery of cells of connective
 and allied tissues gave me the first possibility of finding a cellular
  matrix for many new growths.        One observation followed another,
 and I was soon in a position to give utterance to the dictum, " Omnis
 cellula a cellula."
     And so at last the great gap was closed which Harvey's ovistic
 theory had left in the history of new growth, or, to speak more
 generally, in the history of animal organisation.           The begetting
 of a new cell from a previous cell supplements the reproduction of one
 individual from another, of the child from the mother. The law of
 the continuity of animal development is therefore identical with the
law of heredity, and this I now was able to apply to the whole field
of pathological new formation.      I blocked for ever the last loophole
of the opponents, the doctrine of specific pathological cells, by show-
  ng that even diseased life produced no cells for which types and
ancestors were not forthcoming in normal life.
    These are the fundamental         principles of cellular pathology.
In   proportion as they have become more certain, and more generally
recognised, they have in turn become the basis of physiological
thought. The cell is not only the seat and vehicle of disease, but also
the seat and carrier of individual life ; in it resides the " vita propria."
It possesses the property of irritability, and the changes in its sub
stance, provided these do not destroy life, produce local disease.
    Disease pre-supposes life ; should the cell die, its disease also comes
to an end.     Certainly, as a consequence, the neighbouring and even
far-distant   cells may become diseased, but as regards the cell itself
the susceptibility to disease is extinguished with life.
    Since the cellular constitution of plants and animals has been
proved, and since cells have become recognised as the essentially

 living elements, the new    science   of biology has sprang up. It has
not brought us the solution of the ultimate riddle of life, but it has
provided concrete, material, anatomical objects for investigation, the
 structures and active and passive properties of which we can analyse. It
has put an end to the wild confusion of fantastic and arbitrary notions
such as    I have just mentioned ; it has placed in a strong light the
immeasurable importance of anatomy, even in the most delicate con
ditions of the body, and lastly, it has made us aware of the close
similarity of life in the highest and lowest organisms, and has thus
afforded us invaluable means for comparative investigation.
    Pathology has also its place, and oue certainly not without honour,
in this science of biology,   for to pathology we     are indebted  for the
knowledge that the opposition between healthy and diseased life is not
to be sought in a fundamental        difference of the two lives, not in an
alteration of the essence, but only in an alteration of the conditions.
    Pathology has been released from the anomalous and isolated posi
tion which it had occupied for thousands of years. By applying its
revelations not only to diseases of man, but also to those of animals,
even the smallest and lowest, and to those of plants, it in the best
manner helps to strengthen biological knowledge, and to narrow still
more that region of the unknown which still surrounds the intimate
structure of living matter.       It is no longer merely applied physio
logy ;  it  has become  physiology itself.
    Nothing has more contributed thereto than the constant scientific
anion which has endured for more than three hundred years between
English and German investigators, and to which to-day we add yet
another link. May this union never be broken !

  I. " On the Composition of Water by Volume." By ALEXANDER
        Scott, M.A., D.Sc., Jacksonian Demonstrator in the Uni
        versity of Cambridge.        Communicated by LORD Ratleigh,
        Sec. R.S. Received March 4, 189a
                                   (Abstract.)
     In a  preliminary note presented to the Society in Jnne,       1887, the
 results of twenty-one experiments on the composition of water hy
 volume were given in detail.       The ratio deduced from these experi
 ments was less than two volumes to one of oxygen.            This result was
 unexpected, because of the greater compressibility of oxygen than of
 hydrogen, but as every one of the experiments pointed to this result,
 the evidence for it seemed conclusive.           Pursuing the investigation
 with improved apparatus, especially        as regarded making a complete
 analysis of   the residual  gas, a  serious  source of error was discovered
 in the use of any combustible lubricant for the taps employed. On
 substituting syrupy phosphoric acid for the vaseline previously em
 ployed, the oxides of carbon disappeared as ordinary impurities.           In
 the later experiments two forms of apparatus were employed, the
 chief difference being that in the earlier form the measuring vessel
 was not of fixed volume, so that both volume and pressure of the
gas had to be measured ; in the later form the gas was measured at
 constant volume by varying the pressure, which alone, therefore, re
quired measurement in each experiment.
    As in the apparatus formerly used, the entire apparatus could be
completely exhausted of air before beginning an experiment by using
the mercury reservoir (Mi) and the measuring vessel as a Toppler's
pump.       The gases were measured in A and B, and after measurement
were mixed in the jar H, whence they were drawn into the explosion
tube J, and then exploded in fractions till all was used up. The residue
was now passed back into H, and then into B, and there measured,

retransferred to J, and expelled through the tap 9 into an absorption
tube, and analysed with potassium hydrate and pyrogallol for carbon
dioxide and oxygen, and for gases not absorbed by these reagents.
These gases were roost probably nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbon mon
oxide (from the absorbents).    The mixture thus obtained gave at any
rate a maximum value for any impurity in the gases employed;    when
it fell below 1/110,000 the gases were considered pure.

   All  the results in which potassium chlorate was used as the source
of the oxygen gave low results, doubtless due to traces of chlorine
accompanying        the oxygen even after passing through potassium
hydrate.    The best oxygen was obtained from silver oxide, and the
best hydrogen from palladium hydride.                   The palladium used com

     II. " On   the Densities of the Principal Gases."               By Lord
           Rayleigh, Sec. R.S.           Received     March    4, 1893.
    In former communications*         I have described the arrangements by
"which   I  determined the ratio of densities of oxygen and hydrogen
 (15-882).    For the purpose of that work it was not necessary to
know with precision the actual volume of gas weighed, nor even the
pressure at which the containing vessel was filled.                   But  I  was
desirous before leaving the subject of ascertaining               not  merely the
relative, but also the absolute, densities of the more important
 gases, that is, of comparing their weights with that of an equal
volume of water.        To effect this it was necessary to weigh the globe
used to contain the gases when charged with water, an operation
not quite so simple as at first sight it appears. And, further, in the
corresponding work upon the gases, a precise absolute specification
is required of the temperature and pressure at which a filling takes
place. To render the former weighings available for this purpose, it
would be necessary to determine the errors of the barometers then
employed.      There would, perhaps, be no great difficulty in doiug
this, but   I was of opinion that it would be an improvement to use
a   manometpr      in direct connexion with the globe, without the
intervention of the atmosphere.            In the latter manner of working,
there is a doubt as to the time required for full establishment of
equilibrium of pressure, especially when the passages through the
taps are partially obstructed by grease.              When the directly con
nected manometer is employed, there is no temptation to hurry
from fear of the entrance of air by diffusion, and, moreover (Note A),
the time actually required for the establishment of equilibrium is
greatly diminished.         With respect to temperature, also, it was
thought better to avoid all further questions by surrounding the
globe with ice, as in Regnault's original determinations.              It is true
that this procedure involves a subsequent cleaning and wiping of
the globe, by which the errors of weighing                     are considerably
augmented; but, as it was not proposed to experiment further wit h
hydrogen, the objection was of less force.          In the  case of the heavier

 1893.]           On the Densities    of the Principal Gases.             135
 gases,   unsystematic   errors   of weighing are less to be feared than
 doubts as to the actual temperature.
    In order to secure     the unsystematic     character of these errors,  it
 is necessary to wash and wipe the       working globe after an exhaustion
 in the same manner as after a filling.         The dummy globe (of equal
 external volume, as required in Regnault's method of weighing gases)
 need not be wiped merely to secure symmetry, but it was thought
 desirable to do so before each weighing.            In this way there would
 be no tendency to a progressive change.            In wiping the globes the
 utmost care is required to avoid removing        any loosely attached grease
 in the neighbourhood of      the  tap.   The  results  to be given later will
 show that, whether the working globe be full or empty, the relative
 weights of -the two globes can usually be recovered to an accuracy of
 about 0-3 milligramme.        As in the former papers, the results were
                                                   " full "
 usually calculated by comparison of each                   weight with the
 mean of the immediately preceding and following empty weights.
 The balance and the arrangements for weighing remained as already
described.
                                 The Manometer.
    The arrangements adopted for the measurement of pressure must
be   described in some detail, as they offer several points of novelty.
The apparatus actually used would, indeed, be more accurately spoken
of as a manometric gauge, but it would be easy so to modify it as to fit
it for measurements extending over a small range.
    The object in view was to avoid certain defects to which ordinary
barometers     are liable, when applied to absolute measurements.          Of
.these  three especially may be formulated : —
    a. It  is difficult to be sure that the vacuum at the top of the
         mercury is suitable for the purpose.
    6. No measurements of a length can be regarded as satisfactory in
         which different methods of reading are used for the two
         extremities.
   c.  There is necessarily some uncertainty due to irregular refraction
         by the walls of the tube. The apparent level of the mercury
         may deviate from the real position.
   d.  To the above may be added that the accurate observation of the
         barometer, as used by Regnault and most of his successors,
         requires   the use  of   a catlietometer,    an expensive   and not
         always satisfactory   instrument.
   The guiding idea of the present apparatus is the actual applica
tion of a measuring       rod to the upper and lower mercury surfaces,
arranged so as to be vertically superposed.         The rod AA, 6g. 1, is of
iron (7 mm. in diameter ), pointed below B.           At the upper end, C, it

divides at the level of the mercury into a sort of fork, and terminates
in a point similar to that at B, and, like it, directed downwards. The
coincidence of these points with their images reflected in the mercury

    surfaces, is observed with the aid of lenses of about 30 mm. focus,
    held in position upon the wooden framework of the apparatus.        It
    is,of course, independent of any irregnlar refraction which the tube
    may exercise. The vertical ity of the line joining the points  tested         is
    without difficulty by a plumb-line.
         The upper and lower chambers              C,
                                            are formed from tubing of the
                                                    B
    same diameter (about 21 mm. internal).        The upper communicates
    througb a tap, D, with the Toppler, by means of which a suitable
    vacuum can at any time be established and tested. In ordinary use,
    D  stands permanently open, but its introduction was found useful in
    the preliminary arrangements and in testing for leaks.        The con
    nexion between the lower chamber         and the vessel in which the
                                                    B
    pressure   to be verified takes place through a side tube, E.
                 is
       The greater part of the column of mercury to which the pressure
    is  due      contained in the connecting tube FF, of about
                is                                                 mm. in     3
    ternal diameter. The temperature        taken by a thermometer whose
                                                    is
    bulb    is situated near the middle of FF.        Towards the close of
    operations the more sensitive parts are protected by a packing of tow
    or cotton-wool, held in position between two wooden boards.         The
    anterior board is provided with        suitable glass
                                               a          window,   through
    which the thermometer may be read.
       It is an essential requirement of a manometer on the present plan
    that the measuring rod pass air-tight from the upper and lower
    chambers into the atmosphere.       To effect this the glass tubing                 is
    drawn ont nntil its internal diameter        not much greater than that
                                                          is
    of the rod. The joints are then made by short lengths of thick- walled
    india-rubber H,G, wired on and drowned externally in mercury. The
    vessels for holding the mercury are shown at       K. There usually
                                                                    I,        is
    no difficulty at all in making perfectly tight joints between glass
    tubes in this manner but in the present case some trouble was exper
                                     ;
    ienced in consequence apparently of imperfect approximation between
    the iron and the mercury.     At one time     was found necessary to

    supplement   the  mercury  with  vaseline.  When    tightuess     once        is
    obtained, there seems to be no tendency to deterioration, and the con

is continued by squeezing the tube at P between a pair of hinged
boards, gradually approximated by a screw. This plan, though appa
rently rough, worked perfectly, leaving nothing to be desired.
   It  remains to explain the object of the vessel shown at Q. In the
early trials, when the rubber tube was connected directly to R, the
gradual fouling of the mercury surface, which it seems impossible to
avoid, threatened to interfere with the setting at B. By means of
 Q, the mercury can be discharged from the measuring chambers, and
a fresh surface constituted   at B as well as at C.
   The manometer above described was constructed by my assistant,
Mr. Gordon, at a nominal cost for materials ; and it is thought that
the same principle may be applied with advantage in other investiga
tions.    In cases where a certain latitude in respect of pressure is
necessary, the measuring rod might be constructed in two portions,
sliding upon one another. Probably a range of a few millimetres
could be obtained without interfering with the india-rubber con
nexions.
   The length    of   the iron rod was obtained by comparison under
microscopes with a standard bar R divided into millimetres.            In
terms of R the length at 15° C. is 762 248 mm.             It remains to
reduce to standard millimetres.      Mr. Chaney has been good enough
to make a comparison between R and the iridio-platinum standard
metre, 1890, of the Board of Trade.        From this it appears that the
metre bar R is at 15° C. 0'3454 mm. too long ; so that the true dis
tance between the measuring points of the iron rod is at 15° C.
                    762-248 x 10003454  = 762511 mm.
                  Connexions  with Pump and Manometer.
   Some of the details of the process of filling the globe with gas
under standard conditions will be best described later under the head
of the particular gas ; but the general arrangement and the con
nexions with the pump and the manometer are common to all. They
are sketched in fig. 2, in which S represents the globe, T the
inverted bell-glass employed to contain the enveloping ice.      The con
nexion with the rest of the apparatus is by a short tube U of thick
rubber, carefully wired on. The tightness of these joints was always
tested with the aid of the Toppler X, the tap V leading to the gas-
generating apparatus being closed. The side tube at D leads to the
vacuum chamber of the manometer, while that at E leads to the
pressure chamber B. The wash-out of the tubes, and in some' cases
of the generator, was aided by the Toppler. When this operation
was judged to be complete, V was again closed, and a good vacuum
made in the parts still connected to the pump.        W would then be
closed, and the actual filling commenced by opening        V, and finally

the tap of the globe. The lower chamber of the manometer was now
in connexion with the globe, and through a regulating tap (not
shown) with the gas-generating apparatus. By means of the Tcippler
the vacuum in the manometer could bo carried to any desired point.
fiat with respect to this a remark must be made. It is a feature of
the method employed* that the exhaustions of the globe are carried
to such a point that the weight of the residual gas may be neglected,
thus eliminating errors due to a second manometer reading.        There
is no difficulty in attaining this result, but the delicacy of the
Toppler employed as a gauge is so great that the residual gas still
admits of tolerably accurate measurement.        Now in exhausting the
head of the manometer it would be easy to carry the process to a
point much in excess of what is necessary in the case of the globe,
but there is evidently no advantage in so doing. The best results
will be obtained by carrying both exhaustions to the sa-me degree of
perfection.
   At the close of the filling the pressure has to be adjusted to an
exact value, and it might appear that the double adjustment required
(of pressure and of mercury) would      be troublesome.   Such was not
                            * Due to Ton Jolly.

found to be the case. After a little practice the manometer could be set
satisfactorily without too great a delay. When the pressure was nearly
sufficient, the regulating tap was closed, and equilibrium allowed to
establish itself.     If more gas was then required, the tap could be
opened momentarily. The later adjustments were effected by the appli
cation of heat or cold to parts of the connecting tubes. At the close,
advantage was taken of the gradual rise in the temperature which
was usually met with.           The pressure being just short of what was
required, and     V  being closed, it was only necessary to wait until the
point was reached. In no case was a reading considered satisfactory
when the pressure was changing at other than a very slow rate. It
is believed that the comparison between the state of things at the
top and at the bottom of the manometer could be effected with very
great accuracy, and this is all that the method requires.                     At the
moment when the pressure was judged to be right, the tap of the
globe was turned, and the temperature of the manometer was read.
The vacuum was then verified by the Toppler.
                                     The Weights.
   The object of the investigation being                 to  ascertain the ratio of
densities of water and of certain gases under given conditions, the
absolute values of the weights employed is evidently a matter of
indifference.      This is a point which I think it desirable to emphasise,
because v. Jolly, in his, in many respects, excellent work upon this
subject,* attributes a discrepancy between his final result for oxygen
and that of Regnault to a possible variation in the standard of
weight.      On the same ground we may omit to allow for the buoyancy
of the weights as used in air, since only the variations of buoyancy,
due, for example, to changing barometer, could enter ; and these affect
the result so little that they may safely be neglected. f
   But, while the absolute values of the weights are of no consequence,
their relative values must be known with great precision. The in
vestigation of these over the large range required (from a kilogramme
to a centigramme) is a laborious matter, but it presents nothing
special for remark.         The weights quoted in this paper are, in all
cases, corrected, so as to give the results             as they   would   have   been
obtained from a perfectly adjusted system.

   f In t. Jolly's calculations  the buoyancy of the weight* Beems to be allowed for
in dealing  with tho water, and neglected in dealing with the gases.     If this be so,
the result would bo affected with a slight error, which., however,    far exceeds any
that could arise from neglecting buoyancy altogether.

                      The Water Contents of the Globe.
   The globe being packed in finely-divided ice, was filled with boiled
distilled water up to the level of the top of the channel through the
plug of the tap, that is, being itself at 0°, was filled with water also
nt 0°.   Thus charged the globe had now to be weighed ; but this was
a matter of some difficulty, owing to the very small capacity available
above the tap.     At about                     risk of overflow. Of
                              9° there would be a
course the water could be retained   by the addition of extra tubing,
hut this was a complication      that it was desired to avoid. In
February, 1882, during a frost, an opportunity was found to effect
the weighing in a cold cellar at a temperature ranging from 4° to 7°.
The weights required (on the same side of the balance as the globe
and     its supports) amounted to 0-1822 gram. On the other side
were     other weights whose values did not require to be known so long
as    they remained unmoved during the whole series of operations.
Barometer (corrected) 758-9 mm. ; temperature 6-3°.
   A few days later the globe was discharged, dried, and replaced in
the balance with tap open.  1834-1701 grams had now to be associated
with it in order to obtain equilibrium.  The difference,
                       1834-170-0-182 = 1833988,
represents the weight1 of the water less that of the air dismaced by it.
The difference of atmospheric conditions was sufficiently small to
allow the neglect of the variation in the buoyancy of the glass globe
and of the brass counterpoises.
   It remains to estimate the actual weight of the air displaced by the
water under the above mentioned atmospheric conditions.       It appears
that, on this account, we are to add 2-314, thus obtaining
                                    1836 30
as the weight of the water at 0° which fills the globe at 0°.
  A farther small correction is required to take account of the fact
that the usual standard density is that of water at 4° and not at 0°.

beyond the regulating tap were the same for all the gases experi

condensing syringe in order to force the pressure up to the required
point, but the air thus introduced would not reach the globe. It
may be well to give the results for air in some detail, so as to enable
the reader to form a judgment as to the degree of accuracy attained
in the manipulations.

    The column headed " globe empty " gives the (corrected) weights,
 on the side of the working globe, required for balance. The third
 column gives the corresponding weights when the globe was full of
air, having been charged at 0° and up to the pressure required to
bring the mercury in the manometer into contact with the two points
of the measuring rod.
    This pressure was not quite the same on different occasions, being
 subject to a temperature correction for the density of mercury and
 for the expansion of the iron rod. The correction is given in the fifth
column, and the weights             that would have been required, had            the
 temperature been 15°,         in the sixth.     The numbers in the second       and
sixth columns should agree, but they are liable to a discontinuity
when the tap is regreased.

   There is here no evidence of the variation in the density of air sus
pected by Regnault and v. Jolly.       Even if we include the result for
September 27th, obviously affected by irregularity in the weights of
the globe empty, the extreme difference is only 0-4 milligram, or about
l/6000th part.
   To allow for the contraction of the globe (No. 14) when weighed
empty, discussed in my former papers, we are to add 0 00056 to the
apparent weight, so that the result for air becomes
                                 237717.
   This is the weight of the contents at 0° and under the pressure
defined by the manometer gauge at 15° of the thermometer.           The
reduction to standard conditions is, for the present, postponed.
                                  Oxygen.
   This gas has been prepared by three distinct methods : (a) from
chlorates, (6) from permanganate of potash, (c) by electrolysis.
   In the first method mixed chlorates of potash and soda were
employed, as recommended by Shenstone. the advantage lying in the
readier fusibility.    The fused mass was contained in a Florence flask,
and during the wash-out was allowed slowly to liberate gas into a
vacuum.     After all air had been expelled, the regulating tap was
closed, and the pressure allowed gradually to rise to that of the
atmosphere.     The temperature could then be pushed without fear of
 distorting the  glass, and the gas was drawn off through the regulating
tap.    A very close watch over the temperature was necessary to
prevent the evolution of gas from becoming too rapid. In case of
 excess, the superfluous gas was caused to blow off into the atmo
 sphere, rather than risk imperfect action of the potash and phosphoric
 anhydride. Two sets of five fillings were effected with this oxygen.
 In the first set (May, 1892) the highest result was 2 6272, and the

 114                             Lord Rayleigh.                      [Mar.   23,
lowest 2 6266, mean 2-62691.         In the second set (June, July, 1892)
the highest result was 2-6273 and the lowest 2 6267, mean 2 62693.
    The second method (6) proved very convenient, the evolution of gas
being under much better control than in the case of chlorates.              The
recrystallised    salt was   heated  in   a Florence flask,   the  wash-out,   in
this   case also, being facilitated by a vacuum.          Three fillings gave
satisfactory results, the highest being 2 6273, the lowest 2 6270, and
the mean 2 62714.       The gas was quite free from smell.
    By the third method I have not as many results as could have  I
wished, operations having been interrupted by the breakage of the
 electrolytic generator.      This was, however, of less importance, as I
hal    evidence from former work that there is no material difference
 between the oxgen from chlorates and that obtained by electrolysis.
 The gas was passed over hot copper, as detailed in previous papers.
 The result of one filling, with the apparatus as here described, was
 2-6271.    To this may be added the result of two fillings obtained at
 an earlier stage of the work, when the head of the manometer was
 exhausted by an independent Sprengel pump, instead of by the
 Toppler.    The value then obtained was 2-6272.           The results stand
thus   : —

    It will be seen that the agreement between the different methods is
 very good, the differences, such as they are, having all the appearance
 of being accidental.       Oxygen prepared by electrolysis is perhaps
 most in danger    of  being light (from contamination with hydrogen),
 and that from chlorates of being abnormally heavy.
                                    Nitrogen.
    This gas was prepared, in the usual manner, from air by            removal
 of oxygen with heated copper.        Precautions are required, in      the first
 place, to secure a sufficient action of the reduced copper, and,
 secondly, as was shown by v. Jolly, and later by Leduc, to avoid
 contamination with hydrogen which may be liberated from the copper.
 I have followed the plan, recommended by v. Jolly, of causing the
 gas to pass finally over a length of uureduced copper.           The  arrange
 ments were as follows : —

  by reduced       copper, contained in a tube of hard glass heated by a
  large flame.       It then traversed a (J -tube, in which was deposited
  most of the water of combustion.               The gas, practically free, as the
  event proved, from oxygen, was passed, as a further precaution, over
  a length of copper heated in a combustion furnace, then through
  strong sulphuric acid,* and afterwards back through the furnace over
  a length of oxide of copper.         It then passed on to the regulating tap,
  and thence throngh-        the remainder of the apparatus, as already de
  scribed.      In no case did the copper in the furnace, even at the end

 closing an external contact, was included between the two tubes of
 reduced copper, the gas        being caused to bubble tlirough the electro
 lytic liquid.       The quantity      of hydrogen liberated was calculated
 from the deflection of a galvanometer included in the circuit, and
 was sufficient, if retained, to alter the density very materially.              Care
 was taken that        the  small   stream     of  hydrogen    should    be  uniform
 during the whole time (about 2\ hours) occupied by the filling, but,
 as  will be seen, the impurity was effectually removed by the copper

   Although the subject is not yet ripe for discussion, I cannot omit
to notice here that nitrogen prepared from ammonia, and expected to-
be pure, turned out to be decidedly lighter than the above.                   When
the oxygen of air is burned by excess of ammonia, the deficiency is
about l/1000th part.* When oxygen is substituted for air, so that
all (instead of about one-seventh part) of the nitrogen is derived from
ammonia, the deficiency of weight may amount to                      per cent.  It
seems    certain that the abnormal lightness cannot be explained by
contamination        with hydrogen, or with ammonia, or with water, and
everything suggests that the explanation is to be sought in a dis
sociated state of the nitrogen itself.           Until the questions arising out
of these observations are thoroughly cleared up, the above number
for nitrogen must be received with a certain reserve. But it has not
been thought necessary, on this account, to delay the presentation of
the present paper, more especially as the method employed in prepar
ing the nitrogen for which the results are recorded is that used by-
previous experimenters.
                          Reduction to Standard Pressure.
   The pressure to which the numbers so far given relate is that due
to 762-511 mm. of mercury at a temperature of 14-85°, t and under the
gravity operative in my laboratory in latitude 51° 47'. In order to
compare the results with those of other experimenters, it will be con
venient to reduce them not only to 760 mm, of mercury pressure at 0°,
but .also to the value of gravity at Paris. The corrective factor for
length is 760/762-511. In order to correct for temperature, we will
employ the formula! 1 + 0 0001818 i + 000000000017 P for the volume
of mercury at t°.          The factor of correction for temperature is thus
1"002700.      For gravity we may employ the formula, —
                           g = 980-6056-2-5028       cos 2X,
X being the latitude.         Thus, for my laboratory     —
                                      g = 981 193,
and for Paris —
                                      g = 980-939,
the difference of elevation being negligible.            The factor of correction
is thus 0-99974.
   The product of the three factors, corrective for length, for tempera
ture, and for gravity, is accordingly 0 999 14. Thus multiplied, the
numbers are as follows         : —

    The correction of Regnault by Craftsf represents allowance for the
contraction of Regnault's globe when exhausted, but the data were
not obtained from the identical globe used by Regnault. In the fourth

This is merely an estimate founded upon the probability that the
proportional contraction would be about the same as in my own caBe
and   in that of M. Leduc.

    The evaluation of the densities as compared with water is exposed
 to many sources of error which do not affect the comparison of one
 gas with another.       It may therefore be instructive to exhibit the

    As usually happens in such       cases, the concordance of the numbers
 obtained by various experimenters is not so good as might be
expected from the work of each taken separately.              The most serious
discrepancy   is  in the  difficult case of  hydrogen.    M.  Leduc suggests*
that my number is too high on account of penetration of air
through the blow-off tube (used to establish equilibrium of pressure
with the atmosphere), which he reckons at 1 m. long and 1 cm. in
diameter.    In reality the length was about double, and the diameter
one-half of these estimates ; and the explanation is difficult to main
tain, in view of the fact, recorded in my paper, that a prolongation
of the time of contact from 4m to 30m had no appreciable ill effect.
It must be admitted, however, that there is a certain presumption in
favour of a lower number, unless it can be explained as due to an
insufficient estimate for the correction for contraction.          On account
of the doubt as to the appropriate value of this correction, no great
weight can be assigned to Regnault's number for hydrogen.                 If the
atomic weight of oxygen be indeed 15-88, and the ratio of densities
of oxygen and hydrogen be 15-90, as M. Leduc makes them, we
should have to accept a much higher number for the ratio of volumes
than that (2-0002) resulting from the very elaborate measurements
of Morley.       But while I write the information reaches -me that
Mr. A. Scott's recent work upon the volume ratio leads him to just
such a higher ratio, viz., 2 00245, a number a priori more probable
than 2-0002.       Under the circumstances both the volume ratio and
the density of hydrogen must be regarded as still uncertain to the
l/1000th part.

   It  may be worth while to give explicitly the theory of this process,
supposing that the difference of pressures is small throughout, and
that the capacity of the channel may be neglected.             If v. pi denote
the volnme and pressure of the gas in the first vessel at time t ; vt, p3

where    c is a constant which we may regard as the conductivity of the
channel.      In these equations inertia is neglected, only resistances of
a viscous nature being regarded, as amply suffices for the practical
problem.       From the above we may at once deduce
showing that (pi—pi) varies as e~i\ where

the  ratio of e : 1.
   Let us now apply this result (a) to the case where the globe of
volume Vi communicates with the atmosphere, (6) to the case where
the globe is connected with a manometer of relatively small volume v3.
For (a) we have —

so that                             t/t'= vijvt.
   For such a manometer        as is described in the text, the ratio «i/t)2 is
at least as   high as 30 ; and in this proportion is diminished the time
required for the establishment of equilibrium up to any standard of
perfection that may be fixed upon.

where 7 is surface tension ; s, surface ; k, a constant ; and t, tempe
rature measured downwards from a point about 6° below the
critical point of the fluid. As the origin of T in the gaseous equation
is where p = 0, so the origin of t should be where 7 = 0. Correct
ing the above equation so that t shall represent the number of degrees
measured downwards from the critical point, the equation becomes
                                    yS  =   k (t — d).
    But even this equation        does not express the whole truth.           For at
temperatures        less than    30°    below        the  critical temperature,  the
relation between surface energy and temperature is not a rectilinear
one ; a correction is therefore introduced in the form of a second
term, which becomes             insignificant at temperatures more than
25°    or  30° t ; it is

     The liquids examined were          : ether, methyl formate, ethyl acetate,
 carbon tetrachloride, benzene, chlorobenzene, acetic acid, and methyl
 and ethyl alcohols ; in fact, the only ones for which data are avail
 able. For, in order to calculate 7 from the rise in a capillary tube,
 it is necessary to know the density of the orthobaric liquid and gas ;
 and reliable data exist only for these liquids, and for a few others
 which resemble them closely, e.g., fluorobenzene, bromobenzene, &c.
 Also to calculate s, i.e., molecular surface, it is necessary to know the
 molecular volume of the liquid, and to raise it to the power frds.
 Hence «' = s, or molecular surface; i.e., it is possible to compare
 different liquids on the surfaces of which equal numbers of molecules
 lie.

with the first three ; but in the case of the two alcohols, evidence was
obtained of molecular association, as also with acetic acid.     It is pos
sible to calculate the amount of association at any temperature in such
cases.     For, assuming the constancy of k for the molecular surface of
the   "normal " liquids, the equation
                                  c/d = x\
where d is the differential coefficient of an associating liquid, and x
is the molecular aggregation, gives the number of simple molecules
which have united to form a compound at the temperature chosen.
For the alcohols at — 90°, and for acetic acid at 20°, the association of
molecules approximates to (C^^)^ (CHtO)4, and (CtHtO)!,
    We have thus a method- by which it is possible to ascertain the
molecular complexity of undiluted liquids.          The results with the
 alcohols are shown to agree within reasonable limits with those ob
 tained from strong solutions by Raoult's method.
     It is incidentally shown in the course of the paper that there is no
 angle of contact between liquid and glass, when the liquid surface is
 in contact only with its own vapour.         Ordinary measurements of
 capillarity give inconstant, and probably inaccurate, results, for it is
 not the surface tension of the liquid which is measured, but that of a
 solution of air in the surface film of the liquid.
     The paper contains tables and curves exemplifying and illustrating
 the statements given.

     The experiments described in the paper were undertaken with the
 object of determining the theoretical conductivity at different tem
 peratures of iron, and, in particular, of pure electrolytically deposited
 copper.
     The method adopted was that due to Forbes, with two modifications.
     (a.) The thermo-electric method of determining temperature was
 employed.       The thermo-electric couple used was one of German
 silver and iron, giving, between 0° C. and 200° C, a uniform deflec
  tion on the galvanometer scale of about four divisions for a difference
 of one degree centigrade between the temperatures of its junctions.

separately.   The results of these two determinations agreed within
rather less than      1§   per cent.
  In order to reduce diffusivity  to absolute conductivity, the densities
of the iron and copper were determined hydrostatically, and the varia
tion of the specific heat of iron with the temperature was determined
by Bttnsen's calorimeter with the result that the specific heat at                              t°   C.

   Burton,* Cameron,f and other travellers have given accounts of
much    interest of an arrow-poison used in warfare and in the chase by
the Wa Nyika, Wa Kamba, Wa Gyriama, and other tribes of Eastern
Equatorial Africa. The poison was stated to be prepared from the
wood of the stem and root of a tree, which, however, was not
botanically identified.
   Several years ago, an opportunity was given to one of us to examine
poisoned arrows, and the poison used in smearing them, of the Wa
Nyika tribe. While the pharmacological action of this poison was
found to have a close resemblance to that of Strophanthus seeds, its
physical and chemical properties enabled the conclusions to be drawn
that the poison was not made from these seeds, but was chiefly com
posed of an extract prepared from a wood 4
   These conclusions have been confirmed by the examination of
further specimens of the Wa Nyika arrow-poison, and of the wood
from which it is prepared.           The specimens were most kindly sent to
one    of us, at various times between 1889 and 1892, by the Rev.
William Morris, of the Church Missionary Society's East African
Mission, and by Mr. Berkeley, the Administrator to the Imperial
British East Africa Company at Mombasa.
   These gentlemen have also sent the leaves and fruit of the plant,
which have enabled us to identify it as an Acokanthera ; but, as
flowers have not yet been obtained, it has not been possible to deter
mine the species.

  154       Prof. T. R. Fraser and Dr.     J. Tillie.  On the    [Mar. 23,
    In the present paper       we  propose to give a brief preliminary
description of some of the most important of the results obtained by
 ns in an extended examination of the chemical and pharmacological
 properties of the arrow-poison, and especially of the wood from which
 it is prepared, reserving roller details until the flowers of the plant
 have been obtained.
    We have found that the arrow-poison contains a crystalline gluco-
sidal active principle, which in its chemical properties and pharmaco
logical actions is identical with an active principle present in the
wood, thus confirming the statement of the source of the poison.
    One early and small supply of the wood did not yield a crystalline
principle when the extract was treated by the tannin and oxide of
 lead process, and the limited supply at our disposal prevented the
adoption of the process which, when applied to subsequently received
supplies, led to the separation of the active principle in a crystalline
form.
    This process consists in the preparation of an alcoholic extract of the
wood, the treatment of this with water, and the evaporation of the
filtered watery solution.     Impure crystals appear in the concentrated
fluid, and their purification is effected by digestion of a hot alcoholic
solution with charcoal, and subsequent recrystallisations from rectified
spirit.
    Thus obtained, the active principle occurs in the form of colourless
thin needle-shaped crystals, which usually group themselves in tufts
and rosettes. When crystallised from water it has the form of quadr
angular plates.
    At a temperature between 55° and 60° F. the crystals are soluble
 to the extent of about 0-93 per cent. in distilled water ; of 041 per
cent. in absolute alcohol ; of 0-45 per cent. in diluted alcohol of sp.
gr. 0-838 ; of 24 per cent. in diluted alcohol of sp. gr. 0-920. They
are less soluble in acetone, amylic alcohol, and petroleum ether ; and
are altogether insoluble in ethylic ether and chloroform.            Much
larger quantities are dissolved by hot than by cold water and
alcohol.
    Ether, chloroform, and petroleum ether precipitate the active
principle in a crystalline form from solutions in strong and dilute
alcohol.
    A  saturated solution in cold water is tasteless and neutral in re
action ; and it is obviously affected by very few chemical reagents,
including the ordinary reagents for alkaloids.         Silver nitrate and
mercurous nitrate, however, produce white precipitates.             Tannin
does not cause any change in saturated cold water solutions, but it
throws down a copious white precipitate in cold solutions, prepared
by saturating water at the boiling temperature, and this precipitate is
soluble in an excess of the reagent and in water.

    When to the crystals themselves a little strong sulphuric acid is
added, a pink colour is 'almost immediately developed, which soon
darkens to a brick-red, and then slowly fades to pale brown.                   Dilute
sulphuric      acid,  with   moderate    heat,  changes   the  colourless   crystals
rapidly to brick-red, and then gradually chocolate and green colours
are developed.
    The exact melting point is not easily ascertained.            When heated to
about 184° C., the crystals suddenly almost disappear, and the soft
substance remaining undergoes little further change until a tempera
ture of rather over 200° C. is reached, when the colour becomes
brown, and bubbles of gas are liberated.
    No nitrogen or inorganic matter is present in the crystals.                When
they are heated at 100° C. in 2 per cent. sulphuric acid, a brownish
amorphous substance is deposited, and the neutralised filtrate causes
an .abundant reduction in Fehling's solution, showing that the active
principle is a glucoside.
    Two concordant combustions made for us by Dr. Dobbin, of the
Chemical Laboratory of the University, indicate that the probable
formula of the substance is CmHmOu-
    These characters show that this active principle closely resembles,
if it be not identical with, a crystalline substance separated by
Arnaud,* by a more complicated process than the above, from the
wood of a plant obtained in the Somali country ; and, although the
species has not yet been identified, the plant has, from an examina
tion of   the twigs and wood, been placed in the genus Acokanthera.f
    On testing the pharmacological activity of the crystalline active
principle     obtained by us from the Acokanthera wood, we found that
the   minimum lethal       dose for the frog (Sana temporaria) was between
0 00004      and 0-00005 grain per 100 grains of weight of frog.                  The
latter dose always caused death, usually in from three to six hours ;
the former dose was not lethal.            Rabbits died usually in a little over
an hour after the subcutaneous administration of from 0-00003 to
0 000035 grain per 100 grains (l/400th to l/500th grain per pound) of
weight of rabbit.
    The arrow- poison itself was found to have only one-fourth the
lethal power of the crystalline active principle.
    In a series of experiments on frogs and rabbits we found certain
effects to occur so uniformly that they may be regarded as character
istic of the action of the poison.
    In the frog the prominent effects which follow the subcutaneous
injection of large lethal doses are : — Slowing and intermittence of
respiration ; gaping of the mouth, often accompanied with straining

movements like those of vomiting ; fibrillary twitching of muscles,
especially at the seat of injection ; impairment of motor power and.
of co-ordination ; disappearance of the cardiac impact ; cessation of
respiration ; and gradual enfeeblement and loss of reflex and voluntary
movement.
    On opening the thorax, the heart is found motionless, the ventricle
in extreme systole, the auricles distended with blood, and the whole
heart inexcitable to mechanical or electric stimulation.          When, how
ever, the precise minimum lethal dose has been administered, the
heart is found to have been arrested in extreme diastole, and it
responds to stimulation.      Immediately after death, stimulation of a
motor nerve causes muscular contraction ; but, soon thereafter, the
muscles cease to respond to stimulation of the nerves or to direct
irritation, and become acid in reaction and rigid.
    In the rabbit, after the subcutaneous administration of a minimum
lethal dose, the most important phenomena are gradual impairment
and failure of the heart's action, of respiration, and of motor power.
Just before death the cardiac pulsations     become     slow and extremely
feeble, but the rate is estimated with difficulty by palpation of the
thorax on account of frequent muscular twitchings. The respiration
is rendered slow, irregular, and shallow.           Inspiratory difficulty
occasionally becomes so great that death from asphyxia seems im
pending even when the cardiac pulsations and general motor power
appear good. Motor power is usually so much reduced before death
that the animal lies prostrate ; and only a few feeble movements of
the body indicate the arrest of the heart.       When the dose is large,
or when the poison acts with unusual rapidity, the heart is paralysed
before the general motor depression has set in, and sharp convulsive
movements follow the arrest of the circulation.            It is sometimes
difficult to say whether the cardiac or the respiratory movements
cease first.   Usually, respiration is distinctly continued for a brief
period after the heart can no longer be felt to pulsate, and on post
mortem examination, the bright red colour of the left auricle and the
pulmonary veins contrasts strongly with the dark colour of the right
auricle.    Sometimes cardiac movements occur after the respiration
has finally ceased, but immediate post-mortem examination reveals
that the pulsations are mere irregular movements, altogether in
sufficient to sustain life or to indicate that the arrest of respiration
was the cause of death.        The left ventricle is usually found con
tracted and nearly empty, and the right ventricle and the auricles
filled with blood. Most frequently the heart is motionless, and does
not respond to mechanical or electrical stimulation, but it sometimes
shows spontaneous quivering movements, and, for a very                    brief
period,  may  respond   to stimulation.  The  lungs    are   of  a  light pink
colour.    After death, the motor nerves    soon   lose   all  influence over

  1893.]    Arrow-Poison of    the   Wa Nyika and oilier Tribes.      157
 the muscles,     and, in a very brief period thereafter, the muscles
 become inexcitable, acid in reaction, and rigid.
    On analysing the action of the active principle we have found
 that, in the frog, the slowing, irregularity, and cessation of respira
 tion, and the gaping movements of the month are not necessarily
 primary actions, but may be secondary to the arrest of the circula
 tion, because control frogs, whose circulation has been mechanically
 arrested, exhibit these phenomena within a similar period of time.
 In rabbits, artificial respiration does not prevent death from cardiac
 failure  ; but the impairment of respiration     probably contributes in
 them    to the fatal result in the case of doses bordering upon the
 minimum lethal.
    The fibrillary muscular twitchings which occur in rabbits as well
 as in frogs are due to a primary action upon the endings of motor
 nerves.
    The disappearance of reflex and voluntary movements after the
 administration of small lethal doses is due to paralysis of the nerve
 centres, and not to a peripheral action, for when one part of the body
 is protected, reflex and voluntary movements cease in the protected
 and uuprotected parts at the same time.          This central paralysis,
 however, is almost entirely due to the failure of the circulation, and
 resembles    the paralysis in uupoisoned control frogs whose circula
 tion is arrested.    When large doses of the poison are administered
subcutaneously to frogs, the depression of reflexes is partly due to peri
 pheral causes, because, when one part is protected, that part exhibits
 more rapid and vigorous reflexes than the uuprotected parts.        This
difference is largely due to a paralysing action on the muscles. It may,
 however, be partly caused by depression of sensibility, for when the
action is limited to one part, stimulation of the skin in the poisoned
area fails, after a time, to cause reflexes in the uupoisoned parts,
although stimulation of a poisoned nerve trunk still excites reflex
movements.       The action of large doses upon the sensory nerves is
well shown by applying l/100th of a grain in solution to the cornea
of the rabbit, when anaesthesia, lasting for several hours, along with
some contraction     of the pupil, is produced.
    The motor nerves retain their influence upon the muscles until the
latter show distinct signs of poisoning ; but the muscles still react to
Btrong, although not to moderate, electrical stimulation after stimu
lation of their motor nerves is no longer able to excite contractions.
    The action on the heart is very pronounced.      When a large dose is
injected subcutaneously in the frog, or applied directly to the heart,
the pulsations become slow owing to a great increase in the duration
of the systole.     Unequal contraction and relaxation of parts of the
ventricular    wall occur, the diastolic expansion becomes less and less,
and,   within twenty minutes after poisoning, the ventricle is arrested

158       Prof. T. R. Fraserand Dr.       J.   Tillie.      On the         [Mar. 23,
in extreme and permanent systole. The auricles contract for a short
time longer, but cannot empty themselves, and become arrested in a
dilated state. The heart no longer responds to stimulation, and the
muscle of the ventricle quickly acquires an acid reaction.        After
arrest of the heart, respiration may continue irregularly for so long
as an hour, and for a time the frog can jump about actively.
   The action of small doses upon the heart        in several respects,
                                                     is,
essentially different from that of large doses. Several hours after the
administration of the precise minimum lethal dose, the cardiac pulsa
tions become very slow.       The slowing, however,      not due to a
                                                                is
lengthening of   the systole, but to a great prolongation            of the diastole,
and of the Succeeding panse in the heart's action. Gradually, periods
of standstill occur in extreme diastole, and, when the heart sponta
neously resumes beating, one or more auricular contractions precede
those of the ventricle. The systolic contraction     extremely power
                                                           is
ful.  The condition of diastolic arrest often lasts many minutes at a
time, and finally spontaneous pulsations cease.     At this stage, the
dilated heart responds, by one or more contractions, to any form of
stimulation, but, if   the stimulation be frequently repeated, the re
laxation   after each   contraction becomes less and less, and the ven
tricle slowly passes into moderate, but permanent, systole. During
these events, the inhibitory function of the vagus         not only retained,
                                                           is

                                                                is

nor prevented     by  the   administration   of  atropine.   The accelerator
action of the vagus    is    retained.   The  diastolic arrest    apparently
                                                                      is
due, therefore, to a direct action of the poison upon the motor ganglia
and muscle of the heart.
  The action upon the blood-vessels was found to be very slight. One
part of the crystalline active principle in 10,000 parts of normal
saline solution (0'75 per cent.) produced, when circulated through
the vessels of a pithed frog, about the same effect as the pure saline
solution, whereas  1 part of Merck's purest digitalin (soluble in water)
in 50,000 parts of normal saline solution produced an extreme and
rapid reduction in the calibre of the vessels. This difference in action
upon the vessels is much accentuated by the fact that the lethal power
of the digitalin in frogs was found to be only about l/50th of that of
the active principle of the Acokanthera wood.
  In  blood pressure experiments upon rabbits, the repeated adminis
tration of small non-lethal doses by injection into the jugular vein
produced a remarkable slowing of the pulse, the vertical height of
each pulse curve indicating at the same time a great increase in the
force of the ventricular contraction.  The blood pressure was usually
found  not to be increased, and, when increased, was evidently not the
cause of the slow pulse.    When rise of blood pressure from asphyxia

 1893.]     Arrow-Poison of          the  Wa Nyika and other Tribes.             159
 was guarded against by carrying on artificial respiration, the pres
 sure was little affected, except when a marked fall occurred before
death.     The inhibitory action of the vagus was found to be retained,
and the nerve proved to be intimately concerned in the early slow
pulse, because the division of the vagi or the administration                      of
atropine prodnced an immediate change in the tracing, the pulse
becoming rapid and the movements relatively small.                       The further
administration of the active principle restored to only some extent
the original character of the tracing.              When large closes were ad
ministered, the original slow pulse quickly becamo rapid and irregu
lar, the blood pressure rose somewhat, and the respiration became
disordered.       The pressure then rapidly fell, and the cardiac pulsa
tions became slow, intermittent, and feeble, and finally ceased before
the pressure was at zero.
    The action upon the circulatory, muscular, and nervous systems,
therefore, closely resembles, if it be not identical with, that of
strophanthin.
                                          Note.
    In 1880, an arrow-poison used by the Wa Nyika and Wa Kamba
tribes was examined chemically by Gerrard,* and a non-crystalline
substance, giving the reaction of a glucoside, was separated, and was
 found by Ringer* to be a powerful muscle -poison, which caused
death by arresting the heart in systole. In 1887, Labordef examined
some features of the physiological action of a Wa Kamba arrow-poison,
obtained from a missionary, M. A. Le Roy, and stated by him to be
composed of parts of eight plants.              Laborde found that the poison
caused death by arresting the respiration and heart, and he came to
 the conclusion that the primary and predominant action was exer
cised upon the cardio-respiratory centres in the medulla.
    In  1888,    MM. Langlois and VarignyJ examined the action                    of
 poisoned arrows obtained from the Somali country, and found that
 the poison caused arrest of respiration and of the heart, which they
attributed to paralysis of the medullary centres.
    In the same year, MM. Qley et Rondeau, § and also M. Gley|| sepa
 rately, examined some points in the action of ouabain, the active
 principle separated by Arnaud from wood believed to be the source
 of the Somali arrow-poison, and concluded that the                effects produced
 were due essentially to an action upon the medullary centres. Dr.

poison is exercised directly upon the heart, and that the asphyxia is
a secondary phenomenon.

 Second      Report    to    the   Royal Society Water Research
    Committee.        The Vitality and Virulence of Bacillus
    anthracis and its Spores in Potable Waters.
 By Percv F. Frankland, Ph.D., B.Sc., F.R.S., Professor of Chemistry
     in University College, Dundee, and H. Marshall Ward, D.Sc.,
     F.R.S., F.L.S., Professor of Botany, Royal Indian Engineering
     College, Coopers Hill.     Presented to the President and Council,
     March 16, 1893.
                                 Introduction.
   In our First Report we endeavoured to give a concise account of
 the more important work which has been done on the bacteriology of
water, and devoted special attention to those investigations which
 have thrown any light on the vitality of pathogenic bacteria when
submerged in aqueous media of various kinds and under various cir
cumstances. We showed what a very large amount of scientific labour
has already been bestowed on this comparatively new subject ; and
 we as far as possible sifted this accumulated material, collecting those
facts which may be reasonably regarded as definitely proved, and
separating them from those which are more or less uncertain, proble
matical, or contradictory.      The results of this critical analysis we
embodied in a number of conclusions, to be found on pp. 124—219 of
our Report, and to which we would again refer the reader.
   In this summary and conclusions we have prominently pointed out
that the information which is at present most urgently required
from a practical point of view is with regard to the manner in which
the vitality of pathogenic bacteria is affected by the presence of non
pathogenic or saprophytic forms.          Although several investigators
have already approached this question, we were obliged to indicate
that their results have to be received with much caution, in conse
quence of the great experimental difficulties which attach to this
inquiry, and which we were of opinion had not in some cases been
adequately taken into account to prevent        misleading  results being
obtained.

      It was owing to our consciousuess of these experimental difficulties
  that we resolved to confine our own investigations           in the first instance
  to the study     of such a pathogenic        form    as would    permit of thef-e
  difficulties being reduced to a minimum, and to this end we naturally
 selected the Bacillus anthracis. But in so doing we also had a second
 object in view, for, inasmuch as the spores of this bacillus are among
 the    hardiest forms of pathogenic organisms, their deportment under
 any particular conditions is of peculiar interest as exhibiting the limit
 of endurance which has to be taken into consideration in dealing witli
 pathogenic bacteria.         Thus, conditions which are found to be fatal to
 anthrax spores may in general be assumed to be a fortiori fatal to
 other pathogenic forms.          Again, we have in the ease of anthrax the
possibility of determining in a mnch more decisive manner than with
other forms the influence which conditions exert on the virulence of
the organism.
          The Vitality   of Bacillus  anthracis and its Spores in Water.
     As indicated     in our First Report, this question has already occu
 pied the attention of       a number of investigators.          In some cases the
 bacilli* free from spores, in other cases sporiferous bacilli, have been
employed ; again, in some experiments sterile, and in others un-
sterilised, waters have been used, whilst the temperature at which
 the waters were maintained during the experiments has also been
 varied.
     Thus, Wolffhiigel and Riedcl (' Arbeiten a. d. Kais. Geaundheits-
 amte,'     vol. 1, 1886j. p. 455) introduced           the bacilli, which may
 possibly have contained spores,f as they were taken from a gelatine
 culture, into sterile water kept at 35° C., and obtained abundant
multiplication, whilst when similar bacilli were placed in water at
 7 — 10° C. their presence was no longer demonstrable by culture after
two days, although a few bacilli (or spores) must still have been pre
 sent    in a virulent condition, as of four mice, each inoculated with
J   c.c. of the water, one died of anthrax.        The water employed in these
experiments       was   primarily   the  polluted liquid found in the River
 Panke at Berlin, although the results were substantially similar when
this water was      diluted with ten times its volume of distilled water.
These      investigators made no experiments with unsterilised water.
    •  We adopt the following terminology throughout: — Asporogenotu means in
capable of developing spores ; sporiferous bacilli are bacilli actually containing
spores, whereas vegetative bacilli are bacilli free of spores, though not necessarily
incapable of developing them later.
    t Gelatine cultures do not develop spores very rapidly, so that it is by no means
certain that spores were introduced : however, these observers added so much
gelatine that we cannot attach much value to the conclusions.
                                                                          N 2

  We may with advantage quote their experiments in full in the fol
  lowing tables (pp. 167 and 168).
     Their results are in nearly all important respects entirely out of
 harmony with those of Meade Bolton, to whose experiments we may
 in the next instance refer.
     Meade Bolton (' Zeitsch. f. Hygiene,' vol. 1, 1886, p. 76) found
 that on introducing anthrax bacilli presumed to be devoid of spores
  into ordinary drinking water (Gottingen water supply) sterilised
  by steam and kept      ac 20° C., they were no longer demonstrable hy
 culture after 6 days, whilst at 35° C. the same result was obtained
 in 55 hours. On the other hand, when he employed sporiferous
 anthrax bacilli, they were still demonstrable after 90 days at 20° C,
 both in sterile distilled and in sterile well water of bad quality,
 whilst at 35° C. in the same waters the organisms disappeared between
 the 30th and the 90th day as tested by cultivation. The waters were
 not tested for virulence by inoculating animals, nor does it appear
 whether or no in these latter experiments     there was any multiplica
 tion of the anthrax bacilli, as an uncountable number were in the first
instance introduced into the water.        It will be most convenient to
quote Meade Bolton's tabulated results in extenso (see p. 169).
     Results in substantial agreement with those of Meade Bolton have
also been recorded by Koch (Gartuer-Tiemann's book, p. 585) and
Naegeli, who both state that the spores of anthrax preserve their
vitality in distilled water for upwards of one year. Hochstetter
 (' Arbeiten a. d. Kais. Gesundheitsamte,' vol. 2, p. 1), again, found
the anthrax bacilli free from spores to persist both in sterilised dis
tilled and in sterilised drinking water for 8 days only at the outside
 (in  some cases they actually disappeared in a quarter of an hour), whilst
the sporiferous bacilli were still alive and virulent after 154 days in
the same waters a* well as in unsterilised seltzer water.         (For de
 tailed table of results, see pp. 170 and 171.)
    Similarly again Hneppe ('Journ. f. Gasbeleucht.,' 1887, p. 129)
found the anthrax bacilli no longer demonstrable on the fifth day in
sterilised drinking water kept at 16° C.
    Straus and Dubarry (' Arch, de Med. Exper.,' 1889 ; ' Ann. de
rinst. Pasteur,' vol. 4, pp. 109 — 124), on the other hand, found even
the bacilli free from spores to retain their vitality in sterile drinking
water at 20° C. for 28 days in one case and 65 days in another, and
they proved that when such sporeless bacilli are introduced into dis
tilled water they can form spores and persist for upwards of 131 days.
The greater longevity of the anthrax bacilli in the hands of these
investigators is doubtless due to their having employed a more sensi
tive method of cultivation than the others to whom we have referred,
for, instead of simply submitting the waters to plate cultivation in
the ordinary way, they first added broth to the water, so as to en

 made by Kraus (' Archiv f. Hygiene,' vol. 6, p. 234) with unsterilised
 water at 10"5° C. ; on introducing anthrax bacilli free from spores,
 he found them no longer recognisable by cultivation tests on the fourth

   A similar result       was later   obtained      by   Karlinski (' Archiv f.

free from spores were by      him  found   to  have    disappeared on the third
day.
   Uffelmann (' Centralbl. f. Bakteriol.,' vol. 5, p. 89), on the other
hand, introduced sporiferous anthrax into unsterilised drinking water
at 12 — 20° C., and found that its vitality was preserved for upwards
of three months.
   The only experiments which have been made with British waters
are those which were carried out by one of us (Percy Frankland,
Society of Chem. Ind., 1887), in which sporiferous anthrax was
introduced into sterile distilled water, sterile Grand Junction water
(filtered Thames water), and sterile London sewage. In all cases the
vitality   of the   anthrax    was   preserved       for upwards    of 61   days,

                   Report  on the Bacteriology   of Water.              173
 and in the sewage extensive multiplication of the organism actually
took place, as will be seen from the following table (see p. 174).
   If we endeavour to summarise the results obtained by these several
investigators, the evidence would appear to point to the following
conclusions : —
   1. Spores of anthrax retain their vitality either in sterile      or un-
        sterilised waters of the most varied charactor for long     periods
        of time, many months, at ordinary or low temperatures,        whilst
        they are slowly destroyed if the waters are kept at 35°      C.
   2. The evidence concerning the sporeless anthrax bacilli is some
        what contradictory.       Most observers agree that they are
        rapidly destroyed in a few days both in sterilised and uu-
        sterilised waters ; Straus and Dubarry, however, using a more
        delicate method of cultivation, have found their vitality to be
        retained for a much longer period, viz., from 28 to 65 days.
        There can be little doubt that in these experiments spores were
        formed in the waters.     The results of Wolffhiigel and Riedel
        differ also from those of other observers, probably owing to
        their having added so much gelatine, inasmuch as they found
        the anthrax bacilli to undergo abundant multiplication in
        sterile waters at 16° and at 35° C., whilst rapid destruction
        took place if the same waters were maintained at 7 — 10° C.
   3. As regards the power of anthrax to propagate in water, there is,
        with the exception of the last mentioned results of Wolffhiigel
        and Riedel, no evidence that they undergo multiplication in
        ordinary    potable waters even when sterilised ; indeed, it has
        been clearly shown by one of us that no numerical increase
        takes place either in sterile distilled or sterile filtered Thames
        water (Grand Junction Company), whilst in sterile London
        sewage the numbers underwent very considerable multiplica
        tion.    The power of propagation in sterile water at any rate
        is, therefore,   dependent on its chemical composition.           It
        should be mentioned that the multiplication observed by
        Wolffhiigel and Riedel was not in potable water proper, but in
        the water of the River Pauke at Berlin, which is, or was,
        practically diluted sewage, although they also obtained multi
        plication when this water was diluted with ten times its
        volume of distilled water.     The whole question of multiplica
        tion, however, is doubtless to a large extent dependent on the
        vigour of the anthrax growths employed for experiment.
   4. It is much to be regretted that so few investigators have made any
        experiments on the virulence of the anthrax organisms after
        their residence in waters under varied conditions; this is,
        after all, the chief point of practical importance, it is the point

          which admits of the most ready determination, and it is quite
          unaccountable why in the experiments made on the Continent
          it should have been so frequently neglected.
       ^
                      Object and Nature      of our Experiments.
    One of our first objects has been to make ourselves acquainted with
the nature of the waters, and especially that of the Thames, selected
for investigation; and this not only as regards their chemical com
position, but also as regards the nature and numbers of organisms
normally found in the water. We have also made inquiries as to the
changes      the water undergoes on standing, and have acquired much
interesting information regarding these points.
    In pursuing the inquiry as to the vitality of anthrax in water, we
have been guided by the following considerations.                          As already
pointed out, we selected the Bacillus anthracis for the first series of
our investigations on the vitality of pathogenic bacteria in water,
 because it constitutes almost the extreme term, so to speak, in the
series of pathogenic organisms which are at present known.                         In the
 form of spores it presents one of the hardiest and most refractory
 examples      of living organisms,* at any rate of the pathogenic kind,
 for amongst the non-pathogenic forms there are a number which
excel it in this respect ; whereas our information as regards the
bacilli in water is most incomplete, though the whole practical in
terest as regards pathogenic organisms turns on their behaviour in
 the vegetative — spore-free — condition, and on whether they can
 multiply or develop spores in the water.
     In introducing the anthrax bacilli and their spores into British
 waters of typical character, we have endeavoured to ascertain whether
 their fate is affected (a) by differences of temperature such as occur
 in the natural course of events, (ft) by the other bacteria present in
 the water ; and, in order to ascertain this point, we have employed the
 waters in question in their natural state, unsterilised ; also sterilised
 by heat (steam) in the ordinary way ; and, thirdly, sterilised without
 the application of heat by filtration through unglazed porcelain.
     We have also endeavoured to ascertain whether the sporiferous
 anthrax bacilli are differently affected according as the water in
 which they are resident is kept in darkness, placed in diffused light,
 or exposed to direct sunshine.
    • Pasteur showed
                        (* Compt. Eend.,' 1877, vol. 85, p. 99) that they remain alive for
 some time    in absolute alcohol, and for twenty-one days exposed to a pressure of
  10 atmos. of pure oxygen.     Koch has shown (' Mitth. a. d. Kaiserl. Ges. Amt.,' I,
 p. 32) what extreme temperatures         they  will endure, and Klein      declares  that
 ten minutes' boiling cannot be relied on.       We have already given      the literature
  showing  that the spores remain for long periods alive in water, and it is well
  known they can be kept intact for months on silk threads in the dark.

   Finally, we have not merely confined ourselves to the ordinary
cultivation  tests for ascertaining the vitality or otherwise of the
anthrax organism under these several conditions ; but we have also
submitted the virulence of the infected waters under investigation to
the direct test of inoculation into animals.
   Inasmuch as the investigation of the above points has been con
ducted by each of us to a certain extent independently of the other, it
has been proposed to record our experiments separately also, as in this
manner the course of the two investigations is most easily followed,
and the results obtained most readily surveyed.       In the following
pages, therefore,  will be found a separate account of the independent
inquiry pursued by each of us, the report closing with    a number     of
conclusions which we have together drawn from the         experimental
material collected by both.

    Experiments     on the Vitality and Virulence of Sporiferons
       Anthrax in Potable Waters."           By Professor Percy Frank-
       land, Ph.D., F.R.S., assisted by J. R. Appleyard, F.C.S.
    The first water selected for experiment was that of the River
Thames, which may he taken as a t3'pe of a calcareous surface water
draining from cultivated land, but receiving only such a moderate
 [iroporh-on of organic impurity as to leave it in a condition that,
judged by the ordinary standards of taste, smell, and appearance to
the eye,    it is suitable for drinking purposes.      This is in fact the
 water which has for years been supplied to the larger part of the
metropolis, and is, therefore, in some respects the most interesting
 water, from a hygienic point of view, in the United Kingdom.
    The second water experimented with is that of Loch Katrine as
supplied to Glasgow, which again is typical of those upland surface
 waters, collected from almost entirely uninhabited areas, which have
 been so largely utilised during the past 30 years for the supply of
 the great manufacturing       districts of the north. These waters, and
 notably that of Loch Katrine, are characterised by their great soft
 ness and almost entire freedom from mineral matters,            whilst the
organic constituents     are  almost  wholly  of vegetable origin, and thus
differ more qualitatively than quantitatively from those present in
 waters such as that of the Thames.
                      Experiments with Thames Water.
    In order to render the experiments as comparable as possible they
have    all been made on one and the same sample of Thames water,
 which was collected personally by my colleague, Professor Marshall

                   Report on the Bacteriology    of  Water.               181
Ward, on     March 8, 1892, at a point more than a mile above Staines,
and   sufficiently distant from the Windsor district to render it very
improbable that any direct contamination thence need be feared ; as
a matter of fact, the analyses show that this water was by no means
rich either in bacteria or organic matter, and, for an open river,
was   remarkably pure (see p. 182).
   As this sample was not received by me until some days after its
collection, the number of micro-organisms which          I  found in it does
nut afford any insight into the bacterial condition of the river at the
time, but on this subject I have already collected a large amount of
information in the course of the regular monthly examinations of the
London water supply which I made for the Local Government Board
during the three years 1886, 1887, and 1888.           The results of these
examinations, which are recorded in the preceding three tables,
clearly indicate (1) the seasonal variations which the number of
bacteria in the unfiltered waters of the Rivers Thames and Lee under
goes ; (2) the great reduction in these numbers which is effected by
the storage and     sand-filtration to which these waters are subjected at
the   waterworks before distribution ; (8) the very small number of
bacteria present in the deep-well water of the Kent Company.
   Two entirely independent series of experiments have been made
with this sample, the difference between the two series being in the
number of anthrax organisms which were introduced                   into the
water. Thus in the First Series, a comparatively small number of
anthrax bacilli were put into the water, whilst in the Second Series
the number introduced was very much larger.                  There was this
further difference between the two series of experiments that the
Bacillus anthracis employed had a totally different origin in the
two cases.      The use of the organism from two distinct sources in the
way indicated is in my opinion of great importance as eliminating
the    possibility of any special and exceptional characters           having
 become impressed on the       particular cultivation employed.
               Experiments with Thames     Water  (First Series).
    We will direct our attention in the first instance to what we have
 called the " First Series
                               " of
                                    experiments, in which the sporiferous
 Bacillus anthracis was introduced in comparatively           small numbers
 only  into  the  water.
    This First Series of experiments includes four sub-series, in each
 of which the Thames water was employed in a different condition.
 Thus—

 paper. This was done, as it was quite conceivable that the presence
 of comparatively large suspended particles should exercise a marked
 influence on the behaviour of the anthrax introduced, whilst this
 filtration would not remove more than a portion of the bacteria
 already present in the water in its natural state. It was, moreover,
 especially desirable to ascertain whether the removal of these coarser
 suspended particles would influence the result, as in the follow
 ing sub-series (3) all suspended particles, including the water
 bacteria themselves, were removed prior to the introduction of an
 thrax.

glass bottle   (D), a porous cylinder of biscuit-porcelain of the con
struction shown in section in (BB) also passes through the same
india-rubber stopper.     The bottle (D) has a lateral tubulure (E)
which is plugged with sterile cotton-wool.          The whole of this ap
paratus is sterilised in position by placing it bodily in the steam-
steriliser for several hours ou three successive days, after which it is
ready for use.      The water to be filtered is poured into the glass
cylinder (A), and the tubulure (E) is connected by means of pressare
tubing with a water-pump.           On thus reducing the pressure in-
sido  (D), the water in (A) is forced by atmospheric pressure through
the porous    cylinder (BB). In order to remove the filtered water

                                                  — In this first series the an
    Infection of the Water with Anthrax.
thrax bacilli were taken from an agar-agar cultivation of about
 three weeks age, in which it was known by previous microscopic
 examination that spores were abundantly present.
    The surface of the agar-agar was scraped with a sterile platinum
loop, care being taken to remove the growth with as little as
possible of the culture material.            Five loops full in all were taken
 and transferred to a small sterile stoppered bottle containing about
 50 c.c. of Thames water which had been steam-sterilised.                        The
contents     were    then  violently agitated       for  some   fifteen minutes in
order to break up the conglomerations of bacilli and spores, and
effect as uniform a distribution as possible.             This may be termed the
" first attenuation."
    From this first attenuation four portions of 2 c.c. each were re
moved with sterile pipettes and introduced respectively into four large
flasks, each containing about 2 litres of the waters for experiment,
viz.  : —
    (a.) Thames water, in natural state.
    (6.) Ditto after filtration through Swedish paper.
    (e.) Ditto after filtration through porcelain.
    (d.) Ditto, after sterilisation by steam.
The waters thus infected were well shaken in the large flasks con
taining them so as to ensure complete mixture, and the contents of
each flask was then distributed in a number of small sterilised
conical flasks plugged with sterile cotton wool.               In the case of each
of these infected waters some of the small conical flasks were placed
in an incubator maintained at 18 — 20° C., the summer temperature of
surface waters, whilst others were put into a refrigerator in which a
 temperature of 6 — 10° C. was preserved.
    The distribution and arrangement will be readily apparent                   from

   Examination of the Waters for the Presence of Anthrax. — The bac
teriological examination for the presence of anthrax was in general
made by the ordinary process of gelatine plate cultivation.                This
method of identifying the presence of anthrax is attended with but
little difficulty if no other organisms are simultaneously present, as
in the case of the waters sterilised by steam, and by filtration through
porcelain. The anthrax colonies develop with such facility in the
gelatine medium, and are of such a characteristic appearance even
to the naked eye, but especially when seen through a low power of
the microscope, that no doubt can be entertained as to their identity.
On the other hand, the very greatest difficulty attends, as will be seen,
the recognition of anthrax in the presence of the ordinary water
bacteria, partly because the colonies of some of the latter grow much
more quickly than those of anthrax, but especially because many of
these   water bacteria cause such rapid liquefaction of the gelatine that
the greater     part, or even the whole, of the film may be destroyed
before the anthrax colonies have had time to become visible.                  In
order to overcome this difficulty, I have devised a method of
destroying nearly the whole of these liquefying bacteria without
injuring more than a part of the anthrax spores, and thus rendering
possible the development and recognition of the colonies from the latter,
even when they are present in water along with vast multitudes of
the ordinary water bacteria.        The nature of this special method will
be described later.      The gelatine plates were invariably incubated at
a temperature of 18 — 20° C., and in order to give every opportunity
for the anthrax colonies to make their appearance, the incubation was
carried on as long as possible.         On this account the numerical esti
mation of the other colonies        was  made a subsidiary matter, and in
consequence      of the extensive liquefaction which had often taken
place,  the  accuracy   of the numbers found has often been interfered
 with ; in fact, discrepancies in the number of colonies found on dupli

cate plates cannot fail to take place if they are preserved until wide-
spreading liquefaction of the gelatine has occurred.
1. Bacteriological  Examination of the Thames Water previous    to Infec
                            tion with Anthrax.
   From Table    I it will be seen that the unfiltered water contained a
large number of micro-organisms, which was, however, much reduced
by the simple process of filtration through Swedish paper. The
colonies obtained showed the micro-organisms to be of numerous
different kinds, many of them being easily recognisable as belonging
to the forms which have already been described and figured by me
three years ago (Grace C. and Percy F. Frankland, ' Zeitsch. f.
Hygiene,' vol. 6, 1889) as occurring in Thames water, and a brief
resume   of which is given in the following table.          Owing to a
large number of the colonies causing liquefaction        of the gelatine,
their numerical estimation is much interfered with, and in order to
some extent obviate this difficulty, it will be seen that plates were
not only poured with the undiluted waters, but also with the waters
after large dilution (50 times their volumes) with sterilised water,
so as to obtain a smaller number of colonies on the plate. This expe
dient has always been resorted to in cases where an inconveniently
large number of colonies was to be expected; in all cases, however,
the results are calculated to the number of colonies obtained from
1 c.c. of the water in the undiluted state.
   Table I also shows that the filtration through porcelain, as well as
the steaming, were effectual in sterilising the water, the number of
colonies obtained in these cases being no greater than would appear
on blank plates.
   The unfiltered Thames water, and that which had been passed
through Swedish paper, were again examined on October 26, 1892,
or more than seven months after the experiments were commenced ;
in both cases the flasks which had been kept in the incubator con
tained more organisms than those which had been in the refrigerator,
but in all cases the numbers were comparatively small, and in the
unfiltered water had fallen much below what they were at the begin
ning.

2. Bacteriological      Examination of the JJnsterilised Unfiltered Thames
               Water (First Series) after Infection with Anthrax.
     Table    II   brings out a number of points. In the first place the
extreme difficulty of discovering, by ordinary plate cultivation, a
particular micro-organism          when present in only small numbers
alongside       of  vast multitudes of other forms, is particularly note
worthy.        Special reference was made to this difficulty in our First
Report, and it is most strikingly brought out in these experiments.
From the experiments made with the steamed and porcelain-filtered
Thames water, to be described below, we know that the number of
anthrax organisms in this nnfiltered Thames water must have
amounted to at least 30 —40 per cubic centimetre, yet only in one out
 of the numerous plate cultivations made with this water was anthrax
 discovered, and then only a single colony was found on a plate poured
 on the day that the infection with anthrax was made.
     The principal obstacles to such discovery are two : firstly, in con
 sequence of the extremely large number of micro-organisms present
 in the water, it is only possible to take a very small volume (not
 more than, say, -fc c.c.) for cultivation, in which, therefore, the
chance of anthrax organisms (if introduced in such small numbers as
 in the present series of experiments) being present is very remote ;
 whilst, secondly, owing to the rapid liquefaction of the gelatine
 caused by many of these water bacteria, it is not possible generally
 to incubate the plates for a sufficient length of time to admit of the
 proper development of the anthrax colonies ; this is more particularly
 the case when, as here, the anthrax is present in the form of spores,
 which take time to germinate.
      In order to obviate these difficulties attending the discovery of
 anthrax in the presence of large numbers of water bacteria causing
 liquefaction,       I have tried a number of special devices, of which
 I   need, however, only describe the one which proved the most useful.
      Previous experience had shown me that a large proportion of the
 organisms present in water, and more especially those causing lique
 faction of the gelatine, are very sensitive to a temperature even con
 siderably below that of boiling water, whilst the spores of anthrax
 in their normal state will withstand such temperatures for a con
 siderable length of time.
      In order to turn these properties to practical account, portions
  (1   c.c. or  3 c.c.) of the anthrax-infected Thames water under con
 sideration were mixed with a little sterile broth (1 c.c.), and heated
 for periods of two or five minutes to 50° C., to 70° C., and to 90° C.,
 after which treatment they were submitted to ordinary plate culti
 vation.       The first of these experiments was made on March 31,
  1892, and is recorded in the above Table II.          The infected Thames

                     Report   on the     Bacteriology       of Water.                        1   93
water at this time contained upwards of 100,000 water bacteria in
I c.c., yet after beating as above for five minutes to 503 0., only
from 35 to 39 colonies per cubic centimetre made their appear
ance, and amongst these several were easily recognisable as those
of anthrax.     Again, on the same day, other portions of the
same water were heated to 70* C. for two minutes, after which
only from 10 to 30 colonies per cubic centimetre made their
appearance, amongst which from 4 to 10 were recognisable           as
anthrax. Other portions of the same water were heated on the same
day to 90° C. for two minutes, with the result that only from 7 to 10
colonies     per cubic centimetre         appeared, of which from 3 to 6 were
found to be anthrax.
    Thus by this simple method comparatively large volumes (up to
3 c.c. have been used, but there is no reason why even larger quan
tities should not, if necessary, be employed) of water swarming with
water bacteria can be operated on and sifted, so to speak, for anthrax.
    From Table          II
                     it will be seen that this method was repeatedly
employed   on the anthrax-infected  unfiltered Thames water in question,
in most cases the temperature of 70° C. for two minutes being re
sorted to.
    Employing this method it will be              from the table that it
                                                         seen
became more and more difficult to discover anthrax in the water, although
even after nearly four months anthrax could still be just traced both in the
water, which had remained at summer (18 — 20° C.) temperature in the
incubator,     as   well as    in that       preserved     at    the      winter   temperature
(Jo — 10° C.)   of   the refrigerator.
   It now became of interest to ascertain whether the water in which
anthrax could just be barely traced by cultivation contained that
anthrax in      virulent state.
                a                  In consequence of the delay which
occurred in my obtaining the necessary licence to perform these
experiments,    Iwas not able to attack this problem until October                               7,
1892, or nearly seven months after the water was infected with anthrax.

  From these experiments           obvious that on October
                                   it    is
                                                                1892, or           7,
nearly seven months after infecting this unfiltered Thames water

  194           Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
  with sporiferons anthrax bacilli, the latter had been so much re
  duced in number, that a whole cubic centimetre of the water, irre
  spectively of whether it had been kept at the winter temperature of
  the refrigerator, or at the summer temperature of the incubator,
  was unable to cause the death of a mouse, the most sensitive of
  animals to anthrax.
     It was in the next instance necessary to ascertain whether the
  sporiferons anthrax had actually perished outright in this water, or
  whether it was still present in a living state only in very small num
 bers. To determine this point, the following plan was adopted : —
  The two flasks referred to above, 3 I and 3 R, were each treated with
  5 c. c. of sterile broth on October 15, 1892, and placed in an incub
  ator at 37° O.» so as to encourage the growth and multiplication of
  any anthrax bacilli or spores that might still be living in them. With
 these nourished waters, so to speak, then, the following two experi
  ments were made        : —
     Animal Experiment No. 16. — On October 18, 1892, 0-4 c.e. from
  the Flask 3 I, to which broth had been added on October 15, 1892,
  was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse. The mouse died
 within 1 day 19 hours, and, although no bacilli could be microscopic
 ally detected in the spleen, a gelatine tube inoculated from the spleen
 developed a typical growth, and in this the characteristic anthrax
 bacilli were subsequently found, thus leaving no doubt that the mouse
 had died of anthrax.
     Animal Experiment No. 24. — On October 29, 1892, 05 c.c. from the
 Flask 3 R, to which broth had been added on October 15, 1892, was
 subcutaneously injected into a white mouse. The mouse died within.
 2 days 18 hours      ;  the spleen was found to be full of anthrax bacilli,
 and gelatine cultivations prepared from the spleen yielded the cha
 racteristic growths, thus leaving no doubt that the animal succumbed
 to anthrax.
     These two experiments       clearly demonstrate that the sporiferons anthrax
 bacilli had    not become actually       extinct in this unfiltered Thames wafer
  (eitlier at winter or summer temperature), but had only undergone great
 numerical decline, for on adding broth to the waters these straggling
forms multiplied        sufficiently  to  cause  the death  of the mice which re
 ceived subcutaneous       injections of them.
     Of subsidiary interest in Table               II  is the insight furnished
 into the behaviour           of the     ordinary   water  bacteria at the tem
 peratures in question.            These    numbered about 10,000 per cubic
 centimetre at the outset,* whilst after 4 days (March 22, 18i)2) about
    * This  does not refer to the number present in the water at the time of its col
lection from the Thames, but at the time of its infection with anthrax several days
later. The sample was collected on March 8, and the infection was made on the
18th of the same month.

 80,000 were found       in the incubated, and upwards of 100,000 in the
 refrigerated, water.        After 46 days (May 3, 1892) they numbered
 about 13.000 in the incubated water, whilst after 98 days (June 24,
 1892) the numbers in the incubated water were about 7,000, and from
 2.000 to 3,000 in the refrigerated.        These latter figures are much the
 same as were obtained in the nninfected           waters (see Table I) after
 upwards of      7  months.
 3.  Bacteriological Examination      of the Unsterilised Thames Water ( First
    Series), Filtered through Swedish Paper and Infected with Anthrax.
    The experiments with the Thames water which had been filtered
 through Swedish paper prior to infection with anthrax, and which are
 recorded in Table      III  (pp. 198 and 199), yielded very much the same
 results as those made with the unfiltered Thames water recorded in
 Table II. We find a similar multiplication followed by diminution
in the number of water bacteria, both in the flasks kept at summer
 and winter temperatures respectively.            In no single instance was
anthrax detected by ordinary plate cultivation, but in the refrigerated
 water it was found by the special method after 98 days (June 24,
 1892), whilst with the incubated water the same method failed to
find  anthrax after 53 days (May 10, 1892), and again after 98 days
 (June 24, 1892), whilst in two final examinations, after 113 days
 (July 9, 1892), one again gave a negative result, whilst the other
yielded a feeble growth, presenting a very doubtful resemblance to
anthrax.       It may be taken, therefore, that in the water preserved at
summer temperature the degeneration of anthrax was markedly more
rapid than in that kept at the winter temperature.
    This infected paper-filtered Thames water was also examined for
virulence by direct experiment, as follows : —
    Animal Experiment No. 8. — On October 15, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask " 1 R, paper-filtered Thames water, infected with
anthrax, March 18, 1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white
mouse.       The mouse died within 4 days 17 hours ; there was very
extensive oedema, and the spleen was not much enlarged ; no bacilli
were microscopically found in the spleen, but the characteristic growth
was obtained on cultivation in gelatine, thus leaving no doubt that
the animal had succumbed to anthrax, although in an attenuated form.
    The result of this experiment is interesting in several respects.
Thus, firstly, it shows that in this water anthrax was still present,
after 7 months, and in sufficient numbers in 1 c.c. to cause the death of the
mouse, whilst      it will be remembered that in the unfiltered Thames water
this mas not the case, so that apparently the removal of a certain propor
tion of the water bacteria by paper filtration had been conducive to the
preservation of the anthrax.

    That the anthrax    had undergone considerable       attenuation through
its long residence in this nnsterile water          appears from its tardy
causation of death with the non-typical             symptom     of but slight
enlargement of the spleen.
4.   Bad etiological Examination of the Infected Thames Water Sterilised
     by Filtration through Porous Porcelain and by Steam respectively
      (First Series).
    The results recorded in Tables     IV   and V  may be conveniently con
sidered together.       These tables exhibit the effect of introducing a
 small number of spore-bearing anthrax bacilli into Thames water pre
 viously sterilised, on the one hand by filtration through porous
porcelain, and on the other by steam.
    In these waters     the  recognition and numeration of the anthrax
•colonies in the plate cultivations    is, of course, attended with no diffi
 culty, and, indeed, it is only by means of these that an estimate of the
number of anthrax organisms introduced into the unsterilised water
can be formed.       It will be seen that the number of anthrax germs
introduced into each cubic centimetre of the waters of this Series I
amounted to from 30 to 100.          The fate of these in the unsterilised
water we have already traced ; in- these sterilised waters it will be
seen that they undergo little or no change in numbers during a period
of upwards of 3 months, nor is there any material difference in their
deportment in the waters sterilised in the two different ways.
    Although these waters, which had been submitted to steam and
filtration through porcelain respectively, were sterile in the first
instance, it was only to be expected that in repeatedly opening the
flasks for the purpose of preparing the plate cultivations, some would
become contaminated with air-carried bacteria,             &c., the presence
of such intruding forms in a few of the flasks will be found recorded
in the tables, but they generally gave rise to no difficulty in con
nexion with the plate cultivations.
    It will be seen that in the case of these sterilised waters there is
evidence of a very slight increase in the number of anthrax colonies
 after the first day, the number subsequently falling to abont the
original.
    At the foot of Table IV will be seen         the result of applying the
 special method of anthrax identification,       which had to be relied on
 exclusively in the case of the nnsterilised     waters.    On comparing the
 number of anthrax colonies found by this        method with that obtained
 by ordinary plate cultivation, it will be seen that the greater portion
 of the anthrax organisms are either actually destroyed in the process
 of heating to 70° C., for 2 minutes, or, at any rate, are so far enfeebled
 that they do not subsequently develop in the gelatine.           Thus, whilst

43—44       colonies per   1 c.c.  were found in one flask (1 R, porcelain,
Table      IV) by ordinary plate cultivation, only 2 — 5 colonies in the
same volume were found after the preliminary heating to 70° C. for
2 minutes.       On comparing, these results with those obtained by the
same method in the case of the unsterilised waters, it will be seen that
there     is distinct evidence of the anthrax organs undergoing more
rapid degeneration in the latter than in the sterilised waters.          The
degeneration      is, however,  in  any case, only an extremely slow one.
     There is hardly any difference to be found between the results
yielded by the sterile waters kept at summer and winter tempera
tures respectively, but such slight difference as there is points rather
to the degeneration of the anthrax being more retarded at the los
than at the higher temperature.
     One of these waters was also examined for virulence in October, or
7. months after infection with anthrax, and the following results
obtained     : —
    Animal Experiment No. 9. — On October 15, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask " 1 R, Thames water, porcelain-filtered, infected with
anthrax, March 18, 1892," was subcutaneonsly injected into a white
mouse.       The mouse died within 4 days 17 hours. Anthrax bacilli
were fonnd in the spleen and by cultivation in gelatine.          There was
extensive oedema, and the spleen was not much enlarged.
     Thus, in the water sterilised by filtration through porous porcelain the
anthrax was still present after 7 months, in sufficient numbers for 1 c.c.
to cause the death of the mouse, although from the comparatively slow
action and non-typical symptoms it had apparently become somewhat
attenuated.
     I did not consider it necessary to make a corresponding experiment
with the steam-sterilised Thames water, as, owing to the similarity
between the results obtained by plate cultivation from both types of
sterilised water, it appeared only reasonable to assume that their
virulent effect would also be much the same.
  5.   Vitality and Virulence of Anthrax in Thames Water (First      Seriet)
                         Exposed to Diffused Daylight.
     In all the experiments hitherto referred to, the waters       were pre
served in total darkness, the flasks containing them being placed in
an incubator and refrigerator respectively.             Further experiments
were, however, made       with    the same waters, exposed to diffused day
light, at the ordinary temperature of the laboratory, and others, again,
in which the flasks were exposed to direct sunshine.
    The results of the experiments with Thames water (First Series),
exposed to diffused daylight, are recorded in Table VI.
   All the flasks employed in these experiments had been in              the

                   Report on   the Bacteriology of   Water.            205
 refrigerator   or incubator   from the day of infection with anthrax
 (March 18, 1892)    until March 25, 1892, from when they remained in
 a dark room until April 9, 1892, after which they were exposed to
 the diffused daylight in a room with a southern aspect.
    An inspection of Table VI at once shows that the anthrax in the
previously sterilised (porcelain and steam) Thames water survives
this exposure to diffused daylight, nor does the number of colonies
obtained on plate cultivation differ materially from that obtained
from the corresponding flasks maintained throughout in the dark.
    On the other hand, the degeneration of the anthrax in the unsterilised
Thames water is distinctly more rapid in these flasks exposed to day
light than in those preserved in the dark.       Thus, in the case of the
unfiltered Thames water (daylight) the special method of examina
tion revealed no anthrax from May 17, 1892, whilst in the same
water, kept both in the incubator and refrigerator, anthrax was dis
covered    by the same method on July 9, 1892.
    The following experiments were made to test the virulence of the
flasks which had been thus exposed to diffused daylight : —
    Animal Experiment No. 5. — On October 8, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask " 1 1, Thames water, unfiltered, infected with anthrax
on March 18, 1892, and exposed to daylight since April 9, 1892," was
Bubcutaneously injected into a white mouse. The mouse did not
succumb, but is alive to the present time (November 11, 1892), or 32
days after the operation.
    This result was to be anticipated, seeing that the corresponding
flasks 3 I and 3 R, which had not been exposed to daylight, also
failed to kill mice (see Animal Experiments Nos. 1 and 2).
    Animal Experiment No. 3. — On October 7, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask " 5 I, Thames water, paper-filtered, which had been
infected with anthrax on March 18, 1892, and exposed to daylight
since April 9, 1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse.
The mouse did not die, but is still alive, 33 days after the operation.
    It will be remembered that a corresponding flask, 1 B, which had
not been exposed to daylight did kill a mouse (see Animal Experi
ment No. 8), so that the virulence has in this case been reduced by
the exposure.

infected with anthrax on March 18, 1892, and exposed to daylight
since April 9, 1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse.
The mouse died within 6 days 20^ hours.         The body exhibited exten
sive oedema ; the spleen was only slightly enlarged, but was found to
contain anthrax bacilli both microscopically         and by cultivation in
 gelatine.
    Animal Experiment No. 10. — On October 15, 1892, 1 c.c. of water

 206           Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
 from the flask " 5 I, Thames water, steam-sterilised, which had been
 infected with anthrax on March 18, 1892, and exposed to daylight
 since April 9, 1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse.
 The mouse died within 4 days 17 hours; the body exhibited much
 oedema and the spleen was not very large; anthrax bacilli were
 detected in the latter both with the microscope and by cultivation in
 gelatine.
    The contrast exhibited by the sterilised and unsterilised Thames water
 is thus again most striking in the case of these flasks exposed to daylight,
for both the unfiltered and paper-filtered waters failed to kill, ichilst the
porcelain, filtered and the steam-sterilised waters were fatal to the mice
into which they were injected. The lethal effect of both the latter, and
especially of the porcelain-filtered water, accompanied by the non-
typical symptom of only slight enlargement of the spleen, points
again to an attenuation of the virus.
    These results did not lead me to conclude, however, that the
anthrax virus was necessarily quite extinct in these two unsterilised
waters (viz., the unfiltered and paper-filtered Thames water), and I
resorted, therefore, to the method before employed (see p. 194) of
revivifying it by the addition of 5 c.c. of sterile broth to each of the
two flasks in question.      The flasks so treated were placed in an in
cubator at 37° C., and the following further experiments made with
them    : —
    Animal Experiment No. 20. — On October 22, 1892, 05 c.c. of the
water (to which broth had been added on October 15, 1892) in the
flask " 1 I, Thames water, unfiltered, and infected with anthrax on
March 18, 1892, exposed to daylight since April 9, 1892," was sub-
cutaneously injected into a white mouse.           The mouse died within
2 days 18 hours.        The body exhibited extensive oedema and the
spleen was much enlarged ; the latter was found full of anthrax
bacilli, the presence of which was confirmed by cultivation in
gelatine.
    Animal Experiment No. 17. — On October 18, 1892, 0-5 c c. of the
water (to which broth had been added on October 15, 1892) in the
flask " 5 I, Thames water,     paper-filtered, and infected with anthrax
March      18, 1892, exposed to  daylight since April 9, 1892," was sub
cutaneously injected into a white mouse. The mouse died within
1 day 19 hours.       Only few bacilli were found in the spleen, but more
in the kidney ; their presence was confirmed by gelatine cultivations
from both organs.
    These experiments show, then, that in the flasks in question (un
sterilised Thames water exposed to daylight), although the number of
anthrax germs had been so far reduced that 1 c.c. would not kill mice,
yet after nourishment with broth they were so revivified as to be fatal to
these animals when injected in the same or even a smaller quantity.

6.   Vitality and Virulence of Anthrax in Thames Water (First Series)
                         Exposed to Direct Sunshine.
   The effect of direct sunshine is recorded in Table VII.       The flasks
were taken from the incubator and refrigerator respectively on
March 25, 1892; they remained in a dark room from that day to
April   9, 1892, and from then onwards they were exposed to as much
sunshine as could be conveniently obtained, and which was approxi
mately estimated in hours, although        it is obviously very difficult to
make any exact determination          of  the latter.   The conditions of
experiment are, of course, also much      complicated by the fact that the
temperature of the water so exposed       was subject to very great varia
tion, although it certainly never exceeded 32° C.
   The results, which are very striking, are easily followed by reference
to  Table VII.
    From the table it will   be seen that in —
    Unfiltered Thames water, anthrax was still alive on May 2, 1892,
after 56 hours' sunshine, but extinct on May 12, 1892, after about
84 hours' insolation.
   Paper-filtered Thames water, anthrax was almost extinct on May 15,
1892, after about 92 hours' insolation, and quite extinct on June 1",
1892, after about 151 hours' sunshine.
    Thames water filtered through porcelain, anthrax was still alive on
May 2, 1892, after about 56 hours of sun, but extinct on May 12,
1892, after about 84 hours' insolation.
     Thames water sterilised with steam, anthrax was still alive on
May 2, 1892, after about 56 hours', but dead on May 12, 1892, after
about 84 hours' sunshine.
    In consequence of the sunshine having destroyed the greater num
ber of those water bacteria causing liquefaction of the gelatine, it
was possible to incubate the plates for a long period of time, and
thus in most instances to dispense with the special method of
examination     by preliminary heating already so often referred to.
    The above results have only reference to the presence or absence of
 anthrax as revealed by cultivation, but experiments were also made
 on the virulence of these waters which had been exposed to direct
 insolation.    Thus : —
    Animal Experiment No. 30. — On November 2, 1892, 1 c.c. of the
water from the flask " 4 I, Thames water, unfiltered, and infected
with anthrax on March 18, 1892, exposed to 151 hours' sunshine,"
 was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse. The mouse is still
 alive (November 14, 1892).

   Animal Experiment No. 32. — On November 2, 1892, 1 c.c. of the
water from flask "4 I, Thames water, porcelain-filtered, and infected

subcutaneously injected into a white mouse.      The mouse is still alive
(November 14, 1892).
    Thns, in all three cases, the water was   non-virulent when injected
to the amount of 1 c.c. ; this is, it will be observed, the first instance
in which the sterilised waters infected with anthrax had become non-
virulent. It was, however, obviously not to be necessarily concluded
that the anthrax had become absolutely extinct in these waters,
and in order to put this point to the test the flasks in question were
each treated with 5 c.c. of sterile broth and incubated at 37° C., after
which the following further experiments were made : —
    Animal Experiment No. 36.— On November 9, 1892, 0'5 c.c. of
the water (to which broth was added on November 7, 1892) from
flask "41, Thames water, unfiltered, and infected with anthrax on
March 18, 1892, exposed to 151 hours' sunshine," was subcutaneously
injected    into a white mouse.   The mouse is still alive (November    14,
1892).
    Animal Experiment No.     37. — On November 9, 1892, 0 6 c.c. of the
water    (to which broth was added on November 7, 1892) from flask
"  4 I, Thames water, steam-sterilised, and infected with anthrax on
March 18, 18'.)2, exposed to 151 hours' sunshine," was subcutaneously
injected into a white mouse.      The mouse is still alive (November 14,
1892).
    Animal Experiment     No. 38. — On November 9, 1892, 0"6 c.c. of
the water (to which broth was added on November 7, 1892) from
flask " 4 I, Thames water, poreelain-filtered, and infected with anthrax
on March 18, 1892, exposed to 151 hours' sunshine,"              was sub
cutaneously injected into a white mouse. The mouse is still alive
November 14, 1892).
    N.B. — These three mice, Nos. 36, 37, and 38, all lived much longer
than November 14, 1802, so there can be no doubt that they escaped
infection.
    Thus, in these waters exposed to direct sunshine, the anthrax germs
were completely destroyed and could not be revived by the ad>Ktion of
broth.
    The destruction of anthrax spores by direct sunshine is a subject
which has received the attention of a number of observers. Thus,
Arloing (' Compt. Rend.,' vol. 100, 1885, p. 378, and vol. 101, p. 511)
 found that they were destroyed in two hours, whilst in subsequent
experiments in which the spores were placed in broth maintained
at a temperature of 4— 11° C. by means of ice five hours' insolation

                    Report on   the Bacteriology of Water.            213
 effected their destruction. Roux ('Ann. de l'lnst. Past.,' 1887, p. 445)
again insolated the spores when dispersed in the aqueous humour of
the ox-eye, and found them destroyed in from twenty-nine to fifty-
four hours, whilst Pansini (' Rivista d'Igiene,' 1889) observed their
destruction on potatoes in from four to five hours, in gelatine in from
six to seven hours, and in broth in from thirty minutes to two hours.
In all these experiments it will be seen that nutrient culture media
"were employed for the insolation, and that the spores were destroyed
in a much briefer period of time than in my experiments, in which
they were insolated in Thames water.           This same phenomenon of
the spores of anthrax being more resistant to the action of sunshine in
water than in ordinary culture materials has also been observed by
Straus ('Societe de Biologic,' 1886, p. 473) and by Momont ('Ann.
de l'lnst. Past., '1892, p. 21), who both, however, appear to have made
 nse of distilled water only.
ii.   vXtalitt    and  virulence of anthrax spores in thames water
                      (Second   Series of Experiments).
    Owing to the very small number of anthrax germs introduced into
the water in the First Series of experiments, it was deemed advisable
to carry out a Second Series in which a much larger number were
inoculated into the several waters, whilst as a further modification
 and check, the infection was made with virulent anthrax from a
 totally different source to that employed in the First Series.
    The infection was made as follows : —
    50 c.c. of Thames water previously steam sterilised were placed in
a small sterile stoppered bottle, and inoculated with 5 needle loops
from an anthrax culture in glycerine agar of 3 weeks' age, and with
4 needle loops of another similar culture of 3^ weeks' age. The
water thus infected was then violently shaken, after which three
portions of 5 c.c. each were measured with a sterile pipette into
three flasks containing the three following waters respectively : —
     (a.) TJnfiltered Thames water (750 c.c.).
     (6.) Thames water sterilised by filtration through porous porcelain
            (1000 c.c.).
     (c.) Thames    water sterilised by steam (1000 c.c.).
     The waters thus infected were violently agitated to secure even
 distribution of the anthrax, after which each water was divided
 amongst a number of small flasks as follows : —

           water               \3          „        „ refrigerator.
    The contents of these flasks were then from time to time submitted
to  bacteriological examination in the same way as in the First Series
of experiments.
           1.  Infected Unfiltered Thames     Water (Second Series).
    The results of the experiments made with the unaltered Thames
 water are recorded in Table VIII.
    The plates poured on the day of infection (March 25, 1892) yielded
about 15,000 colonies per cubic centimetre, of which about 12,000
were easily identifiable as anthrax.
    The second series of plates were poured 4 days later (March 29,
 1892), but those both from the incubator and the refrigerator flask
were already so badly liquefied on the third day of incubation that it
 was impossible either to count or identify any anthrax colonies.
    In consequence of this failure of the ordinary plate cultivation
 method, the special process for anthrax identification by preliminary
 heating was resorted to on April 13, 1892, for one of the refrigerator
 flasks, with the result that anthrax was easily recognised.
     Ordinary plates were again poured some days later, on April 26,
 1892, both from an incubator        and a refrigerator flask, but in neither
 case could any anthrax colonies be found.
     Ordinary plates were again poured on June 17, 1892, but only in
 one out of eight plates could any anthrax colonies be identified ;
 nevertheless, when on the same day the special method by pre
 liminary heating     to 70° C. was adopted, a number of      anthrax colonies   .
 were easily     obtained both from the incubator as           well as the re
 frigerator flask.      This conclusively demonstrates the necessity of
 resorting to the special method of examination, and of not relying on
 that by ordinary plate cultivation.
     The anthrax had thus retained its vitality in the unfiltered Thames
  water for 84 days, both when the water was maintained at a summer
 and a winter temperature respectively, although it was undoubtedly
 present in very much diminished numbers compared with those
 originally introduced.
     Some of the flasks were finally examined on October 8, or 197 days
 after the original infection, and anthrax was still discoverable by the
 special method, although in slightly smaller numbers than on the
 previous occasion.      By comparing these numbers with those obtained

                   Report on    the Bacteriology of Water.            215
  in a  corresponding experiment made on the same day (October 8)
  with the porcelain-filtered    water (which was also orginally infected
  with about the same number of anthrax germs as the nnfiltered
  water), it will be seen that the numbers have not diminished to
  nearly the same extent in the porcelain- filtered water as in the
  unsterilised water ; in fact, in the porcelain-filtered water they have
  undergone hardly any reduction at all.
    The following experiments were conducted in order to investigate
 the virulence of this nnfiltered water in which plate cultivation had
 revealed the presence of living anthrax germs : —
    Animal Experiment No. 21. — On October 23, 1892, 1 c.c. of the
 water in flask " 1 1, nnfiltered Thames water (Second Series), in
fected with anthrax, March 25, 1892," was subcutaneously injected
 into a white mouse. The mouse died within 4 days 16 hours, anthrax
 bacilli being duly found in the spleen.
    Animal Experiment No. 26. — On October 29, 1892, 1 c.c. of the
 water in flask " 2 I, nnfiltered Thames water (Second Series), in
 fected with anthrax, March 25, 1892," was subcutaneously injected
 into a white mouse.      The mouse is still alive (November 14, 1892)
 16 days after the operation, and therefore out of danger of anthrax.
    Animal Experiment No. 25. — On October 29, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask " 3 R,      nnfiltered Thames water (Second Series), in
fected with anthrax, March 25, 1892," was subcutaneously injected
into a white mouse. The mouse died within 5 days 16 hours ; the
 body exhibited extensive oedema, and the spleen was found full of
anthrax bacilli, which was further confirmed by the gelatine cultiva
tions prepared from that organ.
    Animal Experiment No. 33. — This was performed on November 5,
1892, and was a repetition of Experiment No. 26.           The mouse died
within 2 days 4 hours. The spleen was much enlarged and found to
contain anthrax bacilli, the characteristic growth being obtained in
gelatine cultivations from the same organ.
    Animal Experiment No. 34. — On November 5, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask "2R, nnfiltered Thames water (Second Series), in
fected with anthrax, March 25, 1892," was subcutaneously injected
into a white mouse. The mouse died within 6 days 16 hours ; the
body exhibited much oedema ; the spleen was considerably enlarged,
and an abundance of anthrax bacilli were found in it.
    We may conveniently also refer at this point to experiments made
with some flasks resembling the above in all respects excepting that
from July 23, 1892, onwards, when they were taken out of the in
cubator and refrigerator respectively, they had been exposed to
diffused daylight, whilst the above flasks had been kept in the dark
throughout.      The results of the plate cultivations from these day

 Table VIII. Thus :
   Animal Experiment No. 18. — On October 21, 1892, 1 c.c. of the
 water in flask "31, unaltered Thames water, infected with anthrax,
 .March 25, 1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse.
 The mouse died within 3 days 17 hours; the spleen was much
enlarged, and although no anthrax bacilli could be found either in
the latter or in the kidney with the microscope, gelatine cultivations
prepared from the spleen developed the characteristic growths in due
course, leaving no doubt that the animal had succumbed to anthrax.
   Animal Experiment No. 27. — On October 31, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask " 1 R, untiltered Thames water (Second Series), in
fected with anthrax, March 25, 1892," was subcutaneously injected
into a white mouse.      The mouse died within 2 days 18^ hours,
anthrax bacilli being found in the spleen, and the characteristic
growth obtained on gelatine cultivation.
   These experiments with the unfiltered Thames water (Second
Series) on being contrasted with those of the same water (First
Series) show that the virulence was distinctly greater in the Second
than in the First Series, for both incubator and refrigerator flasks of
the Second Series, irrespectively of whether they had been kept in
darkness or in the daylight, were sufficiently virulent to be fatal to
mice.   That the anthrax must have suffered a certain amount of at
tenuation is clear from the fact that one of the mice (Experiment
No. 26) remained alive after receiving 1 c.c. of the water in flask
" 2 1," although a second mouse similarly inoculated succumbed.
This unquestionably greater virulence of the unfiltered Thames water
(Second Series)     is,
                    doubtless, due to the much larger number    anthrax
                                                                     of
germs with which the water was infected in the Second than in the First
Series.  It   isparticularly interesting that the mouse in Experiment
No. 26 remained alive, because from the plate cultivations (see
Table VIII)   it  perfectly certain that in the

therefore, that their virulence must have been weakened by the long
residence in the unsterilised water.
     2.   Experiments with Sterilised Thames Water (Second Series).
  The results of the experiments made on Thames water sterilised
by filtration through porous porcelain are recorded in Table IX,
whilst those on the same water sterilised by steam are given in
Table X. From these tables     will be seen that about 6000 anthrax

organisms per cubic centimetre were introduced into the porcelain-
filtered water, and about 8000 into the steamed water; whilst in

unfiltered water.     This greater impregnation of the unfiltered water
was intentionally effected so as to heighten the contrast which it was
anticipated would be presented at the close of the experiments. Thus
on June 16, 1892, or 83 days from infection, the sterile waters still
yielded several thousand anthrax colonies per cubic centimetre, whilst
in the unfiltered water on the following day (June 17, 1892) only
1200   anthrax   colonies conld at most be detected.   Or, again, com
paring the results obtained by the special method of preliminary
heating, on June 17, 1892, the unfiltered water yielded a maximum of
49 colonies per cubic centimetre ; whilst on July 11, 1892, or nearly
a month later, the porcelain-filtered     water yielded by the same
method 128 — 145 colonies per cubic centimetre, and the steamed
water on the same day (July 11, 1892), 163 — 179 colonies per cubic
centimetre.
   There is thus again the most convincing proof that the degenera
tion of the spores of anthrax is more rapid in the unsterilised than
in the sterilised water, whilst it is almost immaterial in this respect
whether the latter is sterilised by steam or by filtration through
porous porcelain, although there is some slight evidence that the
steam-sterilised water is more favourable to the preservation of the
anthrax germs than that which has been rendered sterile by filtration
through porcelain.
   As regards the influence of temperature on the preservation of
anthrax, in the First Series of experiments the evidence apparently
pointed in the direction of the degeneration taking place more
rapidly at the summer than at the winter temperature ; whilst in the
 Second Series of experiments the indications are uncertain, and I am
of opinion, therefore, that the difference of temperature in question
is probably a matter of little consequence in this respect.
   Finally examining the results obtained in the last plate cultiva
tions made in October, it will be seen that the anthrax germs were
still present in the sterile waters (steamed and porcelain-filtered) in
practically undiminished numbers, whilst in the unsterilised water
their numbers were so much reduced that they could only just be
still recognised by the special method of preliminary heating.
   I made the following experiments in order to test the virulence of
these infected sterile waters of the Second Series : —
   Animal Experiment No. 6 — On October 12, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask " 1 1, Thames water, steam-sterilised   (Second   Series),
infected   with anthrax on March 25, 1892," was subcutaneously in
jected into a white mouse.     The mouse died within 2 days 21 hours ;
the body exhibited much oedema ; the spleen was very much enlarged,
and anthrax bacilli were fairly abundant in it, the gelatine cultures
also developing the characteristic growths in due course.

                   Report on   the  Bacteriology    of Water.                 225
    Animal Experiment No. 7. — On October 12, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
 from the flask " 2 1, Thames water, porcelain-filtered (Second Series),
 infected with anthrax, March 25, 1892," was subcutaneously injected
 into a white monse.      The mouse died within 2 days 5 hours ; the
 body exhibited mnch oedema, but the spleen was very small ; anthrax
 bacilli were found in the latter, both with the microscope and by
 cnltivation in gelatine.
    From    these experiments     it is evident, therefore, that       the  sterile
 Thames waters (Second Series-) were still virulent nearly 7 months after
 their infection with anthrax, and the virulence as measured by the
 rapidity of their lethal effect was noticeably greater than with the corre
sponding waters of the First Series.
III.   Experiments    on the Vitality and Virulence of the Bacillus
           anthracis and its Spores in Loch Katrine Water.
   Experiments were made on the same lines with the water supplied
to  Glasgow from Loch Katrine.
   The water was collected personally by myself, on July 6, 1892, at
the Anderson's College, Glasgow; some of the water was drawn
directly into sterile bottles, and submitted to ordinary plate cultiva
tion within a few hours of its collection.            The plates, after three
days' incubation at 18
                         — 20° O, yielded 74 colonies per 1 c.c. of water.
   As this is, as far as I am aware, the first record of the plate
cnltivation of such moorland water, I take this opportunity of also
referring to the results obtained by me, for another purpose, in
the plate cultivation of a number of samples of that portion of the
Dundee water supply which is derived from the Loch of Lintrathen,
a very similar source to Loch Katrine.            All the samples were taken
during the months of June and July,           and  one in October, during the
present year, and were submitted to cultivation in about one hour
from the time of collection.       The results were as follows : —

   It should be pointed out that neither the Loch Katrine nor the
Li nt rath en waters are submitted to filtration before delivery, and that
these figures, therefore, indicate the bacterial life present in these
waters as they come from the loch, excepting in so far as changes
may occur in their passage through the mains.
    The behaviour of these bacteria normally present in the Loch
Katrine water, when the latter is kept at winter and summer tem
peratures respectively, was investigated, and the results are recorded
in Table XI. From this it will be seen that in four days a very con
siderable multiplication had taken place, the increase in numbers
being much greater in the case of the incubator (19° C.) flask than in
that of the refrigerator (9° C.).             After three months, however, the
numbers        in the  incubator  flask     had  fallen very much below those in
the refrigerator flask, showing that the higher temperature leads to
rapid multiplication followed by rapid decline, whilst at the lower
temperature the increase and decrease are of a more gradual character.
    As in the experiments on the behaviour of the anthrax bacilli in
 Loch Katrine water, the latter was used both in the natural condition
 and sterilised by filtration through porous porcelain ; the water was
 also submitted to chemical analysis both in its natural state and after
 passage through the porcelain filter, with the following results : —

 to be of its usual character ; as far as mineral ingredients are con
cerned, it is but little removed from distilled water ; it contains, how
ever, just about the same proportion of organic matter as Thames
water, although the smaller yield of albuminoid ammonia and the
larger amount of oxygen absorbed from permanganate show this
organic matter to be qualitatively different.             In point of fact, the
organic matter in Loch Katrine water is almost exclusively of peaty
origin, whilst that in Thames water, coming as it does from land
which is under high cultivation, is derived from a variety of sources,
both vegetable and animal.
   The Loch Katrine water was also experimented with in three
different states : (a) in the natural condition unsterilised, (b) sterilised
by filtration through porous porcelain, and (c) sterilised by steam.
   The method of infection was similar to that already described for
Thames water; the sporiferous anthrax bacilli were taken from an
agar-agar cultivation of four days' age.            Eight needle loops full of
the surface growth were introduced into 50 c.c. of sterile water, and
thoroughly mixed by violently shaking for 15 minutes ; 1 c.c. of this
attenuation was then employed for infecting 750 c.c. of each of the
three waters.
   The waters, after infection, were distributed in a number of small
flasks, which were then disposed of as follows : —

    Turning in the first instance to Table XII, in which the results for the
unsterilised water are recorded, it will be seen from the plates poured
on the day of infection (July 8, 1892) that the sporiferous anthrax
bacilli had been introduced to the amount of about 5000 per cubic
centimetre, the water bacteria being present to the number of about
600 per cubic centimetre only. From Tables        XIII  and XIV it will be
seen that the sporiferous anthrax bacilli        had been introduced into
the sterile waters in also just the same numbers as into the unsterile
water, viz., about 5000 per cubic centimetre.
   In the case of the unsterilised water, there was no difficulty in
counting the anthrax colonies on the plates poured on the day of
infection (July 8, 1892) ; but already, four days afterwards, the
number of water bacteria had so greatly increased that the plates
could not be preserved long enough for the proper development of
the anthrax colonies, although they could still be just recognised as
minute dots with a low power of the microscope.         The multiplication
of the water bacteria was greatest in the flask which had been kept at
18 — 20° C., although it was also very considerable in the one which
had been in the refrigerator at about 9° C.
   A fortnight (July      22, 1892) after the day of infection, anthrax
was easily    discoverable    in large numbers by means of the special
method of preliminary heating to destroy the water bacteria, there
being three or four times as many colonies on the plates from the
refrigerator flask as on those from the flask which had been kept at
18 — 20° C.    This difference becomes still further accentuated later
on,  for on examining those flasks which had been continuously at the
temperature. (19° C.) of the incubator up to October 18, 1892, it was
found that no anthrax could be demonstrated, whilst in those flasks
which had been at the temperature of the refrigerator (9° C.) up
to July 23, 1892, and up to 15° C. afterwards, a large number of
anthrax colonies was obtained on cultivation. This contrast was pre
sented both by those flasks which were kept continuously in the dark,
as well as by those which had been placed in the daylight from
July 23, 1892, onwards. From this it would appear that the spores
of anthrax undergo markedly more rapid degeneration in the un
sterilised Loch Katrine water at 20° C. than at 9° C. As will be
seen presently, this striking phenomenon is not exhibited by the
sterilised Loch Katrine water, in which there is little difference
between the numbers of anthrax colonies obtained from the incubator
and refrigerator flasks respectively.
   It became, of course, particularly interesting to ascertain whether
these remarkable differences between the incubator and refrigerator
flasks would be maintained also in respect of virulence, and to deter
mine this point the following direct experiments were made : —
   Animal Experiment No. 11. — On October 16, 1892, 1 c.c. of the

                   Report on  the Bacteriology  of   Water.              237
 water from the flask " 1 T, Loch Katrine, unaltered, infected with
 anthrax, July 8, 1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white
  mouse.    The mouse is still alive (November 10, 1892), or 25 days
 after the operation.
    Animal Experiment No. 22. — On October 23, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
 from the flask "21, Loch Katrine, unfiltered, infected with anthrax,
 Jnly 8, 1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse. The
 mouse is still alivo (November 10, 1892), or 18 days after the opera
 tion.
    Animal Experiment No. 19. — On October 21, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
 from the flask " 1 R, Loch Katrine, unfiltered, infected with anthrax,
 July 8, 1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse. The
 mouse died within 2 days 15 hours ; the body exhibited extensive
oedema ; the spleen was much enlarged, and was found f nil of anthrax
 bacilli, the characteristic growth being obtained in gelatine cultivation.
    Animal Experiment No. 23. — On October 23, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
 from the flask " 2 R, Loch Katrine, unfiltered, infected with anthrax,
July 8, 1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse. The
mouse died within 2 days 16 hours, and, although no bacilli could be
 microscopically detected in the spleen, their presence was revealed by
g-elatine cultivations made from that organ, thus leaving no doubt that
the animal succumbed to anthrax.
    Thus, the experiments made on mice with the unsterilised Loch Katrine
water    are in precise harmony with the results obtained by plate cultiva
tion ; the two incubator flasks failed to kill, whilst the two corresponding
refrigerator flasks were fatal to the mice, into which they were injected
in   the same quantity.
    The same striking contrast was likewise obtained in the case of
two similar flasks, which had, however, been exposed to daylight
since July 23, 1892. Thus—
    Animal Experiment No. 12. — On October 17, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask " 3 1, Loch Katrine, unfiltered, infected with anthrax,
July 8, 1892, exposed to daylight since July 23, 1892," was sub
cutaneously injected into a white mouse. The mouse is still alive
(November 10, 1892), or 18 days since the operation.
    Animal Experiment No. 13. — On October 17, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask " 3R, Loch Katrine, unfiltered, infected with anthrax,
July 8, 1892, exposed to daylight since July 23, 1892," was sub
cutaneously injected into a white mouse.          The mouse died within
2 days 18 hours ; the body exhibited much oedema ; the spleen was
slightly enlarged, and anthrax bacilli were discovered in the latter,
both by the microscope and by cultivation in gelatine.
    Thus, in the case of the flasks subsequently exposed to daylight, also,
the incubator flask proved harmless, and the refrigerator flask fatal, to
the mice, into which they were respectively injected in equal quantity.

238           Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
   It was not, however, to be forthwith concluded, that the anthrax
germs in these incubator flasks were necessarily extinct, and the
endeavour was made, as in previous cases described above, to revive
them, by the addition of broth to the waters.             On October 29,
1892, therefore, 5 c.c. of sterile broth were accordingly added to each
of the flasks    1 1," and
                            " 2 I," which were then placed in an incubator
at 37° C., after which the following two experiments were per
formed : —
   Animal Experiment No. 28. — On October 31, 1892, 0-5 c.c. of the
water from the flask (to which broth had beeu added on October 29,
        " 1 1, Loch Katrine, unfiltered, infected with anthrax, July 8,
1892)
1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse. The mouse
is still alive (November 14, 1892), or 14 days after the operation,
and, therefore, out of danger of succumbing to anthrax.
    Animal Experiment No. 29. — On October 31, 1892, 0'5 c.c. of the
water from the flask (to which broth had been added on October 29,
        " 2 I, Loch Katrine, unfiltered, infected with anthrax, July 8,
1892)
1892," was subcutaneously injected into a white mouse.          The mouse
died within 2 days 19 hours, anthrax bacilli being           found   in the
spleen, and the characteristic growth obtained on gelatine cultiva
tion.
   Thus, in the   case of flask
                                  " 1 1," the anthrax germs were extinct
and could not be revived with broth ; in the case of " 2 I," however,
the addition of broth restored the virulence, so that some few anthrax
germs must still have been alive in this flask.
   Turning, in the next instance, to Table XIII, we find that on the
day of infection    (July  8, 1892) the porcelain-filtered Loch Katrine
water yielded about 4000 colonies per cubic centimetre, whilst four
days later (July 12, 1892) the number had risen to about 8000 in the
flask kept at 18 — 20° C., whilst the refrigerator flask exhibited only a
slight increase on the original number, a similar difference being
observable again on the tenth day (July 18, 1892). From July 23,
1892, the temperature of the refrigerator was permitted to follow
that of the room, and on October 8, 11, and 12, 1892, these refrigerator
flasks yielded 6000 — 8000 anthrax colonies, whilst the incubator ones
had fallon again to the original number of about 4000 per cubic
centimetre.
   Again, in the case of the flasks which had been exposed to the day
light from July 23, 1892, onwards, it was found, on October 12,
1892, that the refrigerator flask contained about 10,000, the incubator
flask only 6000, anthrax germs.
   It will be seen, therefore, that although there is evidence of the
numbers being longer maintained at the low than at the high tem
perature, the contrast between the two is enormously less marked than
in the case of the unsterilised Loch Katrine water.

                       Report on   the   Bacteriology         of   Water.                239
   In order to test the virulence of the porcelain-filtered water, I
made the following experiments : —
   Animal Experiment No. 15. — On Octoher 17, 1892, 1 c.c. of water
from the flask "31, Loch Katrine, porcelain- filtered, infected with
anthrax, July 8, 1892, exposed to daylight since July 23, 1892," was
subcutaneously injected into a white mouse. The mouse died within
2 days 17 hours ; the body exhibited much oedema; the spleen was
slightly enlarged, and anthrax bacilli were found in           both by the  it,
microscope   and  by gelatine cultivation.
   The porcelain-filtered Loch Katrine water was, therefore, fully virulent
more than three months after infection with anthrax.
   Again, if we turn to Table XIV, in which the results with the
steam -sterilised Loch Katrine water are recorded, we find that the
multiplication after four days      more pronounced than in Table XIII,
                                         is
and, again,      will be seen that the multiplication
                  it                                    markedly greater
                                                                      is

In the later examinations, after the temperature of the refrigerator
had been allowed          to rise to that          of the room (about 15° C.), the
numbers          in the incubator and             refrigerator flasks became more
equalised    ;    on the whole, the numbers were, at the final examination,
greater      in the refrigerator than in the incubator flasks, and this                      is
markedly the case also in those flasks which,                        from   July   23, 1892,
onwards, were exposed to diffused daylight.
  To test the virulence of the steam-sterilised   Loch Katrine water,
the following experiment    was made  —           :

teristic growth in gelatine cultivation.
  Thus, the steam-sterilised Loch Katrine water was highly virulent
more than three months after being infected with anthrax.
                               Conclusions        to   Part   I.
  The results obtained by me in the course of the above investigation
on the vitality and virulence of anthrax spores in potable water may
be summarised in the following statements —                   :
     Three distinct series of experiments were made, viz. —
    1.                                                                       :
    Series   I,  in which Thames water collected above Staines was used,
      and    a   very small number of anthrax germs introduced into the
         water (pp. 181—213).

240            Profs. Percy Franklaud and Marshall Ward.
    Series  II,  in which the same water was employed, but a much
       larger number of anthrax germs introduced (pp. 213 — 225).
    Series III, in which the water of Loch Katrine, taken as typical of
       a moorland supply, was employed, and a large number of anthrax
       germs introduced   (pp. 225 — 239).
    2. In all these three series of experiments the waters were infected
 with anthrax from an agar-agar cultivation of such age as to ensure
the abundant presence of spores, so that the investigation deals
exclusively with the vitality and virulence of sporiferous anthrax
bacilli (pp. 184, 213, 228).
    3. In the sterilised waters both of the Thames and Loch Katrine the
 sporiferous anthrax bacilli maintain themselves in practically undi
 minished numbers for long periods of time — many months. In nearly
 all cases, moreover, a distinct increase in the numbers was in the first
 instance observed, which was followed in those cases in which the
experiments were extended over a sufficiently prolonged period by a
 decline, which, however, in no case resulted in less than about one
 half of the original number of anthrax spores being left in the water
after seven months. In the sterile Loch Katrine waters the anthrax
 spores after upwards of three months were still two or three times
 as numerous as in the first instance ; indeed, there was more dis
tinct evidence of multiplication in the sterile Loch Katrine waters
 than in either of the two series of Thames water experiments (pp.
 200—204, 219—225, 232—235, 238, 239).
    As far as any difference could be established between the beha
 viour of the anthrax spores in these sterile waters at winter
    —
 (4 10° C.) and summer (18° C.) temperatures respectively, the
 balance of     evidence was on the whole in favour of the numbers
 being longer maintained at the low than at the high temperature,
 although the preliminary increase took place more rapidly at the
 high temperature and was earlier followed by the subsequent decline
 (pp. 204, 224, 238).
    Practically no difference could    be established between the beha
 viour of the anthrax germs in water sterilised by steam and by
filtration through porous porcelain respectively ; in the case of the
 Loch Katrine water there was indeed some evidence of the steam-
 sterilised water being more favourable to the anthrax spores than
 that which had been filtered through porcelain (pp. 201 — 203,
 220—223, 232—234).
    No effect could be traced to the influence of diffused daylight on
 the behaviour of the anthrax spores in these sterile waters, the
 numbers in daylight and in darkness being practically the same
 (pp. 204—206, 208, 221, 223, 233, 235).
    On the other hand, direct sunshine exerted a most marked effect,

                  Report   on the Bacteriology    of Water.              241
for after 56 hours' insolation the number of anthrax spores was
greatly diminished, and after 84 hours' exposure to solar radiation
the presence of anthrax was no longer demonstrable by cultivation
at all (pp. 209—213).
   As regards the virulence of the anthrax in the sterilised waters of the
Thames and Loch Katrine, the experiments which I have performed on
mice conclusively prove that this is maintained over long periods of
time — many months. In no single instance did the injection of 1 c.c.
of these waters fail to kill the mouse, although the anthrax spores
had been in the Thames water for upwards of seven months, and for
upwards of three months in that of Loch Katrine. There is, however,
unmistakable evidence of the rapidity of the lethal action of the
anthrax depending on the number of spores present in the water.
Thus in the First Series of Thames water experiments, in which only
a small number of anthrax spores were present, the porcelain-filtered
water was fatal in 4 days 17 hours, the steam-sterilised water which
had been exposed to daylight was also fatal in 4 days 17 hours, and
the porcelain-filtered water similarly exposed to daylight killed the
mouse in 6 days 20| hours ; on the other hand, in the Second Series of
Thames water experiments, in which a much larger number of
anthrax spores were present in the water, the porcelain-filtered was
fatal in 2 days 5 hours, and the steam-sterilised in 2 days 21 hours ;
and again in the case of the Loch Katrine water, in which a still
larger number of anthrax spores were present at the time of the ex
periment, the porcelain-filtered killed in 2 days 17 hours, and the
steam- sterilised in 1 day 20 hours (pp. 204—206, 224, 225, 239).
    Of the sterilised Thames waters exposed to direct sunshine, neither
the porcelain-filtered nor the steam-sterilised was fatal to mice, nor
could their virulence       be revived    by the addition of broth    to the
water (pp. 209, 212).
   4.  In  the unsterilised Thames water, both of the      First and Second
Series of experiments, the anthrax spores were indeed found to be
still present in a vital state after many months, but in greatly
diminished numbers, and thus furnishing the most'striking contrast
to their behaviour in the same water when sterilised either by steam
or by porcelain filtration.
    In  the unsterilised    Thames    water of the   First Series of experi
ments, anthrax was only just discoverable by the special method of
cultivation which I devised for the purpose (see p. 185) 4 months
after infection, so that it must have undergone great diminution in
numbers during this period (pp. 195, 196, 198, 199).
    This diminution in the number of anthrax spores was further
established by the experiments on animals.           Thus, when mice were
subcutaneonsly injected      with  1 c.c. of these unsterilised waters of the
 First Series, 7 months after the anthrax spores had been introduced,

   2-12         Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
  the mice were not killed. That some few living anthrax spores were,
  however, still present in the water was proved by adding some broth
  to the water, which led to such a multiplication of the anthrax, that
  in the course of a few days the water thus treated became fatal on in
  jection into mice. It is worthy of note in this connexion that one
  only of the unsterilised Thames waters (First Series) proved fatal
  without broth being added, and that this water had been filtered
  through Swedish paper before its infection with anthrax, so that
  it approached to some extent in its character the sterilised waters
  (pp. 193—194, 197, 200).
      In the case of the unsterilised Thames water again it appears, as far
  as the evidence goes, that the anthrax     spores are better preserved in
  the water at the winter than at the summer temperature (pp. 193, 197).
      Daylight again appeared to be slightly nnfavourable to the preser
  vation of anthrax, the indications in this direction being more
  marked in the case of the First than in the Second Series of Thames
  water experiments (pp. 205, 218).
      Sunlight. on the other hand, was most pronounced in its deleterious
 effect on the'anthrax spores in the unsterilised Thames water.          In
 the unfiltered water they were no longer discoverable by cultivation
 after 84 hours' sunshine, whilst in the paper-filtered water there were
 still    a few present after 92 hours, but all had disappeared after
 151     hours' insolation.  These waters also which had been thus ex
 posed to direct sunshine proved innocuous to mice, nor could their
 virulence be resuscitated by the addition of broth, clearly showing
 that the anthrax spores had perished to the last individual (pp.
 209—212).
      It is especially noteworthy in connexion with these results that they
 establish the remarkable fact that the anthrax spores, when immersed
 in water, are less prejudically affected by sunlight than when im
 mersed in any of the ordinary culture materials*.        Thus, it has been
 shown by a number of observers that the anthrax spores suspended
in broth and other culture materials are generally destroyed in the
course of a few hours' exposure to sunshine, whilst in the above
experiments the anthrax spores immersed in Thames water, both
sterile and unsterile, resisted an insolation of upwards of 56 hours.
This remarkable contrast between the behaviour of the anthrax spores
in an aqneous and a nutrient medium respectively is also in accord
ance with the previous observations of Straus and of Mamont, who
both,      however,   appear to have experimented     with distilled water
only     (pp. 212, 213).
     In the unsterilised Thames water experiments of the Second Series,
the conditions were different, inasmuch as the water was in the first
instance infected with a much larger number of sporiferons anthrax
bacilli. On this account, although a great diminution in the number

                 Report on  the Bacteriology of Water.               243
had taken    place during the seven months' residence in the water, yet
sufficient remained even then to be discoverable by cultivation, and
to prove fatal to mice when 1 c.c. of the water was subcutaneonsly
injected into them. Only in one instance did a mouse remain alive
after receiving such an injection, and on repeating the experiment,
the second mouse injected with the same water duly died of anthrax
(pp. 214—219).
   5. In the unsterilised Loch Katrine water, the behaviour of the
anthrax spores was particularly remarkable.      At the commencement
of the experiment there were about 5000 anthrax germs and 500
other micro-organisms per cubic centimetre.     These micro-organisms
underwent, as was to be anticipated, very large multiplication,
especially in that portion of the water which was kept at a summer
temperature.     Fourteen days after the commencement of the experi
ment cultivation still showed the anthrax to be abundant, but their
number was markedly greater in that portion of the water which had
been kept at winter than in that kept at summer temperature (p. 229).
    On re-examination 3 months after the beginning of the experi
ment, the anthrax was absolutely undiscoverable by cultivation in
the water kept at summer temperature, whilst it was still present in
considerable, although greatly diminished numbers, in the water
which had been kept at the lower temperature (p. 230).
    The same difference was observed ir respect of virulence also, for
in every case mice injected with the low temperature water died of
anthrax, whilst those which received the same quantity of the higher
temperature water remained alive. Indeed it was not until broth
was added to this water kept at summer temperature that, of two
flasks so treated, the one became virulent, whilst the other still
remained innocuous (pp. 236 — 238).
    It should be mentioned also that in this Loch Katrine water kept
at the higher temperature (18° C.) the ordinary water bacteria
became very much diminished in number after the preliminary multi
plication referred to above (pp. 226, 227).
    This remarkable bactericidal power of the unsterilised Loch Katrine
water kept at 18° C. is doubtless due to the elaboration by the water
bacteria of toxic products from the peaty organic matter present in
this water, which products cause the destruction either of the spores
 or of the bacilli into which the anthrax spores will at this tempera
 ture gradually germinate. Moreover, the difference in this respect
 between the Thames water and that of Loch Katrine is to be sought
 for in the different nature of the organic matter present in these
 waters. The analyses show that quantitatively the organic matter (as
 measured by organic carbon and nitrogen) in both waters is almost
 exactly the same, but qualitatively they are very different, that in the
 Loch Katrine water being much less oxidised than that in Thames

water, as measured by the oxygen which they respectively absorb from
permanganate.      This doubtless means that the Loch Katrine organic
matter has hitherto been a comparative stranger to bacterial life,
whilst the organic matter of the Thames has been more fully ex
ploited by the micro-organisms       which are more abundant in its
waters. It is evident, however, that the Loch Katrine organic matter
per se is not possessed of bactericidal powers at the higher tempera
ture, for in the sterilised Loch Katrine waters at that temperature the
anthrax spores underwent no such destruction (pp. 182, 227, 232
—235, 238).

      anthracis in Water."          By Professor Marshall Ward, D.Sc.,
      F.R.S., assisted by G. E. Cartwright Wood, M.D., B.Sc.*
    It is obvious that some of the questions raised in our Report can
  only he settled by experimenting directly with the freshly collected
 water, and, since we selected a definite type of Thames water for our
 work, it was necessary to determine the main points in the natural
 history of this water itself, and to employ it directly for cultures.
    Some of the principal results are submitted as follows :—
     Bacteriological Examination        of the Thames Water    in its Natural
                                      Condition.
                                    Preliminary.
    On January 21, 1892, three samples of Thames water were sub
 mitted to examination immediately after collection, to obtain an
 answer to the question, Does the Thames water selected for inquiry
 contain bacteria at the moment of collection P
   Plate cultures were made in the usual way, by dropping known
 quantities, so many drops from a pipette containing 1 c.c., and
 known to emit so many drops per 1 c.c., of the water into gelatine
 melted  at  30° C.
   Sample     I  gave the following results : —
   (a.) 1-drop plates incubated         5 days at 15° C. (drop = Ttj c.c.) gave
            an average of 2 colonies per plate = 46 bacteria per 1 c.c.
   (6.) 3-drop plates in 7 days gave an average of 8 colonies per
            plate = 61 bacteria per 1 c.c.
   (c.) 9-drop plates in 5 days gave an average of 8 colonies per
            plate = 10 bacteria per 1 c.c.
   So far,   it was clear that the river water contains           some bacteria,
10 to 61 per c.c., which       develop on gelatine.     These were of     several
kinds,   and    developed    at  different   rates, and  pure cultures    of the
different forms were isolated for future reference, as it was            part of
our object to familiarise ourselves with the normal bacterial            flora of
the  river.
   Samples      II  and  III  were    similarly examined, and with similar
resultB,  which    need  not be detailed here.

     In all  cases the Thames    water experimented with contains an appre
  ciable, but not necessarily large, number of living bacteria, capable if
 germination and growth on gelatine plates.          As will be seen later on,
 the above numbers are very small, no doubt owing to the low
 temperature of the water, and the promptuess of the cultures direct
 from the river ; moreover, the number per 1 c.c., as shown by gelatine
 plate-cultures, is to a great extent dependent on the temperature of
 incubations.
                                     Series A.
     In this series of experiments          I confined my attention to the
 numbers     of  bacteria actually present in the Thames water when col
 lected.     The method followed was the usual one of carefully collect
 ing   the  samples in sterile flasks, or occasionally in sterilised vacuum
 tubes drawn to a point which is broken under the water by forceps :
 these    being heated and the glass point re-sealed in          a  spirit lamp at
 the   river itself.
     In no case given was the water allowed to stand more than a
 couple of hours or so, and then at low temperatures, and in some
 cases (employed as checks on the others) the plates were actually
 made within half an hour of collecting.
     The method of making the plates was also the well-known one,
 and     does not need description       here ; 1  employed round or square
 Petri's dishes in all cases.
     Examples illustrating the results of these examinations are given
in Table A.
     Table A shows very clearly that the number of bacteria actually
present in the Thames water at the moment of collecting is not large, tor
an open river, though differences appear to exist in June as con
trasted with March and December as regards the numbers.                       I do
not propose to go into these differences at present, however, since
they are not striking, but it is worth noting that the experience of
previous observers favours the supposition that monthly differences
in the total number of bacteria of rivers are to be expected.*
     Of course the point could only be decided by continuous observa
tion, which I think should be carried out.                  It is, perhaps, not
without interest to note that, so far as my few observations on this
point go, they bear out the conclusions of Miquel,! that there are
more bacteria in the river in March than in June, and more in Decem
ber than in either of these months, a fact probably correlated with
the surface drainage and rain washings.               I repeat, however, that

my observations on this particular point are only by the way, and
much too few for any valuable conclusions on the wider question.
   As regards the species or forms met with, I defer their discus
sion for the present ; suffice it to say that we carefully isolated and
tabulated the different forms in order to experiment with them
afterwards (see p. 285), and that a considerable number of the indi
viduals    (not species) were rapidly liquefying forms,    rendering the
keeping of the plates difficult.
                                  Series B.
    This series, part of a more extensive set of experiments to be
referred to later, is calculated to show the kind of changes as regards
the number of normal water bacteria, undergone by the river- water
on standing.      It should be regarded, therefore, as supplementing the
results in the last table.
    In each case the same procedure was adopted, and of course the
same care in collecting the samples and making the plates, &c.
    The collected water was placed in properly sterilised and plugged
flasks, and allowed to stand, at the temperature given, undisturbed
for a number of days.
    Plates were made forthwith to determine the initial numbers of
bacteria per 1 c.c. of the water, and then samples taken every twenty-
four or forty-eight hours, for several days, to determine whether any,
or what, increase or decrease in the total numbers had occurred in
the interval.
    It was to be expected, from the publications of others and from
our own experience, that such increase would occur, and my pre
liminary experiments showed that in this case the increase is very
great.     Consequently we had to take precautions against having our
plates too over-crowded with colonies, and this we did by adding
 pure distilled water to each sample taken for analysis in such quanti
ties that the bacteria in 1 c.c. of the original water were distributed
 through 20 c.c., and making the plates from the diluted sample.
    It is true this method involves the risk of killing some of the
bacteria ; but the results show that the numbers obtained are very
 large, nevertheless.
    It is also true that the dilution method introduces a further source
 of error in compelling us to multiply the ascertained result — always
 a dangerous process in statistics.     However, we have been unable to
 see any way out of this difficulty,      and have relied rather on the
 general results expressed in the tables than on the actual numbers,
 which   it is evident must be looked upon as approximations   only.

                   Report on  the Bacteriology  of Water.              251
    If  we take the average numbers in the ninth column of Tables B (I)
and    B (II), it is clear that a very rapid rise in the numbers occurred
during the first twenty-four hours, and continues during the second
day, and even to the third or fifth, and then comes a fall, slight at
first, and then rapid.      Now, without insisting too closely on the
numbers — indeed, we expressly desire to emphasize the fact that they
can ouly be more or less approximate, from the nature of the case — it
is  interesting to note how closely the general result compares with
the experience of other observers,     working with the waters of rivers,
Ac.,   in other parts of the world.    For the   sake of this general com
parison,    I append our own averages and those of one or two other
workers in the annexed tabular resume, where the averages are taken
in round numbers as approximations.

                 Report   on the Bacteriology  of Water.              253
Experiments   to test the Influence of Temperature on the Changes under
       gone by the Normal Bacteria of Standing Thames Water.
  To determine whether the effect of temperature        on the increase of
the bacteria   of standing Thames water is very marked, the experi
ments summarised in Table x were carried out.
   Two 1-litre flasks of the water were collected and at once carefully
analysed, with the result that the Thames water collected on De
cember 10 contained, on the average, 1065 bacteria per 1 c.c.
   The flasks were then placed in the dark,    one at 12° C., the other at
20° 0., and examined periodically,     with the results tabulated.
   The column of remarks sufficiently denotes the behaviour noticed.

  The results    seem to show conclusively             that   the maximum          number is
not only higher at the higher temperature, but that it is attained more
rapidly. That this is, at least in part, due to the bacteria being enabled
to multiply and diffuse themselves through the liquid more rapidly,
before the available oxygen and food materials are diminished, seems
an obvious conclusion ; though               I
                                   do not believe that these factors
alone explain the phenomenon.
Experiments with the Vegetative Bacilli of Anthrax in Thames Water.
   It is necessary to know, if possible, whether the living vegetative
bacilli of anthrax can survive immersion in such waters as we have
experimented with, and then to see if they can multiply therein :
that spores can withstand such immersion has long been known, and
we gave very full particulars on this point in our First Report,* but
the evidence regarding the vegetative bacilli is somewhat conflicting,
and consequently I have devoted attention especially to this point.
The difficulties are decidedly great. In the first place it is not easy
to obtain spore-free bacilli, and it will be objected that in some of the
following cases it is not certain that my material was absolutely spore-
free ; this cannot be gainsaid, but it can at least be claimed from the
experiments that, while they do not absolutely settle the question
 whether the vegetative bacilli can or cannot multiply in Thames
 water, they do show that, if such bacilli obtain access to the water
and form spores in           it,
                         they are very tenacious of life and difficult to
exterminate.
                                        Preliminary.
   On January 28, 1892, a sterilised J-litre flask was charged with
25 c.c. of Thames water, fresh from the river, and inoculated with a
large charge of a potato cultivation of a normal anthrax grown at
16° C., and devoid of spores, so far as could be ascertained.      We
employed a potato culture in order to introduce as little nitrogenous
food material as possible into the water, and chose a tube grown at                       a
relatively low temperature (16" C.) to try and prevent the precocious
development of spores.
   Five |-  litre flasks were then charged each with 25 c.c. of                          the
freshly-collected Thames water, and inoculated each with  c.c. of              1         the
above  infecting fluid. The flasks were marked A, B,   D, and E.       C,
   Flask A was selected for periodic examination, to obtain     pre                  a
liminary answer to the question, Can Bacillus anthrads maintain
itself alive at all in Thames water       Pipettes were selected to
                                                   ?
 drop 25 drops to the  c.c.    1
   After standing 24 hours at 20° C., we made                   a   series of plates (on
               * See   -
                           Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 51, 1892, pp. 219 and 268.

                   Report on the Bacteriology        of Water.             257
January 29) with       1, 3,  and 9 drops each respectively,      and examined
next day.      The annexed example is selected.
          1-drop plate =     5  colonies = 125 per     1 c.c. No anthrax.
          3      „       =   67     ,,      = 558     „             „
          9                  260    „       =  720    „
    This seemed to show that the vegetative bacilli rapidly disappear from
the water, a result apparently in accordance with the experience of
several previous observers.
    A   liquefying bacillus was common on the plates, however, and
prevented our keeping them long enough to determine whether
anthrax was really absent, or merely slower in development than the
rest of the organisms.
    A new set of plates were made from Flask A on January 30, i.e.,
the flask having stood 48 hours at 20° C.
               1-drop plate    =   107 colonies    = 2675 per  1 c.c.,
while plates with 3 and 9 drops respectively liquefied so rapidly
that we could make no determinations of the numbers.
    No anthrax colonies were found to develop in the time, and
similar results were obtained next day, the flask having then stood
 72 hours
             The 1-drop plate = 320 colonies = 7900 per 1 c.c.
    On February     2, the flask having       stood 110 hours, a further set of
 plates were prepared, but the colonies developed were so numerous
 that we could not estimate them. On some of the plates, however,
 very small anthrax colonies appeared, and even in relatively large
 numbers.      On the whole, this preliminary examination convinced us
 that such plates may fail to show anthrax colonies, because the
normal      water bacteria present develop so rapidly, and in -such
 abundance, that the anthrax has no chance, especially if bad liquefy
 ing forms are present.         They also showed us that the water forms
 increase in numbers, day by day, as the water stands.
    As our further experiments show, the conclusion that the anthrax
 died in these flasks is quite unwarranted ; its persistence was due to the
formation of spores ; but at the stage here reached that was a ques
 tion to be inquired into.
                                       Series B'.
    This series was also designed to see whether virulent normal anthrax
 was capable of living as bacilli, and multiplying in the Thames water,
 either untouched or rendered sterile by filtration through porcelain
 or by heat, or if it passes over into spores in the water.             In this
 series we boiled the Thames water for two hours.

258         Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall        Ward.
  The anthrax employed was a very virulent one, and known as
" Edinburgh Cow A," grown on agar for thirty hoars at 30° C.
Eight flasks were used, and divided into four pairs ; each flask re
ceived 25 c.c. of the water to be examined, and a large charge of
anthrax — 1 c.c. of the infecting fluid, which contained chiefly, if not
entirely, bacilli.
  Two flasks were charged with the Thames water in its crnde state,
and not infected at all.
   Two were charged similarly with the crude water forthwith infected
with anthrax.
  Two were charged with the Thames water forthwith filtered
through porcelain, and at once infected.
   Two were charged with the boiled Thames water infected at once
on cooling.
   All stood at 20° C. in the dark.
   In order to meet any such objection as that the original water
possibly contained the spores of anthrax, we proceeded as follows : —
   On June 27, the flasks having stood for seven days, we took samples
of the original raw (non-infected) Thames water, and heated them
at 60° C. for twenty-four hours.    Plates made from this gave no signs
of anthrax colonies.    We also inoculated a guinea-pig with 1 c.c. of
the raw water (not sterilised) injected into the peritoneum;         this
animal lived uninjured, whereas a guinea-pig inoculated with 1 c.c.
of the raw water infected with anthrax died in thirty-six hours, and
cover glass preparations and cultures made from the organs proved
that it died normally of anthrax.

   Table a shows very clearly how the anthrax rapidly falls in
quantity during the first three days, whereas the normal aquatic
flora takes the lead and runs through the usual phases of rapid rise
to a maximum and then an eventual fall.    I have not included their
further behaviour here, however, because it was impossible to trace
the anthrax any longer on  the plates.
   On June 27, we heated   a sample of the water — having then stood
seven days at 20° C. — at  60" C. for twenty-four hours, and made a
series of plates from it.   With the exception of one or two water
organisms on one of the plates, we obtained beautifully pure cultures
of anthrax, proving beyond doubt that spores had been introduced or
formed in the flasks. This was confirmed by inoculating a guinea-pig.

                   Report on   the Bacteriology of Water.             263
    If we  compare Table a with Tables b and c, there is a striking con
trast as regards the maintenance of the anthrax colonies on the plates.
This is no doubt largely dne to the removal of the water organisms,
enabling us to connt the anthrax colonies so much more readily; but
I do not believe it is solely due to that cause. It seemed much more
likely — and a comparison of these tables with those of Series C ap
peared to bear out the probability — that the competition of the water
organisms really affects the anthrax more directly, partly owing to the
former taking what organic food materials there are, and so starving
the anthrax, and partly owing to the rapid de- oxygenation of the water
by the competing forms.       As will be shown later, these normal water
bacteria are aSrobic in a very high degree, as we have convinced
ourselves by actual experiments ; and we have been surprised, there
fore, at these results in the raw Thames water.        As will be seen in
the sequel, however, the behaviour of the organisms towards one
another cannot be predicted (see pp. 290 — 298).
    There is one point in connection with the boiled Thames water
cultures (Table c) which seems worth further investigation : it is the
remarkable retardation of growth exhibited on some of the plates
after the first tweoty-foar hours. It seems by no means unlikely
that the explanation is due to two causes : —
    (1) The boiled water has been so far de-oxygenated that the living
bacilli fall off, and only those which can pass into the spore condition
 maintain themselves, and as it takes longer to get cultures from the
 spores than from the actively vegetating bacilli, this might well
 explain the retardation seen on the plates.
     (2) It may also be, however, that boiling the water renders many
 of the organic food substances less available for the growth of
 anthrax, and thus a partial starvation concurs in the fall.
     Or (3) it may be due simply to osmotic phenomena consequent on
 immersion in the water.
     In any case it seems worth while to note the apparently more
 rapid fall in the numbers in the boiled as contrasted with the filtered
 water, in the first forty-eight hours, though we think the matter
 would need a special inquiry to make certain of the phenomenon.
                                   Series 0.
     This series of experiments was designed to secure answers to the
 following questions : — Do the bacilli of the anthrax live and multiply
 in Thames    water at all, apart from any persistence of the spores ? It
 so, is there any difference in their behaviour in the crude water, taken
 fresh from the river, with all its normal bacteria flora and other im
 parities, and in the same water deprived of the aquatic microbes by
 filtration through porcelain, or sterilised by boiling ? And, further,

       "  anthrax, known to be less deadly to animals, though still
 capable of forming spores if the right conditions are offered, in any
 respects, and in any or all of the waters ?
    The virulent anthrax employed was obtained from Ediubnrgh (and
 recorded as Cow No. 3), and was proved to be fatal to rabbits in
 two days) ; the attenuated anthrax also came from Ediuburgh (Cow
 No. 1), and took five days to kill a rabbit.
    The experiments detailed in the following tables, C (I) to C (VI),
 were arranged as follows : —
    I. Four flasks, two of a litre capacity, and two of half a litre each,
 were filled with the crude Thames water, brought fresh from the river,
and infected forthwith with anthrax : one pair of flasks receiving
strong anthrax, the other weak anthrax : plate cultures were made
at once, and on eacb succeeding day, the flasks standing in an
incubator at 20 — 22° C., the whole time.
   II. Four similar flasks were filled with the Thames water, same
collection, filtered forthwith through porcelain (Chamberland filter),
and proved to be free from aquatic bacteria, and duplicate pairs
treated in exactly the same way.
   III. Four similar flasks were filled with the Thames water, same
collection, and treated exactly as before, excepting that the water was
sterilised by heating in a steam steriliser to 100° C. for two hours.
   rV. Finally, four similar flasks were filled with the raw Thames
water, exactly as in set I, excepting that no anthrax was added, as
we wished to determine by daily plate culture how the water
organisms of the normal water behaved apart from the anthrax.
    As regards the incubation and future care, &c., all the 16 flasks
were treated alike, and the conditions of comparison are, therefore,
the same.
   The infecting fluid   was   obtained as follows in each case : — Clean
sowings were taken from an active agar culture, then shaken up with
sterile distilled water, and some of the dilute sowing spread on
potato (in tubes) and incubated for 24 hours at 30° C.
   This gave vigorous vegetative cultures, free from spores, as we
satisfied ourselves by placing samples at 60° C. for 18 hoars, and
then making plate cultures, and we then proceeded as follows : —
   The potato cultures were broken down in sterile distilled water,
care being taken to introduce          as little potato as possible, and
charges of this placed in the flasks.     Of each pair of flasks infected,
one received     four times as much as the other; the charge is re
ferred   to in the tables as " large," or " small," accordingly. It may
here be stated that in those cases where experience showed us that
large numbers of colonies were to be expected on the plates, we nsed

                  Report on   the Bacteriology     of Water.              265
not  only small  doses of the liquid to  be tested, e.g.,   1 or 3 drops from
.  pipette discharging   25 drops to     the  1   c.c., but also diluted the
liquid with sterile distilled water, e.g., 1 :  4, or 1 : 9, &c., facts which
we bring out duly in the tables.
   To those critics who would remark on the dangers of the " dilu
              " above referred to, I would
tion method                                       reply in two ways : (1) it
is the only practicable method available for getting over the difficulty
of plates so densely crowded with colonies that no attempt at count
ing (or estimating) is possible ; and (2) it certainly does not lead to
exaggeration of the numbers of colonies, but in the contrary direction,
and, therefore, the final numbers obtained are more likely to be below
than above the truth.
   As a matter of experience, I am, in fact, more and more assured
that the whole procedure of gelatine plate cultivation leads to under
estimation rather than to over-estimation, and this is obviously a
fault on the better side of exactuess, since we have to be content with
approximations.     Nevertheless, great care has to be taken in all
stages of manipulation, and the more so because it is always neces
sary to  multiply out the final results.
   The results of the daily examination of the non-infected flasks show
the usual rise to a maximum, and then fall in the numbers of normal
aquatic organisms existing in the Thames water.                I now pass to
the results obtained with weak and strong anthrax respectively, in
the crude Thames water, i.e., without filtering or sterilising in any
way, Tables C (I) and C (II).

    Here we see, on examining Table C (I), in spite of unavoidable
imperfections in the observations, due to the difficulties of counting
and of observing when liquefaction                 commences, that both the
anthrax and the water organisms may run a similar coarse as regards
the first few days ; in both cases the climax is rapidly reached (about
the third day) and then a decline sets in. But it is worth notice
that even after seven days' standing the anthrax is not eliminated,
and we were so struck with the importance of this phenomenon
that I decided to employ further tests to see if this persistence
was really dne to the continued vegetation of the anthrax or to
the development of spores.
    I was driven to suspect spores by several facts. In the first place
Strauss and Dubarry have shown* that anthrax can form spores
after being placed in water, provided the temperature is not too low
(20° C.) ; secondly, we noted in some plates that the anthrax colo
nies were hanging back, so to speak, in their development, and it
seemed     not unlikely that this was due to time being needed for
the germination of spores.
    To test this point we placed a few cubic centimetres from one
of the flasks of this group on April 7, i.e., eight days after the last
culture, for 24 hours at 60u C., and, before heating the liquid,
inoculated a guinea-pig and a mouse with a trace of it.
    Both guinea-pig and mouse were dead on April 9, i.e., after 48
hours, and that their death was due to anthrax was proved by find
ing the bacilli in the blood of the heart, and by obtaining pure
cultures therefrom.
    The water heated to 60° G. for 24 hours gave pure cultures of
anthrax also, showing conclusively that spores had been formed in
the water.       These cultures also justify the conclusion that aquatic
normal forms did not develop spores, unless we assume that their
spores are less resistent to moderately high temperatures.                    With
out laying too much stress on the numbers, therefore,                       I think
Table C (I) shows that while Bacillus anthracis can only live vege-
 tatively and maintain its hold for about three days in the crude
 Thames water at 20° C., it can form spores there which enable it to
 live for a longer period,t and 1 conclude not that the competing
 water forms destroy the bacilli, but that the decrease of anthrax on the
plates is due partly to its passing into the spore condition, and to the
    • See our First Report, p. 268.
    t We  shall show later on that these spores can remain alive for several months,
a result well established by previous observers.   Duclaux, for instance, found that
there were spores still alive in some of Pasteur's old flasks which had been kept
for twenly-one or twenty-two years, and showed that in those flasks where they had
 died it was probably owing to the acid or alkaline reaction of the media.      (See
 De Bary, ' Lectures on Bacteria,' 1887, p. 54.)

                  Report          on the   Bacteriology of Water.         273
aquatic forms developing so rapidly, and some of them so quickh< liquefy
ing the gelatine, that even when plenty of anthrax exists on the plates
the latter are rendered useless before they can be got to develop visible
colonies.
   On comparing Tables C (III) and C (IV) the result comes out
that both weak and strong anthrax can hold their own for some time
in the filtered Thames water, and that this is not a mere case of their
lying passive and nnchanged in it ; indeed, without laying undue
stress on the actual numbers, the general result seems to he that this
schizomycete multiplies vegetatively under the conditions given, and
then passes over into spores. I say this seems to he the case ; but it
is much more likely that the apparent increase at first is due to the
breaking up of the bacilli into shorter rodlets, most of which die at last.
  That spores were really present we proved, as before, by sub
mitting samples of each of the waters to 60° C. for 24 hours, and
then cultivating plates from them ; the beautifully pure cultures of
 anthrax obtained showed clearly that spores had been formed.
  I  are aware of the criticism that the vegetative growth exhibited
by both the weak and strong anthrax was probably not entirely
at the expense of the organic materials already in the filtered Water,
but was no doubt in part due to small quantities of food materials
introdnced with the infecting material (and possibly in part also due
to substances derived from decomposing bacteria) ; but the reply is
(1) that the quantity of food materials introduced by our mode of
infection was very small, and (2) that it does not affect the practical
question much, because in nature such minimum fouling of the water
would be likely to occur when anthrax finds its way to the river.
Of course the criticism should be borne in mind, however, and our
experimental   results       do support the idea that anthrax can
                                   not
multiply vegetatively in waters containing only minimum traces of
food materials.
   If we compare Tables c (V) and c (VI) the fact again appears to
come out that the anthrax bacillus, whether strong or weak as regards
its virulence, behaves very like an ordinary water form when first
placed in Thames water sterilised by steam.      Here, again, the ex
planation given above no doubt applies.        Moreover, it is again
evident that, as time goes on, the plates need more incubating to
bring out the bacilli, and the numbers are then very large —      the
                                                                    cf.

events of the third day a fact which again raised our suspicions ns
to the development of spores.    As before, moreover, we tested this
suspicion by heating  sample
                         a    of each water to 60° C. for twenty-four
hours, and obtained pure cultures of anthrax therefrom.

                                      Series D.
    This series of experiments was designed to seek answers to the
following questions: — 1. Can an anthrax known to be incapable of
developing spores (asporogenous) maintain itself in the Thames water
side by side with other organisms, or in the same deprived of the
water forms by filtering through porcelain ?*                    2. Is there any
appreciable    difference   in behaviour    between   the  asporogenous    anthrax
and a virulent race      known   to  be capable   of developing spores     ?
    As matters turned out, we had to abandon the series in the middle,
                                                                     "
owing to the discovery that our so-called " asporogene was a very
much enfeebled form, but not utterly devoid of the sporogenous
power, t and partly owing to a mishap with the filtered series.                 We
select  some   of  the  results —  see  Tables  D  (I)  to  D (III) —  because  the
approximate numbers obtained are useful ; but we are engaged in
repeating the series with a more reliable culture of the "asporogenous
anthrax."
    The arrangement of the flasks, &c., was much as before. Four flasks
were filled with the crude Thames water, not infected, and examined
daily.     Four flasks were filled with the same collection of water,
and to these anthrax was added as follows: — Two received virulent
anthrax liquid in the proportion of 1 c.c. to every 25 c.c. of water;
and two received the same proportion of liquid through which
"                " anthrax was distributed.
   asporogene
    Finally four similar flasks were filled with the water (same batch),
filtered forthwith through a Chamberland porcelain filter, and infected
exactly as the last. The virulent anthrax came from an agar cul
ture, growing well at 30° C. for 24 hours, and in excellent condition,
The " asporogene " anthrax was also growing vigorously on agar
under the same conditions.            In each case the infecting liquid was
made by evenly distributing quantities of the anthrax, as equal as
possible in quantity and as free from agar as we could remove it from
the tubes, in sterile distilled water.         It will be noticed that all the
plates were made with a dilution of 20 times as much water as corre
sponded to the original infected liquid. As before, the plates were
made daily for a week, and the numbers given in the columns
depend on several countings.
    * We decided not to use the water sterilised by heat in this series, in order to
reduce the number of flasks and plates which it would entail.
   f  The asporogenous anthrax employed was not the spontaneous natural form,

    On comparing the Tables D (I) and D (II), we see that the
water forms pass through the usual stages of rapid rise in numbers
during the first two or three days, followed by a relapse to fewer
and fewer ; but it is suggestive that the enfeebled
                                                             " asporogene "
anthrax seemed        to disappear more rapidly from the plates —
Table D (II).       This rapid disappearance did not occur where the
water was sterilised by filtration, however, as Table D (III) shows,
and    I was for some time inclined to attribute this to the influence
of the normal aquatic bacteria.        It may still turn out to be so, but
my experiments on p. 290 do not support the idea, and our confidence
                                         "             " anthrax used, I do
being shaken in the character of the asporogene
not press the point, but hope to raise the question in another form at
a later date.
    The evidence goes to show, then, that Bacillus anthracis, while only
 capable of living for a short time in the Thames water in the vegetative
state, is able to persist very much longer  in the form of spores.
          Bacteriological Examination   of some Old Culture Flasks.
     On October 6, it was decided to analyse the contents of five flasks,
 selected from a series which had been put aside for this purpose on
 the 5th March previous.        The analysis of these five flasks is very
 interesting.
     The flasks were labelled A, B, B', C, and D, and had been treated
 in various ways, as described below.
     A was a litre flask, which on March 5 had been charged with about
 600 c.c. of fresh Thames water, inoculated with a comparatively large
 dose (10 c.c.) of the same water, in which a vigorous potato culture
 of anthrax had been shaken up.          The culture used was known to
 contain spores, and a good deal of starch had also been carried over.
     The flask stood during the whole of the period (spring and summer)
  unier a glass bell-jar, on a table near a north window, and received
  no direct sunlight, but ordinary bright daylight every day.
     It was occasionally opened (the cotton-wool plug being carefully
 and quickly removed and replaced each time), to remove samples for
  analysis.
     The temperature rarely fell below 12° C., or rose beyond 15° C., and
  a slight growth of green microscopic algae made its appearance during
  the summer.
     On October 6 cultures were made (1) direct from the flask (2)
  from same after exposure to 56° C. for 24 hours.
     The direct cultures on gelatine gave plenty of bacteria, &c., but if
  any anthrax was there it was overwhelmed by the alien forms, or
  would not grow.
     The cultures, after exposure at 56° C., gave no results on gelatine,
  but animals inoculated with 2 c.c. died in five days of anthrax.

                    Report on the  Bacteriology of Water.                279
     The results  (see Table  F) showed that spores had remained alive
  for seven months in the flask, and though enfeebled they were capable
 of germinating and killing.
     Flask B, March 5 to October 6, 1892.— B was also a 1-litre flask,
 filled with about 500 c.c. Thames water, and inoculated with 8 c.c.
 of the anthrax infection.
     Kept in the open laboratory.     Cotton-wool plug.       Under bell-jar.
At east window. Partial insolation in mornings. Temperature varied
from 12°to 20° C.
     After being thus undisturbed    till October 6—»<«., seven months —
the     plates showed no anthrax,      though numerous other (water)
 bacteria were present.
     A guinea pig inoculated with 2 c.c. of the water did not die in
fourteen days.
     Cultures from plates of the water, after exposure at 56° for twenty-
four hours, showed no anthrax.
     This result shows either (1) insolation killed off the spores, or
 (2) the temperature was not high enough for spores to form.            That
the first suggestion is the right one will be shown in the sequel.
     Flash B', March 5 to October 6, 1892.— 1-litre flask of Thames
water exactly like B, and inoculated in the same way.
     The only difference in treatment was that B' was placed at 20° C.
in the incubator, and remained two months at that temperature ;
then, still in incubator, it was left through the summer in the dark, at
the same temperature as B.
     Plates on October 6 (i.e., seven months later) gave no anthrax,
either from water direct or after twenty-four hours at 56° C. Any
anthrax-like colonies turned out to be saprophytes.
     Nevertheless a guinea pig inoculated with 2 c.c. of the water died
in three days, and cultures of anthrax were made from the heart.
     Suggests that spores developed well, and kept well, but that they
were either too few or too feeble to be easily detected on gelatine.
     Flask C, March 5 to October 6, 1892.— 1-litre flask filled with Thames
water and boiled for half an hour, and then inoculated with 2 c.c.
 (therefore water organisms introduced), exactly as before.
     Kept at 20° C. for two months in dark incubator, then remained
(in same) for five months at ordinary temperatures.
     On October 6 plate cultures gave no anthrax, though other organ
isms were shown. After twenty-four hours at 56° O, plates also
gave no results ; but a guinea pig inoculated with 2 c.c. of the water
died in five days, and the heart's blood gave cultures of anthrax.
     Suggests that boiling the Thames water in no way hurts it as a
medium for anthrax to sporify in.
     Flask D, March 5 to October 6, 1892.— 1-litre flask filled with crude
Thames water, and not inoculated.
                                                                  u 2

280         Profs. Percy Franklaud and Marshall Ward.
   Kept in incubator   at 20° C. for two months, then (same place) at
ordinary temperature   for five months more.
  Plates gave no anthrax, either raw or after the water was at 56' C.
for twenty-four hours, yet other organisms were found.
   A guinea pig inoculated with 2 c.c. of the water lived.
   The experiment suggests that there was no anthrax in the original
Thames water, or it would have made itself evident during the
sojourn in the incubator.

                 Report   on the Bacteriology of Water.               283
    On October   26, 1892, we examined the contents      of a flask which
had stood since March 5, 1892, in a north window of the laboratory,
i.e., it had remained nearly eight months undisturbed, at ordinary
temperatures and in diffused daylight.
    This flask was an interesting one in many respects. When first
placed in position, on March 5, it had received a charge of about
300 c.c. of fresh Thames water, infected    with a very strong charge of
 virulent anthrax taken from a potato culture, but we discarded it at
the time because (1) the culture was found to contain so many
spores, and (2) so much of the starch of the potato had been trans
mitted with the charge that we judged it better to renew the experi
ments we were engaged in.
    During the summer the water in this flask became quite green
 with microscopic algae, evidently developed from the Thames water,
 and it seemed worth while on October 26 to test the water for
 anthrax, to see if the presence and activity of the algae had eliminated
 that organism.
    The positive results of the analysis are shown below in Table G.
 On several of the plates no anthrax could be found at all ; but in the
 two cases recorded in the table there was no doubt whatever.

    Two other facts are worth note in these analyses.              (1) The large
 n amber   of water organisms which had persisted through the seven
 to eight months, and (2) the total absence of rapidly liquefying
forms.
    It was already clearly proved then that the presence of the green
algse and the diffuse daylight had not exterminated                  the anthrax,
although      the  numbers     were   extremely    diminished,   for   on starting
the experiment        our flask contained something like 1,000,000 per
 1 ex., and more.
    To place the matter still further beyond doubt. however, we placed
 25 c.c. of the water at 56° C. for twenty-four hours, and obtained
1 anthrax colony in a 3-drop plate, and several plates with no trace
of anthrax ; then we got a 3-drop plate, among several with negative
results, showing 5 anthrax colonies, and finally a 12-drop              plate with
38 anthrax colonies.
    It was observed that in all these cultures the anthrax colonies
came on very         slowly, and had there been any liquefying bacteria
present, it is practically certain that we shonld have missed the
anthrax:    altogether.
    The conclusion is inevitable that although the anthrax had not
been eliminated       from this flask, it had been enormously diminished
in quantity, and enfeebled as regards the powers of germination of
the spores.
    This conclusion was made         a certainty   by the following test : — On
November 7 a guinea-pig was inoculated intra-peritoneally with
2^ c.c.* of the water in the flask ; at first we thought it had escaped,
bat it died on November 17.               Cultures from the heart's blood
proved that it had died of anthrax ; but it took ten days for the
feeble and few spores to do the        work.
    The chief interest attaching to this series of experiments, however,
is the proof that insolation rapidly rids the water of the spores of an
thrax.     I shall show later on that this is not only a very definite
action, but one capable of being more directly and easily demon
strated than has hitherto been suspected.f
     Experimental      Observations  on the Bacterial   Flora of   the Thames.
    As already pointed out (p. 244),         I have devoted considerable        at
tention    to the normal      aquatic bacteria of the river water, isolating
each form for       farther   culture as it turned up in the coarse of the
   * This large dose was given because we found so few spores, and these apparently
Terr much enfeebled.

the literature dealing with the action of light on bacteria.   See also pp. 303 and
310 of this Report.

investigation.       Indeed, some of the first questions           I  set myself were
the following:      —   (1.) What Schizomycetes are ordinarily found in
the water?        (2.) Are any of them pathogenic? (3.) Does Bacillus
anthracis occur in the Thames ? And (4) how do the aquatic forms
behave in cultures ?
    Our preliminary examinations showed that several forms of Schizo
mycetes can be distinguished as common in the water, while here and
there a yeast and a mould have been met with.                        I shall defer the
consideration of all the other forms, with the exception                    of the one
treated below.
    Of these several forms we have been strongly impressed with the
characters of some, while others have shown such slight individuality
that it is difficult to be sure of their autonomy.
    Of the well marked forms, one very common one is particularly
characterised by its rapid growth and liquefaction of the gelatine,
 with a greenish hue and slightly putrid odour. This form is very
like one of the forms known as Bacterium termo, and separated by
 Mace as Bacillus termo.*              For some time we thought this was the
 species referred to, but prolonged and careful isolations and cultures
 have shown quite clearly that it is the form described by Fltigge
 under the very descriptive name of Bacillus fluorescens liquefaciens.^
     It occurs on the gelatine plates at all ordinary temperatures up to
 20° C., as minute, greyish- white points, which rapidly enlarge to
 circles, and soon begin to liquefy, so that the colony lies at the base
 of a perfectly circular concave depression as a granular flocculent
 mass with a tinge of green, and with irregular radiations or net
 works into the liquefied circular area.
     In from twenty-four to forty-eight hours the area of liquefaction
 extends very rapidly — in forty-eight hours at 12 — 15° C. the colonies
 were each as big as a shilling — and soon floods the plate with a
  slightly malodorous slimy fluid, of a pale emerald-green hue, with
 a very distinct fluorescent shimmer.
     Such colonies consist of very short fine rods, often with a slight
 constriction,     or in couples, and then difficult to distinguish from
 chains of cocci, from 2 to 3-5 fi long by 0*5 to 0"8 fi broad (measured
 after staining in Spiller's purple and mounting in Canada balsam) ;
 in no case have we found filaments or spores in the gelatine cultures.
     If transferred to gelatine tubes, the same depression, rapid lique
 faction,   and green fluorescence are observed at 12°, 15°, and 20° C. ;
 and   if the culture is made as a " stab," a very characteristic series of
 events follow. The liquefaction of the gelatine proceeds so as to
                                                     " in
 form a funnel, very like a " thistle-head                 shape, and the flocculent

                                                                   (more
12 — 15°   C.),      thin, wet-looking, or almost waxy, greenish-white
                   as a
layer, becoming thicker eventually, and very smooth and glassy, and
tinging the subjacent agar with the characteristic hue. Here and
there longer rods can be found in agar cultures, but no trace of spore
formation could bo discovered either on this or any other medium.
   On potato the colonies are brownish-yellow, becoming deeper with
age, and often with a raised, rough, granular surface, moist or oily in
appearance.     On all the solid media the fact that this bacillus is
strictly aerobic comes out very strongly.       Its growth is at once in
hibited if a sterilised glass cover slip is placed over the young colony :
the liquid rapidly fills up all the interspaces, and no air can enter,
and growth stops at once. Moreover, if a " stab " culture is carefully
 made and covered with gelatine, the same inhibition is noticed.
    The marked and rapid disappearance of this form from water
 which is kept standing in a closed vessel is almost certainly to be
attributed to the same cause.
    We have made numerous attempts to cultivate this form in hang
 ing drops of gelatine, and with success, but there are no special
 points to notice : the rods divide very rapidly, and never grow out into
 long filaments or form spores in the moist chambers. It is impossible
 to cultivate it under a cover slip in compressed gelatine.
    Milk is rendered slightly acid by the bacillus, and coagulation and
 peptonisation follow.
    The slimy, green, fluorescent liquid presents several interesting
 features.   Slight quantities of acid— hydrochloric or acetic — cause
 the green colour to disappear ; but neutralisation with ammonia at
 once restores it, and an excess of the alkali deepens the hue. The
 colour is not destroyed by boiling, though, if prolonged, the green
 hue becomes distinctly paler. This agrees exactly with Mace's
account of        it,
                 and     no doubt strong confirmatory evidence as to the
                           is
correctuess of our identification of the Schizomycete.
   The annexed table summarises the character of this Schizomycete.

    If we now   attempt to discover this form among the species recorded
in Eiseuberg, Mace, and Ronx, there appear to be only the following
to choose from as the known liquefying forms which produce the
characteristic green fluorescence in gelatine, or which possess any
green    pigment     at all :* — Bacillus fluorescens liquefaciens (Fliigge),
B. fluorescens liquefaciens minutissimus (Unna), B. fluoresceins nivalis
 (Schmolck), B. viscosus (Frankland), and B. termo (Duj. and Mace).
We will also notice B. aerophilus (Libor.) and B. chlorinus (Engelm.)
as being accompanied by a green colour in the cultures.                We may ac
once eliminate B. chlorinus, however, because, according to Engel-
mann's description (he called it Bacterium chlorinum), the green
colouring matter is in the cells, and these are much too large for our
form. The same applies to "Van Tieghem's Bacillus viridis and B.
virens, and we are not concerned here with the discussion as to the
chlorophyll nature of the colour or the claims of these forms to be
regarded as Schizomycetes at all.
    B. aerophilus may also be readily eliminated, for, apart from the
large size of its filaments, it grows very slowly, and does not colour
 the gelatine ; its green colour is confined to the colonies.
    B. flvorescens liquefaciens (Fliigge) presents startling points of
 similarity with our form.
    It agrees in habitat, water and air, &c., as well as in the mean size
 and union of the rodlets, and is motile.
    The colonies on gelatine plates are, like our form, round and de
 pressed in funnel form, and the very regular clear zone of liquefaction
 is characteristic, as also the mode of liquefaction and fluorescence.
    On agar, too, according to Mace, the growths are quite similar,
 while the very marked aerobian character and rapid growth are also
 alike.
    In short. we find no important differences between the descrip
 tions, and therefore regard this form as identical with Flugge's B.
fluorescens liquefaciens.
    B. fluorescens liquefaciens minutissimus (Unna), whether a good
 species or not, presents sufficient differences to separate it from ours.
 Apart from its habitat, the feeble fluorescence and capacity for grow
 ing anaiirobically wonld seem to separate it.
    B. fluorescens nivalis (Schmolck) is a form found in the glacier
 waters of Norway, and reminds one forcibly of B. fluorescens lique
faciens.     The information to hand is too meagre to enable us to
 decide.
     B. viscosus (Frankland) is possibly eliminated by the characters of
  the colonies, if the author's description of the radiating hair-like
  marginal growths is characteristic.           Nor does the size quite agree,
  though the discrepancies could hardly be insisted upon. In other

respects, however (e.g., as regards habitat and mode of liquefaction,
&c.)> there are suggestive resemblances, and Mace regards it a6
identical with B. fluorescent liquefaciens.
     Bacillus termo is the name given by Mace to a form which he sepa
rated from the mixture which previously passed under the name of
Bacterium termo (Dujardin), and it presents several impressive simi
larities to our form.
     It is very common in water, and has the size and shape and modes
of union and movement observed. In fact almost the only serious
discrepancy we find as regards the habit of the two forms is that ours
                                               "
has not the peculiar wavy or "amoeboid           contour of Mace's form.
     As will readily be understood, the critical examination of these
water bacteria is a matter of time, and requires much care ; neverthe
 less,  I regard it as of great importance to the object we have in view,
 and propose now to give an example of one of the lines of inquiry
 which ought to be pursued as closely as possible, and which can only
 be properly pursued when the separate water organisms have been
 thoroughly     studied.
     Experiments on the Behaviour of Anthrax sown simultaneously with
                      B. fluorescens liquefaciens in Water.
      For many reasons, and especially because thjs is a common water
  form, perhaps the commonest Schizomycete in the Thames, it seemed
  worth while to try the effect of sowing Bacillus anthracis and this
  B. fluorescens liquefaciens together in the same water. The following
  experiments were accordingly carried out : —
      A litre flask was filled about three-quarters full (700 c.c.) of
  sterilised distilled water and plugged with cotton wool, and the whole
  carefully sterilised and allowed to cool, and a very dense sowing of
  a mixture of active anthrax and of B. fluorescens put into the water.
  The sowing was accomplished as follows : — 10 platinum loops full of
  a vigorous two-day agar culture of anthrax were rubbed into a sterile
  test-tube with 1 c.c. of sterilised distilled water ; then 10 loops of a
   B. fluorescens culture as equal as possible were treated in the same
   way in another tube, and the contents of the two tubes mixed and
   shaken thoroughly.       1 c.c. of this mixture was finally put into the
   700 c.c. of the sterilised distilled water and thoroughly mixed by
   shaking.    The flask was then placed in the dark incubator at 20° C.
   Every effort was made to introduce as little of the culture media
   (agar) as possible, and to sow approximately equal quantities of each
   Schizomycete, though of course it was impossible to attain these
   objects completely.      Then plate cultures were made day after day —
   starting with one made directly on sowing the bacteria — to see what,
   if any, effect the straggle for existence would present.
      The results are shown in the annexed table : —

     On carefully going over this table, which illustrates very clearly
the results of the struggle for existence between the two organisms,
it is evident (1) that both the anthrax and the Bacillus fluorescein
                                                      —
liquefaciens fall off in numbers day after day for it cannot be urged
that the doubtful high number found on the sixth day invalidates the
general results — and (2) that the anthrax persists simply because it
passes into the spore condition.
     To make this last point quite certain, we heated a few c.c. of the
 water to 54° C. for twenty-four hours, and then made new plates, with
 the expected result : there were anthrax spores present.
     Possibly the third inference to be drawn from this experiment ia
 the most interesting of all, viz., that anthrax can hx>ld its own in dis
 tilled water at 20° C, iti the dark, not only in spile of the presence of
 B. fluorescens, but (owing to its power of forming spores) it may even
 tire out and exterminate      the latter, because it cannot   form    spores in  the
 water.
     These results show with startling clearness how cautious we must
 be in forming any opinions about the mutual relations between any
 two bacteria, or, indeed, beteeen any two organisms whatever.                   The
 whole subject is a matter of biological experiment, and cannot be pre
 dicted on any other grounds than those of actual experiment.                   It is
  very commonly supposed         that  a  saprophyte   like  B.  fluorescens lique
faciens must be able to drive out a parasite like B. anthracis if the
  latter invades the territory of the former ; the above experiment
  shows that such is by no means the case under the conditions
  afforded, and we ought to be very cautious indeed in surmising what
  will occur under other conditions of the same general kind.
      In view of the facts above recorded, it seemed advisable to test the
  question in another way, and we did this as follows : —
      A  sterilised glass cylindor, A, receives a porcelain filter, B, also
  sterilised, and held in position and protected from dust, &c., by a
  covering and plug of sterilised cotton wool, C, and a paper cap.
  After final sterilisation, the cylinders received about 300 c.c. of
  Thames water, sterilised by filtration through porcelain.                  Bacillus
 fluorescens     liquefaciens was  sown   in the water   inside   the  filter B, and
  anthrax in the water outside the porcelain. Since experiments showed
   that the green fluorescing liquid of the former passes readily through
   such a filter, and that the excretions made by anthrax do the same,
   it was hoped that this apparatus would help to answer the question,
   Do either of these bacilli poison the water for the other ?
       The results, after twenty-four days' incubation at 20° C. in the
   dark, proved that both the organisms were still alive, the anthrax
   being chiefly or entirely in the form of spores.                On heating the
   whole apparatus up to 56° C. for twelve hours, the plates showed
   total absence of B. liquefacuns fluorescens — proving that it developed

no spores — while anthrax        was present after this treatment      to the extent
of  many thousands     per   cubic centimetre of the liquid.
    Clearly, therefore, the anthrax is not poisoned off by the secretions
of B. fluoresceins liquefaciens.
   These results suggested the following simple experiment : —
    Four sets of test-tubes, properly prepared, were arranged as fol
lows : —
    One set (A) received a charge of the green fluorescing liquid ob
tained by allowing Bacillus fluorescens to thoroughly liquefy gelatine,
the charge being simply filtered at ordinary temperatures through
sterilised filter paper ; this merely holds back the large flocculent
masses of the Schizomycete, and allows numerous isolated ones to
pass.
   Set B received an exactly similar charge, but was then put into
;i beaker of water kept boiling for fifteen
                                                   minutes.
   A third set (C) was charged with equal quantities of ordinary
nutrient gelatine and of the above green liquid.

   The fourth set (D) was prepared exactly as C, bnt kept in boiling
water for fifteen minutes.
   When all were ready, and the heated tubes had cooled to 25 — 20° C.
just sufficient to solidify the gelatine, a large loopful of anthrax spores
was placed in each tube, and all four sets put into the dark incubator
at 20° C.
   The results were less satisfactory, as regards sharpness, than we
hoped, but it was clear that the spores of anthrax were still there,
and alive in all the tubes, after three weeks.
   Finally, the following careful set of experiments were made : —
   A quantity of Thames water, collected on the morning of December
10, was at once filtered through a Chamberland porcelain tube at
low pressure, the whole apparatus having been very carefully steril
ised.    Control experiments showed that this sample of water was
almost entirely devoid of water organisms.
   Two similar flasks were prepared, and into these 1 litre of the
above water was distributed after the water had been infected as
follows : —
   To the 1 litre of filtered water 1 c.c. of a liquefied gelatine culture
of anthrax, consisting almost entirely of rodlets and filaments, but
partly of spores, and 1 c.c. of a similar liquid culture of B. fluorescens
liquefaciens were added, and thoroughly shaken up.
   Each charged flask was then placed in the dark, one at 12° C., the
other at 20° C., and plates made daily, as shown in Table y, which
summarises the results.

Report on the Bacteriology of Water. 297
298          Profs. Percy Franklanil and Marshall Ward.
   The table shows conclusively that the anthrax     was not exterminated,
even after eighteen   days at either temperature.
   On January    3, the flask kept at 20° C. was heated to 56° C. for
twelve hours, and plates made. These plates, after three days' in
cubation at 20° C., showed that anthrax was still present to the
extent of from 110 to 230 per 1 c.c. of the water in the flask.
   If the numbers in Tables x, p. 254, and y, p. 295, are put in the form
of curves, the ordinates representing the numbers of bacteria, we find
in all cases that there is a large and rapid rise to a maximum during
the first four days ; the climax may be reached during the second
day, or the third or fourth, but it is always relatively high, and
usually soon reached.      Then follows an equally rapid fall during the
next twenty-four to forty-eight hours, succeeded by a slower one.
    It is interesting to note that the mixed Bacillus anthracis and
B. fluorescens liquefaciens behave very similarly as a whole at the
lower temperature, 12° C., which is not favourable to the anthrax ;
but at the higher temperature of 20° C. it looks as if disturbances of
 various kinds occur which lead to a very different and irregular
 curve.
    It seems almost certain that temperature is not the only factor       at
 work here, for, although its effects are very distinct, as shown        by
comparing     Tables   x, y, and  z, there   must be other   circumstances
 concurring to account for the very different       heights of the curves,
 and times taken to reach this maximum.
    The extreme rapidity of the main ascent, when once it begins,
 suggests that a moment arrives when the ferment actions which
 must be supposed to render the food materials available are at their
 best ; if this is so, the sudden fall may well be due to two causes —
 (1) the exhaustion of the available oxygen, and (2) that of the food
 materials themselves.
     The actual height of the maximum — i.e., the numbers of bacteria
 then sustained by the medium — may well be supposed to depend on
 a number of factors, e.g., the quantity of food materials, especially
 organic, present in the water, the number of bacteria in the water at
 the outset, and, of course, the nature of both, being amongst the most
 important of these.
     Obviously the whole subject is extremely complex, but we are in
 clined to think that valuable information could be got by extensive
 comparative examinations at constant temperatures of waters of
 known chemical composition infected with definite quantities of two
 known    organisms, the behaviour of which should       be studied at in
 tervals of twelve hours if possible.

            Experiments with Oxygenated       (Aerated) Thames       Water.
   In   order to test the action of combined movement and aeration, we
employed the following means : — A flask of 1£ litre capacity, and
with a side arm tubulure, was half filled with the water to be
experimented       on, and its neck fitted with a caoutchouc stopper
through which passed a long, narrow glass tube ; the lower end of
the tube was drawn to a point and passed to the bottom of the flask ;
the upper end was curved back on itself and carefully packed with
successive plugs of sterilised cotton wool, and the end covered with a
large tuft of the same. Preliminary trials convinced us that if this
apparatus is properly sterilised, and carefully used, air may be
drawn through the cotton-wool filter for two or three weeks without
contamination of the contents. The accompanying figure represents
the apparatus.
A,  lateral tubuluro plugged with cotton wool and attached to pumn : B, curved
      tube plugged at intervals with cotton wool to filter air which passes into
      liquid below ; C, large wad of cotton wool, tied on to air tube at D ; E, water
      containing bacteria to be experimented with.
    In   the following series of experiments, one flask was aerated in the
 manner described for six days, and an exactly similar flask kept
 standing quietly by its side under exactly similar conditions other
 wise.     Both flasks contained Thames water, from the same collection,

 and placed in action within a' few hours of its removal from the river.
 The temperature of the room was 15 — 16° C., and remarkably con
 stant day and night. The flasks were exposed to diffused daylight.
 and occasionally to the light of a Swan lamp.
    After the six days the two flasks showed the following results on
 bacteriological analysis by means of gelatine plate cultures, using 1,
 3, and 6 drops per plate, and diluting with 10 vols, sterile water to
 1 vol. from flask.      The numbers given are the calculated averages,
 and   it is possible that more extended observations would, perhaps,
 alter them slightly.

    It must be remembered that in such experiments as these, the rapid
development of the liquefying organisms is always the chief trouble,
since we cannot allow the plates to incubate long enough to bring
forward all the liquefying forms, on the one hand, while the lique
faction overpowers the young non-liquefying colonies on the other :
consequently we lay no stress on the last column.
   As regards the direct effect of the aeration, we believe the third
column does express it more or less accurately, though of course the
reply is always possible that we have no absolute guarantee that no
aerial forms were filtered into the flask.
   We propose to extend this inquiry at a later period, and merely
put forward our results so far as tentative, and by no means devoid
of interest and suggestiveness.
   We next resolved to extend the comparison between aerated and
non-aerated cultures to flasks of Thames water treated exactly as in
the foregoing series except that we first infected both flasks with
anthrax.
   We employed a gelatine culture of the anthrax, selecting a tube of
rapid growth, and in which the gelatine was completely liquefied,
and nsed a relatively very large quantity (5 c.c. to the litre of water)
and of course a correspondingly large quantity of gelatine food-
material.      This was done purposely, in this first experiment, to en

 competing water forms.
   The results are again expressed in calculated averages, in the
following table. As before, the aeration was conducted for six days
at 15 — 16° C, a temperature at which the spores can germinate.

   Here it must be admitted that we failed in our attempt to as
certain any effects of the aeration on the anthrax as compared
with the water organisms.
   We, meanwhile, altered the course of the inquiry as follows : — Each
flask, aerated and non-aerated, was placed, at the end of the six days,
as soon as the samples had been removed for plate cultures, at 60° C.
for twenty-four hours, and plates then made to ascertain, if possible,
what had happened to the anthrax- — i.e., to see if spores had been
formed, and to what extent in the two cases.
   The following table summarises the results : —

   So far as the quantitative results go, we regard the experiments
here summarised as failures, because no stress whatever may be laid
on the actual numbers until we have made a larger series on these
comparative lines.
   We do think, however, that the results are valuable                       in another

sense   ;  for they show quite clearly that (1) the oxygenation and
movement of the water for six days in diffused light does not sensibly
reduce the anthrax if it passes into the spore stage, and (2) does not
by any means eliminate the element of a straggle with normal water
forms.
    We regard the subject as well worth more exact study, and espe
cially along lines to determine more accurately the relative direct
effects on the various organisms         in the water.
    The following series was designed as a continuation of this
inquiry.
     One litre of fresh Thames water was infected with 5 c.c. of a
gelatine culture of virulent anthrax, the culture being one day old,
and distributed into three flasks A, B, and C, in equal quantities.
The flask A was aerated, as before, B stood quietly by its side : these
two flasks were exposed to ordinary diffused daylight, while C stood
quiet in a south window, exposed to what sunlight could fall on it in
November.
     At the outset, we examined the infected water, and found the
proportions of organisms as follows : — Water organisms = from 370
 to 450 per 1 c.c., and anthrax from 150,000 upwards per 1 c.c.
     After seven days, our examination gave the following results,
tabulated as averages          : —

 samples of each flask at 60° C. for twenty-four hours, and made plates
 again, with the following results : —

    Here, again, we abstain from dwelling too much on the quantitative
results, though, so far as they go, they suggest that aeration favours
the sporification or preservation of the anthrax, while insolation —
even feeble — tends to destroy the spores.             But the positive qualitative
result is obvious, that the anthrax if it passes over into the spore
stage in these waters becomes, thereby, to a great extent removed
from the direct competition with the water organisms.
          Experiments on the Action of Light on Bacillus anthracis.
    It is abundantly evinced by experiments that direct insolation
 in some way leads to the destruction of spores of Bacillus anthracis,
 and in so far the results merely confirm what had already been dis
 covered by Downes and Blunt in 1877 and 1878.*
    From the fact that an apparent retardation of the development of
 the colonies on plates exposed to light was observed several times
 under circumstances which suggested a direct inhibitory action of even
 ordinary day-light, the author went further into this particular question
with results as startling as they are important, for if the explanation
 given of the phenomena observed in the following experiments turns
 out to be the correct one, wo stand face to face with the fact that by
 far the most potent factor in the purification of the air and rivers of
 bacteria is the sun-light. The fact that direct sun-light is efficacious
 as a bactericide has been long suspected, but put forward very vaguely
 in most cases.
    Starting from the observation that a test-tube, or small flask, con
 taining a few c.c. of Thames water with many hundreds of thousands
 of anthrax spores in it may be entirely rid of living spores by con
 tinued exposure daily for a few days to the light of the sun, first
 shown for water by Straus (' Soc. de Biologie,' 1886, p. 473), and that,
 even a few weeks of bright summer day-light — not direct insolation
 — reduces the number of spores capable of development on gelatine,

 it  seemed    worth while to try the effect of direct insolation on plate-
 cultures,    to see if the results could be got more quickly and
 definitely.*
     Preliminary trials "with gelatine plate-cultures at the end of the
 summer soon showed that precautions of several kinds were necessary.
 The direct exposure of an ordinary plate-culture to the full light of even
 a September or October sun, especially in the afternoon, usually leads
 at once to the tunning and liquefaction of the gelatine, and although
the exposed plates eventually showed fewer anthrax colonies than
 similar plates not exposed, the matter was too complicated to give
 satisfactory results.      Obviously one objection was that the spores
 might have begun to germinate, and the young colonies killed by the
 high temperatures.
     Experiments      made in October with gelatine plates wrapped in
 black paper, in which a figure — a square, cross, or letter — was cut,
 also led to results too indefinite for satisfaction, although it was clear
 in  some cases    that if the plates lay quite flat, the illuminated area
 was on the whole clear of colonies, while that part of the plate
covered by the paper was full of colonies.
    But another source of vexation arose. After the plates had been
 exposed to the sunlight for, say, six hours, it was necessary to put
them in the incubator (20 — 22° C. was the temperature used) for
two days or so, to develop the colonies, and in many cases it was
observed that by the time the colonies were sufficiently far advanced
to show up clearly, liquefaction had extended so far as to render the
figure blurred and doubtful.
    Stencil plates of zinc were employed with, at first, equally un
certain results.      The stencil plate was fixed to the bottom of the plate
culture, outside, and every other part covered with blackened paper :
the plate was then placed on a level surface, the stencil-covered face
upward, and exposed to the direct sunlight.                 As before, the gelatine
softened and in many cases ran, and the results were uncertain,
though not altogether discouraging.
    In November it was found that more definite results                      could  be
obtained, and the problem was at last solved.
    Meanwhile it had already been found possible to obtain sun prints
in the following way with agar plates. Ordinary agar was heated
and allowed to cool to between 50° and 60° C., and was then richly in
fected with anthrax spores, and made into plates as usual.                       Such
plates were then covered with a stencil plate on the lower face— the
stencil plate being therefore separated from the infected agar only
by the glass of the plate — and wrapped elsewhere closely in dull
   *  It appears that Buchncr (' Centr. f. Bakt.,' vol. 12, 1892) has already done this
for typhoid, and finds the direct rays of the summer sun quite effective.

black paper,   so that, on exposure to the sun, only the cut-out figure
or letter allowed the solar rays to reach the agar.
   Such plates were then exposed to the direct rays of the October
sun for from two to six hours; or they were placed on the ring of a
retort-stand,  stencil downwards, and the sun-light reflected upwards
from a plane mirror below.
   After the insolation, these plates were incubated for at least forty-
eight hours at 20° C., and on removing the wrappers the colonies of
anthrax were found densely covering all parts of the plate except the
area — a letter or cross, &c. — exposed to the sun-light.  There, how-
over, the spores were killed, and the agar remained perfectly clear,
showing the form of a sharp transparent letter, cross, &c., in a ground
work rendered cloudy and opaque by the innumerable colonies of
anthrax.
   Experiments proved that this was not due to high temperature,      for
a thermometer with its bulb next the insolated glass rarely          rose
beyond 14° to 16° C., and never beyond 18° C., and even if            the
thermometer did not record the temperature inside the plate,         this
can scarcely have been much higher.
   As long as this latter point remained      uncertain,  however,    the

experiments could not be regarded as satisfactory ; whence it was
necessary to again have recourse to gelatine cultures. The gelatine
employed began to run at 29° C., and in November it was found that
such plates exposed outside, either to directly incident sunshine, or
to directly reflected rays, showed a temperature of 12" to 13° C. at the
insolated glass surface, and even five to six hours' exposure caused no
running of the gelatine.
   The following experiment may be selected as a type of the rest : —
A (fig. 1) is the upright of an ordinary retort-stand; on the ring B
rested a gelatine plate-culture of anthrax spores, covered with black
paper everywhere except the cut-out letter E, seen on its lower face.
C was an ordinary plane microscope-mirror, with its arm fitted to a
cork on A.
   The whole was placed in the middle of a field at Cooper's        Hill  at
9.30 a.m. on Wednesday,        November 30, and exposed to the clear,
but low, sunshine which prevailed that day, the mirror being so
 arranged (from time to time as necessary) as to reflect the light on
the E the whole period, until 3.30 p.m., when the plate was removed
and placed in the dark incubator at 20° C. On the following Friday
 — i.e., after less than forty-eight hours' incubation — the letter E stood
out sharp and clearly transparent        from the faint grey of the rest of
                                    Fio.  2.

 the plate of gelatine.    Not a trace of anthrax could be found in the
  clear area, even with the microscope, while the grey and almost
  opaque appearance of the rest of the plate was due to innumerable
  colonies of that organism which had developed in the interval.
     It was impossible to incubate the plate longer for fear of liquefac
  tion, whence the sceptical may reply that the anthrax exposed to
  light was only retarded ; the experiments with agar show that such
 is not the case, however, and that if the insolation is complete the
spores are rendered incapable of germinating at all, as proved by
removing pieces of the clear agar or gelatine and attempting to
 make tube cultures from them : in all cases where insolation is com
plete they remain sterile.
     The chief value of these gelatine plate exposures in November,
however, is that they prove conclusively (1) that the rays of a winter
 sun are capable, even if reflected, of killing the spores, and (2) that
 it is really the solar rays which do this directly, and not any effect of
a higher temperature, since the gelatine remains solid throughout.
     Experience has shown, however, that some precautions are neces
 sary in selecting the anthrax cultures employed for these experiments
 with gelatine. The light certainly retards or kills (according to its
intensity or the length of exposure) virulent spores, but if one takes
the spores, mixed with vegetative bacilli, direct from a thoroughly
liquefied gelatine culture, or from a bouillon culture, the plates are
apt to be liquefied too rapidly for the proper development of the light
print, evidently because so much of the liquefying enzyme is carried
in when inoculating the plates. The same danger is run when active
bacilli alone are employed.
     The  best  method of avoiding these disadvantages has been found
to be the following, and it has the additional merit of enabling us to
prove, beyond all doubt, that the ripe spores of Bacillus anthracis are
reallyjinhibited or killed by sunlight.
    A few c.c. of sterile distilled water in a tube are thoroughly
saturated with the anthrax spores taken from an old culture which
has never been exposed to light, and the tube placed for twenty-four
hours at 56° C. ; this kills all immature spores, bacilli, and enzymes,
and leaves us with a crop of the most resistant and fully matured
virulent spores.
     Experiments with such spores have been made to determine the
relative power of the different rays of the spectrum to destroy the
anthrax.
    It is necessary to note first, however, that in experimenting with
the electric light, although but few exposures have been made as yet,
it is evident that its effects are feebler than those of the winter sun.
     At present it has only been possible to observe that the inhibiting
effects   are stronger at the blue end of the spectrum    than at the red,

and exposures to sunlight passing through coloured glasses confirm
this result ; but the observations are being continued in the hope of
getting a perfectly sharp record of the effects of each set of rays.
    The following series of experiments are quoted in detail, because
 they teach several details of importance, in addition to proving the
main fact.
    On December        7 three gelatine plates and five agar plates wen'
prepared with spores from a very vigorous and virulent agar tube of
anthrax.      The spores, which were quite mature, were not subjected
to heat, but simply shaken in sterile water to wash and separate them
thoroughly.
    The three gelatino plates were made at 35° C., the agar plates at
60° C-, neither of -which temperatures could injure the ripe spores.
    The three gelatine plates were labelled pi, p2, and p3, and the
agar plates p 4 to p 8 in order.
    Immediately after making the plates, all were exposed to the
December sun, except plates p 4, p 5, and p 6, and this was done as
follows : — In each case the plate had a stencil plate with a cut-out
letter on its lower face, and arranged as described above (p. 304).
    pi, a gelatine plate with a large letter M, was exposed, face down,
to the light reflected from a mirror (see fig. 1) for three hours on
December 7, and for four hours on December 8, the interval being
passed in a cold room (< about 8 — 9° C.), and then incubated at 20°
in the dark.
    p 8 was treated in exactly the same manner. But this was an
agar plate with a large W.
    p 2, a gelatine plate with a large H, was exposed and treated in the
same way, except that no mirror was used, the latter being upwards
towards the sun.
    p 3, a gelatine plate   with a large B, was similarly exposed, face up,
but   a plane    mirror arranged to reflect light down upon it.
    p 7, an agar plate with a large E, was treated exactly as the last.
    There now remain the three agar plates, pi, p5, and p 6, to
account for.
    p 4 was placed forthwith in the dark incubator at 20° C.
    p 5 and p 6 were kept for eighteen hours in a drawer, the average
temperature of which is almost 16° C., and were not exposed till next
day (December 8), when they lay for five hours, face upwards, and
with a mirror above them, p 5 had a small E, and p6 a broad but
small    I, to let the light in.
    After exposure, these also were put in the     same incubator with the
others.
    Nothing was visible to the unaided eye on these plates (except p 4)
 until the 11th instant, though the microscope showed that germina
                                   '
 tion was proceeding on the 10th. The plate p4>, however, had a

                    Report on the Bacteriology  of Water.             309
distinct veil of colonies all over it on the 9th, and this had developed
to a dense typical growth by the 11th.
   On December 11, at 10 a.m., the state of affairs, as regards the
exposed plates, was as follows : —
   p 5 and p 6 showed each a sharp transparent letter— E and             I
respectively — of clear agar in a dull grey matrix of strong anthra2
colonies, which covered all the unexposed parts of the plate.
   p 1, p 2, and p 3 showed in each case a perfectly clear central patch,
about 1£ inches diameter, with anthrax colonies in the gelatine
around.      These anthrax colonies were the larger and more vigorous the
more distant they were from the clear centre.       In other words, the
anthrax spores had begun to germinate, and the colonies were
growing more vigorously, in centripetal order.
   On p 7 and p 8 germination was beginning, but the colonies were as
yet too young to enable one to judge of the results.
   The first point of interest is to account for the prononnced results
in the plates p 5 andp6, and the want of sharp outlines inpl,p2,
and p.3, and the explanation seems to be that, owing to the plates 5
and 6 having laid over night at 16° C., the spores began slowly to
germinate out, and were conse/pienlly in their most tender condition when
exposed to the sunlight next dny.
   The peculiar centripetal order of development of the colonies on
plates p 1, p2, and p 3 gave rise to the following attempt at explana
tion. After observing that the clear space in the middle was not due
to the centre of the plate being raised, and the infeeted gelatine
having run down to the periphery — a possible event with some batches
of Petrie's dishes — it was surmised that the large letters employed
might give     the clue.
   This was found to      be the case.   The solar rays on entering the
plate were largely reflected from the glass lid of the plates, and so
produced feebler insolution effects on parts of the plate around the
letter : these effects were naturally feebler and feebler towards the
margin, and so the inhibitory action became less pronounced at dis
tances further and further removed from the centre.         Those spores,
therefore, which were nearest the periphery germinated out first,
and those nearer the centre were retarded more and more in propor
tion to their proximity to the insolated letter.
   That this is the correct interpretation of the facts follows clearly
from the further behaviour of the above plates.
   At 10 p.m. on the 11th — i.e., twelve hours after the morning ex
amination — the plates pi, p'2, and p3 exhibited their respective
letters M, H, and B quite clearly, in the grey matiix of anthrax
which had rapidly developed in the interval, and excepting a slighs
want of sharpness in the 11 of p 2, the results could hardly have been
more satisfactory.

    In p   7  and p 8 the very      faint outlines of the letters were also
showing.
    On the 12th, at 8.30 a.m., the gelatine plates had begun to run, and
although the M of p 1 was still intact, and very well marked, p 2 had
liquefied completely, so that the H was a clear patch with blurred
outlines in the centres        p 3 still showed the outlines of the B, but it
was impossible to keep        it longer.
    The main point       was  definitely established, however, and the treat
ment of the plates proves conclusively that the spores are not killed
by high or low temperatures, but by the direct solar rays.
    These experiments are being continued in order to answer some
other questions in this connexion.
    The gelatine and agar after such exposures as have been described
are still capable of supporting a growth of B. anthracis if fresh spores
are sown on them, whence the effects described are not merely due to
the sub-strata being spoilt as food material.
    That the action of the light is direct on the spore, and not due to
any reaction from the medium,             I have recently shown by the follow
ing    new   method   : —
    A thin layer of dried spores only, spread on glass without food
materials, shows tho letter as in the experiments on pp. 305 — 306, if
a slab   of solidijied agar is placed    on the jilm  of spores after exposure, and
the whole      incubated;     whereas the reciprocal treatment — where the
agar alone is exposed, and then laid on a, film of spores — -yields negative
results, the spores germinate equally well all over.*
                               Conclusions   to  Part II.
    The following conclusions are to be drawn from the results of the
 experiments recorded in this Part          II  of the Report : —
     1. Thames water, like all open waters, contains a variable number
 of bacteria at all times (pp. 244 — 256).
     2. The actual numbers of these bacteria are not great, but compari
 sons show that there are more in the Thames in December than in
 March, and fewer still in June (pp. 246, 252, 254).
     3. There are no reasons for supposing any of these water bacteria
 to be pathogenic, and some of them have been recognised as known
 saprophytes (pp. 247, 280, 285—290).
     4. In agreement with the universal experience of those observers
     * This proof that the action of the light is direct on the spores is
                                                                          opposed to
  Roux's conclusions ('Ann. Inst. Pasteur,' 1887, pp. 445 — 452), and in support of
  those of Arloing ('Compt. Eend.,' vol. 104, 1887), and of Janowski (' Ontralbl.
  fur Baktcriol.,' 1890, Nos. 6— 8). These authors worked with less perfect method?,
  however, and Janowski's results concern typhoid only.          I  have given more
  txtensive results in the paper read to the Royal Society on February 16, 1893.

  who have attended to the question, we find these water bacteria to
 multiply with astounding rapidity         if the water is allowed to stand for
 a few days ; the maximum numbers are reached in from one to four
 days as a rule, and the curve itself is exceedingly steep and sharp
  (pp. 249— 256).
     5. Our observations go to show that the rapidity of increase and
 the maximum numbers           reached depend on various factors — tempera
 ture, oxygen supply, the amount and quality of the food materials in
 the water, and the nature and numbers of the bacteria concerned
 (pp.    254, 291, 295, 299—302).
     6.  We have experimented with the waters, chiefly of the Thames,
 in three conditions, viz. : — (1) fresh from the river and not subjected-
 to any treatment ; (2) deprived of all of the above bacteria by
 filtration through porous porcelain; and (3) sterilised by heat.-
 (4) Experiments have also been made with distilled water. We
 regard the four conditions of water referred to as essentially differentr
 one from another (pp. 259—263, 266—273, 275—278).
     7. We have employed such waters to test the power of resistance of
Bacillus anthracis (anthrax) both in the form of spores and of vege
 tative bacilli, and also in the asporogenous state (pp. 256 —         285).
     8. We have, moreover, employed the anthrax in a virulent and in
a weakened condition (pp. 266 — 273).
     9. And we have experimented under various conditions as regards-
(1) time, (2) temperature, (3) light, (4) the presence of other organ
 isms, with the following results briefly summarised : —
     10. Neither as spores nor as bacilli — weak or strong — is anthrax
killed forthwith in any of the waters under any of the conditions
tested     ;  but the spores     are   immensely     more resistant     than  the
bacilli (pp. 259—285).
     11.   In the dark,    and at moderate        temperatures,   the  spores of
anthrax retain their powers of germination and infection for many
months — we have proved up to eight months — in any of the waters
referred to (pp. 278—283).
     12. In direct sunlight, however, the spores in the waters undergo
rapid destruction, depending on the intensity of the insolation and
the time of exposure (pp. 279, 283, 303).
    13. That this destruction is directly due to the light-rays, espe
cially at the blue end of tho spectrum, and not to a rise ot temper--
atnre fatal to the spores, is definitely proved by the experiments
with gelatine and agar plates.           These experiments     also demonstrate
conclusively that the bactericidal action is really direct, and not dne
indirectly to the action of the solar rays on the medium (p. 310).
    14. The value of the experiments             on the bactericidal action 0f
direct sunlight on the spores of B. anthracis is the more important
when      it is reflected that the most decisive results have      been obtained

312          Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
by exposure to the rays of a winter sun (November and December), at
temperatures so low that no question of heat can come into considera
tion ; moreover, the experiments prove that the bacteria spores are
really killed, and not merely retarded (p. 307).
   15. That we have here an essential part of the explanation of
numerous phenomena cannot be doubted, e.g., the purity of shallow
running waters, and the steady diminution of bacteria from our rivers,
lakes, &c. ; while, conversely, the suspension of solid particles, ren
dering water turbid, may obviously react on their bacterial life by
intercepting the sun's rays.
   16. These experiments also suggest how necessary it is to conduct
all cultures of such bacteria in the dark ; and bring vividly before us
the importance of direct sunlight in our streets and dwellings, &c., and
in numerous circumstances of life.
   1 7. In no case have we succeeded in showing that Bacillus anthracis
multiplies to any considerable extent in the form of vegetative
bacilli in the above waters, unless appreciable quantities of organic
food materials are added and the temperature is raised to above
12° C.    So far as we can decide, the bacilli either die off in the
course of the first day or two, or, if the conditions are favourable,
they form spores (pp. 272 — 273).      I regard this question as to the
power  of the bacilli  to multiply  or  form spores in the water as the
most important from a hygienic point of view ; unfortunately it is
also by far the most difficult one to answer.
   18. Aeration and consequent disturbance of the water contain
ing anthrax does not destroy nor appreciably affect the latter
(pp. 299 — 302).    Nor does the presence of ordinary green Algae in
the standing  water   seem to affect         it,
                                          or, at any rate, not more than
can   be   explained   by   the   diffused     light   necessary for the   Algae
 (pp. 278—283).
    19. Experiments prove that anthrax by no means succumbs easily,
if  at all, in the struggle for existence with Bacillus fluorescens liqn<<-
faciens, one of the commonest of the Thames bacteria, and remarkable
 for its aiirobism and liquefying powers (pp. 290— 298).
    20. Whether the result will be the same with other bacteria
 selected for antagonism remains to be shown      several other Thames
                                                        ;
bacteria have been isolated, and are being studied in detail to the
end that their effects may be tested.

                                 Part III.
           Joint Conclusions arrived at by both Authors.
   After carefully comparing the results, we beg to submit to the
Committee the following conclusions at which we have arrived on
the subject of inquiry :—
   1. The waters both of the Thames and of Loch Katrine normally
contain a number of different forms of micro-organisms, some of
which have been isolated and described (pp. 178 — 180, 186 — 191,
244—246, 285).
   2. These bacteria are, as far as our comparisons have        been pur
sued, more numerous in the water of the Thames than            in that of
Loch Katrine, and the numbers in the Thames water at            least have-
been shown by us to be subject to well-marked seasonable       variations,
being usually much greater in winter than in summer (pp.        178 — 180,
246) . This relationship is probably due to the Thames water in dry
weather being to a large extent derived from springs, whilst after
rain, especially in winter, it receives considerable accessions of surface
water rich in bacterial life and the organic materials which promote the
growth and multiplication of micro-organisms (pp. 178 — 180, 225).
   3. Hitherto no pathogenic bacteria have been found in the Thames
water, either by other observers or ourselves (p. 258).
   4. In agreement with the universal experience of all observers
who have given attention to the subject, we have found that the
water   bacteria, both of the Thames and of Loch Katrine, multiply
with astounding rapidity when these waters are allowed to stand for
a few days, a maximum being rapidly reached, which is followed by a
corresponding, although less precipitate, decline (pp. 190, 191, 226,
 249, 254.)
    5. An adequate   explanation of this remarkable multiplication has
not yet been given, and is the more difficult to find, inasmuch as it
has been shown that the same phenomenon occurs in the case of
waters, like those of deep wells, which are almost wholly destitute
of organic matter.      Again, although oxygenation and a high tem
 perature undoubtedly accelerate this multiplication, it even takes
 place to a surprising extent at the low temperature of a refrigerator.
    6. We have experimented with the waters both of the Thames and
 Loch Katrine in the three following conditions : — (1) in their natural
 state as derived from the river and loch (p. 246); (2) sterilised, or
                                                               Y 2

 deprived of all their bacteria, by filtration through porous porcelain;
 and (3) sterilised by heat, 100° C. ; (4) experiments have also been
 made with distilled water. We regard these several conditions of
  the waters referred to as essentially different one from another (pp. 184,
  185, 213, 214, 228).
     7. Into such waters    we have introduced         the Bacillus anthracis
  (anthrax)  in the  form  of  (a)  vegetative   bacilli (pp. 256 — -278) ; (6)
                                 "                "
 spores (p. 278) ; (c) in the      asporogenous     variety (pp. 274 — 278) ;
 contrasting also the effect of using large and small quantities of this
 micro-organism, and of employing it in a virulent and an attenuated
 or weakened condition respectively (pp. 184, 213, 228).
    8. The principal factors to which we have devoted attention in
 these experiments have been (1) the temperature at which the
 infected waters were maintained ; (2) whether they were exposed to
 light or preserved in darkness ; (3) the presence or absence of other
 organisms besides anthrax in the waters (pp. 184, 214, 228; all ex
 periments were conducted in the dark, excepting when otherwise
 stated, 40, 45, 54, 57, 59, 67, 69, 71; 92, 119, 126—134).
    9. We will in the first instance call attention to the results which
 we have obtained in our experiments with these spores.
    We found that the behaviour of the spores was very different,
 according as they were introduced into the unsterilised or sterilised
 waters respectively (pp. 181 — 243).
    10. In the sterilised waters their behaviour was practically uni
 form, irrespectively of whether Thames or Loch Katrine water was
 employed, irrespectively of whether the water was sterilised by filtra
tion through porcelain or by steam, and also irrespectively of whether
 the waters were preserved at a summer temperature of 18 — 20° C.,
or in the refrigerator at 4—9° C. In all cases the spores retained
both their vitality and their virulence^ for many months.           After this
prolonged residence in these sterile waters, they were recognisable by
cultivation in either the same or in only slightly diminished numbers
from those in which they were originally introduced into these waters.
These infected sterile waters, after standing for upwards of seven
months, were also invariably fatal to the animals into which they
were inoculated (pp. 200, 219, 232, 234, 238).
    11. The same results      with these infected sterile waters were
obtained irrespectively of whether they were preserved in absolute
darkness or freely exposed to diffused daylight.             Direct sunshine,
on the other hand, was rapidly fatal to the anthrax spores in these
waters within 84 hours.     In the waters    bo insolated anthrax could not
be detected by    cultivation, and animals inoculated with these waters
remained alive.     But in order to make absolutely certain that the
anthrax spores were quite extinct in these insolated waters, we incu
bated them with some sterile broth, so that if only a single spore had

                  Report on  the Bacteriology of Water.              315
remained in the water it would have multiplied abundantlj ; hut the
waters, even after this treatment, proved innocuous to animals
 (pp. 209—212).
   12. The striking results ohtained by direct insolat'on at low tem
peratures in the open air in winter bring vividly before us the
extreme importance of this bactericidal action of direct sunlight, for
they show conclusively that the action is direct, and not due to any
rise of temperature from the heat rays (pp. 303 — 310). Other facts
and their consequences are given in the conclusions to Part II.
   13.  We found that when the spores were introduced even in very
large numbers into unsterilised waters in their natural condition, they
were often no longer recognisable by the ordinary cultivation methods
after the lapse of a few days, and it was only by resorting to special
methods of detection that the anthrax spores could be discovered. By
employing these special methods, however, we have conclusively
shown that the number of anthrax spores undergoes a continuous
decline in such unsterilised waters, and thus presents a marked con
trast to the persistence of the numbers in the sterile waters referred
to above. Notwithstanding this decline in the number of anthrax
spores, their presence could still be demonstrated many months after
their introduction into the Thames water, and this infected water
still retained its power of killing animals after upwards of seven
months (pp. 278 — 283), either by direct inoculation (when large num
bers of anthrax spores had been originally introduced) or after pre
liminary incubation with sterile broth (which had to be resorted to
when only a small number of anthrax spores was originally intro
duced, pp. 192—200, 214—219, 229—231, 236—238).
    In the case of the Thames water we found but little difference in
the result when the waters were kept at winter and summer tempera
tures respectively, but in the case of the Loch Katrine water a
marked difference was exhibited in this respect, for at the summer
temperature (18 — 20° C.) the anthrax spores underwent such rapid
degeneration that after three months they were no longer recognis
able by cultivation.    Moreover, the water kept at the summer tem
perature proved in every case to be no longer fatal to animals when
inoculated directly, and out of two such specimens of water which
had been specially incubated with broth for the purpose of revivifying
any lurking anthrax spores that might remain, only one became viru
lent, showing that in the other at least complete extinction of the
anthrax spores had taken place. It is suggested that this compara
tively rapid destruction of the anthrax spores in unsterilised Loch
 Katrine water at 18 — 20° C. is due to the elaboration of bactericidal
products by the water bacteria, and not to the character of the moor
land water itself, for in the sterile Loch Katrine water the destruction
of anthrax spores at this temperature did not take place (pp. 228 — 239).

 316          Profs. Percy Frankland and Marshall Ward.
    14. The results obtained with the anthrax spores in the un-
 storilised waters were not influenced by whether these waters were
 preserved in darkness or exposed to diffused daylight.       Exposed to
 direct sunshine, however, the anthrax spores were rapidly destroyed,
 not more rapidly, however, than in the sterilised waters under the
 same exposure (pp. 204 — 213).
    15. In experiments made in order to test the nature    of the conflict
 between anthrax and particular forms of water bacteria, the Bacillus
fluorescens  liquefaciens (Fliigge) was employed in pure cultivation
 along with anthrax in approximately equal proportions.      The results,
 however, show that this saprophyte, at any rate, has not the power of
 rapidly destroying the anthrax spores ; indeed, there was no evidence
 that either it, or its products, act prejudicially on anthrax spores at
 all (pp. 290—298).
    16. In connexion with the antagonistic interests of the anthrax on
 the one hand and the several kinds of water organisms on the other,
 it is worthy of note that in one experiment in which anthrax spores
 were introduced into unsterilised Thames water exposed freely to
 daylight, and in which in addition to water bacteria there was also
 present a quantity of small algae, the anthrax spores survived the
 conflict with these competing forms for upwards of seven months,
 although enormously reduced in numbers and much impaired in
 virulence (pp. 278, 283).
    17. To summarise our results with anthrax spores in one sentence,
 we may state generally that there is one natural agency at least
 which is capable of destroying    them in surface waters to which they
 may have gained access, viz., the action of direct sunshine on the
 organism.     Whether the activity of water bacteria may be added as
 a second bactericidal agent is not definitely determined, but, in any
 case, of these two influences the sunshine is by far the more rapid
 and the more potent, though its sphere may be much more re
 stricted.
    18. Behaviour of Anthrax Bacilli. — As regards the behaviour        of
 anthrax bacilli free from spores, it should be pointed out that we
 have only experimented with such spore-free bacilli obtained from
 artificial cultures, and not with those derived directly from the
 organs of an animal dead of anthrax.      We have in many cases found
 that the bacilli obtained from artificial cultures behave in essentially
 the same way when introduced into water as do the spores under the
 same circumstances, and apparently for the reason that the bacilli
 introduced rapidly produce spores in the water, and the subsequent
 phenomena thus become identical with those which we have already
 discussed above (pp. 260, 272, 278).
    19. Some of the evidence points to the possibility of the multiplica
 tion of the bacilli in waters containing more than the usual amouut

                  Report  on the Bacteriology of Water.                317
 of organic materials ; but in no case does it support the view that
Bacillus anthracis can live and multiply like a water bacterium in
ordinary waters (p. 273).
    20. As regards the behaviour of that variety of anthrax bacillus which
is known as " asporogene," and which is incapable of forming spores
under any known circumstances whatever, our experiments are not
yet sufficiently advanced to warrant any conclusions being drawn from
them at present (pp. 274 — 278). The great manipulative difficulties
of experiments with spore-free bacilli have already been pointed out,
and no one has, so far as we know, as yet, overcome them.
    In conclusion, we would point out that the chief hygienic interest
of our investigation is centred in the behaviour of the anthrax spores,
which, as we have already pointed out, may be regarded as repre
sentative of the extreme limit of endurance possessed by patho
genic bacteria ; on the other hand, the most important question to be
examined was whether the bacilli of anthrax can grow and multiply
or form spores in such waters, and our results point to this being
possible only under special conditions.     We trust, therefore, that the
information which we have collected, both from our own experi
ments and from the published results of other observers, concerning
the behaviour of these hardy anthrax spores, may serve as a basis for
practically assessing the higher limit of possible vitality which may
be exhibited by pathogenic micro-organisms gaining access to potable
water.

      Report of the Kew Committee for the Year ending
                           December 31, 1892.
   The operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Committee, which is
constituted as follows   :
                          Mr. F. Galton, Chairman.
   Captain W. de W. Abney, C.B.,       Prof. A. W. Riicker.

      K.C.B.                              R.N.
   The Earl of Rosse, K.P.
   The serious illuess of Mr. Whipple has prevented his performing
the duties of Superintendent during the last half-year.        Daring this
period the work of the Observatory was very satisfactorily carried
out by Mr. Baker, the Chief Assistant, and the Committee are of
opinion that his services should be specially recorded, and they are
glad to state that the routine work of the Observatory has in no way
suffered in these circumstances.
    The work at the Observatory may be considered under the fol
lowing    heads  :—
    1st. Magnetic observations.
    2nd.  Meteorological observations.
    3rd.  Solar observations.
   4th.   Experimental, in connexion with any of the above departments.
    5th.  Verification of instruments.
    6th.  Rating of Watches and Marine Chronometers.
    7th. Miscellaneous.
                         I. Magnetic Observations.
    There   have been no changes introduced in the magnetographs
 during the past year, but during the erection of the additional story
 to the west wing of the Observatory the self-recording instruments
 were at times disturbed by the building operations.       Fortunately the
 indications of the instruments were seriously affected by these causes
 on one of the " quiet days only, and that day has been omitted in
                                "
 calculating the monthly mean.

                        Report of      the    Kew Committee.                  323
     The  building in which the absolute observations are made is suffi
  ciently remote (about 100 yards) from the main building to be quite
  unaffected by these sources of magnetic disturbance.
     The photographed magnetic curves representing Declination, Hori
 zontal Force, and Vertical Force variations have been secured unin
 terruptedly throughout the year, and, as usual, the scale values of all
 the instruments were determined in January last.
     The following values of the ordinates of the different photographic
 curves were then found : —
                                                    '
            Declinometer    : 1  inch   =    0° 22 04.     1 cm. = 0° 8--7.
    Bifilar, January   5, 1892,   for  1 inch 6H = 0-0280 foot grain unit.
                                   „   1  cm. „ = 0 00050 C.G.S. unit.
    Balance, January    7, 1892,  for  1  inch eV= 0 0287 foot grain unit.
                                   „   1 cm.      „   = 0 00052  C.G.S. unit.
    In the    case  of the Vertical        Force magnetometer, it was found
 necessary    to readjust the   instrument; at the same time its sensibility
 was slightly altered, after which the scale value was again deter
 mined with the following result : —
   Balance, January 15, 1892, for         1   inch &V = 0-0277 foot grain unit.
                                      „    I  cm. „ = 0 00050 C.G.S. unit.
    The distance between the dots of light upon the Horizontal Force
 cylinder having become too large for satisfactory registration, the
 trace dot was brought nearer to the zero dot on August 6.
    The principal magnetic disturbances were recorded on the follow
ing dates, viz. : — February 13 — 14, March 6 and 12, April 26, May 18,
July    16 — 17, and   August    12.
    The most marked disturbance, however, was that which com
menced on       February 13 at 5.34 a.m., and lasted until the afternoon of
the 14th.
    The oscillations were of a more extended and violent character
than any which have been recorded during the last ten years.
    From the insufficient range of the scale, the magnetometers did
not record the complete extent of the vibrations to which the needles
were subjected, nor could the entire change of force be secured in the
field of the instrument.
    The limits, however, clearly recorded, were 1° 40' of declination,
from 0-1755 to 01835 of horizontal force, and from 0 4350 to 0 4425
units of vertical force expressed in C.G.S. measure in absolute force.
    The following table exhibits the absolute hourly values of Declina
tion (Inclination calculated from the Horizontal and Vertical Forces),
the Horizontal Force and Vertical Force having both been corrected
for temperature for February 13, 14, and 15, 1892 : —

                        Report  of the Kew  Committee.                   325
   Tho following are the principal results of the magnetic elements for
the year 1892 :—
      Mean Westerly Declination                   17° 36'7
      Mean Horizontal Force                       018202 C.G.S. unit.
      Mean Inclination                            67° 29'-4
      Mean Vertical Force                         0 43919   C.G.S. unit.
   Additional observations of the Horizontal Force, Inclination, and
Declination have been made each month with the absolute instru
ments, for the purpose of determining with greater precision the zero
values of the magnetograph curves.
   Information on matters relating to various magnetic data              has
been    supplied    to Lord Kelvin, P.R.S., Professor          Riicker,  Dr.
Neumayer, Captain Schiick,        and  Dr. Atkinson.
   Lieutenant C. E. Mouro, of H.M.S. " Penguin," visited the Ob
servatory from November 11 to 22, in order to gain a knowledge of
the nse of the unifilar magnetometer and the method of observing and
reducing the observations.
   Mr. E. Kit to, Superintendent      of the Falmouth Observatory, again
spent a fortuight at Kew, in the spring, preparing for the reduction,
upon the International scheme, of the magnetic observations made at
that Observatory.
   From time to time Messrs. Gray and Watson have visited the
Observatory for the purpose of taking a series of absolute magnetic
observations with the instruments which have been employed under
the direction of Professors Riicker and Thorpe in their magnetic
survey of the British Isles.
   A glass scale graduated in millimetres for measuring magnetic
curves was constructed for Professor W. G. Adams.
   A number of Thomson compass deflectors by J. White, of Glasgow,
have been examined, the examination being conducted at the Observa
tory by Mr. Baker, acting upon suggestions made by Captain
Creak.
                      II.  Meteorological   Orservations.
   The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
tion respectively of Atmospheric Pressure, Temperature of Air and
Wet-bulb, Wind (direction and velocity), Bright Sunshine, and Rain,
have been maintained in regular operation throughout the year, and
the standard eye observations for the control of the automatic records
duly registered.
   The tabulations of the meteorological traces have been regularly
made, and      these,   as  well as copies of   the eye   observations,  with

 326                    Report  of the Kew  Committee.
notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine, have been transmitted, as usual,
 to the Meteorological Office.
    With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, data have been
 supplied to the Council of the Roynl Meteorological         Society, the
 editor of ' Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine,' Dr. Rowland,
 the Institute of Mining Engineers, and others.
    Detailed information of all thunderstorms observed in the neigh
 bourhood during the year has been forwarded to the Royal Meteoro
 logical Society, as usual.
    At the request of the Meteorological Council, experiments have
 been for some months in progress upon the spare Beckley Rain Gauge
 with Willesden prepared paper and aniline ink, with the view of
 determining    its adaptability for use with that instrument, as a
 substitute for the paper hitherto used, which has been found to
 deteriorate on keeping.
    Daily trials were carried out, and the results showed a marked
improvement upon those previously obtained.         It was found impos
sible, however, to entirely prevent the lengthening of the papers
during very damp weather, although the sheets were soaked and
coated with various varnishes, &c. Experiments are still in progress
on this subject.
    Various suggestions for a supplemental record of the number of
 discharges made by the Beckley Rain Gauge during heavy rainfalls
 have been under consideration, but nothing definite has, up to the
 present, been decided upon.
    Anemograph. — A new pricker was fitted to this instrument in June,
 the old one having become bent and loose in its fitting.
    Sunshine Records. — As it was found that the scaffolding erected
 during the extension of the west whig interfered with the registration
 of bright sunshine by the recorder after 6 p.m., a spare instrument
 was obtained on loan from the Meteorological Office, and fitted up on
 the staging above the sun room, in order to prevent any possible loss
 of record, and was in use from August 2 to September 10, the
 scaffolding being removed on the latter date.
    Alterations in Observatory. — To facilitate photographic operations,
 and to keep the thermograph free from disturbance, &c., the curtains
heretofore used in the room have been removed, and a wooden
partition with two doors erected, which         has  been  found a great
improvement.       At the same time, arrangements were made so as to
render the room available for the registering portion of the electro-
graph, and the two instruments are now conveniently placed side by
side.
   Inspections. — At the commencement of March Mr. Whipple visited
the Valencia Observatory, and after dismounting the whole of the
meteorological     instruments,   conveyed them to the new building

                      Report of   the  Kew Committee.                 327
constructed for the purpose at West wood House, Cahirciveen, the new
Valencia Observatory.       The removal was successfully accomplished
with only one breakage, that of the wet-bulb reference thermometer.
Before leaving, Mr. Whipple made careful determinations       of the level
of the barometer at the new station, the heights of anemometer       cups
rain gauges, and thermometers above ground, .re-determined index
errors, &c.
   At the request of the Meteorological Council, Mr. Baker visited
the Glasgow Observatory         in April, taking with him three new
thermograph     tubes and  two  Kew standard thermometers of reference,
in order to replace instruments which had been maliciously broken.
   Electrograph. — This instrument was kept in action until the end of
July, when it was dismounted to prevent possible damage during the
building operations connected with the extension of the west wing of
the Observatory.      The scale value was determined by direct com
parison   with   the portable electrometer, No. 53, early in May and at
the end of June.       On the completion of the building, the instru
ment   being in a somewhat inconvenient spot, rendering dislocation
possible, it was decided to remove it to a safer position, which waa
rendered accessible by the alterations to the thermograph room. The
water reservoir, however, was not moved, as this might perhaps have
interfered with the continuity of the records, and it is intended to
commence again the regular records with the beginning of 1803.
                         III.  Solar Orservations.
   Sun-spots. — Sketches of Sun-spots have been made on 178 days, and
the groups numbered after Schwabe's method.
   On no occasion during the year, when observations have been
taken, has the Sun's surface been found free from spots, and the
number of new groups enumerated has largely increased.
   Time Signals. — These have been regularly received from Greenwich
through the G.P.O., with the exception of a few days, on which
occasions supplementary signals were transmitted at later hoars, and
a list of time corrections sent when required.
   Transit Observation. — Occasional solar and sidereal transits      have
been observed as checks upon the Greenwich        signalled times.
   Violle's Actinometer. — With regard to these instruments, the only
observations made during the past year were experiments to deter
mine the rate of cooling both of tho spheres and the thermometers
used in connection with them.         The weight of each sphere also was
determined when filled with water.         The results were forwarded to
Mr. H. F. Blanford, F.R.S., who had undertaken to investigate the
subject for the Solar Physics Committee.

328                  Report of  the Kew Committee.
                        IV. Experimental Work.
   In accordance with the request of Mr. Ellery, the Government
Astronomer at Melbourne, the Indian pendulum apparatus, having
been thoroughly overhauled since its return from the Royal Observa
tory, Greenwich,     to Kew, was carefully packed and shipped to
Melbourne, for use in the Gravity Survey now being undertaken by
the Australian authorities.
   The packing and shipping were conducted under the direction of
General Walker, who prepared a detailed statement of the necessary
instructions to be followed by the observers.
   The Richard thermograph, procured for use with the apparatus,
was also carefully packed and sent to Melbourne.       Notice has been
received of the arrival in the Colony of the apparatus.
   Cloud Photographs. — Operations connected with cloud photography
have been suspended during the past year.         At the request of the
Meteorological Office, certain cloud negatives taken in 1891, with
their reductions, were forwarded to them for examination, as well as
the apparatus used in the reduction of their heights and velocities.
   Fog and Mist. — With the view of ensuring greater uniformity in
observations of these phenomena, at the suggestion of Mr. R. H.
Scott,  a  list of twenty-four well-known objects in the neighbour
hood of the Observatory has been prepared, at distances varying
from 9 to 3850 yards.      Since May, the most distant of the objects
visible at each observation hour between suurise and sunset has been
noted. Up to the present the most dense fog recorded was when an
object at 20 yards distance was obscured.
   Further experiments were made at the beginning of the year with
Muuro's sight indicating anemometer, but the variation of viscosity
of the oil at low temperatures has caused some difficulty in deter
mining the scale value of the instrument, which has been returned to
the maker.
                     V. Verification of Instruments.
   The following instruments have    been purchased on commission and
their constants determined : —
   1  pair of dip needles, for the Meteorological     Institute, Copen
hagen.
   1 pair of dip needles for the Imperial and Royal Austro-Hungarian
Embassy, London.
   1 Clifton electrometer, water dropping collector and insulators, also
a battery of 60 chloride of silver cells and a dip needle for the Royal
Alfred Observatory,    Mauritius.
   A  set of 24 thermometers   fcr the Observatory, Hong Kong.

  The total number of other instruments           compared during the year
was as follows : —

    3 Standard Thermometers have been supplied during the year.
   There were at the end of the year in the Observatory undergoing
verification, 12 Barometers, 202 Thermometers, 8 Hydrometers, 13
Sextants, 21 Telescopes, and 1 Anemometer.
    At the request of Captain Tyler, R.E., Inspecting Officer of the
R.E. Division, Royal Dockyard, Woolwich, a batch of 72 telescopes
for the   use of the officers  of the field artillery has been examined.
                           VI. Rating    op Watches.
    1044 watches have been sent        for examination    during the    year, as
contrasted     with 709 during the fourteen months         comprised in last
report.     They were entered for the following classes : —
    For class A, 414 ; class B, 403 ; class C, 221 ; and 6 for the subsi
diary trial. Of these 192 failed from various causes to gain any
certificate  ; 214 were awarded      class C certificates, 377 class B, and
256 class    A ; of the latter, 22 obtained the highest form of certificate,
class A, especially good ; and 5 of the 6 passed the second test.
    In the Appendix will be found statements giving the results of trial
of the 22 watches which gained the highest number of marks during
the year.      The first place was taken by Messrs. Baume and Co.,
London, with a keyless, going-barrel, chronometer- watch, No. 103,018,
with the "tourbillon" escapement, which obtained the high total of
 91-9 marks out of a maximum of 100 ; this is the highest value yet
awarded.
    The best performance of lever watches during the year was that of
No. 13,400 by Fridlander, Coventry, which gained 86 marks.
    There has been a marked increase in the number of watches sent
for the B and C trials, and the use of these tests for lower-graded
movements appears, judging by the demand, to be steadily growing
 in favour.
    Non-Magnetic Watches. — Several watches thus designated have been
 examined during the year, both as to their ordinary time-keeping
and also to their non-magnetic properties.           The trial is rigorous, the
movement being tested in an intense magnetic field, both in vertical
and horizontal positions, and gradually approached to and removeil
 from   the coil, whilst its behaviour is critically watched, and its
 subsequent daily rate noted.         Should any alterations of its normal
 performance occur, the watch receives no certificate.

                      Report  of the  Kew Committee.                    331
   Marine    Chronometers. — During the year, 9 class A and 9 class B
certificates have been issued with chronometers which had undergone
the tests, as described in last report; ono movement failed to pass the
trials.
                           VII.  Miscellaneous.
    Lens Testing. — A detailed account of the apparatus and methods
employed in the examination of lenses has been completed by Major
 Darwin, and presented to the Royal Society.            The paper is being
printed in extenso by several photographic journals.          Major Darwin
also read a paper on this subject before the Photographic Society of
 Great Britain, the apparatus being illustrated by means of lantern
slides.    The Lens Testing Camera was shown at the Soiree of tho
Royal Society, in May.
    A loan of twelve lenses, all known to be of good quality, has been
obtained from the Royal Engineering School at Chatham, by the kind
 permission of the Commandant.          These have been subjected to a
 very detailed examination, the results of which will be considered as
standards of reference for other lenses sent here for certification.
    Experiments are in progress in the endeavour to find an object
more suitable for the "definition
                                      " test than the one now in use.
    Library. — During the year the library has received as presents the
publications of —
   37   Scientific Societies  and    Institutions    of Great Britain    and
         Ireland, and
    106 Foreign and Colonial Scientific       Establishments,  as well as of
         numerous private individuals.
    The preparation of the card catalogue of the Library is still con
tinued, but confined only to such publications as relate to Meteorology,
Terrestrial Magnetism, and the other work of the Observatory.
    Extension of the Building. — The Chief Commissioner of Works and
Public Buildings having granted permission for the Committee to
undertake the erection of the additional story to the west wing of the
Observatory, as mentioned in last year's Report, and having instructed
Mr.   Lessels, surveyor to the Board, to prepare the necessary drawings,
plans, &c., tenders were invited from the principal local builders for
the work. That of Messrs. J. Dorey and Co., of Brentford, for £540,
-was accepted, and operations were commenced on July 15. They
bave now been completed, under the superintendence of Mr. Chart,
H.M. Commissioners' Clerk of Works for the Hampton Court and
Kew District, and Mr. Allen, his assistant.
    The cost of the operations being a heavy charge on the funds at
tbe present disposal of the Committee, they made application to the
Royal Society for a loan of £400, which was liberally granted.

                    Report    of the Kew       Committee.
   During the building alterations the thermometer             testing was
carried on in the experimental magnetic house.
   Water Supply. — Applications having been made to Her Majesty's
Office of Works for the provision of a direct water supply, available
for the protection of the building in the case of fire and other pur
poses, arrangements were made with the Water Committee of the
Richmond Corporation for the laying of a branch main along the
roadway leading from Clarence Street, Richmond, to the Observatory,
and H.M. Office of Works contributed a moiety of the cost, viz.,
£74   10s.
   Paper. — Prepared photographic paper has been procured, and sup
plied to the Observatories at Aberdeen, Falmouth, Fort William,
Lisbon, Mauritius, Oxford, Stonyhurst,             Valencia, Hong Kong,
Toronto, as well as to the Meteorological Office for Batavia.
   Anemograph sheets have been sent to Mauritius, and blank forms
for entry of magnetic observations to Professor Riicker and Dr.
Meldrum.
   Exhibition of Instruments. — Various instruments were shown by
the Committee at the thirteenth annual exhibition of the Royal
Meteorological Society.
   Workshop. — The machine tools procured for the use of the Kew
Observatory by grants from the Government Grant Fund or the
Donation Fund have been duly kept in order.
   House, Grounds and Footpath. — These have all been kept as usual
during the year.

   The results given   in the following tables are deduced from the
magnetograph curves which have been standardised by observations
of deflection and vibration. These were made with the Collimator
Magnet K.C. I. and the Declinometer Magnet marked K.O. 90 in the
9-inch  Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
   The Inclination was observed with the Inclinometer by Barrow,
No. 33, and needles 1 and 2, which are '6\ inches in length.
   The Declination and Force values given in Tables I to VIII are pre
pared in accordance with the suggestions made in the fifth report of
the Committee of the British Association on comparing and reducing
Magnetic Observations.
   The following is a list of the days during the year 1892 which
were selected by the Astronomer Royal, as suitable for the deter
mination of the magnetic diurnal variations, and which have been
employed in the preparation of the magnetic tables.

     The LORD      KELVIN,    D.C.L., LL.D., President, in the Chair.
     A List of the Presents received was laid on the table, and thanks
 ordered for them.
     The following Papers were   read  : —
    L  '•
          Magnetic    Viscosity." By      J. Hopkinson, D.Sc, F.R.S.,
       E. Wilson, and F. Lydall.            Received March 8, 1893.
    The following experiments were carried out in the Siemens
 Laboratory, King's College, London, and are a continuation of ex
 periments by J. Hopkinson and B. Hopkinson, a description of which
                    '
appeared in the Electrician,' September 9, 1892.
    In that paper determinations were given of curves showing the
relation between the induction and the magnetising force, for rings of
 fine wire of soft iron and steel, through complete cycles with varying
 amplitudes of magnetising force, both with the ordinary ballistic
 method     and with alternating currents of a frequency up to 125
 complete periods per second. It was shown that if the induction was
 moderate in amount, for example, 300(1 or 4000, the two curves closely
 agreed ; but, if the induction was considerable, for example, 16,000, the
 curves differed somewhat, particularly in that part of the curve
 preceding the maximum induction. The difference was greater with
 steel than with soft iron.
    It was not then determined whether this difference was a true time
 effect or was in some way due to the ballistic galvanometer.         The
present paper is addressed to settling this point.
    The ring to which the following experiments refer is of hard steel
containing about 0"6 per cent. of carbon, in the form of wire -t-^t in.
diameter, varnished with shellac to ensure insulation. The material
was supplied by Messrs. Richard Johnson. The ring is about 9 cm.
diameter, and has a sectional area of l-08 sq. cm. ; it is wound with
200 turns of copper wire, and with 80 turns of fine wire for use with
the ballistic galvanometer.
                          '
    In the ' Electrician paper the static curve of hysteresis was
determined by the ballistic galvanometer, the connexions being made
according to the diagram in fig. 1 : where R is the hard steel wire

  ing a resistance      into the primary circait. The resistance R2 was
  so  adjusted   that the   maximum current in the primary circuit was
  such    as to  give the    desired     maximum      magnetising  force on the
  ring.
     In taking the kicks on the ballistic galvanometer the method
 adopted was as follows : — Having closed the primary by means of S,,
 the   switch   S2 was suddenly opened, thus          allowing the magnetising
 force to drop to an amount determined by Rt, and the kick observed.
 A total reversal was then taken with Sj, and the kick again observed.
 The closing of St again brought up the magnetising force to its
 maximum in the opposite direction to that at starting.
     In a letter to the editor of the ' Electrician,' September 16, 1892,
 Mr. Evershed stated that " Had the slow cycle been obtained by the
 method described by Mr. Vignoles,* Messrs. Hopkinson would have
 found it in almost absolute agreement with the quick cycle curve."
     To settle this point the static curve of hysteresis was obtained by
 the ballistic galvanometer, the connexions being made according to
 the diagram in fig. 2.      This is not the method of experiment alluded

wire ring, B is the ballistic galvanometer, S, is a reversing switch,
and S3 a small switch for the purpose of short-circuiting the adjust
able resistance Ri. The difference between this diagram and that in
fig. 1 is that Ri can be suddenly inserted into the primary circuit by
one stroke of the reversing switch Si.    In this way it is possible to
vary the magnetising force from one maximum through 0ero to any
desired point within the other maximum by one motion of the switch
S, : which operation takes but a small fraction of a second to
perform.

 been   plotted, and their close agreement proves that the difference
 found between the static and quick cjcle curves is not due to the
 cause suggested by Mr. Evershed.         In each case the battery used had
a potential difference of 108 volts, the periodic time of the ballistic
needle being 10 seconds.
    It was observed, when taking the hysteresis curve by the method
in fig. 2, that the sum of the inductions found by varying the
magnetising force from one maximum to an intermediate point, and
from that point to the other maximum, did not exactly equal the
induction got by varying the magnetising force direct from one
maximum to the other.
   To investigate this with the ballistic galvanometer the magnetis
ing force (fig. 3) was taken from one maximum through zero to the
point a by one motion of the reversing switch handle, and the
galvanometer circuit closed at known intervals of time after such
change, the deflection being noted. This deflection does not repre
sent an impulsive electromotive force, nor yet a constant current,
but is caused by a current through the galvanometer diminishing in
amount somewhat rapidly.         It might arise from the comparatively
slow rate at which the magnetising current changes, owing to the
self-induction of the circuit, or it might arise from a finite time
required to develop the induction corresponding to a given magnetis
ing force.      The former would be readily calculable if the ring had a
definite self-induction ; in our case it is approximately calculable.
   Let R be resistance of primary circuit, E the applied electromotive
force, x the current, and      I  the total induction multiplied by the
number of primary turns.
                                             dl
   Now    I  is known in terms of x for conditions of experiment very
approximately, and roughly dljdt has a constant ratio to dxjdt — is
equal, say, to It(dzjdt) ; hence the well known equation
                                              dx

   From our curves we        see   that induction per sq. cm. increases
10,000, whilst magnetising force increases 4. Total induction multi
plied by the primary turns, taking the volt as our unit, increases
10,800 X 200 X 10~8, whilst the current increases ±_ an ampere, i.e.,
                              L  =   4-32  x 10-'.
                                                                2 c 2

    In the experiments made E = 4 and          108 volts and  R =   0-8 and
 21"6 ohms, whence

     In either  case as does not differ sensibly from its final value when
 t  =   £  second.   Hence the self-induction of the circuit can have
  nothing to do with the residual effects observed.
     These experiments showed that an effect was produced upon the
 galvanometer needle, appreciable for some seconds, the effect being
 somewhat more marked with 4 than with 108 volts.            But the whole
 amount was so small as to be less than 1 per cent. of the total change
  of induction ; from which we infer that no material difference exists
  between curves of induction determined by the ballistic galvano
 meter and the inductions caused by magnetising forces operating for
  many seconds.
                                        —
     Effect of tapping the Specimen. Having taken the magnetising
 force from its maximum through zero to the point a as before, the
 effect of tapping was marked, especially in the case of soft iron,
 when a kick corresponding to an acquirement of 633 lines of induc
 tion per sq. cm. was observed.
    The following experiments on the hard steel wire ring were
 carried out with the alternator, the object being to ascertain if a
 time effect on magnetism exists.         The ballistic curve (fig. 3) has
been taken as a standard with which to compare the respective
hysteresis curves.      In each case the maximum magnetising force has
been made as nearly as possible to agree with that used when taking
the ballistic curve, and the method of test was that employed in the
 '              '
   Electrician     paper.   For the sake of completeness the diagram,
fig. 4, and description are given over again.
    Quoting from that paper, we have : " For determining the points
on the closed curve of magnetisation given by rapid reversals of tho
current in the coil, the ring was connected in series with a non-
inductive resistance to the poles of an alternate current        generator,
or  a transformer excited by the generator, thus : —

1893.]                      Magnetic   Viscosity,                    357
in which A, B are the poles of the transformer or generator ; C, D the
terminals of the non-inductive resistance R ; H the coil surrounding
the ring ; P and Q the studs of a reversing key connected to the
quadrant of a Thomson quadrant electrometer ; L a key by means of
which Q could be connected with C or E at will ; and K a revolving
contact maker, through which P was connected to D. A condenser
was connected to P and Q, in order to steady the electrometer read
ings. The contact maker K was bolted on to the axle of the gener
ator.    It consists of a circular disc of ebonite, about 13 in. in
diameter, having a small slip of copper, about -tL in. wide, let into its
circumference.     A  small steel brush presses on the circumference,
and makes contact with the piece of copper once in every revolution.
The position of the hrush can be read off on a graduated circle. The
quadrant electrometer thus gives the instantaneous value of the differ
ence of potential between the points C and D, or the points D and E,
according to the direction of the key L."
    Frequencies of 5, 72, aud 125 -»• per second have been tried, two
values being given to the potential difference at the terminals of the
alternator in each of the frequencies 72 and 125, making in all 5
complete experiments.       The curves so obtained are given in figs. 8,
9, 10, 11, and 12 respectively.      From observations of the values of
the electromotive force between C and D (fig. 4) at different times
in the period, a curve A (in each experiment) was plotted, giving the
magnetising force in terms of the time ; a similar curve was plotted
for the electromotive force hetween D and E, which, when corrected
by subtracting the electromotive force dne to the resistance of the
coil H, gives the potential or time rate of variation of the induction
in terms of the time. Hence the area of this curve (B) up to any
 point, plus a constant, is proportional to the indnction corresponding
to that point.    This is shown in curve C, which is the integral of B.
In each of the five experiments the ring with the non-inductive
resistance was placed across the terminals of the alternator, and the
excess of potential taken up by a non-inductive resistance.
    In fig. 5 the hysteresiss curves for frequencies of 5; 72, and 125
 are compared with the ballistic curve.      These curves are marked 5,
 72L, and 125L respectively.     The corresponding values for B and H,
from   which  these curves  have been plotted, are given in Tables II,
III,  V, which have been obtained from the curves in figs. 8, 9, and
 11 respectively.
    The mo9t noteworthy features in these curves are that the curve
 with a frequency of 5 is very near the ballistic curve, if allowance
 is made for difference in the magnetising current, and that tho curves
 with a frequency of 72 and 125 deviate very materially, particularly
 in the part of the curve somewhat preceding the maximum induction.
  Hence the time effect mainly develops with a greater frequency than

358     Dr. Hopkinson and Messrs. Wilson and LydalL               [Apr. 20,
5 per second.    Hence also we infer that this effect, as already described
         '
in the Electrician,' is a true time effect, not arising in any way
from the ballistic galvanometer.
   In fig. 6 the hysteresis curves for a frequency of 72 are compared
with the ballistic curve. The curves are marked 72L and 72H
respectively, the potentials at the terminals of the alternator in the
two cases being approximately 36 and 430 volts.         The corresponding
values for B and H are given in Tables III, IV, which have been
obtained from the curves in figs. 9 and 10 respectively.
   The difference between the two curves in fig. 6 was at first
puzzling, but a little consideration satisfied us that it arises from the
same time effect.    The curve 72L was determined three times, with
the same result.    The numerals refer to thirtieths of a half-period.
From 26 to 28,8 of the L curve the magnetising force increases from
31"8 to 45'6,  whilst from   21 to 26   of the H  curve   it increases from
30"6 to 44, the rate of change being about double as great           in the
former case as in the latter, and it is the L curve which deviates
most from the ballistic curve.     In like manner, in the neighbourhood
of zero induction, the induction in the H curve is changing twice as
fast as the induction of the L curve, and it is here the H curve which
differs most.   How these differences of rate of change arise can be
seen by inspecting   figs. 9 and 10.
   In fig. 7 the hysteresis curves for a frequency of 125 are compared
with the ballistic curve. The curves are marked 125L and 125H
respectively, the potentials at the terminals of the alternator being
approximately 62 and 750 volts. The corresponding values for B
and H are given in Tables V and VI, which have been obtained from
the curves in figs. 11 and 12 respectively.
   These curves show the same difference as fig. 6, but lass markedly
than in fig. 5. The L curve was determined twice.
   Experiments have been made upon chromium steel, supplied by
Mr. Hadfield, having the following composition: — 0-71 per cent,
carbon, 9,18 per cent. chromium, when annealed, and when hardened
by raising to low yellow and plunging into cold water.          The results
show that the same time effect exists in this case, although it was not
so marked as in the case of the hard steel.
   We draw the following conclusions from these experiments : —
(1.) As Professor Ewing has already observed, after sudden change
of magnetising force, the induction does not at once attain to its full
value, but there is a slight increase going on for some seconds. (2.)
The small difference between the ballistic curve of magnetisation with
complete cycles and the curve determined with a considerable fre
quency, which has already been observed, is a true time effect, the
difference being greater between a frequency of 72 per second and
5  per second than between    5 per second and the ballistic curve.

II.   " On the
                  Spectrum of Thallium, and its Relation to the
         Homologous Spectra of Indium and Gallium." By Henby
         Wilde, F.R.S. Received March 14, 1893.
    The spectral reactions of thallium have been made the subject of
observation by so many distinguished physicists as to leave little to
be gleaned by further research of the spectrum of this interesting
element.      A strong line in the red seems, however, to have been
overlooked, with one exception, in all the tables of the spectrum of
thallium which have hitherto been published. Huggins would appear
to have observed this line in the spark spectrum, and assigned a place
for it in his table* corresponding to a wave-length of 6547 of Ang
strom's scale. f
    For reasons which will presently appear, the existence of this line
has not been confirmed by Thalen in the spark spectrum, nor by
 Liveing and Dewar in the arc spectrum,J nor by other subsequent
observers.
    The importance of this line in relation to the homologous spectra
of other elements of the same series induced me to undertake ex
periments which have proved, beyond doubt, the existence of this
characteristic spectral reaction of thallium.
    When metallic thallium or its chloride is volatilised in the elec
 tric arc between carbon points, a red line appears in the spectrum
apparently coincident with the hydrogen line C 6562.               As the C
line invariably appears in the spark spectrum of all metallic sub
stances in moist air, the red thallium line was considered by me,
as   it "would doubtless have       been    by others, as due to the electro-
lysation of aqueous vapour suspended in the atmosphere. It was,
however,      found that the line did not present itself in the arc
spectrum    of  the alkaline and other metals experimented with under
the same conditions.        It therefore appeared to me probable that
the red line belonged to the spectrum of thallium.                There was,
moreover, the further fact that, up to the -present time, the arc
spectrum of thallium below the ultra-violet was limited to the well-
known Crookes' green line, and in this respect was anomalous in the
simplicity of its spectrum at the high temperature of the electric arc.
    That the red line was not due to electrolytic hydrogen of aqueous
vapour was shown by the following experiments : — Two wide-
necked phials were partially filled with strong sulphuric acid,
leaving an air space at their upper ends of about two cubic inches.

 370       Mr. H. Wilde.      On the Spectrum     of Thallium,   [Apr. 20,
 The mouths of the phials were closed with tightly-fitting stoppers
of caoutchouc, through which pairs of copper wires were thrust for
 the purpose of attaching electrodes of different metals in the in
 terior of the phials.   Pairs of platinum and thallium electrodes were
 placed in the phials respectively, which were set aside for some
hours to allow the moisture of the enclosed air to be absorbed.
    An induction coil, giving a 10-inch spark in air with 12 amperes
 of current, was used in the experiments, and the density of the spark
 was increased by connecting the secondary circuit with the coatings
 of a Leyden jar in the usual manner.
    The observations were made with       a  direct-vision spectroscope of
 five prisms, fitted with an illuminated   scale, which enabled compari
 sons to be made simultaneously between the spectral lines of different
 substances with great exactness aud rapidity. The range of tbe in
 strument with the arc spectrum included the rubidium line 7951, and
 the calcium line Hj 3933, while the prismatic dispersion was such as
to well divide the potassium double line 4044, 4042.
    On transmitting a succession of sparks from the platinum electrodes
through the dried air in one of the phials, the air lines 6602 and
 6482 were very conspicuous, but there was no trace of the hydrogen
 line 6562 between them.        When, however, the sparks were taken
from the thallium electrodes under like conditions the sharp red line
appeared as in the arc spectrum.         The same results were obtained
when similar pairs of platinum and thallium electrodes were con
nected in series and placed under a large glass receiver, the air in
which had been dried by sulphuric acid.
    The red line of thallium does not appear in the oxy-hydrogen flame,
nor when the intensity of the spark is somewhat reduced by placing
a vacuum tube in series with the thallium electrodes, although the
brilliancy of the air lines was but little diminished.
    That the red line was not due to hydrogen occluded in the thallium
 was shown by the following experiments : — A pair of palladium
 electrodes  were saturated with electrolytic hydrogen from dilute
 sulphuric acid, through which an electric current was transmitted for
several minutes.      These electrodes were substituted for those of
platinum    in  the  phial of dried air ; and when the sparks passed
 between them the strong hydrogen line C appealed for several
 seconds   before it finally disappeared through the heating of the
pa'ladium electrodes.
    A small quantity of thallium was placed on a piece of pumice under
the glass receiver of an air pump, and fused in vacuo by the arc
light condensed by a pair of Fresuel annular lenses foenssed through
the side of the receiver.   The spectrum of the thallium fused in racuo,
from which all gas had been excluded, was the same as in the pre
vious experimenis.

 1893.]    and its Relation   to those  of Indium and Gallium,           371
   In  r11 my observations on the spectrum of thallium         I  found that
the red line was slightly more refrangible than the hydrogen line.
The difference, however, was so small from the nebulous character of
hydrogen C at atmospheric pressure, that, with the spark spectrum
in moist air, the thallium line overlapped C so much as to be undis-
tinguishable ; but when the intensity of the hydrogen line was re
duced, by passing the spark through partially dried air, the two lines
could    be distinctly recognised by the difference in their bright
ness.
   A closer comparison of the red lines of thallium and hydrogen was
now made by placing the narrow part of a hydrogen vacuum tube
behind the phial containing the thallium electrodes.
   The sparks through the vacuum tube and electrodes were taken
simultaneously    from separate induction coils.        The red lines were
now distinctly separated by a dark space of less width than the in
terval between the double sodium line D'D2. The spectrum of C was
less bright than the thallium line, owing to the greater distance of the
vacuum tube from the slit of the spectroscope ; but a more distinct
line was obtained by substituting for the hydrogen tube one of carb
onic acid, in which the C line appeared by the electrolysation of the
residual aqueous vapour contained in the gas.
   The wave-length of the thallium red line, as estimated by the dif
ference of refrangibility of the hydrogen line, from the same electrodes
in moist air, is 6560 ; or, 6558,   as estimated from the   distinct line of
hydrogen in   a vacuum tube.
   A  comparison of the arc spectrum        of thallium may now be made

advance towards the more refrangible parts of the spectrum in the
inverse order of their atomic weights.* The correlation of the
spectral reactions of thallium, indium, and gallium with the other
properties of these elements is of further interest from the fact that
their arc spectra (below the ultra-violet) are represented by homo
logous pairs of lines in the order of their atomic weights. Tl = 204 ;
 X6560,5349. In = 113-4 ; V4510, 4101. Ga = 70 ; X4170.4031. The
intervals of space between each homologous pair of lines, as will be
seen, increase in the same order.         These relations are further repre
sented in the subjoined            diagram, reduced from the scale of
 Angstrom's normal spectrum.
    It would be interesting to know if the arc spectrum of scandium
 is represented by a similar pair of lines in the ultra-violet, as         I  have
already suggested in the paper referred to before this elementary
 substance was discovered.

    1.   This paper is a continuation of some researches on rings published
 in the ' Phil. Trans.,' 1893. In that paper the potential of an anchor
 ring was found at all external points ; here it is determined for
 internal points.      The annular form of rotating gravitating fluid was
 considered ; the stability of such a ring is investigated here.                 In
 addition, the potential of a ring of elliptic cross-section, being of
 interest in connexion with Saturn, is obtained.              Besides this, the
 similarity of the methods and of the analysis employed has led
 me to put in this paper also the determination of the steady motion
 of a single vortex ring of finite cross-section and the motion of
 several fine vortex rings on the same axis.
    2. Let the figure represent a section through the axis Ox of an
 anchor ring. O is the centre of the ring, C the centre of the cross-
  section, P any point inside the ring.
          Let OC =    c,     CA =    a,     CP =R,          z ACP =      X-

    3. The stability of an annulus of rotating fluid is considered for three
kinds of disturbances : fluted, in which case the ring remains symme
trical about its axis, but its cross-section ceases to be circular ; twisted,
in which case the central circle of the ring is deformed, but the cross-
section is undisturbed ; beaded, in which case the central line remains
circular, and the cross-section is a circle, but one of varying radius.
 It is proved that when the cross-section is small compared with the
radius the annular form is stable for fluted and twisted disturbances,
but is broken up by beaded waves.
    4. In Laplace's proof that Saturn's rings cannot be continuous
fluid rotating in relative equilibrium, he assumes that the attraction
of the ring at a point on the surface is the same as that of a cylinder.
Madame Kowalewski, in her memoir, uses a method which applies
only to rings of nearly circular cross-section.                 Here I have found
the potential of a ring of elliptic cross-section.                The results are
complicated.        For a very flat ring of mass M of mean radius c, and
whose cross-section has a semi-major axis a, the exhaustion                       of
potential energy is      if (o/c)- is neglected
    As applied to Saturn, the result obtained is that for the ring to be
continuous fluid its density would have to be about 100 times the
density of the planet.

Then fo, ftj, /J4, &c., are of the 2nd, 3rd, 4th,.     . . . orders in o/c.   Their
values are obtained as far as (a/c)4.

      Equinoxes."      By F. C. Pknrose, F.RA.S.            Communicated

                                (Abstract.)
   This investigation   is supplementary to Mr. Lockyer's examination
of the orientation   of the Egyptian temples, in the course of which
he has cited passages translated from hieroglyphics, showing most
distinctly that there was a connexion between the foundation of
those temples and certain stars.      He has also shown that the struc
ture of the temples demonstrates that the light from these stars
must have been admitted at their rising or setting along the axis of the
temples through the doorways, and that in certain temples the door
ways have been altered in such a way as to follow the amplitude of the
star as it changed, owing to the precession of the Equinoxes, and that
in some   cases a new temple had been founded         alongside of an older
one for the same purpose.
   Although there does not seem to be any historical or epigraphies!
record of such a nature in Greece, the architectural evidence is not
wanting. On the Acropolis of Athens there are two temples, both
dedicated to Minerva, lying within a few yards of one another, both
apparently oriented to the Pleiades, the older temple to an earlier
position of the star group, and the other to a later one. At Rhamnus
there are two temples almost touching one another, both following
 (and with accordant dates) the shifting places of Spica. In a temple

at ^Hgina a doorway placed excentrically in the west wall of the cella
was adapted for the observation of a setting star.
   A clue is given for finding out the dates of the foundations of
temples oriented to stars by means of the changes produced upon
them by the precession of the Equinoxes, a movement which in
duces a divergence between the latitudes        and longitudes of stars,
and their places reckoned in declination       and right ascension ; so
that after the lapse of 200 or 300 years       a star which rose or set
in the direction of the axis of a temple        would have passed to a
different amplitude, so as to be no more available for observation, as
before, from the adytum.
   In the earlier ages of Greek civilisation the only accurate
measure of time by night was obtained by the rising or setting of
stars, and these were more particularly observed when heliacal, or
as near as possible to suurise.      For the purpose of temple wor
ship, which was carried on almost exclusively at suurise, the priests
would naturally be very much dependent for their preparations on
the heliacal stars as time warners.
   The orientation of temples may be divided into two classes, solar
and stellar.     In the former the orientation lies within the solstitial
limits ; in the latter it exceeds them. In Greece there are compar
atively few of the latter class.
   In the lists of temples which follow, all the orientations were
obtained from azimuths taken with a theodolite, either from the
Sun or from the planet Venus.       In almost every case two or more
sights were observed, and occasionally also the performance of the
instrument was tested by stars at night. The heights subtended
by the visible horizon opposite to the axes of the temples were also
observed.
   The first list comprises twenty-seven intra-solstitial temples   :
      7 examples from Athens.             1 example from Sunium.

   For all these the resulting solar and stellar elements are given,
with the approximate dates of foundation, similarly to the following
specimen, namely, that of the Temple of Jupiter at Olympia.

    This example       has  been selected    from the rest of the list,          because
this temple has been chosen for the purpose of showing the method
of procedure in working out the elements from the observations,
those,     namely, of the orientation angle, and of the height of the
visible horizon.
    A few general remarks, however, seem required respecting the
Sun's and star's altitude, and the Sun's depression when the star
is to be observed.
    For a star to be seen heliacally, it is necessary that the Sun should
be just sufficiently below the horizon for the star to be recognised.
According to Biot, Ptolemy, speaking of Egypt, has recorded this to
be about 11°. But where, as generally in Greece, there are moun
tains screening the glow which at such times skirts the true horizon,
it seems fair at any rate for a first magnitude star to consider 10°
as sufficient.      I have myself seen Rigel in the same direction as the
Sun when elevated 2° 40' above the sea horizon, the Sun being less
than 10° below. Obviously an observer looking from a dark chamber
in a well known direction would be more favourably situated.
    It is proper to allow about 3° of altitude for a star to be seen above
low clouds and the hazy glow which skirts the horizon.                         The Sun's
light, however, seems to be very effective at a lower altitude, and when
 he appears over a mountain of 2° or 3° altitude the angle may
properly be reduced by 20' or 25', partly for refraction, and partly
because a small segment only of the disk is sufficient for illumina
tion.
    The method I have pursued in working out the example of the
 Temple of Jupiter at Olympia is as follows.
    The orientation angle, measured from the south point round by
 way of west and north, is 262° 37' 46", which is equivalent to an
 amplitude of +7° 22' 14".               The eastern monntain subtends an
 angle   of   2° 4'.    For reasons   above      given, the solar altitude may be

382                     Mr.  F. C. Penrose.       On the             [Apr.  27,
taken as 1° 42', but that of the star, 3°. Combining these values
with the latitude, viz., 37° 38', and using the formula
sin  £ =  cos zen. dist. x cos  colat-f sin zen. dist. x sin colat x sin ampl.,
we obtain for the star a declination of + 7° 40', and for that of the
Sun +6° 52' 22". This latter, with the ecliptic obliquity of about
800 years B.c., determines the Sun's right ascension to have been
lh  3m 15t.
    The next step is to enquire if there be any bright star or star
group which, at a date consistent with archaeological possibility,
would have had a declination near to the above-named place, and
would also have been heliacal.
    Such a star would have required about 6h 8m to pass from 3°
altitude to the meridian, and it would have required to have been
about        in advance of the Sun to allow it to be seen. The ap
proximate R.A. of such star would therefore be about 23h 40™, and
its declination, as already stated, must be about 7° 40' N.
    For trials   I have nsed a stereographic projection of the sphere
taken on the pole of the ecliptic, but showing also R.A. hours and
parallels of declination.      Any place on this projection may be chosen
and marked on a superimposed sheet of tracing           paper, and then if the
tracing paper is turned round upon the pole              of the ecliptic as a
 centre, so that the straight line drawn upon           it, which in the first
instance joined the two poles marked on the             projection, is carried
 round to an angle equal        to  the  amount   of  precessional movement
 under consideration, if there be a suitable star marked on the pro
jection the point selected for trial will pass over it or near it, and
 after the star has been thus roughly pointed out the more exact
 calculations may be proceeded with.           By this process in the case
 before us the tracing-paper mark coincided almost exactly with the
 place of a. Arietis, and for this star the particulars were carefully
 computed which have been given in the list of elements.
    It should be noticed that there are in every case of intra-solstitial
 temples four possible solutions of this step. The Sun's amplitude
 may be due either to the vernal or the autumnal place, and the star
 might have been heliacal either at its rising or setting.             In every
 instance all these four alternatives have been tried by the pre
 liminary search method, and in every case in temples of old founda
 tion an heliacal star has resulted from one or other of the trials, but
 never more than one.
    The star which has been found as above for the Temple of Jupiter
 is no other than the brightest star of the first sign of the Zodiac, and
 therefore peculiarly suited to that god. The same star is connected
 with the early temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.
    In intra-solstitial temples, by the nature of the case, the stars are

 1893.]       Orientation     of a number of Greek Temples, $c.                   383
almost     entirely confined to the Zodiacal constellations, and conse
quently suitable stars are very much limited in number.
    Another very great limitation arises from the consideration that, to
have been of any service as a time warner, the star must have been
heliacal, and when these two limitations are taken into account, it
becomes improbable to the greatest degree that there should always
have been a suitable star unless it had been so arranged by the
builders of the temple.
    In about two-thirds of the cases which                I  have investigated the
 dates deduced from the orientations are clearly earlier than the
architectural remains now visible above the ground.                       This is ex
plained by the temples having been rebuilt upon old foundations, as
may be seen in several cases which have been excavated, of which
the archaic Temple of Minerva on the Acropolis of Athens and the
 Temple of Jupiter Olympius on a lower site are instances. There
are temples also of a middle epoch, such as the examples at Corinth,
JEgina, and the later temples at Argos and at Olympia ((he
Metroum at the last named), of which the orientation dates are quite
consistent with what may be gathered from other sources.
    Besides the list of intra-solstitial temples already given, I have
                                        I
particulars of five for which have been unable to find an heliacal
star.    They are all known to be of recent foundation, when other
methods of measuring time had been discovered.                        The solar axial
coincidences      were no doubt in all these cases connected with the
great festivals of these temples. It was clearly the case in two of
them.
    At the Theseum at Athens the date was either October 10 or
March 2. The Thesea festival is reckoned to have been on October
8 or 9.      For the later Erechtheum the day would have been April 8
or September      3.    The great festival of this temple is put down for
September 3.
    Leaving the solar temples, we find that the star which was ob
served at the great Temple of Ceres must have been Sirius, not used,
however, heliacally — although this temple is not extra-solstitial — but
for its own refulgence at midnight. The date so determined is quite
consistent with the probable time of the foundation of the Eleusinian
Mysteries and the time of year when at its rising it would have
crossed the axis at midnight agrees exactly with that of the celebra
tion of the Great Mysteries.
    It is reasonable to suppose that when, as in the case of Sirius at
Eleusis, brilliant stars were observed at night, the effect was
enhanced by the priests by means of polished surfaces.

    Of a list of seven extra-solstitial temples which are named, five are
more particularly noticed, viz. : —
    A  temple at Mycenae and one near Thebes, which are built nearly
north and south, but which probably, as was the case at Basssa, had
eastern doorways.        The star, a. Arietis, which suits the first, seems to
point   out  the  dedication  of this temple to Jupiter.    The other is very
remarkable, and connects the Boeotian Thebes with the great
Egyptian city      ; the star was 7 Draconis.     Thebes was called the City
of the Dragon, and tradition records that Cadmus introduced both
Phoenician and Egyptian worship.             Three of the temples lay more
nearly    at  an  angle bisecting    the cardinal   points; these are Diana
Propyhea at Eleusis, a small temple (not yet named) lately discovered
at Athens, and the Temple of Venus at Ancona, recovered by means
of the walls of a church built upon its traditional site. In these
temples the star observed at the first seems to have been Capella,
the time of the year when it shone axially at midnight agreeing with
that of the celebration of the Little Mysteries, and in the other two
the star was Arcturus.
 II. "On      the Coloration of the Skins of Fishes, especially of
       Pleuronectidse."        By J. T. Cunningham. M.A. Oxon.,
       Naturalist on the Staff of the Marine Biological Associa
       tion, and Charles A. MacMunn, M.A., M.D. Communi
       cated by Professor E. Ray Lankester, F.R.S.                   Received
       March     6, 1893.
                                    (Abstract.)
    Tn normal specimens of the majority of the Flat Fishes, i.e., of the
family PleuronectidaB, the upper side is pigmented, the lower side
opaque white, the colours and markings being characteristic of the
species. In symmetrical          Fishes which swim vertically the dorsal
surface is pigmented, the ventral almost or entirely destitute of pig
 ment.     Where the pigment is absent or in small quantity the charac
 teristic silvery brilliancy and iridescence of Fishes' skins is exhibited.
 It has long been known that the pigment in the skins of Fishes and
 Amphibia is contained in chromatophores provided with contractile
radiating processes, and that the iridescence and brilliant reflection of
light is due to special anatomical elements of fixed form, all these
elements being placed in the category of connective tissue cell?.
But exact and detailed descriptions of these coloration elements in
Fishes are not available.       The most complete account of them is that

                                       (' Journ. Anat. et Phys.,' 1876). He
 there gives the separate reflecting cells the convenient name " irido
cytes," and refers to the silvery layer of the skin under the name
" argenture."      The anatomical analysis of the structural coloration
elements having thus not previously been adequately carried out, we
have described these elements as they are found in Pleuronectidas and
various other Fishes.        In the former family there are two kinds of
chromatophores,       the  black  and the coloured, the latter usually of
some shade of yellow or orange. The coloured elements in the skin
on the upper side are chiefly developed in the more superficial layer
immediately beneath the epidermis and for the most part outside the
scales, and on the inner side of the skin in the subcutaneous tissue,
the rest of the skin being almost destitute of these elements. In the
superficial layer the iridocytes are somewhat polygonal plates of
irregular shape, distributed uniformly, and separated by small inter
spaces.     The chromatophores are much larger, and farther apart, and
are superficial to the iridocytes, although sections show that their
processes often pass down between adjacent iridocytes.           The coloured
 chromatophores have less definite outlines than the black, and as a
 rule radiating processes are but indistinctly indicated in them. The
 external    part of the coloured chromatophore          consists of  diffused
yellow pigment, while in the centre the concentration of the pigment
 produces a deeper colour, varying from orange to red, as in the Plaice
 and Flounder.       On the upper side of the Fish the subcutaneous color
 ation elements are quite similar, but not so uniformly distributed ;
 the iridocytes are larger, and the chromatophores not so symmetrical
 in shape.
     The lower side of the normal Flounder is uniformly opaque white,
  like chalk. Here in the more superficial part of the skin there is a
  uniform layer of iridocytes like those of the upper side, opaque and
 reflecting, but not very silvery or iridescent.         Chromatophores are
  entirely   absent.    In  the  subcutaneous    layer there  is a continuous
  deposit of reflecting tissue, to which the whiteness of the skin is due,
  the superficial iridocytes not being sufficiently thick to make the skin
 so opaque. We have shown by comparing the adults of different
 species, and stages of growth of the same species (Flounder), that
 the subcutaneous deposit is merely a further development of a layer
of separate iridocytes which enlarge until they become continuous.
 In some cases, e.g., Arnoglossug, the subcutaneous layer of the lower
side remains permanently as a layer of separate plates or iridocytes.
 The continuous deposit in all respects corresponds to the subcutaneous
tissue to which is due the silvery glitter of the Mackerel or Herring,
and we have called it the argentenm.
     We have shown by descriptions of the coloration elements in a
number of species of symmetrical Fishes such as Mackerel, Whiting,

 Gurnard, Cottus, Pipe-fishes, &c., that the general distribution of the
 elements is constant in all, the differences being in minute details.
 Thus, there is always an argenteum consisting of reflecting tissue
 composed of needles or granules in a layer of greater or less thick
 ness.   And in the superficial region of the skin there is a layer of
 chromatophores associated with a thinner deposit of reflecting tissue
 corresponding to the iridocytes of the Pleuronectid.       Thus, in the
 Herring the superficial reflecting tissue is in the form of a layer o
 slender rods or prisms lying side by side and adhering to the inner
 surface of each scale, forming a coating to the latter when it is
 removed, and endowing it with its beautiful iridescence.       The scales
 themselves are never silvery or iridescent.        In the Herring the
 argenteum     consists of similar rods in close apposition, forming
 laminae.    On the dorsal surface of the body, where the argentenm
  becomes thinnor, chromatophores are found on its surface and pene
  trating it with their processes ; on the ventral surface these are
 absent, and the argenteum is very thick.
     The ultimate histological relations of the coloration elements we
 have not completely elucidated, but have merely described the rela
 tions as seen in sections, pointing out the difficulty of regarding the
 iridocytes of the Pleuronectids as cells, considering their homology
 with the reflecting tissue in other forms, such as the Herring, and
 the fact of the argenteum, a continuous deposit whose cellular nature
 is very improbable, being developed from iridocytes.
    In chemjcal and physical properties the substances contained in
the coloration elements are as distinct as the elements are in appear
ance and form.       The black chromatophores owe their colour to a
melanin which is granular in its natural condition, is a nitrogenous
body, and is very refractory towards reagents. The pigment of the
coloured chromatophores is always a lipochrome, and the absorption
bands of the various lipochromes obtained from the Fishes examined
do not differ to any great degree.     The reflecting tissue was found
always to consist of guanin in the pure state, not, as has often been
stated, to a combination of gnanin and calcium.        The differences in
the appearance of the reflecting tissue in the natural state, whether
it is silvery, chalk white, or iridescent, depend on the form of it<
minute elements. It is chalk white when granular, silvery when
composed of very fine needles in a thick layer, iridescent when com
posed of thicker prisms in a thin layer.     The opacity and reflecting
power is a property of the guanin itself in any form.      Besides these
substances, large crystals of phosphate of calcium were found in
many skins, both of Pleuronectidse and other Fishes, and from these
or from the scales* has probably been derived the calcium supposed to
be associated   with the guanin.

  1893.]         On the Coloration     of the Skins of Fishes.           387
 were undertaken in order to find out what exactly took place when
coloration was developed in the lower side of Flounders in certain
experiments carried on at the Plymouth Laboratory since the spring
of 1890.      The first of these experiments was described in the
'
   Zoologischer Amseiger,' No. 354, 189.1.       The method of the experi
ments is to take young Flounders in process of metamorphosis, or at a
later stage, and keep them in a vessel with a glass bottom without gravel
or sand, and then to direct light from a window on to the lower sides
 by means of an inclined mirror placed beneath the vessel and opposite
the window.      The first experiment was not quite conclusive, although
some pigment was found on the lower sides of the fish after an ex
posure to light of four months.          The second experiment was quite
conclusive.    Four Flounders were taken on September 17, 1890, from
a number reared in the aquarium since the preceding May : they
were five to six months old, and 5 to 8 cm. in length.        They had been
 living  under  ordinary   conditions,  and   were  in all respects  normal,
 having no colour on the lower sides.        They were placed in the vessel
above the mirror. On one of these, two faint specks of pigment were
observed on April 26, 1891, one died on the following July 1, which
showed no pigment, and one on September 26, 1891.             The latter was
16-7 cm. long and showed only a little pigment on the posterior part
of the operculum.      At this time one of the two survivors had de
veloped pigment all over the external regions of the lower side, and
the other had a few small spots.        The first of these two is still alive
 (March, 1893), being     now  three   years old, and it is now pigmented
over the whole of the lower side except small areas on the head and
the base of the tail. A drawing showing its condition in November,
1891, was exhibited at the soiree of the Royal Society in 1892, and is
laid before the Society with this paper. The other specimen died on
July 4, 1892. It was then 25 cm. long and had a good deal of pigment
in scattered spots on the lower side. This specimen had been exposed
about one year and ten months.            Several other experiments gavo
similar results. The Flounders which were reared in the aquarium
under ordinary conditions showed no such tendency to develop pig
ment; a few, as in nature, were found to have small patches of pig
ment on the lower side, but the percentage was extremely small, and
the pigment in such cases was constant, not progressive, as jn the
fish exposed to light.
    The occurrence of abnormal coloration in Pleuronectids is fully
considered in the memoir ; a large number of specimens are described,
and it is shown that there is no evidence whatever that these speci
mens have been exposed to abnormal conditions.             We conclude that
these abnormalities are congenital and not acquired.
    We find that where pigment is developed on the lower side, whether
in the experiments or as a congenital abnormality, the argenteum is

much diminished, as it normally is on the upper side, and it is sug
gested that possibly there is an inverse physiological relation between
the formation of gnanin and the formation of pigment.
   We conclude that exposure to light does actually cause the develop
ment of pigment in the form of normal chromatophores on the lower
side of the Flounder, and also causes the absorption of the argenteum
to a great extent.    We infer, in spite of the occurrence of congenital
abnormalities, that the exclusion of the light from the lower sides of
Flat Fishes is the cause of the absence of pigment from that side in
normal specimens. We think that the fact that the metamorphosis
of the Flounder takes place at first normally, in spite of the light
coming from below and being shut off from above, is, in respect of
the pigmentation, in favour of the inheritance of acquired characters.
When the exposure is continued long enough, the change that has
taken place in consequence of heredity is reversed, and pigment
appears.
   We have discussed briefly the question of the physiological process
of the formation of the pigment, but we have at present no decisive
result to offer in this part of the subject, and need not include it in
this abstract.
   We consider that these investigations afford support to the view
that the incidence of light is the reason why the upper and dorsal
surface of animals is more strongly pigmented than the lower or
ventral throughout the animal kingdom, and that the absence of
light is the cause of the disappearance of pigment in many cave-in
habiting and subterranean animals.
III. "The      Electric Organ of the Skate: Note on an Electric
       Centre in the Spinal Cord." By J. C. Ewart, M.D., Regius
       Professor of Natural History, University of Edinburgh.
       Communicated by Professor Sir W. Turner, F.R.S. Re
       ceived March 15, 1893.
   Having considered the development and structure of the electric
organ of the Skate, it appeared to me desirable, by way of making my
work more complete, to reinvestigate the nervous apparatus of the
organ, and more especially to ascertain whether, as in Torpedo and
Oymnotus, there is an electric centre.          In Torpedo the electric
organs  are  developed  from  a limited  number  of myotomes, and inner
vated by afferent fibres, belonging to a limited number of cranial
nerves, which proceed from two large collections of cells — the electric
lobes — situated in the region of the medulla.    In Oymnotus the nerves
for the electric organs proceed from two well-marked cellular tracts

which extend along the greater length of the spinal cord, one at each
side of the central canal.  In the case of the Skate the question at
the outset is,granting  the existence  of an electric centre,       as in     is   it,
Torpedo, situated in the brain  or, as in Oymnotus,  in the spinal cord                    ?
Sanderson and Gotch* made out that in the Skate "a reBex centre
is situated in the optic lobes," but, notwithstanding this, these lobes
in the Skate in no way differ histologically from the corresponding
structures in Acanthias and other Selachians uuprovided with elec
trical organs.
   The development of the Skate's organ from portions of the caudal
myotomes, and its innervation by afferent fibres from certain caudal
nerve, point to the electric centre being situated in the spinal cord
rather than in the brain, and to its being, as in Oymnotus, on   level,            a
and all but co-extensive, with the electric organ.
  Having observed, when working at the development of the electric
organ, a number of large nerve-cells in the caudal portion of the
spinal cord, the sections of Skate embryos made some years ago
were first examined.     It soon became evident that in sections from
the middle of the tail on   level with the electric organ certain cells of
                               a
the anterior horn of the cord were very much larger than in sections
through the root of the tail, and further that in late embryos and very
young Skate there was an electric centre, resembling in many respects
the electric centre in Oymnotus.
   It did not, of course, follow that the electric nerve-cells persisted
into adult life.    They might degenerate, and thus the supposed
feebleness   of the Skate's organ might be accounted for.      The fact
that the Skate's organ    increases in size as the fish grows larger led
me, however, to expect that large nerve-cells would be found in the
caudal region of the spinal cord in well-grown fish. In this         was           I
not disappointed, for, though there was at first some difficulty in
demonstrating the presence of electric nerve-cells in large fish, on ob
taining perfectly fresh material their position,               size, and relations were
easily made out, and the remarkable difference in the appearance of
sections of the cord at, and in front of, the root of the tail, from sec
tions on a level with the electric organ, was at once evident.      From
the observations already made,       appears that the electric centre in
                                        it
the Skate closely resembles, from a morphological point of view at
least, tbe electric centre in Oymnotus.    The electric tract is, how
ever, much shorter in the Skate than in the Electric Eel, and the
cells are relatively fewer in number.   On the other hand, the cells in
the Skate are larger than in Oymnotus, and this        true not only of
                                                                   is
Baia batis but also of R. radiata, in which the organ        extremely   is
small and poorly developed. Nerve-cells from the electric centres of
Torpedo, Oymnotus, and Raia are represented in the accompanying

(a R.  batis two feet  in length) ; fig. 2 a cell from the electric centre
of a well- grown Gymnotus ; and fig. 3 a cell from the electric lobe of a

be noted that, though the cell from the Skate is much smaller than
the Torpedo cell, it is decidedly larger than the one from Gymnotus.
   In sections of the Skate's cord on a level with the electric organ,
small, as well as large, cells are usually visible in the anterior horn.
The small cells are in connexion with the fibres which supply the un-
transformed caudal muscles.        They agree exactly with the cells in
the anterior horn throughout the entire length of the spinal cord
lying in front of the electric organ region.      One of these unenlarged

motor cells is represented in fig. 4. It was drawn from a section of
the cord (of the same fish from which fig. 1 was taken), about six
inches in front of the electric organ.          It closely resembles, except in
size, the electric cell (fig. 1), and it also resembles the large motor
cells of the Mammalian cord. A motor cell from the spinal cord of
a Mammal, drawn to the same scale as the other cells given, is repre
sented in fig. 5.* This cell, smaller than the electric cell of tho
 Skate (1), and still smaller than the cell from Torpedo (3), is about
 the same size as the electric cell of Qymnotus (2).
    With the help of sections through a series of embryo Skate, for
 most of which I was indebted to Dr. Beard, I have been able to
 study the development of the cells in the Skate's electric centre. This
 part of tho subject, together with the condition of the electric cells in
 large fish, will be dealt with in a subsequent communication.             It may,
 however, be stated now : 1. That in R. batis embryos under 5 cm.
 in length none of the motor cells in the caudal region have under
 gone enlargement.        2. That in an embryo 5-8 cm. in length, although
 the muscular fibres seemed still unchanged, certain cells in the
 anterior horn of the caudal portion of the cord were distinctly larger
 than similarly shaped cells in their vicinity. 3. That in an embryo
 15-5 cm. in length, in which the electrical elements were already
 well developed, the electric nerve-cells were large and conspicuous,
 so that sections through the cord in the region of the electric organ
 presented quite a different appearance from sections through the
 root of the tail, where no change had taken place in the cells of the
 anterior horn.

      " On the Thickness and Electrical Resistance of Thin Liquid

        Physics in the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, and A. W.
        ROCKER, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Physics in the Royal
        College of Science, London. Received March 10, 1893.

     The paper gives an account of experiments             made for the purpose
 of determining     the  thickness   of black    soap  films  formed of solutions

 1893.]    Thickness and Electrical Resistance      of Liquid Films.    395
of varying composition.        Two methods of experiment were employed :
(1) an optical method,     in  which the mean thickness of about 50 plane
black films contained in a tube was deduced from observations of in
terference phenomena ; and (2) an electrical method, in which the
thickness of a cylindrical black film was derived from a measurement
of its electrical resistance.     The optical method involves the assump
tion that the refractive index of a thin film of liquid is the same as
that of a large quantity of the same liquid.
   Reasons are given for the belief that the refractive indices in
question, if not identical, differ only slightly, and hence that the
thickness of a film as determined by the optical method is the true
thickness.
   In the electrical method the assumption is made that the specific
conductivity of a liquid does not alter when the liquid is drawn out
into a thin film.
   If the results obtained by the two methods agree, the conclusion is
that the specific resistance of a film is not affected by its tenuity ; if
they differ widely from each other, a change in the specific conduc
tivity of the liquid must have taken place.
   The authors showed, in 1883, that for a solution of hard soap con
taining 3 per cent. of KN03, with or without the admixture of
glycerine, the mean thicknesses of black films, as measured by each
of the two methods, were in close agreement.            For such solutions,
then, the specific conductivity is the same whether the liquid be
examined in considerable bulk or in the form of a film 12 [ifi in thick
ness.   The accuracy of this result has been confirmed by a large
number of observations made during the last three years.
   If the'proportion of KN03 added to the solution be diminished, the
thickness of a black film, whether measured optically or electrically,
is found to undergo a change.

   The change in the mean thickness of a black film due to variation
in  the percentage of dissolved soap is shown in the following table: —

   When the solution contains 3 per cent. of KN03 variation in the
proportion of dissolved soap has little influence on the thickness of a
black film, as is evident from the following numbers : —
                        Hard Soap.        3 per cent.   KN0j.

                              II.    Electrical Method.
   It has been stated that for a soap solution containing 3 per cent. of
KN03 the thickness of a black film as measured electrically is
practically the same as that measured optically. If, however, the
proportion of KN03 be diminished, the thickness (measured electri
cally) increased in a far larger ratio than would be inferred from the
optical method.       If the proportion of salt be diminished to zero, the
thicknesses thus calculated are much greater than the greatest thick
ness at which a film can appear black.             In such cases, therefore, the
electrical method does not give the true thickness of the black, and
the hypothesis that the specific conductivity of the film and of the
liquid in mass are identical is untenable.
   The following table shows the change in apparent thickness due               to
diminution    in the quantity of dissolved salt : —

the unsalted hard soap solution is confirmed by experiments on a
solution of unsalted soft soap, which gave a mean appearent thickness
of 162 pp.
   In different films the measured thicknesses of the black differ widely
from each other, the limits being roughly 80 pp and 230 f-p. This
large variation is due in some cases, at all events, to a real variation
in the thickness. Two different shades of black are (in cases where
the solution contains little or no salt) frequently seen in a film.     They
are separated from each other by a line of discontinuity which is
irregular in shape.         Comparative measurements on the two shades of
black are difficult to make, as tho regions they occupy are rarely
sufficiently extended or separated by a line sufficiently approximating
to a horizontal circle for the application of the method of measure
ment which the authors employ.            Measurements, however, have been
made, and the results indicate that the electrical thicknesses of the
two kinds of black are approximately as 2 : 1.
   Details are given in the paper of numerous experiments carried out
with the object of determining the cause of the great increase in elec
trical conductivity in Hack films made from unsalted soap solutions.
   The results     have shown that the increase of specific   conductivity in
question —
                                   •
   1. Is independent of moderate changes of temperature.
   2. Is not due to the absorption or evaporation of water by the film.
   3. Is not due to change in the composition              of the liquid by
electrolytic decomposition produced by the current used          to measure
the electrical resistance of the film.
   4. Is not affected by a very large change in the quantity of C02
in the air around the film.
   5. Is practically unaltered if the films are formed in an atmo
sphere of oxygen.
   The next question to be answered was whether the large changes
in specific conductivity affect black films only, or whether similar
phenomena can be detected in the case of thicker films.
   The conclusions arrived at were (1) that the specific conductivity
of a film increases as the thickness decreases and (2) that this in
crease is less in the case of a film to which a salt has been added and

    In the case of a soap solution     containing 3 per cent. of KNO, the
results of the electrical and optical methods of measurement agree
for thicknesses greater than 450 fifi. At thicknesses between 450 and
200 fifi the ratio is generally above unity, being in some cases as large
as 1-28, but there is no clear indication that its value increases as the
film thins,   and when the thickness corresponding to the black is
reached the ratio is again unity.
    The paper concludes with a discussion as to the cause of the in
crease of electrical conductivity in thin films.      The authors point out
that it may    be   attributed  either   to a modification   of the chemical
constitution of the film brought about by its tenuity, or to the forma
 tion of a pellicle  on the surface.     They prove that the experimental
results cannot be explained by the formation of a pellicle only, but
that they are consistent either with the former or with a combination
of both causes.      To discriminate between them it will be necessary
to carry out observations in gases other than air, and an apparatus
specially designed for this purpose is being constructed.

       By H. W. Pomfret, M.D., F.R.C.S., late Berkeley Fellow at
       the Owens College.        Communicated by Sir Wm. Rorerts,
       F.RS. Received March 6, 1893.
                                 (Abstract.)
    Organic oximides may      be concisely defined as
                                                         " bodies containing
the chemical group ~X-OH attached to a carbon atom."
    These bodies may be broadly divided into two classes          : (a) Those
whose preparation involves the use of hydroxylamine ; these are
known as " oximes," whence the generic name " oximide" is derived.
(b) Those which are prepared independently               of hydroxylamine.
These latter may be obtained by the aid of nitrons acid, and have
been    termed " isonitroso- " bodies.       This group      K'OH must be
distinguished from the true        " nitroso-
                                               "         —  NO. The oxime
                                                 group
group is bivalent, being regarded as a compound of trivalent nitrogen
with the monovalent radical hydroxyl. The trne nitroso-group is
monovalent,    two " affinities " of the nitrogen       being taken up by
oxygen.
    There is furthermore an essential structural difference between the
bodies forming the subject of this research and the nitrites. In the
nitrites the nitrogen is attached to oxygen, whereas in these
oximido-bodies     the nitrogen     of the oxime group is attached to
carbon, and the larger group " C~N-OH " may be considered
present.

   It  is this larger group,     C^N'OH, which has          been called the
" oximido- " group.
   The ultimate object of this research was to correlate this structural
relationship with the pharmacology of these bodies, and to discover
how far they may possess any pharmacological type which can be
isolated and referred to the presence of the group ~N.OH.
   Representative members were selected for pharmacological              in
vestigation from several series of the oximido- bodies.           From the
fatty aldoximes were taken — ethylaldoxime, propylaldoxime, isobutyl-
aldoxime and oenanthaldoxime ; acetoxime was chosen to represent
the ketoximes ; isonitrosoacetone to represent the isonitrosoketones ;
benzaldoxime and salicylaldoxime to represent the aromatic bodies.
I   had previously investigated the pharmacology of quinonoxime
 (paranitrosophenol, CsHVO-NOH).
   It may be said at once that the physiological actions of these sub
stances recall in many points the properties of nitrites.             When
oxidised at the body temperature decomposition takes place, and very
soon the presence of a nitrite can be demonstrated.
   This decomposition consists essentially in the separation of
bydroxylamine from an aldehyde or ketone. In other cases the in
termediate production of hydroxylamine has not been proved, but an
immediate oxidation of the whole molecule and severance of nitrous
acid has appeared possible.
   Before analysing the experimental results of the actions of these
oximido-bodies,     it was necessary to define the actions of their
corresponding    aldehydes and ketones.
                   Ethylaldehyde, CH,-COH.
                  Propylaldehyde, CH,-CH,:COH.
                   Isobutylaldehyde, (CH3),-CH-COH.
                   Heptylicaldehyde, CtHu'COH.
   The action of these fatty aldehydes on voluntary muscle is chiefly
evidenced in two ways — contracture and loss of irritability and con
tractility.   A primary stimulation is always seen in observations
with minimal stimuli, bat becomes more and more transient in
equivalent dilutions as the series of aldehydes is ascended.
   In muscle tracings a primary increased range of contraction is

 400            Dr. H. W. Pomfret.          Organic   Oximide* :     [May    +,
 seen when     dilute solutions are used ; but the dilution must be in
 creased   with  the atomic weight of the aldehyde.
     There is a primary shortening of the latent period which also
 varies as the primary stimulation.         This same action is also reflected
 in the  muscle   curves,  where    the abrupt ascent and increased height,
 whilst always to be seen as initiatory effects, are found to become
 more transient.     At the same time the descending arm of the curve
 nlways shows the rigidity of contracture, and that in increasing
degree.
     As the group of aldehydes is ascended, muscle-nerve preparations
 show a gradually increasing loss of irritability in the nervous path,
both absolutely and also slightly in comparison with a similar loss of
irritability in the muscle itself.
    A primary slight exaltation of irritability in the nervous path also
becomes a little more evident, and, since the nerve trunks have shown
no such action, the nerve endings must be the seat of such primary
stimulation.
    In their action on the spinal cord       these fatty aldehydes produce a
primary increase      of irritability followed by a secondary depression.
The intensity of this primary stimulation of the spinal cord seems
scarcely to vary in the case of the lower three members, that is to
say, ethyl-, propyl-, and isobutyl-aldehyde, whereas the potency of
their secondary depressant action intensifies with their increasing
weight.     CEnanthol causes a more marked primary stimulation of
the cord than would inferentially be expected, and may cause reflex
convulsions in the frog.
    Ethyl-, propyl-, and isobatyl-aldehyde all constrict the vessels of
 the excised sheep kidney.        This action varies inversely as the atomic
 weight ; thus, isobutylaldehyde constricts the vessels less than propyl-
 aldehyde and the latter less than the ethyl compound.              CEnanthol
 first constricts and then dilates the same vessels.          In the tortoise
 ethylaldehyde and propylaldehyde are again vaso-constrictors.             The
 effect of pithing the cord in the tortoise has shown that both ethyl-
 and propyl-aldehyde have a local constrictory influence on the vessel
walls, and it would appear that this action is reinforced during the
 period of exalted sensibility of the cord by a like influence exerted
 through the spinal centres.          As the cord becomes depressed this
 central constricting influence is abolished, or even replaced by an
influence antagonistic to the local constrictory action.
    Isobutylaldehyde      dilates the tortoise's vessels slightly, and the
action increases somewhat as the circulation is continued.                This
vaso-dilating action of isobutylaldehyde is again exerted locally on
the walls of the vessels, and is at first either uninfluenced by, or is
slightly antagonised by, the spinal cord ; later, a vaso-dilating in
fluence is also exerted through the spinal centres.

   (Enanthol also dilates   the vessels of the tortoise, bat, provided the
spinal cord be intact, by no means so markedly as the vessels of the.
excised kidney.     Pithing the cord balances the comparison, for then
the tortoise's vessels are dilated by cenanthol to as great a degree
as those of the excised kidney.         (Enanthol has, therefore, its local
vaso-dilating  action  inhibited  by a  central action exerted through the
spinal cord.
   All these fatty aldehydes have essentially the same action on the
heart, the difference between them being simply one of degree.
They all tend to slow the cardiac rhythm, and have a primary tonic
and secondary depressant action.           As the atomic weight of the
aldehyde increases, weaker solutions are required to show the tonic
effect, and the arrest   in diastole is more quickly reached.
                      Ethylaldoxime,    CH3'CH:NOH.
                      Propylaldoxime,    CtHtINOH.
                      l8obutylaldoxime, CiH8!NOH.
                      (Enanthaldoxime, C7Hlt;NOH.
   Contrasting now the actions of the fatty aldehydes with the actions
of their corresponding aldoximes as observed by similar experimenta
tions, it is seen how closely these latter bodies reflect the combined
actions of a nitrite and aldehyde.
   These fatty aldoximes depress the irritability of voluntary muscle.
This depressant action is also possessed by nitrites and by aldehyde.
Bthylaldehyde has also a slight primary stimulant action, but this in
the aldoxime molecule is for the most part absent, being counter
acted by the oxime group.
   The aldoximes diminish the extensibility, the elasticity, and the
range of contraction of voluntary muscle, actions also possessed both
by aldehyde and nitrite.
   Ethylaldoxime .has rarely produced an initial increased range of
contraction, which initial increase is a usual effect of ethylaldehyde,
but might be annulled by nitrites.
   The latent period is not affected by nitrites.      Under the influence
of both aldehydes and aldoximes there is a primary shortening of
this period.
   Again, these fatty aldoximes differ amongst themselves in their
action on voluntary muscle exactly as do the corresponding alde
hydes. As the series is ascended the action on voluntary muscle
becomes more toxic, as seen firstly in the increasing degree of con
tracture, and secondly in the more rapid loss of irritability.
   In their action on the spinal cord they present the same characters
and variations as those possessed by the corresponding aldehydes.
 Comparison simply shows a more marked primary stimulation in the

402            Dr. H. W. Pomfret.       Organic Oximidts :       [May 4,
case   of the aldehydes.       This might be explained by the fact of
nitrites being purely depressant to the cord. The stimulant action of
the aldehyde would in this sense be discounted by the       TJ-DTT group
of the aldoxime.                                               •
   In the same way the experimental circulation of these aldoximes
has shown their action to be that of the corresponding aldehyde
modified by a local vaso-dilating influence.
   Lastly, accelerated rhythm coupled with depression is the type of
the cardiac action of all but very dilute solutions of nitrites, and
perfusion experiments on the heart have shown that these aldoximes
possess this nitrite type superadded to the action of the correspond
ing aldehydes. Accelerated rhythm is invariably produced, whilst
the primary tonic effect is less marked.

                     Salicylaldehyde, OH-C.H^COH.
   These aromatic aldehydes have the same type of action as their
fatty homologues, but differ from them in their much more powerful
toxicity and greater dominance of irritation, which is more espe
cially seen in their action on the spinal cord and voluntary muscle.
   They are both vaso-dilators, though such action is not very pro
nounced.
   A solution of either of these aldehydes not stronger than 1 part in
30,000 parts has a marked action on the frog's heart.       The rhythm
is slowed whilst the amplitude of beat gradually diminishes, and the
heart becomes arrested in diastole.      Stronger solutions cause imper
fect dilatation of the ventricle during diastole, with final arrest in
systole.

               ,     Salicylaldoxime, CtH^qjj.jjqjj.
   These two aromatic aldoximes have been found to scarcely differ
in their physiological     actions from their corresponding aldehydes.
The powerful aldehyde influence almost completely obscures any
action which might be attributable        to the NOH group in their
Structure.
   Progressive contracture and loss of irritability are the main
features of their action on voluntary muscle. A primary stimulation
of voluntary muscle, doubtful in the actions of the fatty aldoximes, is
well in evidence in the case of those aromatic compounds, and in
muscle-nerve preparations is seen equally well, should the stimulus
have been thrown along the nerve or directly into the muscle fibres.
   The results of subcutaneous injections of these two aldoximes have

1893.]              a Research on their Pharmacology.                  403
indicated their action on the spinal cord to be paramount.             The
reflex irritability of the cord is greatly increased until the muscles of
the limbs are thrown into tetanic convulsions.
   The presence of the NOH group is, however, felt by the vessel
walls of the excised kidney, and is revealed by the much more power
ful vaso-dilating action exerted by salicylaldoxime than by salicyl-
aldehyde.
   Also in the action of these two aldoximes on the heart the influence
of the NOH group is probably to be traced in the fact that no
retardation of rhythm occurs as is seen in perfusion experiments with
the aromatic aldehydes, though in all other respects the cardiac
actions of these two classes of aromatics are identical.
                     Acetoxime, (CH3)2:C:N-OH.
                     Itonitrosoacetone, CH3-CO-CH:N-OH.
   I have investigated the physiological actions of these substances by
the same methods as those employed for the previously described
bodies, and have found their actions to closely resemble those of the
fatty aldoximes.     The structural difference is not borne out pharma
cologically.    Acetoxime    more especially repeats the actions of propyl
aldoxime, and in the presence of this fact it is interesting to observe
that the molecular weight of acetoxime is exactly equivalent to that
of propylaldoxime.
   Isonitrosoacetone   finds its parallel intermediate to propylaldoxime
and isobutylaldoxime,      in some of its actions approaching the former,
but, on the whole, being nearer to the latter.
   In molecular weight isonitrosoacetone finds its exact equivalent in
isobutylaldoxime.
                              Acetone, CH3-COCH3.
   I have examined the actions of acetone on the isolated tissues and
organs, and have found that, except in the case of voluntary
muscle, these actions differ in little from those of propylaldehyde.
Nervous depression is the cardinal feature of the general action of
acetone on the frog.      Injections have paralysed the spinal cord. In
muscle-nerve preparations acetone quickly depresses the irritability of
the nervous path.
   It is in its action on voluntary muscle that acetone diverges most
from the aldehydes.       Pure acetone causes no contracture in muscle,
and the muscle irritability is depressed rather than the contractility.
In fact, the action of acetone on voluntary muscle        I  have found to
closely resemble that of ethyl alcohol.
   On the vessels of the tortoise and excised sheep's kidney, acetone
has not been found to possess any action, beyond at times an equivocal
constriction.

404             Organic Oximides    : their Pharmacology.       [May 4,
   Acetone is almost innocuous to the frog's heart in all but very
strong doses, when the only action is depressed systole with final
arrest in diastole.
    Seeing, therefore, the resemblance in action found to exist between
a ketoxime and an aldoxime, and also between isonitrosoacetone and
an aldoxime; seeing, further, the resemblance in action between the
involved aldehydes and ketone, it must follow, as a corollary, that the
influence of the oxime group must in each case be the same.          This
influence is that of a nitrite, as was also found to be the case in the
aromatic aldoximes.
    The only discrepancy arises in the actions of acetoxime and of iso
nitrosoacetone on voluntary muscle.       They both give rise, when pre
sent in strong solution, to the development of some contracture, a
phenomenon which cannot be ascribed to acetone.
    During the course of this research it has been sought to explain
the nature of muscle contracture, and it has been determined that
the phenomenon is probably due to direct irritation of the nerve end
plates, the irritant in the case of these oximido-bodies being an
aldehyde, or, perhaps, more accurately, the COH group.
    In support of this contention several facts may be here adduced.
    It is an active process associated with an increased formation of
 heat.
    Tracings show the onset and decline of contracture to be in rela
 tionship with the shortening and lengthening of the latent period.
    The development of contracture is prevented by curare.
    A primary increase of irritability in the nervous path of muscle-
 nerve preparations can be traced to the end plates.
    This irritability, better expressed as exalted conductivity of the
 end plates, becomes more marked as the power of the aldehydes to
 cause contracture increases.
    The decline of contracture is synchronous in its onset with the loss
 of conductivity through the end plates.
     Experiments on the oxidation of acetoxime and isonitrosoacetone
 have led to the detection of an aldehyde — pyroracemic aldehyde, in
 the case of acetoxime, and acetylformic aldehyde in the case of iso
 nitrosoacetone.     This formation of aldehyde, should it take place in
 the tissues, would then be a sufficient explanation for their giving rise
 to contracture.      On the other hand, it might be argued that the
 oxime group, whilst in all other respects giving rise to actions
 identical with those of nitrites, yet exerts a primary stimulant action
  on nerve centres and on the muscle end plates.     Such an action   this
 investigation has not disproved.

       Communicated by Dr. J. S. Bristowe, F.R.S. Received
       February 27, 1893.
                                 (Abstract.)
    Attention is first drawn to the alarming increase in mortality from
cancer, shown by the Registrar-General's figures, and to the fact that
the view that this increase is due to more accurate diagnosis and
certification has been partially abandoned.
   An attempt is then made to test this conclusion, by a study from
an independent standpoint        of the official cancer death-rates for
England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland ; and by a comparison of
these death-rates    with other data obtained from the experience of the
 Scottish Widows' Fund Life Assurance Society, and from the official
cancer returns for the city of Frankfort-on-the-Main.
    In order to make the figures from these different sources exactly
comparable, corrections have been made for variations in age and
sex distribution.      A standard population is taken (that of the
"English Life Table, No. 3. Persons.") The death-rates at the
different age-groups in each case are then multiplied into the popula
tions at the corresponding age-groups in the standard population
 assumed as a common basis. Thus we obtain in each case the total
deaths from cancer per annum among a million persons aged 25 and
upwards, grouped as in the standard population, and can contrast the
 different totals obtained, without any fallacy arising from varying age
and sex distribution of population.
    The results obtained are grouped in septennial periods, as the figures
relating to the Scottish Widows' Fund Assurance Society were only
 obtainable in septennial periods.     From these septennial results, the
 corresponding death-rates are obtained for each single year by an
 application of the graphic method employed by Milue in the con
 struction of his Carlisle Life Table.     These are shown as a series of
 curves.
    The Irish curves are the lowest, probably because medical attend
 ance   in Ireland owing to poverty is on the average more meagre than
 in Great Britain. The English curves for males and females are very
 far apart. The Scottish curves for the two sexes are nearer together
 than the English, the apparent cancer mortality in Scotland for males
 being higher and for females lower than in England. The greater
 propinquity of the Scotch male and female curves may be ascribed to
 more correct diagnosis and certification in Scotland than in England.
 This view does not, however, explain why the female English is

                                                    of                    [May    4,
 higher than the female Scotch curve ; and it must be assumed there
 fore that there is some condition more favourable to the causation of
 cancer in English than in Scotch female- life.
    The Scottish Widows' Fund curve has the easiest gradient of all,
 probably pointing to more accurate diagnosis and certification than
 for the whole country, especially at the earlier periods.
    That the apparent increase of cancer is at any rate chiefly due to
 improved diagnosis is shown by a comparison of the male and female
 curves respectively.       They run practically parallel throughout If
 cancer   had   really  increased,   its increase would probably have been
 an approximately equal percentage in the two sexes, and consequently
 the curves would have widened their distance apart.                    Even if—
 assuming     that   a real  increase   of cancer   had  occurred  —  the increase
 were unequal in amount in the two sexes, it is highly improbable
 that the increase would have         been of such a distribution as to main
 tain the parallelism of the      male  and female curves.
    The statistics for Frankfort-on-the-Main enable us to classify
cancer in accordance with the part of the body primarily affected.
We have, therefore, classified the returns into two groups, according
                     " accessible " or                            " inaccessible "
 as the cancer is                        easy of diagnosis, and
 or difficult of diagnosis.      The results of this classification show that
 in those parts of the body in which cancer is easily accessible and
 detected there has been no increase in cancer mortality between 1860
and 1889.       It is true that the majority of the deaths from "acces
sible" cancer are among women — the deaths from "accessible"
cancer among men at Frankfort-on-the-Main being too few to be,
when considered alone, trustworthy — but we know of no reason for
                                                   " accessible "
supposing that, while female cancer of                             parts has re
mained stationary,       male  and  female   cancer  of  the other  parts of the
body has really increased.
   The general conclusions arrived at are that—
   1. Males and females suffer equally from cancer in those parts of
the body common to man and woman, the greater prevalence of
cancer among females being due entirely to cancer of the sexual
organs.
   2.  The apparent increase in cancer is confined to what we have
called   inaccessible cancer.         This is shown (a) by the Frankfort
figures ; (o) by the fact that the difference between the rates for
males and females respectively is approximately constant, and does
not progressively increase with the apparent increase in cancer in
each of the sexes ; and (c) because the apparent increase in cancer
among the well-to-do assured lives, who are presumably attended by
medical men of more than average skill, is not so great as amons               the
general population.
   3. The supposed increase in cancer is only apparent, and is due               to

    Appropriate      excitation of the afferent nerves from the flexor
muscles of     the  knee joint so alters, as I have shown,* the condition
of the extensor muscles of that joint that the reaction called the " knee
       "
jerk becomes no longer elicitable.             I  have endeavoured to examine
the quality of the alteration which thus restrains or abolishes the
" jerk."
    It  must be remembered that there is some variance of opinion as
to the nature of the jerk itself.         In the opinion of some authorities
the jerk is of reflex nature (Bowditch, Lombard, Senator, Warren) ;
in the opinion of others it is not truly reflex, but is a direct muscular
reaction,    intimately     dependent, however,        on a reflex tonus in the
muscle     (Tschiriew), or on a spinal influence reflexly exerted, but
not necessarily identical with " tonus
                                                 "
                                                    nor necessarily measurable
by tonicity (Waller).
    On the reflex theory of the "jerk," its disappearance or decrease
under excitation      of the sensory nerve from its antagonistic muscles
tallies with phenomena of the mutual interference of spinal activities
such as are exemplified perhaps most clearly by those experiments of
 Goltz, in which, after section of the spinal cord in the thoracic region,
the act of micturition could be cut short by strong stimulation of the
 skin of the tail. On the view that the jerk is not itself reflex, but
depends on a reflex tonus, the abeyance of the phenomenon under
excitation of the afferent fibres of the hamstring nerve might be
 owing to decrease thus induced in the tonus of the vasto-crureus
 muscle, just as on the same view abolition of the jerk by cutting the
 sensory roots of the crural nerve is due to the impairment thus pro
duced in the tonicity.
    As a step toward determining between these two possibilities, I have
 attempted to discover whether afferent impulses ascending from the
 hamstring muscles affect to any considerable extent the tonus of the
 antagonistic quadriceps extensor.           Complete abeyance of the "jerk"
 under excitation of the hamstring nerve cannot, so far as I have seen,
 be long maintained.          After a longer or shorter interval the jerk

 returns.     Soon after discontinuance of the stimulation the jerk not
 only   returns, but becomes markedly exaggerated.                   Though abolition
 or decrease of the jerk is thus temporary, exaltation conversely pro
 duced by severance of the hamstring nerve is permanent, lasting at
 least for some weeks. On the tonicity hypothesis concerning the
 jerk, exaltation of the jerk by section of the hamstring nerve should
 be accompanied       by a concurrent       increase in the tonus of the vasto-
 crureus muscle.
    It is not easy to judge slight differences in tonus of muscles even
 where of the fellow muscles of the two sides of the body one normal
 muscle is available as standard for comparison.                      Yet any decided
 difference of tonus must, if multiplied into a sufficient time, amount
 to a not inconsiderable difference in the chemical condition of the
 muscle. I have therefore sought to test what influence, if any, section
of the hamstring nerve exerts on the extensor muscle of the joint as
judged of by the development of rigor mortis in that muscle.
    In muscles paralysed by section of their nerves, onset of post
mortem rigidity is delayed (Kolliker,* Brown-Sequardf).                    BierfreundJ
has found    that after semisection of the spinal cord made a few hours
 before death the onset of rigor in the limbs on the side of section is
 considerably later than on the opposite side. Inasmuch as depression
 of tonus is an alteration in the direction of this paralysis,                   I hoped
 that time of onset of rigor mortis might serve to indicate whether,
cccteris paribus, decrease or increase of tonus had obtained              in the  muscle
for the period immediately preceding               death. A few experiments on
the influence of nerve section upon speed of onset of rigor mortis gave
results accordant with the original by Brown-Sequard and Kolliker.
I  then turned to the division of, instead of muscular nerves, the
anterior roots supplying the muscles.                  Experiments made on the
hind limb of the Cat showed           the  effect   of section of the anterior roots
to be a marked delay in the onset of rigor in the muscles supplied by
them. The effect was clear, even if the roots were cut only five
minutes before killing the animal.              I  then experimented on division
of the posterior roots.        The posterior roots of the 6th, 7th, and 8th
post-thoracic nerves of one side were severed. In result the ham
string muscles of the corresponding side became rigid later than did
those of the opposite side, even in an experiment iu which the animal
was killed only a quarter of an hour after section of the roots. The
effect of section of these sensory roots after previous severance of the
cord at the 1st lumbar segment was then examined.                       The severance
of the cord, as was to be expected, deferred considerably the onset of
rigor mortis in both of the hind limbs. It appeared also to decidedly

 reduce the difference between the time of onset of the rigor in the two
 hind limbs ; but still, in each case, the hamstring muscles on the
 side corresponding     to the section of the posterior roots entered
 rigidity later than in the fellow limb. The effect of section of the
 hamstring branch of the sciatic trunk upon the time of onset of
 rigor in the extensors of the knee, the cord having been previously
 divided at the 1st lumbar (segment, was then proceeded to. Twelve
 experiments were made, but the results obtained were conflicting.
 In seven of these experiments rigor commenced in the extensor of
 the side on which the nerve had not been cut before it did in the
 extensor of the opposite side. In three rigor commenced indubitably
 rather earlier on the side of nerve section than on the opposite. In
 two   I  could not detect that there was any difference between the
 two sides in the time of onset of the rigor.          A point noted in
 nine of these experiments (it was not looked for in the remaining
 three) may be mentioned. When death is induced by haemorrhage,
 the cord having a short time previously been severed at the top of
 the lumbar region, various reflexes can be elicited from the hind
 limbs and tail for some little time after respiratory spasms and all
 reflexes have vanished from the body in front of the level of the
 section.   There is in the Cat an ear reflex which generally outlasts
 others under chloroform or ether administration, and often out
 lasts them by a considerable time. Indeed, so soon as this reflex has
 disappeared, the respiratory movements are reduced to a dangerous
 extent.    It consists in a laying back of the pinna of the ear, the
 pinna    being  frequently twitched several times: it is elicited by
 sharply twisting the tip of the pinna. The corneal reflex and still
 more the knee jerk are both extinguished by chloroform and ether
for some time before this ear reflex disappears. This reflex may in
the Cat, like Dastre's reflex from the gum of the upper jaw in the Dog,
be termed the reflexus ultimus.       But when death is induced in the
manner     above mentioned,  the  knee jerk outlasts the ear reflex by as
long in some experiments as four or five minutes ; and in the limb
in which the hamstring nerve has been divided the jerk persists
loDgor than in the fellow limb.
    Finally, I examined the effect of bandaging one knee in full ex
tension, the other in full flexion, after previously severing the r:ord at
the 1st lumbar segment. The bandages after an interval were re
moved.      The jerk on each side was then found to be good, and
rather brisker in the knee that had been flexed than in that which
had been extended.         Death was induced by haemorrhage.            No
difference between the time of disappearance of the jerk on the two
sides was detected.       In each of five experiments performed the
qnadriceps extensor and the crural muscles became rigid later on the
side that had been flexed than on the other side, but the hamstring

muscles became rigid earlier in the leg that had been flexed than in
the other.      This is not what might have been expected in view of
 Wundt's* observation that tension in a mnscle hastens rigor in it.
It must be remembered that Wundt's statement is not based on
muscle in situ, intact and connected with the spinal cord.                The
observed     fact  harmonises   with   the  existence of an augmentation of
tonus of extensors in result of excitation of the afferent nerves from
their opponent group.
   The experiments so far therefore seem to indicate that the direc
tion of the change induced in the extensor muscles by afferent im
pulses ascending from the flexors is in the direction of increased
tonicity, and to strengthen the supposition that the interference with
the "jerk
              " is located in the                             " jerk."
                                   spinal mechanism of the
   The marked influence exerted reflexly by the flexors of the knee
upou the extensors of that joint suggested search for instances of
analogous correlation elsewhere.           The delicately correlated muscles
of the eyeball offer an experimental advantage in that even slight
alterations     of their length can be readily observed by inspection.
I therefore exposed the inferior oblique muscle (Cat and Monkey),
completely detached it from the globus, and then observed the effect
of lightly drawing upon it, so as to stretch it between the end held
and the end attached to the bony floor of the orbit. Reflex actions
were in this way easily obtained, but were inconstant in character ;
the eyeballs were generally moved, perhaps most frequently conju-
gately, toward the side corresponding to the stretched muscle.
I watched especially to see whether the globes were turned upward
or downward, but those movements were far less frequent than move
ments apparently purely lateral.          Sometimes the reflex obtained did
not affect the eyes at all ; the movement was often a pricking of the
par, either    with movement of the eyes or apart from eye movement.
Twice the muscle was detached altogether with careful avoidance of
injury to its nerve and blood vessel ; held between two ivory-tipped
forceps, it was then gently stretched.         The results were the same as
when its one end retained the natural attachment.               In all cases,
section of the nerve which enters its posterior border to supply it
immediately abolished all reply.          This nerve is relatively long and
easily   isolable.    Electrical  excitation  of it can be performed with
facility ; a weak tetanising current applied to its central end pro
duced the- same variable movements as did the stretching of the
muscle itself, but apparently less readily.
   The inferior oblique muscle was employed for these observations
because it can be freely isolated with little injury and displacement
of other structures, and becanse of the length of the nerve branch
supplying it. I should have preferred, otherwise, to use the externus

rectus, because of the simplicity of its antagonistic coupling with the
internal rectus. But the external rectus it is not easy without dis
turbance of other parts to isolate sufficiently to feel certain that
tension put upon it remains confined to it alone. I adopted, therefore,
for examining the antagonism of the external and internal recti the
method of paralysing one and then examining the activities of the
other.  When examining in the Monkey the movements of the digits
obtainable by cortical excitation, if movement, e.g., flexion, of the
hallux or pollex is elicited, and the nerve to the flexors of the digit
be then severed, renewed cortical excitation at the same spot still
produces a movement ;* this movement is generally in direction the
reverse of that previously obtained ; this " reversal
                                                      "          is,
                                                          however, not
invariably obtained  occasionally there results a feeble movement in
                      ;
the same direction as the movement previously obtained.       In three
experiments this movement has been so decided as to lead one to re
examine carefully the site of division of the peripheral nerve in order
to assure oneself that   had been really severed completely.
                           it                                    The
persistence of movement in the same direction as before the flexor
nerves are severed must indicate that the stimulation applied to the
cortex produces at each repetition an inhibition of the tonus of the
muscles antagonistic to the flexors, that    to say, of the extensor
                                                   is
muscles. My experience    of this inhibition    that    cannot, even
                                                        is      it
when    itoccurs, be demonstrated many times in succession.        The
phenomenon of reversal is, on the other hand, obtained repeatedly
with facility.
  A power to inhibit the activity of striated musole has, therefore, to
be included among the attributes      of the " motor
                                                      " cortex of the
hemisphere.    In the coordination of the movements of the eyeballs                 it
appears to play an important and easily demonstrable part. Ferrierf
discovered that excitation of a particular portion of this cortex pro
duces a conjugate movement of both eyeballs in a direotion away
from the hemisphere in which the stimulation is employed.         If the
appropriate area of the cortex of the left hemisphere b© excited the
movement     isof both eyeballs to the right. My enquiry regarding
the correlation of action of the antagonistic internal and external
recti in this movement may be stated as three questions. Is the
movement carried out       :
   a. By contraction of the left internal rectus and the right external
rectus, their antagonist muscles undergoing the while simply passive
traction ;

   The plan of experiment adopted has been as follows : — The appro
priate portion of the left cortex having been ascertained by excitation,
and having assured myself that the desired conjugate deviation is
regularly obtained, I at once sever the 3rd and 4th cranial nerves
of the left side between their origin and the point of their entrance
into the cavernous sinus.   The position of the left eyeball in rest            is,
immediately   after performance of that section, scarcely perceptibly
different from what       has been before, nor
                             it                    usually the pupil

is   still conjugate deviation of both eyeballsto the right.   The right
globus appears   to  move   exactly as  before  the;left globus, on close
examination, although it moves, clearly does not move as      did before.
                                                                  it

                                                                   is

                   ;
together. Sometimes the movement of the left eye, instead of starting
later than that of the right, starts simultaneously with      sometimes
                                                                  it

it starts distinctly earlier, and this especially when the external
squint that soon appears has become well developed. But the move
ment     never seen quite so rapid or so ample as that of the right
            is
eye.        On excitation of the corresponding part of the right cortex        the
movement of the left eye outwards may be very slight, especially                if
there be marked outward strabismus      in two experiments there fre

quently   occurred on excitation of the right cortex together with the
usual movement of the right eye to the left a movement of the left
eye to the right and sometimes, apparently, to beyond the primary
position.   A few times a double movement occurred, the left globus
at first moving to the left conjugately with the right, and then
suddenly reversing its movement and turning inwards to the right.
At                       of the excitation of the right cortex when the
       each discontinuance
eyeballs have reacted by conjugate movement to the left, the left does
not return so quickly as the right    indeed

 well as from Ferrier's " motor

                                       region, can the tonus of the external
 rectus be inhibited in the orbit of the same side as the hemisphere
 stimulated after the 3rd cranial nerve of that side has been cut
 throogh.
     An extremely interesting observation has recently been made by
 Mott and Schafer.*        Experimenting fiogether, they have seen that
 by simultaneous excitation of the frontal cortex of both right and left
 hemispheres the two eyeballs can be set approximately in the primary
 position, sometimes with a slight degree of convergence.               I have, in
 two Bonnet Monkeys, repeated this experiment after having pre
viously performed section of both right and left 3rd nerves and both
right and left 4th nerves at their origin from the brain.                After the
 section there was considerable double divergent squint, and in one of
 the experiments the strabismus of the left eye was distinctly the
greater in degree.      The effect of simultaneous bilateral excitation,
 approximately balanced, of the frontal cortex was to cause both eyes
 to be rotated inwards up to, and certainly in some trials beyond, the
primary position.      The double divergent squint was converted iuto
a slight degree of convergence.         Here, where the external recti were
the dnly ocular muscles still connected with the central nervous
system, convergence must have been due to simultaneous bilateral
inhibition of the tonus of the right and left external recti. It is
difficult to find any other interpretation for these results than that
the excitation    of the cerebral cortex, just as        it occasionally inhibits
the tonus of the muscles of the thumb             or hallux, also   possesses  the
power of inhibiting the tonus of ocular muscles, at least of the
external straight muscle. Further, it would seem that this inhibitory
activity of the cortex is more constantly elicitable experimentally in
the case of the muscles of the eyeball than in the case of those of the
hand and foot.       That the cerebrum nominally exerts a more or less
tonic inhibitory influence over the lower local centres subserving
muscular     tonicity and local muscular reflex action is a widely
accepted    doctrine.   The above observations accord with and, as I
think, extend the data for such a belief.
    The above experimental results may, it seems to me, be all of them
explained on an hypothesis that the cerebral cortex can inhibit
muscular tonus and reduce it even to paralysation limit ; but it does
not seem necessary to suppose that the cortex, although it can thus
inhibit tonus in striped muscle, can also inhibit the active contraction
of it. This second assumption seems necessary, however, to explain
the following result.     If, after section of both right and left 3rd and
right and left 4th nerves, the left frontal cortex be excited and both
eyes made to deviate to the       right, excitation of the right cortex (the
                            * 'Brain,'  vol. 17, p. 165.

 experiment has not succeeded unless this stimulation be somewhat
strong) will not unfrequently cause the right eye to move inwards
and sometimes fully up to the primary position.                      The active con
traction of the external rectus appears to be cut short and even con
verted into a condition of relaxation more complete than when no
cortical excitation at all is being employed.
   I have watched with interest in Macacus the voluntary movements
of the eyes after section of the 3rd and 4th nerves. In the early
hours after the section, if for instance these nerves have been cut
on the left side only, the gaze is readily directed to the left bat not
so readily to the right.         There arises, of course, considerable external
squint    of  the   left eye.    Neither when the right is directed toward
the right nor when it is converged upon a light or other object just
in front of the face is there more than a mere trace of movement
of the left eye. Twenty-four or forty-eight hours later, when the
right eye is turned to right the left eye does perform the conjugate
movement, but imperfectly, and more imperfectly and also more
variably than under experimental excitation of the frontal cortex.
   Another instance in which antagonistic correlation may be examined
is that of the muscles which close and open the palpebral aperture.
These are at least potentially antagonistic.                    I find that in s the
Monkey excitation of the 3rd nerve in the cranium slightly depresses
the lower eyelid at the same time that it freely raises the upper.
This slight depression, often very slight indeed, is abolished by
section of the branch of the 3rd to the inferior rectus muscle.                  The
3rd nerve (leaving out of consideration the cervical sympathetic, the
action of which in opening the eye, as regards speed, direction of
movement, and other characters, is different from the opening obtain
able from the cortex) may be termed the nerve which opens the
palpebral aperture.          The 7th is the only nerve which closes             if by
active muscular contraction.
   This latter statement applies- to the Monkey, not to the Cat, because in the Cat,
after section of the 7th nerve ab the stylomastoid foramen, I find that, although the
upper and lower lids remain permanently rather widely apart, the third eyelid
(membrana nictitans) shuts at short intervals with an extremely rapid sseep com
pletely over the exposed part of the globus ; and when after section of the 7th
the animal sleeps the nictitating membrane is partially extended over the front of
the ball. The third eyelid is therefore not innervated like the upper and lower
from the 7th. Langley and Anderson^ record that it is not innervated from the 4th,
probably not from the 3rd, but that excitation of the 6th causes " great protrusion
of it"
   If, after section of the 3rd, the appropriate                part of the frontal
cortex be excited either on the same side as the nerve cut or on the
opposite side I find no movement at all result in the lids on the side

corresponding to the nerve   section, although the opening of the eye
the other side is each time  quick and wide.   That is to say, there is
in this instance no evidence of concomitant activity of the antagonistic
muscle, either in the sense  of contraction or of relaxation.    But on
shifting the electrodes to the suitable point of the cortex the eyes of
both sides reply to the excitation by a sharp closure just as usual.
   The well-known dilatation of the pupil elicitable from this region
of the cortex might, in view of the above-described examples of in
hibition from the cortex, perhaps, be supposed to be related rather to
an inhibition of the constrictor action of the 3rd nerve than to
cortical augmentation of the influence kept up via the cervical sym
pathetic.   The dilatation of the pupil under excitation of the frontal
cortex certainly is much later in onset than are the movements of the
extrinsic ocular muscles, but that difference might be based on the
difference in time of response of the two kinds of muscular fibres in
volved.   This supposition is, however, negatived by the fact that
division of the cervical sympathetic cut out dilatation that was being
regularly elicited from the cortex, the 3rd nerve being undivided,
in two experiments     I made to test the point.   In these instances,
therefore, although an extreme dilatation was obtained with, for the
cortex, quite weak currents, the cortex reacted by discharge directed
through the sympathetic system.
                       Addition.     April 20, 1893.
    Iwould add to the above the following remarkable passage, which
I find in ' The Anatomy and Physiology of the Human Body,' by
Charles and John Bell (London, 1826, vol. 3).       In describing the
action of the muscles of the eye, the author, after adverting to some
experiments made by himself on the functions of the 4th cranial
nerve, says : —
   " We have seen that the effect of dividing the superior oblique was
to cause the eye to roll more forcibly upwards ; and if we suppose
                                       it is,
that the influence of the 4th nerve    on certain occasions, to canse   a
relaxation of the muscle to which       goes, the eyeball must be then
rolled upwards.
   " The nerves have been considered so
                                            generally as instruments for
stimulating the muscles, without thought of their acting in the oppo
site capacity, that some additional illustration may be necessary here.
Through the nerves         is established the connection between the
muscles, not only that connection by which muscles combine to one
effort, but also that relation between the classes of muscles by which
the one relaxes and the other contracts.        Iappended a weight to a
tendon   of an  extensor    muscle,  which gently stretched   and drew
                                                              it
out the muscle   ;   and
                       I    found   that the contraction   of the opponent

416                Dr. C. S. Sherrington.      Note on the         [May 4,
flexor was attended with a descent of the weight, which indicated
the relaxation of the extensor.      To establish this connection between
two classes of muscles whether they be grouped near together, as in
the limbs, or scattered widely as the muscles of respiration, there
must be particular and appropriate nerves to form this double bond,
to cause them to conspire in relaxation as well as to combine in con
traction.    If such a relationship be established, through the distribu
tion of the nerves, between the muscles of the eyelids and the
superior oblique muscles of the eyeball, the one will relax while the
other contracts."
    My experiments      described above show the correctuess of Bell 'a
supposition,    at  least as regards the external straight muscles, and
that the phenomenon of inhibition of activity under volition and under
appropriate cortical faradisation is not confined among the ocular
group of muscles to the recti externi, the observations made seem to
prove.    For instance,   I have divided the 6th cranial nerve of the left
side at its origin from the brain, and then examined the behaviour of
the eyeballs under suitable experimental conditions.          The position
immediately assumed by the eyeballs was that of slight convergence
even   when under anaesthesia (not very deep).           Subsequently the
internal strabismus increased somewhat, to disappear, or almost dis
appear, when the gaze was voluntarily turned to the right, but to be
greatly increased (i.e., the angle at which the optic axes crossed
becoming great) when the gaze was directed to the left.            The left
eye   under   volitional  movement    frequently  rotated  from  the  inner
canthus outward conjugately with the right, but never passed beyond
the primary (median, straight-forward) position.         On the gaze being
directed from the median primary position toward the right, the left
eye rotated conjugately with the right eye usually with an apparently
perfect symmetry of motion, but not unfrequently with a movement
slower and less ample than the right.          On the gaze being directed
from the median primary position toward the left, the left eye did
not move at all, while the right eye moved of course normally.           It
 was frequently seen that the eyes remained turned to the right,
 apparently resting in that direction ; it was so generally when the
 animal was sleepy or dozing.         When the gaze was directed from
 that position over to the left, the movement of the left eye was not
 unfrequently, so far as could be seen, perfectly conjugated and sym
metrical with that of the right eye, as far as up to the middle line of
the palpebral fissure ; there it stopped short, while the right eye
went a variable distance further.
    On excitation of the appropriate part of the frontal cortex of the
right side, both eyes being in the primary position or with a slight
degree of convergence       at the commencement of the excitation, the
 right eye swept sharply     to the left, and the left either did not move

  1893.]        Correlation    of Action of Antagonistic      Muscles.          417
 or merely shifted sluggishly up to the full primary position.                   On
 excitation of the frontal area of the cortex of the left hemisphere
 both eyes were directed to the right, the left eye sometimes moving
 sluggishly as compared with the right; after cessation of the excita
 tion, the right eye would frequently return at once to approximately
 the primary median position, while the left eye did not return for a
 considerable time, and did so in a slow unequal manner; frequently,
 however, both eyes remained for a long time steadily directly toward
 the right, and under anaesthesia that seemed to be almost as frequent
 a   position for them to assume as was one approximating                   to the
 median primary.          When the right frontal cortex was faradised, the
 eyes resting at the commencement of the excitation in a direction
towards the right, the right eye swept over sharply to the left, some
times with an upward inclination also, more rarely with a down
 ward ; movement of the left eye invariably accompanied this move
 ment of the right, and with a corresponding                inclination, but the
 movement of the left eye often started late, and was almost in
 variably slow and feeble as compared with that of the right, and it
 was also the more variable.            When both eyes had been directed to
the right by excitation of the left frontal cortex, and directly after
the left side excitation         had ceased, the right frontal cortex was
excited, both eyes turned toward the left, but the left eye never
overshot the primary median plane.              When the two eyes had been
directed to the right by moderate faradisation of the left frontal
cortex, a somewhat strong faradisation of the right frontal cortex,
the    moderate faradisation       of the left side being still continued,
caused the left globus, and         the right, to be turned toward the left,
but the right eye generally          started earlier and moved more quickly
than the left, and the left,         although sometimes brought up to the
primary position, was sometimes only slightly turned towards it.*
When a moderate excitation of the right frontal cortex had turned
the right eye to the left and brought the left to the full median
position, moderate faradisation of the left frontal cortex (the
excitation of the right side still continuing) turned the left eye to the
right so    as to produce convergent squint; stronger faradisation of the
left cortex successive to and concurrently with moderate faradisation
of the right directed both eyes to the right.                  In two instances
moderate excitation of the right cortex alone, near the angle of the
precentral sulcus, caused the right eye to be turned to the left, and
the left eye to be turned to the right, so that strong convergence
resulted.
   *  A  notable dilatation of both pupils sometimes occurred in this combination
experiment.     Neither the left nor the right faradisation produced by itself any  .
dilatation of either pupil, but on the second electrodes being applied considerable
dilatation of both pupils followed. There was no epilepsy.

418                  Dr. C. S. Sherrington.    Note on   the       [May   4,
    Faradisation of the left occipital cortex directed both eyes to
the right with a slight downward or slight upward inclination or
without any inclination, according to the area excited (Schafer,
Mank).       Faradisation of the right occipital cortex, if both eyes were
approximately in the primary position, cansed the right eye to be
slowly and steadily turned to the left, and the left eye to be steadily
brought fully up to the medium primary position if it were not
already in it ; if already fully in the primary position the left eyeball
did not move at all. If the left eye moved at all it very generally
started its movement distinctly before the right eye and appeared to
rotate less slowly than did the right.      This difference was best seen
if  the eyes were previous to the excitation resting in a direction to
the right.        On then faradising with weak or moderate currents
 the left occipital cortex the steady slow rotation of the left eye
 commenced so much before that of the right that sometimes the
 left had travelled half-way to the primary position before the right
 eye had well started.      Under excitation of the right occipital cortex
 the movement of the left eye toward the left seemed so clearly
 stronger, sharper in starting, and even quicker and steadier than
 under excitation of the right frontal cortex, that I attempted to
 balance it against the movement to the right produced from the left
 frontal cortex.      On each occasion, when tested, I found that, the two
 eyes being kept directed to the right by moderate excitation of the left
 frontal cortex, they could be sent over to the left again by moderate
 or strong excitation of the right occipital cortex, and in each instance
 the left or paralysed eye was again the first to start travelling. Three
 similar experiments gave results quite similar to the above in the
 points mentioned here.
     In two experiments, one on a small Rhesus and one on a large
  Sinicus, I have combined with section of the left 6th nerve section of
  the left 4th nerve at its exit from the brain. The results obtained
 agreed in many respects with those obtained when the 6th nerve
 alone was severed. Points of difference were the following : — In the
 median position of rest the left eye was turned slightly upward as
 well as inward.       On excitation of the right frontal cortex, the eyes
 starting in the primary position, the right eye was turned to the left
 side and the left eye was turned upward, more or less amply, rarely
  not at all ; the left eye was never observed to rotate to the left beyond
 the primary median position.        When particular points in the right
 frontal cortex had     been found which directed  the eyes not merely to
 the left but upwards also, on stimulation being applied the left eye was
 turned upward to a greater degree than was the right.         When places
 were found in the right frontal cortex which directed the right eyeball
  downward as well as to the left, occasionally the left eye moved a little
  downwards     ;  more usually it moved distinctly upwards, so that   there

1893.]         Correlation of Action of Antagonistic Muscles.                     419
was strong divergence of the optic axes in the vertical plane, with the
right pupil depressed, the left pupil elevated sometimes considerably.
The same held true in the results of excitation of the occipital regions
of the cortex, and the left eye generally commenced movement under
excitation of the right occipital cortex distinctly earlier than did the
right eye, just as when the 6th nerve alone had been divided ; so that
under excitation of the right occipital cortex there was usually at one
phase of the movement instead of any convergence of the optic axes
a strong divergence of them.
   It was noticeable that after division of the 6th nerve, either alone
or in conjunction with the 4th, also in one experiment in conjunc
tion with the 5th, the pupil of the eye on the same side as the nerve
section was slightly but distinctly larger than in the opposite eye.
This observation led me to stimulate the 6th root in the Monkey, but,
although the eye was in result moved outwards, I could not satisfy
myself that any oonstriction of pupil at all occurred, although the
pupil was well dilated at the time.. In the case of the internal
                     I
straight muscle, believed it would be less easy to sever its antago
nist's nerve than in the case of the antagonist of the external rectus.
I therefore made several earlier experiments, employing section of
the external rectus and its nerve inside the orbit.   The above de
scription   however, not based on the results of those earlier experi
             is,
ments in which the orbit was opened, because (I) It was found then
                                                      :
impossible to be quite certain that some remnant of movement or drag
in the muscle could not affect the globus sufficiently to simulate the
movement that might result from a relaxation of the antagonistic
muscle   ;(2) because when once the orbit has been opened, or its
contents dissected, the movements of the globus are deranged suffi
ciently   to besetwith doubt any interpretation that can be put upon
them ;  (3) finally, because destruction of the muscles or their nerves
in the orbit or cavernous sinus involves destruction also of concomi
tant sensory fibres from the 5th nerve which may exert a consider
able influence on the antagonistic muscle, the subject of observation.
I would add, however, that the results obtained in my earlier experi
ments did, though open to these objections, seem to accord with those
I have obtained after sections at the base of the brain   may be that
                                                                   ;   it
the harmony        between   the two sets   is   superficial   rather       than real.
The experiments from which the results related here are quoted are
only those in which neither the orbit nor the cavernous sinus was
opened at all.
  It appears, therefore, that the activity of the internal straight
muscle can be directly inhibited by appropriate excitation of certain
parts of the frontal cortex, still better of the oecipital cortex, of
the hemisphere of the side opposite to the muscle and the inhibi

straight muscle by similar regions of the cortex of the same side as
the muscle.       A point of difference — and it is a suggestive one — be
tween the two cases appears to be that under inhibitory relaxation of
the rectus externus from cortical excitation the globus may rotate
beyond the middle line of the palpebral                  fissure, whereas under
cortical relaxation of the rectus internus the eyeball may travel up to
that middle line, but very rarely, if ever, trespasses beyond it.
    It thus seems clear that by experiment abundant support can                    be
obtained for the supposition put forward by Charles Bell.

  From this it is clear that     d0n,  the coefficient of the highest power
of (ir— p), satisfies the differential equation 02/ = 0, and that the whole
expansion can be fonnd if d<t*sis known.
   On this account I call </0o the source or matrix of the covariant,
and investigate the solutions of Ot/ = 0.
   It is next proved that

and hence that, if is a homogeneous, isobaric f onction of Ot, Ot,. • . . ,
such that Os/ = 0, and that 2w—dz = 0, then dfjdx is equally a solu
tion of O2/ = 0.
  If we know two solutions of O2/ = 0, solutions of all higher orders
can then be educed by the process here implied.
  Ot = 0 on expansion becomes
                                                  r\

   The educts successively found by this method are, however, not
generally irreducible, and it is shown how to find the irreducible
solutions for the successive orders, which are written u?, u. u5, Ac.
Any common solution of 02/ = 0 and O,/ = 0 is a differential inva
riant, and not the matrix of a covariant.     For the second and fifth
orders, the seventh and all orders higher than the seventh, there is a
differential invariant, and for the sixth there is a common solution of
n2/ = 0 and Q,f = 0, which I write L«. It is the matrix of a straight
line through x, y, and all matrices may be expressed as functions of
ut, L6, and differential invariants.   The order of the covariant can
be inferred from the mode in which ut and h, enter the matrix.

  If   the systems of coefficients are subjected to a reciprocal        trans
formation, of which af— ir— 7 = 0 may be taken as the typical
relation, there is this relation between the operators Oi and CX2— if «
is a solution of either Qtf = 0 or O2/ = 0 in which Ot, Ot, . . . . , are
the arguments, and if, in consequence of the substitution for these
qualities of A>, A3, .... (similar functions of the correlative system
of coordinates), « becomes U, then TJ is a solution of the other
corresponding equation, that       of O>F =

 Or, briefly,   we may say the result is the interchange of the operators
 Q, ond Qj.      Regarded as functions of Aj, Aj, &c., the coefficients in a
 contravariant     are developed from a    matrix satisfying OjF  == 0,  by the
 process which has been already described.             Regarded as a function
 of O], aj, &c., they are derived from a matrix satisfying Q,f = 0, by a
 process which differs from that previously described by the inter
 change of the operators Qi and Qj. Any function of the coefficients
 in a covariant     function which would be an invariant for a change of
 coordinates, but not for a homographic transformation,           will be the
 matrix of a contravariant function.         The matrix of the reciprocal is
 the discriminant of the highest group of homogeneous terms in r
 and f treated as a binary quantic.
                                         §4.
    To apply these results to the cubic osculating the standard curve
at the point (x, y), remove the origin temporarily to that point. The
condition of intersecting the standard curve in a number of points
coincident with this temporary origin is an invariantal relation, and
we may treat the coefficients in the equation as if they contained
differential invariants only.

    For the inception of the following work, which it is hoped will add
some    further facts to our knowledge of the most important of the
"
   deep reflexes," the knee jerk,          I  am greatly indebted to the very
kind suggestions of Dr. Hughlings-.Tackson.              To him I owe my best
thanks for proposing the -question of the influence of the asphyxial
    * Part of the expenses connected with this experimental investigation have been
defrayed by a grant from the Scientific Grants Committee of the British Medical
Association.

1893.]             the Normal State        of the Knee Jerk is  altered.         431
state on the knee phenomenon, as a subject likely to be fruitful.
The adoption of his early advice led to the investigation of many
other points of noteworthy interest.                   I am also much obliged to
Professor Horsley for suggestions, especially with regard to control
experiments and operative procedures.
    Since Brown-Sequard* described the condition expressed by him
under the term spinal epilepsy, the so-called deep or tendon reflexes
have attracted considerable attention, and have been the object of
numerous investigations.
    Charcot and Vulpianf were the first to accurately describe the
phenomenon known as ankle clonus.
   Bouchard^ next observed the arm reflexes, and Erb§ and Westphal
simultaneously directed their attention to the contraction of the
quadriceps extensor which follows percussion of its tendon.                      Erb
looked on the phenomenon as a reflex, while Westphal considered it
the result of direct excitation of the muscle percussed or pulled at
its extremity.
   Joffroy endeavoured              to prove that cutaneous excitation          often
evoked the phenomenon, and this view was not refuted until it was
shown that it could be evoked in animals by percussion of the
denuded tendon.
   Westphal pinched, pricked, and irritated the skin in various ways
without producing the knee jerk ; a fold of skin lifted away from the
tendon and subjected to blows with a hammer was attended with a
like negative result.            On the other hand, when the skin lying over
the ligamentum          patellse   was frozen by means of Richardson's process
the contraction which followed a blow on the tendon was in no way
lessened ; nor was it where cutaneous anaesthesia existed in non-
tabetic cases.
   It soon became evident to observers that the knee jerk is a normal
phenomenon, while ankle clonus is only met with in association with
abnormal states ; but there was some discrepancy of opinion as to
whether the knee jerk is always present in healthy subjects. Berger||
noted its absence in 1"567 per cent. of normal individuals ; while in
over 200 instances Euleuberger^f never failed to elicit it in the newly
born at various ages, and Gowers** states that it is probably never
absent in health.

   Westphal* connected for the first time the absence of the phe
nomenon with sclerosis of the posterior region of the lumbar cord,
and Petitclercf showed that it is also absent when the anterior
roots of the spinal nerves are affected. It was about this time that
BuzzardJ called attention to the fact that in conditions where the
knee jerk is absent the response of the vastus internus muscle to
direct percussion may be actually more brisk than in health.
   Exaltation of the tendon reflexes was recognised by numerous ob
servers as existing where muscular spasm, contracture, and " epi-
leptoid trepidation" are present, and that these conditions are asso
ciated with sclerosis of the pyramidal tracts of the spinal cord.
   In the investigation of afferent nerves in tendons and such as
would form the first part of a reflex loop, Tschiriew§ is generally
supposed to be the first observer who discovered nerve fibres, without
myeline, which terminate in the aponeuroses in the neighbourhood of
tendons, which he looked on as the organs of transmission of the
muscular sense.     These centripetal nerves had, however, previously
been noticed, but imperfectly described, by Sachs.     And Golgijj and
his pupil Cattaneo^f fully described the nerve endings in tendons;
and, although Golgi's completed work did not appear until 1880, his
first publication on the subject was three years prior to this.
  Nothnagel** found that when clonus existed it could be arrested
instantly by pressure on the anterior crural or sciatic nerve, and that
pressure on the former nerve stopped the movements in the territory
of the sciatic as well as in its own, and that pressure on the nerves of
one   side puts an end to the phenomenon on the opposite side.
Lewinskift further showed that in cases of contracture with exalted
reflexes increase of the tendon of the tension of the contracted muscle,
however brought about, would evoke clonus, as would excitation of
the nerve supplying the muscle with a moderate induced current ;
while cutaneous stimulation by pinching the skin, or by squeezing the
toes or fingers, would arrest               it,
                                  as would excitation of the nerve sup
plying the muscle with a strong induced current. If the tendon                        was
first rendered lax, none of the methods which formerly evoked                         tlie
clonns would do so.

1893.]           the  Normal State of       the  Knee    Jerk  is altered.        433
    Burckhardt,* in attempting to prove that the phenomenon is a
reflex, measured the time which elapsed between the percussion of
the tendon and the resulting muscular contraction.                     His investiga
tions led him to the conclusion that it is a reflex which is produced
in the spinal ganglia and not in the cord. Following him, numerous
investigators endeavoured to determine the time which elapses be
tween the stroke and the contraction.
    Brissaud,f with Franck, measured the time very exactly in healthy
persons, and also in those the subjects of disease.                   These observers
found that 0"05 second elapses in healthy subjects, but that it
varies from time to time in the same individual, and is modified by
conditions which alter the excito-motor properties of the spinal cord.
When the lateral columns of the cord are sclerosed the time is
diminished ; it is the same on the two sides in a healthy subject, but
is less on that side when one lateral column is more sclerosed than its
fellow.
    Dejerine'sJ observations and Ter-Meulen's§ researches furnished
very similar results.
    Gowers,|| who registered              the movement of the limb in his
observations, concluded that O09 to O015 second is the time which
elapses between the stroke on the tendon and the resulting move
ment of the limb, which time is sufficient to allow a reflex to occur.
Percussion of the tibialis anticus gave a response in 0-03 to 0-04
second, which is not sufficient for a cord reflex.                 He therefore con
cluded that ankle clonus is a phenomenon of direct excitation, while
the knee jerk is to be looked on as a reflex.
     Wallerf found that the time which elapsed between percussion of
the tendo Achillisand contraction of the gastrocnemius was 0-3 to 0-4
second, and in the case of the quadriceps extensor and its tendon
0-3 to 0-4 second. While admitting the necessity of the integrity of
the spinal cord for its production, he did not admit its reflex nature,
as the time was too short for a reflex to occur. He looked on the
phenomena as merely peripheral reactions, and only tests of spinal
conditions in the sense that other peripheral reactions of muscles
(electrical or mechanical) are tests of these conditions.
     Since then new facts with regard to the knee jerk have heen re
corded by several observers.

434       Mr.   J.   S. R. Russell.   Circumstances under which   [May    18,
   Hughlings-Jackson* has recorded an instance of exaggeration of
the knee jerk on one side after convnlsions which affected chiefly the
leg on that side. This observer has also published a case in which
the knee jerks, absent in a case in which the posterior columns of the
cord were sclerosed, returned when the lateral pyramidal tracts
became sclerosed consequent on a cerebral haemorrhage.       Dr. Jack
son has also observed that the knee jerks are absent in conditions
attended by hyper-venosity of the blood in man.
   Beevort found that after generalised convulsions in man the knee
jerks were absent or exaggerated according as the convulsions were
very severe or less so, and the former condition he ascribed to ex
haustion of the lumbar centres consequent on their severe discharge
of energy.
   JendrassikJ has furnished us with a valuable method of eliciting
the knee jerk when it appears to J be absent in healthy persons. It
consists in making the person clench the hands or perform some
other violent movement at tho moment when the patella tendon is
struck, when the resulting jerk is found to be increased.        He con
cluded that the knee jerk is a true reflex caused by mechanical
irritation of the nerves in the tendon ; that passive tension of the
muscle is necessary for its production ; that voluntary innervation of
the crural nerve lessens or prevents it ; and that innervation of the
sciatic favours it.
   Weir Mitchell, and Lewis,§ from a large number of investigations
in man, supplemented by a few in dogs and rabbits, concluded that
the knee jerk varies in health, may be exhausted by too much use,
and may increase from frequent excitation.       All volitional acts may
increase it ; and weak innervation of the crural nerve increases         it,
                                                                        as
does any form of innervation of the sciatic, while strong prohibits it.
Continual violent muscular actions, as of both arms and hands,
eventually enfeeble the knee jerk.       Passive tension    not essential
                                                             is
for its production, moderate tension mechanically favours it, and
extreme tension destroys        even in spastic cases.
                                 it                       An act of will
directed to    part functionally inert, or to amputated parts, reinforces
                a
the knee jerk. Strong or weak stimulation of one sciatic in etherised
animals intensifies the knee jerk of the other leg       and pressure on
                                                         ;
the sciatic in man sufficient to cause pain and numbness diminishes
the knee jerk on that side. One knee jerk does not reinforce the
other.    Touch has no effect on it, but all abrupt impressions such as
pain, heat, and cold anywhere on the skin increase it, as does                 a

violent optical impression.             Nitrite of amyl has no effect on the jerk,
 but ether abolishes it in dogs, but has a smaller effect in rabbits.
Faradic currents strong enough to produce contraction of muscles
increase the knee jerk, and stimulation of the dry skin has a like
effect.      Short voltaic currents not strong enough to cause muscles to
contract are attended by the same result, as are voltaic currents
applied to the head, especially the temporal regions and especially
when the negative pole is applied.                 Making is more effectual than
breaking      the  current,    and   the effects soon wear away.        Long ascend
ing galvanic currents to the spine cause marked increase, while
descending cause far less, and moderate currents do not reinforce the
knee jerk. These results led these observers to conclude that the
knee jerk is a direct muscular act, but that it cannot exist without
that spinal contribution known as tone, which is capable of increase
by a variety of causes.             They consider that it cannot be a reflex, as
the latter are inhibited by violent sensory stimulations, which they
have shown increase the knee jerk. An exactly opposite view is that
taken by Lombard,* who observed that the flexors, i.e., the hamstrings,
sometimes contracted when the ligamentum patellae was struck.                       He
concluded       that  the    flexors   were   caused  to contract    by reflex  excita
tion, and that the whole phenomenon was of the same nature.
    Bowditch and Warrenf found that when a voluntary action was
employed to produce exaltation of the knee jerk the reinforcement
wholly depended on the interval between starting of the action and
the incidence of the blow to elicit the jerk. When this was pro
longed, instead of being exalted, the kuee jerk became much reduced ;
the interval at which the effect changes from positive to negative
varied from 0 22 to 0 6 second. The effect of sudden auditory or
visual stimulus was usually positive.                   Tactile stimulation of the
conjunctiva and of the nasal mucous membrane also showed the same
effect.
    BastianJ has recently brought forward striking evidence to prove
that in man total transverse lesion of the spinal cord above tho
lumbar enlargement abolishes, instead of augmenting, the knee jerks,
as is commonly supposed ; and Bowlby§ has supported this view by
the results of his observations in fracture of the spine with crushing
of the cord.
    Buzzard || has met with absence of the knee jerk in man when there
was extravasation of blood into the cranial cavity.

436     Mr.  J.   S. R. Russell.        Circumstances       under which      [May  18,
                    History of Previous Experimental            Work.
   Experimental work directly bearing on the subject commenced
with Schnltz and Ftirbringer,* who noted absence of the knee jerk
after section of the crural nerve or lumbar roots in rabbits.                   A like
result followed the administration of curara.                  They   also showed that
by striking the tendon on one side, under certain circumstances, not
only that knee jerk could be elicited, but also that on the oppo
site side.    The conclusions come to were that it is not the result of
direct irritation of the muscle or its tendon, but a reflex act, the
centre for which is situated in the lower part of the cord, and that
there can be no question of its being in any sense a cutaneous reflex.
   Tschiriewf excited the divided crural nerve electrically in order to
give the muscle tonicity, but never succeeded in obtaining the knee
jerk after it had disappeared on section of the nerve.
   Burckhardt,J experimenting on rabbits, concluded that the dura
tion of the phenomenon is less than the time necessary for a
cutaneous reflex, that it subsists after section of the posterior roots
of the spinal nerves and after destruction of the cord, but that it is
abolished by section of the crural nerve ; hence his belief that it is a
reflex produced in the spinal ganglia and not in the cord.
   Tschiriew,§ with the knowledge that the crural nerve in the rabbit
is formed by the 5th and 6th lumbar roots, divided the cord at the
level of the 3rd lumbar, and found that the knee jerk became
exaggerated, while when the section was made between the 5th and
 6th roots the knee jerk disappeared.              On making successive sections
from the sacral region upwards he found that the knee jerk re
mained intact until the level of the 6th lumbar pair was reached.
He divided the posterior roots of the 6th lumbar pair, taking great
care not to injure the neighbouring parts, and found that such sec
tion abolished the knee jerk.              Destruction of the segment between
the 5th and 6th lumbar pairs resulted in abolition of the knee jerk
also.
    Prevost,|| in his first series of experiments, divided the cord in the
 dorso-lumbar region, whereupon the reflexes below this point became
exaggerated.        Section of the crural nerve abolished the knee jerk, as
 did section of the posterior root of the 6th lumbar in the rabbit,
 while it was augmented when the sciatic alone was divided.                     These
 experiments, therefore, confirmed the results of previous observers,
 especially those of Tschiriew.             The next series of experiments were

1893.]        the   Xormal State of       the  Knee   Jerk   is altered.      437
entirely original on the part of Prevost, and deserve careful notice.
He found that in the cat deep chloroform narcosis, and the adminis
tration of curara, each individually caused abolition of the knee jerk,
while profound ether narcosis, almost np to the point of cessation of
respiration, failed to do so.         In the rabbit, on the other hand, pro
found ether narcosis abolished the knee jerk. Intravenous injection
of 1 gramme of chloral in 10 grammes of water, injected in small
quantities into a cat until the animal was profoundly insensible, failed
to have any effect on the knee jerk.            3 grammes of water containing
0-075 gramme of the hydrochlorate of morphia, injected into a rabbit
in the same way, caused exaggeration of the knee jerk, the animal
being in a state of torpor with diminished respiration.                  The third
series of experiments were also original, and consisted in compress
ing the abdominal aorta, and thus producing anasmia of the cord, and
observing the effect of this on the knee jerk.                  Such compression,
whether employed through the integument                       or applied directly
to the abdominal aorta, in the rabbit caused in a few seconds
exaggeration, and then abolition of the knee jerk in about 45 seconds,
as a rule, and it remained absent for from 15 or 20 seconds to one or
several minutes, after the compression was left off, before returning.
The length of time that it remained absent was found to be directly
proportional to the length of time that the compression on the aorta
 had been kept up ; the longer the compression, the slower was tho
 knee jerk in returning.            The results obtained from the various
methods     of   experimentation       led Prevost to believe that the knee
jerk has a decidedly central origin, and is of the nature of a reflex,
also that it is the excitation of the tendon, and not of the skin, which
elicits it. He further believed that the contraction of the opposite
qnadriceps when the tendon of one side is struck pointed to the exist
ence of a crossed reflex. .
   Waller and Prevost* soon after performed some experiments in
conjunction, which proved this last conjecture to be erroneous. They
divided the sciatic, anterior, crural, and posterior roots on one side,
and yet did not abolish tho crossed movement. . Percussion of the
tendon on tho injured side caused no contraction on that side, but
evoked a contraction on the opposite side at least as vigorous as
 before the injury.         From this they concluded that there was no
physiological      transmission,     and therefore no " crossed reflex," bat
that the result was due to physical diffusion of vibrations.
    Senatorf found that the hemisection of the spinal cord affected
the knee jerk on the same side only ; that section or greater dis
turbance of the posterior columns of the lumbar cord, or of the pos
terior horns had no effect on the jerk ; and that dividing the lateral

     The latest experimental work on the subject is that by Sherring
 ton,* who found that section of those branches of the anterior crural
 which supplied the vastus internus and adjoining part of the crarens
 abolished the knee jerk, while when these branches were left intact,
 and all the other branches of the nerve divided, the knee jerk
 remained active.        He also noted that section of the 6th roots in
 rabbits did not always abolish the knee jerk, but occasionally section
 of the 5th root alone sufficed to bring about this result. In the cat,
 this observer found that when all the anterior and posterior nerve
 roots of the lumbo-sacral region, with the exception of the 6th, were
 divided, the knee jerk became brisk ; but that section of the 6th root
 instantly abolished the jerk. When only half the filaments which
 composed the posterior root of the 6th root were alone divided the
knee jerk was at onco extinguished.             Section of the anterior root of
 the 6th root greatly       diminished,     but  did not absolutely abolish, the
 jerk ; when, however, the ventral root of the fifth was subsequently
 divided in the same animal the knee jerk was abolished.                In Macacus
rhesus division of the 5th root never failed to abolish the knee jerk,
while section of all other adjacent roots only tended to render it more
brisk. Section of the whole, or even half, of the posterior root of
the 5th abolished the knee jerk ; but when the efferent root of the
5th was divided a remnant of the jerk persisted, as long as the
efferent root of the 4th lumbar was left intact.                   Bisection of the
cord in the lumbo-sacral region of Macacus rhesus produced no altera
tion in the knee jerk. Transverse section of the cord at the level of
the 9th thoracic root caused the knee jerk to disappear ten minutes
later, and it did not commence to return until three weeks after. A
similar lesion of the cord at the level of the 1st lumbar root, with
partial section at the 3rd lumbar, caused abolition of the jerk, and
it did not return during the six months that the animal was under
observation.     When the knee jerk was abolished by the inhalation of
chloroform it did not return so rapidly when the cord had been pre
viously divided transversely as when it was left intact.
    In a later paperf Sherrington has greatly added to our knowledge
of the nerve arc on which depends the efficiency of the jerk. After
showing how very readily the afferent fibres in the 5th lumbar pos
terior root (Rhesus), and on which the existence of the knee jerk
depends,   can be impaired, he proceeded to expand the observation of
Tschiriew concerning the hamstring nerve, and he then found that
excitation of this branch only of the sciatic trunk inhibited the jerk
(thus excluding      for the most part skin paths), and further that

duce the same effect, thus proving that afferent impulses from tho
hamstrings normally inhibit the jerk.
                          The General   Plan of  Research.
   In the present research various circumstances under which the
knee jerk is altered are dealt with, and may, for convenience of
description, be best arranged in two large groups.
   A. Those circumstances under which the alteration in the state of
the knee jerk is brought about by some influence locally exerted on
the lumbar centres.
   B. Those circumstances under which the alteration is due to some
remote cause.        In the first of these groups are included : —
   I. The    effects of asphyxia.
   II.  The effects of the inhalation of certain gases (nitrogen, nitrons
           oxide, and oxygen).
   III.   The action of anaesthetics (ether and chloroform).
   rV.   The effect of anaemia of tho spinal centres as brought about
           by compression of the abdominal aorta, or by general loss of
           blood.
   V. The action of intravenous injections of absinthe and strychnia
           respectively.
   VI. The result of bisection of the spinal cord made vertically at
           the level of the centres in which the knee jerk appears to be
           represented.
    The second group includes : —
    I. The    effect of removal of a cerebral hemisphere.
    II.  The immediate and late effects of extirpation of different parts
           of the cerebellum.
    And   as control experiments      in this connexion.
           1.  The effects of extirpation of the labyrinth.
           2.   The effects of intracranial section of the 8th nerve.
           3.  The effects by chemical excitation of the 8th nerve.
    In  every instance those circumstances under which the knee jerk is
exaggerated, and those under which it is abolished, are considered ;
bat, inasmuch as both conditions may bo brought about during
different stages of the same influence, both of these states of the knee
jerk are considered together.

                              Operative Procedure.
   The anaesthetic employed to render the animal unconscious was
invariably ether, except in those instances in which the effect of the
action of chloroform on the lumbar centres was under consideration,
when that anaesthetic was alone made use of throughout the experiment.
   In every instance tracheotomy was performed, and narcosis              kept
up by allowing the animal to inhale the anaesthetic through the
tracheotomy tube.     When the effects of the inhalation of certain
gases were under observation the tracheotomy tube was connected
with a "["-shapecl glass tube by means of a short piece of india-
rubber tubing; and india-rubber tubing was connected with the other
two limbs of the "|".tube, by which means it was easy to so arrange
that the animal should inhale the particular gas from its reservoir,
and exhale into the air of the room, the one tube being connected
with the reservoir, and the other left free.
   In those instances in which the heart beats were recorded the
right carotid was exposed, opened, and a cannula inserted into              it,
which in turn was in connexion with mercurial manometer.
                                            a               When
a graphic record of the respiratory excursions was obtained   was    it
made   by means of      bertambour, whose elastic membranes were
                        a
attached to a strip of Leslie's strapping which encircled the thorax.
From this tambour an india-rubber tube led to a Marey recording
tambour by which the respiratory excursions were registered on the
cylinder.
  In studying the effects of anaemia of the cord, the abdominal aorta
was compressed, either by means of the thumb through the integu
ments, or directly after   had been exposed by dissection.
                             it                               General
blood letting was effected by exposing and dividing one or both
carotids.
   Intravenous injections were made by injection with     hypodermic
                                                              a
syringe   into either   jugular
                        a       or femoral  vein, the minute opening
made by the needle being closed by    small clip.
                                        a
   Bisection of the spinal cord was effected by exposing the cord at
the level of the roots concerned with the knee jerk, inasmuch as divi
sion ofit abolishes the phenomenon, and by means of a delicate thin-
bladed knife, making     vertical incision along the middle line of the
                         a
cord to the extent of two inches, with the root at its midpoint, and
extending through to the      anterior surface of the cord. In removing
a cerebral hemisphere, a       small disc of bone was first removed from
one side of the cranium       by means of   a half-inch trephine, and then
the opening was enlarged      by bone forceps until the whole hemisphere
was exposed.   The dura mater was then dissected off, and the
hemisphere removed en masse, or taken away piecemeal by means              of
a sharp scoop.

  1893.]       the Normal Stale of  the Knee Jerk is altered.        441
    In the case of the cerebellum, a skin incision was made along the
 middle line down the back of the neck, and at its upper extremity a
 horizontal incision was carried across the vertex. The tissues were
 then scraped and cut away, until the occipital bone and arch of the
 atlas with the intervening occipito-atloid membrane were exposed ;
 care being taken to work from the middle line outwards, as by this
 means haemorrhage was found to be much less troublesome.         When
 the superior vermis, or part of it, was to be removed, the bone cover
 ing this region was removed by means of bone forceps, and then the
 portion of the vermis desired excised by means of the knife. But
 when one or other lateral lobe was to be removed the occipital bone
 on that side was trephined by a half-inch trephine, and the opening
 increased by means of bone forceps.       The dura was next dissected
 off, and then by means of a sharp scoop the lobe was scraped out. A
 syringe containing hot water (about 100° F.) was used to aid in the
 removal    of the broken down cerebellar tissue, and in the arrest of
 haemorrhage. The plan adopted in extirpating the labyrinth con
 sisted in making a curved incision, commencing above, passing
 behind, and ending below the ear.      The flap of skin with the pinna
 was then turned forward, all structures divided and scraped from the
 bone, so as to expose the meatus and the bone for a short distance
 around.      The upper and posterior part of the meatus was then
 enlarged by means of a gouge, and by degrees the middle ear and
 then the labyrinth were cut into and cleared out.
    When the 8th nerve was being exposed the skin incision varied
 little from that described above ; but the bulla was more freely
 denuded of its soft coverings.     The bulla was opened by means of a
 gouge, after which its inner  wall  was similarly cut through, until the
8th nerve was exposed.      It was found that no appreciable length of
the nerve could be exposed without lifting up the lateral lobe of the
cerebellum, but that the nerve could be divided without interference
with this structure. This plan of operation was sometimes followed
in extirpating the labyrinth.
    In both these methods of operating, haemorrhage was profuse and
troublesome, but was checked by the use of aseptic wax.
    In those instances in which the animal was to be afterwards allowed
to live the operation was conducted on strict antiseptic principles,
the edges of the wound brought together by means of horse-hair
sutures, and the wound dressed antiseptically.
    In any instance where the operation was so severe as to lead one
to suppose that the animal would be conscious of pain after the effect
of the ether had passed off, a subcutaneous injection of ^ or 1 grain
of morphia was, as usual, given at the close of the operation, and
repeated    if necessary.

       the Knee Jerk is rrought arout ry some Local Actios                ox
       the Lumrar Centres.
                          I. The Effects of Asphyxia.
  Asphyxia was produced either by clamping a short piece of iudia-
rubber tubing fixed to the free extremity of the tracheotomy tube, or
by inserting an india-rubber plug into the tracheotomy tube directly.
Before inducing asphyxia the knee jerks were carefully and repeatedly
tested in order to be certain that the depth of narcosis was not such
as to cause any material alteration in the state of their condition.
When it was satisfactorily determined that they were as nearly as
possible normal, cardiac and respiratory tracings were taken for some
seconds before the tracheotomy tube was plugged.       The immediate
effects on the respiratory and cardiac movements do not call for
description ; that they were those usually met with under similar
conditions is shown in fig. 1.
  1. The Effects of Asphyxia on ihe Lumbar Centres with the Spinal
Cord Intact. — The first effect which the altered conditions of the
blood had on the knee jerk was to cause it to become exaggerated;
this quickly became more and more marked, until clonus at the knee
was produced by a single tap on the patella tendon ; and when the
exaggeration was at its maximum a tap on one tendon not only pro
duced clonus on that side, but also evoked the knee jerk on the
opposite side, even to the extent of a few clonic jerks. After this
stage was reached the knee jerk became less and less marked, until
it disappeared completely, and did not return up to the time of the
death of the animal, when this was allowed to take place. But              if,
instead of allowing the animal to die, the obstruction to the entrance
of air into the lungs was removed, and the animal recovered
either with or withont the aid of artificial respiration, the knee jerk
reappeared.    -The time which elapsed before its reappearance de
pended  on  the length of time that the asphyxial state had been kept
up the shorter the duration of this state the quicker did the knee
   ;
jerk return, and vice versa.   On its return the knee jerk did not at
once present its normal characters   at first feeble,
                                        ;             quickly passed
                                                             it
into a state of exaggeration, sometimes to the extent that single  a
tap on the patella tendon evoked   few clonic jerks after a variable
                                       a                     ;
period this exaltation subsided, and    returned to its normal condi
                                            it
tion.   The stages in the asphyxial state to which these different
phenomena are related are indicated in fig.        which shows the
                                                        1,

                                                                  2
after the trachea was clamped the stage of asphyxial convulsions
 was reached, and after       the blood pressure had risen the knee jerk

1893.]         the Normal State of   the Knee Jerk  is altered.         443
became    exaggerated.     This exaggeration amounted to clonus in about
30 seconds    later ; but about 1^ minutes later, and after the stage of
asphyxial convulsions, the knee jerk was abolished, while the blood
pressure was still high, though showing signs of commencing to
fall. Artificial respiration was commenced about a minute after this
(see fig. 2), and 1£ minutes afterwards the knee jerks returned,
became exaggerated in about 50 seconds, and returned to their normal
state about 2^ minutes later.
   The exact times at which the various phenomena occurred varied
in different animals of the same class, and more widely in animals of
different classes.    Fig. 3 shows the approximate times at which they
occurred in one of the rabbits used. In this particular instance the
knee jerk became exaggerated about 50 seconds after the tracheotomy
tube was plugged, and it was abolished about 70 seconds later.          The
plug was removed from the tracheotomy tube about 10 seconds after
this, and in about 10 seconds the knee jerk returned ; in about
12 seconds it became exaggerated, and returned to its normal condi
tion after 60 seconds. In fig. 4, besides the blood and respiratory
curves, a tracing of tho asphyxial convulsions is shown, as obtained
from the extensor muscles of the forearm of the dog, in order to show
that the knee jerks were still exaggerated for some time after the con
vulsions had ceased.
    It will thus be seen that exaltation of the knee jerk is a pheno
menon of the so-called first and second stages of asphyxia, while its
abolition is related to the third stage of that condition.      Figs. 5 and
6 are intended to show what relationship exists between the altera
tion in excitability of the spinal centres and that of the cortical cells.
Although the cortex exhibits some diminution in its excitability
before the knee jerk is lost, yet its excitability is not completely
annulled until some time after all attempts to elicit a knee jerk have
failed.   The preliminary exaggeration of the knee jerk commences
to show itself before there is any sign of diminution of the cortical
excitability.
    2. The Effects of Asphyxia on the Lumbar Centres after Total
Transverse Section of the Spinal Cord in the Mid-dorsal Region. — By
this means any influence of the cerebrum and cerebellum on the
phenomena was entirely excluded.           It was found that, with the
exception of commencing the experiment with a knee jerk more
active than when the cord was not previously divided, the phenomena
evoked by the asphyxial state were in every way identical to those
observed    before the cerebrum     and cerebellum were excluded from
taking any possible part in, or exerting any influence upon, their
production.
                                                                2 i 2

   1. Nitrogen. — As has been already noted, a "["-tube was made use
of in these experiments ; one limb of the     being connected with the
                                                              "J"
tracheotomy   tube, one by means  of india-rubber  tubing, with the gas
reservoir, and one being left free with     small piece of india-rubber
                                                          a
tubing fitted on to its extremity.     The tube leading from the gas
reservoir was grasped between the fingers and thumb of one hand,
while the       of tube at the extremity of the free limb of the
              piece                                                                     f
was grasped    between the fingers and thumb of the other hand.
During inspiration the free end was closed, while the tube from the
bag of nitrogen was left free, and during expiration the tube from the
nitrogen was closed, and that opening into the air of the room was
opened. In this way nitrogen gas was alone inspired, while expira
tion took place into the air of the room.
   Except that    tookit  longer time to obtain the results, the effects
                                 a
were identical with those met with in asphyxia.* The loss of knee jerk
was preceded by the stage of exaltation, and when the animal was
allowed to recover the absence of knee jerk was followed by       stage            a
of slighter exaltation before its return to the normal state, such as
existed before the administration of the nitrogen.
   2. Nitrous Oxide. — The plan of procedure was the same in these
experiments as in the last, and the results differed from them in no
way.    Loss of the knee jerk was always preceded by stage of exalta        a
tion, and when the animal was allowed to recover, the normal state                       of
the knee jerk was only reached after passing through    period during       a
which   itwas exalted.
  3. Oxygen.  — Here again the plan of procedure was the same as                         in
the experiments with nitrogen but the results were widely different.
                                         ;
Indeed, they were totally different from any that had been previously
obtained, for in no case was the knee jerk abolished, no matter bow
long the so-called apneeic state was kept up. Increased activity of
the knee jerk, gradually becomiug more so until clonus developed,
was the only effect of inhalation of this gas. When its administra
tion was discontinued the knee jerk gradually returned to the condi
tion in which    was before the inhalation of oxygen was commenced.

                         III.   The Action    of      Anasthetic Agents.
  1.  Ether. — In profound narcosis induced by the inhalation of ether
the knee jerk      abolished
                    is        but this stage
                                     ;           preceded by one of
                                                                is                      in
creased activity, and followed by     similar stage of exaltation when
                                                  a
the animal    recovering from the effects of the anaesthetic, and before
              is
the knee jerk returns to its normal conditions.     The length     time            of
                                Cf. Martin,       Journ. of Pbjsiol.'

I8D3.]        the  Normal State of   the   Knee  Jerk is  altered.       445
that the knee jerk remains absent depends entirely on the depth of
narcosis, and the length of time this is continued, these bearing a
direct ratio to each other. The exaggeration of the knee jerk which
has been alluded to is never so pronounced as in simple asphyxia or
the condition induced by nitrogen or carbonic oxide ; but it is never
theless perfectly distinct.
    2. Chloroform.— The results obtained were identical            with those
obtained with ether, with two important exceptions, however; thus, the
knee jerk is lost very much more rapidly under its influence than
nnder the influence of ether, and after the administration of the
narcotic is discontinued a longer period elapses before the knee jerk
shows any sign of returning than after a similar depth and duration
of ether narcosis.
    These effects with ether and chloroform were obtained both when
the spinal cord was intact and when it had been previously divided
transversely    in the mid-dorsal region.
IV.    The effect  of Anmmia of the Spinal Centres as brought about        by
     Compression   of the Abdominal Aorta or by General Blood-letting.
    1.  Compression   of  the Abdominal      Aorta. — This was effected by
.means of the thumb, either through the structures composing the
abdominal wall in the rabbit, or after the artery had been exposed by
 dissection (rabbit and dog).       The resistance offered by the bony
 spinal column makes it exceedingly easy to entirely stop the flow of
 blood in the aorta beyond the point at which compression is made by
 the thumb. As Prevost* found, after the compression had been kept
up a short time the knee jerk disappeared, and the time that it con
 tinued absent after the compression had been taken off varied directly
as the time that the compression had been maintained ; the longer
the compression, the longer did the knee jerk afterwards take to
return.     Before the knee jerk was abolished, and after it was
abolished and before it returned to its normal state, it passed through
stages of exaltation, as has been already observed to be the case in
other conditions attended with loss of the knee jerk.
    2. General Blood-letting. — The carotid artery was opened on one or
other side, and the animal allowed to gradually bleed to death. As
 more and more blood was lost so the knee jerk became more and
more active at first; but after a time it gradually became less so,
 until it eventually disappeared entirely, and did not reappear np to
the time of the death of the animals.

   V.  The Action of Intravenous Injections of Absinthe and Strychnia.
   1. Absinthe. — The action of this drug on the lumbar         centres was
tried, both when the spinal cord was intact and after transverse
section of it in the mid-dorsal region.        As has been explained, a
jugular or femoral vein was exposed, and varying doses of the essen
tial oil of absinthe were injected 'into it, according to the class of
animal under observation and the particular effect which was aimed
at. Doses short of those necessary to evoke generalised convulsion
were attended by increase of the knee jerk, whether the cord was in
tact or divided in the dorsal region.     Doses sufficiently large to evoke
powerful generalised convulsions were also followed by increase of
the knee jerk after the convulsions ceased.*
   When the spinal cord had been previously divided transversely in the
dorsal region, and the lower extremities thus excluded from the other
wise general convulsions, the increase of the knee jerk, after large
doses of absinthe, was still observed. The increase never amounted
to clonus or tonus, but was nevertheless well marked.         This effect of
absinthe on the lumbar centres was strikingly demonstrated in the
following experiment.     The spinal cord of a dog was divided trans
versely in the mid-dorsal region when the animal was so profoundly
under the influence of ether that the knee jerk could not be obtained.
The animal was then kept lightly under the influence of the antesthe-
tic, but, in spite of this, the knee jerk had not returned fifteen
minutes after the cord had been divided.           Three minims of the
essential oil of absinthe were then injected into the femoral vein of
one side, and the knee jerk of the opposite side kept under observa
tion.   Well-marked convulsions occurred in a few seconds, limited to
those parts above the spinal cord lesion, while the parts below the
lesion remained inactive.     At the time that the convulsions above
the cord lesion were at their height there was doubtful evidence of
return of the knee jerk. As there was absolutely no sign of the
presence of the knee jerk ten minutes after the first injection of
absinthe was given, 2 minims more of the essential oil were injected
into the same vein. As before, convulsions occurred in those regions
whose nerve supply was derived from the central nervous system
 above the lesion in the spinal cord, while those regions which derived
their supply from below this point remained passive. A few seconds
 after this further administration of the drug there was undoubted
 return of the knee jerk, which persisted for a minute or two and then
 disappeared.   Ten minutes after the second dose of absinthe waa
 given a third dose of 2 minims was injected into the same vein as on
 the two former occasions with exactly similar results with respect to
 the convulsions.   The knee jerk was obtained a few seconds after the
                           * Beevor, loc. cit.

1893.]        the Normal State of    the Knee   Jerk  is altered.    447
absinthe had been injected, and did not again disappears in the course
of half an hour, during which time it was under careful obser
vation.
    2. Strychnia. — The effect of this drug was only tested in the dog.
Two minims of a 1 per cent. solution of strychnia were injected into the
femoral vein, after the spinal cord had been previously divided trans
versely in the mid-dorsal region.          Powerful convulsions quickly
followed in all parts whose nerve supply was derived from above the
cord lesion, while those whose nerve supply was from below this point
 remained free from convulsion.      The knee jerk was increased at first
slightly, but soon more so, and on injecting I minim more of the
same solution of strychnia into the femoral vein as before, a single
tap on the patella tendon was sufficient to evoke tonus in the
quadriceps extensor.
    When strychnia was administered without the spinal cord being
previously divided, general convulsions of course resulted, and these
 seriously interfered with the observations on the knee jerk, as even
 when the animal was not in a comparatively quiescent Btate a tap on
the quadriceps tendon usually sufficed to evoke convulsions.         The
 plan of first dividing the spinal cord transversly in the dorsal region
was therefore that usually adopted in observing the effects of strychnia
 on the knee jerk, and in all cases there could be no question as to the
increase of the jerk under the influence of this drug.
               VI.  The Results of Section of the  Spinal Cord.
                          1. Transverse   Section.
                          2. Vertical Section.
     1. Transverse Section of the Spinal Cord. — It has long been recog
 nised that in the lower animals complete transverse section of the
 spinal cord above the level of the lumbar enlargement is followed by
 increased activity of the knee jerk. My own experiments in the dog
 show that the immediate effect of such a lesion depends on the depth
 of narcosis. The cord was always divided at or about the mid-dorsal
 region, and in no instance did the knee jerk disappear after such
 section of the cord when there had been no doubt as to its presence
 before the lesion was inflicted, while usually there was no difficulty
 in being certain of its increased activity under such circumstances.
 The depth of ether narcosis, however, plays a most important part in
 this connexion, for if the cord were divided when narcosis was so
 profound that the knee jerk was almost abolished, the section of the
 cord hastened the result ; and when the cord was divided when the
  depth of narcosis was such that the knee jerk was abolished, the
  latter remained absent for a much longer time than is usual after

suspension of the administration of the anaesthetic when the spinal
cord hus not been divided.
    2. The Effect of Bisection of the Spinal Cord vertically at the level of
the centres on whose activity the knee jerk depends. — These experiments
were undertaken to ascertain whether or no the centres to which the
knee jerks are related are separate and independent in their action on
the two sides, or whether the centre on one side is in any way related
to its fellow of the opposite side, and depending on its co-operation for
the proper performance of its functions.          Since these experiments
were performed Dr. Sherrington has published the results of similar
experiments carried out by himself in connexion with the lumbar
cord of Macacus rhesus.         My results entirely agree with his, and
showed that dividing the cord into two lateral halves, the incision
commencing at the level of the 1st lumbar roots and extending to
the level of the 1st sacral pair, had no appreciable effect, either ia
increasing or diminishing the knee jerks.
   B. Circumstances under which the Alteration in the Statk              of
              the Knee Jerk is due to some Remote Cause.
           I. The Effect of the Removal of a Cerebral Hemisphere.
    Either hemisphere was     selected,  and during the process of exposing
it great    care was taken to prevent the animal from     losing more blood
 than was absolutely unavoidable.         When   everything was ready for
the removal of the hemisphere the knee jerks were carefully tested,
 so as to be certain that nothing had occurred to render them uneqnal
during the preparatory operation.         The hemisphere was then excised
after the dura mater was dissected off it. The effect was immediate
 and striking, the knee jerk on the opposite side of the body becoming
 distinctly more active than that on the same side as that on which
 the cerebral hemisphere was removed, this inequality being due to an
 increased activity of the knee jerk on the opposite side, and not to a
 diminished activity of that on the same side.
 II.    The Immediate and Late Effects of Extirpation of Portions of      the
                                 Cerebellum.
     1.  The Immediate Effect of Extirpation of Portions of the Cerebellum-
 — a. The removal of     one lateral lobe was followed by great exaggera
 tion of the knee jerk on the samo side, while that on the opposite side
 was considerably diminished.          So great was the exaltation of the
 knee jerk on the same side as that on which the cerebellar lobe was
 excised, that often a single tap on the patellar tendon sufficed to pro-
 d nco tonic extension of the limb.

  1
    893.]      the  Normal State of  the Knee  Jerk is altered.       449
     When after extirpation   of one lateral   lobe of the cerebellum the
 opposite one was also removed, the knee     jerk on the side correspond
 ing to that on which the lobe was more recently removed became
 increased, while there was some diminution of the knee jerk on the
side on which the lobe was first removed, the two knee jerks being as
 nearly as possible equal, and, while both knee jerks were exaggerated,
 they were not as much so as was the one when only one cerebellar
 lobe was removed.
     The depression of the knee jerk on the opposite side under these
circumstances was a phenomenon less marked than was the exaltation
of that on the same side as that from which the cerebellar lobe had
 been removed. In order to test this point further, one cerebral hemi
sphere was first removed, with the result that the knee jerk on the
opposite side became more active than it was before.
     A curious and interesting ether effect was observed in connexion
with this difference of the knee jerks on the two sides when one
lateral lobe of the cerebellum was removed. While the above results
obtained during ordinary moderate ether narcosis, the result was
exactly the reverse when anaesthesia was very profound, for then the
knee jerk which was formerly exalted became depressed,               even
abolished, while that which was formerly lessened became markedly
exaggerated.
     The lateral   lobe of the cerebellum   on the same side as that on   .
which the cerebral hemisphere was removed was next extirpated,
when the active knee jerk on the opposite side became less so.
     On account of the risk of complication by injury of other parts,
no attempt was made to do more than remove the whole of the
posterior part of the vermis of one lateral half of this posterior por
tion. When only the half of this posterior portion was removed,
there was slight increase of the knee jerk on the same side, but
this increase was in no way comparable to the great exaggeration
which followed removal of one lateral lobe. As far as could be
determined, the knee jerk on the opposite side was in no way altered
by this lesion. When the whole of the posterior portion of the vermis
was removed both knee jerks became slightly increased.
     2. The Late Effects of Extirpation of Portions of the Cerebellum. —
On the day after the operation of removal of one lateral lobe of the
cerebellum the knee jerk on the same side was still exaggerated,
though less so ; but although the knee jerks on the two sides were
still unequal, that on the opposite side was no longer feeble, but was
slightly exaggerated. In the course of the second and third days it
became difficult to be certain that any inequality existed on the two
sides, both knee jerks being very much exaggerated, though neither
of them as much so as was the one on the side of the lesion im
mediately after the operation.        A month or six weeks after the

450       Mr.   J. S. R  Russell.   Circumstances under which       [May    18,
operation most of the animals showed a slight inequality of the knee
jerks, so that, although both were exaggerated, that on the side
corresponding        to that from which the cerebellar lobe had been
removed was slightly the more so ; bat in some animals the inequality
was not evident.        When half of the posterior part of the vermis was
removed, it was usually difficult next day to say which knee jerk was
the more active ; but, as in the case of the lateral lobe, after a few
weeks a difference on the two sides could be once more detected in
most of the animals.        At this time the knee jerk on the opposite side
was usually as nearly as possible normal, while that on the same side
as the cerebellar lesion was more active than normal.         In like manner
the increase of knee jerk produced by removal of the whole of the
 posterior portion of the vermis persisted.
    If, after a one-sided lesion, either of the vermis or lateral lobes,
 the animal was placed under the influence of ether, the inequality of
 tho knee jerks became more pronounced ; and if the anaesthetic was
pushed to the point at which abolition of the knee jerks results, that
 on the opposite side usually disappeared sooner than did that on the
 side corresponding.
    There seemed, therefore, little reason to doubt that the effects
 obtained in connexion with the knee jerk when portions of the
 cerebellum were removed were directly the result of the cerebellar
 lesion. However, Professor Victor Horsley kindly drew my attention
 to the fact that the proximity of the auditory nerve and labyrinth
 made it necessary to institute control experiments, with a view to
 excluding the possibility of the effects being wholly or partly due to
 interference with one or other, or both, of these structures.               He
 suggested that the labyrinth should be extirpated on one               side  in
 some animals, while in some others the 8th cranial nerve on one
 side could be subjected to chemical excitation.           I accordingly per
 formed the following control experiments.
           III.  Extirpation of the Labyrinth on one side.   {Control.)
     No inequality was produced in the knee jerks by this at the time
  of the operation, nor was any alteration detected two weeks after the
  operation, except in one instance, in which, two weeks after the
  operation, the knee jerk on the same side as the ear lesion seemed
  slightly more active than its fellow of the opposite 6ide. As there
  was suppuration in the deep wound in this case, it was thought that
  the result probably depended on entrance of pus into the region of
  the lateral lobe of the cerebellum on the same side, but no such          con
  dition was macroscopically obvious at the autopsy, so that this           case
  is difficult of explanation.

  IV.  Intracranial Division of      the 8th Nerve on one Side.       (Control.)
   No inequality in the knee jerks was produced, either at the time of
the operation, during the few hours immediately following the opera
tion, or at any time during the week, after the section of the 8th
nerve.
     V. Chemical Irritation of      the 8th Nerve on one Side.      (Control.)
   It was  found impossible to expose a sufficient length of the nerve
to apply an irritant to it without lifting up the lateral lobe of the
cerebellum.      As any interference with the cerebellum would have
vitiated  the  experiment, it was decided that, instead of applying the
irritant directly on the nerve, it should be placed in the labyrinth
instead.    Accordingly the labyrinth was opened, and a small portion
of the 8th nerve exposed as it entered the labyrinth. Crystals of
chloride of sodium were next carefully packed around the stump of
the nerve and kept in position by means of a plug of aseptic wool
introduced    into the labyrinth. The knee jerks were carefully tested
immediately after the operation, and frequently during the same day,
but no alteration could be detected in them, and they remained
normal and equal on the two sides during the week that they were
kept under observation.
                        Summary and Conclusions.
                           I. The Effects of Asphyxia.
   The results obtained in asphyxia appear to be due in great measure
to cutting off the supply of oxygen to the lumbar centres. The pre
liminary exaggeration of the knee jerk might have been due to the
taking off of cortical control from the lumbar centres, letting them
go, so to speak, as suggested by Hughlings-Jackson,* for, as numerous
experimenters have shown, asphyxia diminishes, and in an extreme
degree annuls, the excitability of the motor cortex.             That this hypo
thesis cannot be entertained is proved by the following facts.             At the
time when the knee jerk first becomes exaggerated the excitability
of the motor cortex is little, if at all, diminished, and is not annulled
until a considerable time after the knee jerk is abolished.              Further,
and this appears    to  me   more   conclusive    evidence,  the  same   exagger
ation of the knee jerk was met with when asphyxia was induced in
animals whose spinal cords were divided above the lumbar enlarge
ment, in which case any cerebral influence was entirely put out of
court.   As far as the preliminary exaltation of the knee jerk is con-
                       • '  Brit. Med. Jouro.,* February, 1892.

452   Mr.    J.   S. R. Russell.       Circumstances under which              [May   18,
cerned, therefore, we most look to the spinal centres alone for explan
ation of the phenomenon.      The rise of blood pressure which occurs
in the first stage of asphyxia might be held accountable for the exalt
ation of the knee jerk ; but that this is not the true explanation seems
evident, owing to exaltation being met with in anaemia of the cord,
and in the marked fall of blood pressure in general blood letting.
That it is due to an irritable condition of the lumbar cells induced
by depriving them of their normal supply of oxygen is rendered
probable from the following facts, as well as those just mentioned.
  What part, if any, the presence of excess of carbonic acid in the
lumbar centres plays in the production of the phenomenon, it is diffi
cult to estimate. That the absence of oxygen is alones capable of
producing it is shown by the effects of anasmia of the cord, and by
the fact that when nitrogen gas is inhaled the same result is obtained ;
for in this latter instance most of the oxygen in the body is used up,
and the nitrogen takes its place, but there is not necessarily any
excess of carbonic acid, since there is no obstruction of expired air,
merely the entrance of nitrogen instead of oxygen being provided
for.  One thing      is,
                     however, evident, viz., that in all these conditions
the effect   not so rapid as in asphyxia therefore
            is                                      ;     not improbable
                                                                    it   is
that the presence of excess of carbonic acid hastens the results.
   The abolition of the knee jerk might be due to exhaustion of the
lumbar centres by the asphyxial convulsions, for Beevor* has shown
that after severe epileptic convulsions in man the knee jerk may be
abolished, and this has been attributed to exhaustion of the lumbar
centres, consequent on their great discharge of energy.      That this                  is
not the explanation of the phenomenon     in  asphyxia     proved        is
                                                                       the         by
fact thatit  occurs when the spinal cord has been divided transversely
in the dorsal region prior to the occurrence of asphyxial convulsions,
and where, therefore, the lumbar cells are not discharged daring the
asphyxial spasms, and consequently cannot be exhausted in this war.
Indeed  it  appears not improbable that the effects in man which have
been attributed to exhaustion of the lumbar centres may after all be
due to the asphyxiated condition of the blood, which occurs in severe          a
epileptic seizure, consequent on the arrest of respiration due to the
tonic spasm of the muscles of respiration.
   That the failure of the knee jerk    consequent on the fall of blood
                                              is
pressure which takes place in the third stage of asphyxia seems
improbable, as the knee jerk       lost just when the blood pressure
                                        is
commences to fall, often, indeed, before there     any distinct evidence
                                                            is
of the decline of blood pressure.    Then  also in general loss of blood
the blood pressure falls very considerably lower than the height at
which  it stands when the knee jerk       lost in asphyxia without any
                                                is
sign of loss of knee jerk, which does not take place till much later.

1893.]        the  Normal State of     the Knee Jerk  is altered.       453
   I  trust, therefore, we are justified in concluding that the failure of
the spinal centres, to which the knee jerk is related, to perform their
functions is dno in large measure to their being starved of oxygen ;
for this same starvation occurs in asphyxia when nitrogen or nitrous
oxide is inhaled, and when anemia of the lumbar cord is produced ;
in all these conditions abolition of the knee jerk being the ultimate
result observed.
   With regard to the part played by carbonic acid in helping to bring
about this effect, what has already been said with reference to tho
preliminary exaltation of the knee jerk is wholly applicable ; there
fore nothing further need be said on this subject.
   The behaviour of the knee jerk when it reappears after being
absent for a time, taken in connexion with its behaviour when first
deprived of its normal supply of oxygen, and before it was abolished,
suggests the probability that not merely the presence of oxygen is
necessary for the lumbar cells to functionate normally, but a certain
definite quantity of that gas.        And this normal balance appears to
be upset either by an insufficient quantity of the gas, or by too
much of it ; for when pure oxygen is inhaled the same exaltation is
observed.
             II.  The Effects of the Inhalation of certain Gases.
   The results obtained with nitrogen and nitrous oxide, coinciding
as they do     with those obtained in asphyxia, lend strength to the
hj-pothesis  which     has been advanced in explanation of the phenomena
related to asphyxia ; for when either of these gases is inhaled, to the
entire exclusion of- all atmospheric air, the blood is principally
deprived of its oxygen, and so also the lumbar centres. Here, again,
it is therefore probable that the absence of oxygen is to be looked
on as the prime factor which brings about the alterations in the knee
jerk, which have been already detailed, tho exact form of alteration
apparently depending on the amount of oxygen left in the blood.
When the amount of oxygen in the blood is small, or only moderate,
the lumbar centres become more excitable, while when it is absent,
or only present in very minute traces, inaction of these centres
results.
                  III.  The Effects of Ether and Chloroform.
   That the results obtained with these drugs are due to their direct
action on the lumbar centres is shown by the fact that the results
are almost identical, whether these centres have or have not been cut
off from their connexion with higher centres by complete transverse
section of the cord in the dorsal region.       It is a little curious that
the lumbar centres should show the same increased excitability when

454     Mr.  J. S. R. Russell.    Circumstances under which     [May  18,
these poisons have acted on them for a certain time, just as when
they have been deprived of a certain amount of their supply of
oxygen.     That they should fail to act after they have been subjected
to the influence of such powerful poisons is not surprising.      It may,
of course, be urged that the results obtained with these drugs are
not the result of their specific action on the lumbar centres, but of
the want of oxygen.      While it cannot be denied that this may play
some part in the production of the phenomena, that the direct action
of the poisons is mainly responsible there can be little doubt, for
during the respiration of these vapours, in the manner employed in
their administration    to animals,   the entrance of atmospheric air is
not excluded, so that, while possibly the interference with the supply
of oxygen to the lumbar centres might account for the preliminary
exaltation of the knee jerk, it can never be nearly so great as to
bring about the abolition of the knee jerk, which, as has been shown,
takes a considerable time to disappear, even after the fresh supply of
oxygen to the blood has been completely cut off. Farther, and this
is more convincing, the effects of chloroform and ether respectively
differ in two important respects, since (1) the effects on the knee jerk
are brought about very much more rapidly when chloroform is inhaled
than when ether is administered, and (2) the effect produced by
chloroform continues longer after its administration is discontinued
than does the same effect when produced by ether. Nothing but
certain inherent properties of these drugs can be reasonably believed
to be the causes of these differences, for, if venosity of blood was
alone or mainly responsible for the results, the effects produced by
ether should be more rapid and powerful than those produced by
chloroform, since greater venosity is observable in the case of the
former than the latter drug. It seems not uureasonable to assert,
 therefore, that the results obtained with ether and chloroform are
mainly due to the direct action of these drugs on the lumbar centres.
              IV.  The Effect of Anaemia of the SpinOZ Centres.
    Deprivation of the lumbar cord of its blood supply, either by direct
 pressure on the abdominal aorta or by general blood letting, is
synonymous with depriving it of its normal supply of oxygen. But
 another factor has to be taken into consideration in this relation, for
 both of these methods of experimentation are attended with notable
 lowering of the blood pressure in the lumbar cord. That the shock
 occasioned by such lowering of blood pressure, whether resulting
 from the more or less sudden effect of clamping the aorta, or the
 more gradual lowering in general loss of blood, is capable of causing
 abolition of the knee jerk is not improbable ; but that this is the trne
 explanation of the occurrence of the phenomena is made improbable,

1893.]          the Normal State of the Knee Jerk is altered.          455
-when    it is remembered that exaltation of the knee jerk precedes its
disappearance, for in no known method of producing shock of the
spinal cord is there an increased excitability of its centres before
their failure to act. It seems, therefore, more feasible to attribute
the whole of the result, as far as exaltation of the knee jerk is con
cerned, to the absence of oxygen.
     V.   The Action of Intravenous Injections of Absinthe and Strychnia.
     On' the supposition that the former of these drugs acts mainly on
 the    cerebral cortex, and possibly in some degree on the bulbar
centres, but little, if at all, on the lower spinal centres, this drug
 was given in doses sufficiently large to produce powerful generalised
 convulsions, in order to test whether or no there is any evidence of
 exhaustion of the lumbar centres after such discharges, when the
 paths from these centres to the cerebrum, and from the cerebrum to
 them, are left intact. It was found that, in spite of the most powerful
 and oft-repeated generalised convulsions, there was increased action
 rather than depression of the lumbar centres, as evinced by increase
 of the knee jerk. That this was not a fair test of the condition of
 the lumbar centres, as comparable to their condition when generalised
 convulsions result from some condition which evokes discharge from
 the higher centres alone, is proved by tho results obtained with
 absinthe, when the lumbar cord had been severed from its con
  nexion with the higher centres by complete transverse section of
  the cord in the dorsal region.       When this was done it was found
  that, though no convulsions in those parts enervated from tho spinal
  cord below the level of the transverse lesion, yet there was abundant
  evidence of a considerable direct action on the spinal centres, as
  proved by the re-establishment of the knee jerk when its absence
  probably depended on shock to the lumbar centres, and of its in
  creased action when it was comparatively normal before the adminis
  tration of the drug. That strychnia should cause increase of the
  knee jerk, whether the spinal cord was intact or divided transversely
  in the dorsal region, was only what was expected from the well-
  known powerful action of the drug on the spinal cord. It is thus
  clear that absinthe, like strychnia, has a direct action on the lumbar
  centres, but that this action is very much less pronounced in the case
  of the former than in that of the latter drug.

not require the further support which the results of these experiments
give to it. The chief interest in the present experiments, however,         is
centred in the varying effect obtained according to the depth of ether
narcosis ;and they demonstrate very clearly how greatly shock to the
spinal cord may be increased by the depth of narcosis.     That           is,   a
lesion of such severity and in such  situation as to cause very little

greater  at the outset.
   The results of bisection of the spinal cord in the lumbo-sacral
region prove, in confirmation of Sherrington's observations, conclu
sively that the centres on whose action the knee jerk depends are
distinct in the two lateral halves of the cord, and are not dependent
on each other, either for control or for reinforcement.

cerebral hemisphere of one side,     a result in keeping with the best

Cerebellum. — As has been seen, the knee jerk on the same side became
exaggerated both when one lateral lobe of the cerebellum or when one
half of the posterior part of the vermis was removed, and that this
increase of the knee jerk persisted for weeks, i.e., after all phenomena
which could be ascribed to " irritation
                                           " had passed off. It seems
                                             "           "
justifiable therefore to attribute this to a paralytic rather than an
"            " lesion. This
  irritative                 being the case, two hypotheses are open to
us in explanation of the phenomenon        either we must suppose that
                                              :
the one half of the cerebellum exercises an energising inflnence on
the opposite half of the cerebrum, in virtue of which it causes the
opposite cerebral centres to hold in greater check the spinal centres
of the side of the spinal cord corresponding to the side of the cere
bellar lesion or that the one half of the cerebellum exercises con
             ;                                                       a
trolling influence on the spinal centres on the same side of the spinal
cord.   If the first of these hypotheses   accepted, then the increase
                                                 is
of the knee jerk       due to the diminished power of control of the
                       is
cerebral centres on those in the spinal cord in consequence of the loss
of the energising influence of the cerebellum on the cerebrum.       If,
                                                                      on
the other hand, the second of these hypotheses be accepted, the            in
crease of the knee jerk     due directly to the taking off of cerebellar
                                is
control from the spinal centres.    That the first of these hypotheses

   1893.]       the Normal State of     the Knee Jerk is  altered.       457
   does  not wholly meet the case is, I think, clear on two grounds.
  The increase of the opposite knee jerk which is consequent on the
  removal of the cerebral hemisphere of one side is not nearly so great
  as  that Drought about by the removal of the lateral lobe of the cere
  bellum of the same side. When one cerebral hemisphere has been
  first removed, and the opposite lateral lobe of .the cerebellum is re
  moved, the knee jerk on the opposite side from the cerebral and on
  the same side as the cerebellar lesion is further increased after the
  second operation.     It thus seems clear that the cerebellum exercises
  an independent action on the spinal centres from that exercised by
  the cerebrum, and that this action is of the nature of a control over the
  spinal centres chiefly of the same side. That this* is the chief expla
 nation of the phenomenon there appears little doubt ; but it does not
 entirely negative the possibility of the first hypothesis being wholly or
 in part true.
     The fact that the diminution of the knee jerk, on the side opposite
 to that on which the lateral lobe of the cerebellum was removed,
 was always of such short duration, points to that phenomenon as
            " irritative " one,
 being an                       possibly one of inhibition.
     The curious ether effect which was observed in this connexion is
 easy of explanation as far as the knee jerk of the opposite side is
 concerned, when it is considered alone ; for, if it be admitted that the
 inhibitory influence of the cerebellar lesion is sufficient explanation for
 the occurrence of diminution of the knee jerk, it is easy to understand
 how the first effect of the ether would be to remove this inhibitory
 influence, and by its direct action on the spinal centres to cause
 exaggeration of the knee jerk. The effect of the ether on the knee jerk
 of the same side as the cerebellar lesion is also easy of explanation,
 when considered by. itself, for the direct effect of the ether on the
 spinal centres, when present in sufficient quantity, would be to cause
 diminution, and finally abolition, of the knee jerk.           When both
 phenomena, i.e., those of the opposite sides, are considered together,
the explanation becomes more difficult; for, in order that the explana
tions suggested when the phenomena were separately considered
should hold good now that they are considered in conjunction, one of
two things must be admitted : either some influence on the spinal
centres of the side corresponding to that of the cerebellar lesion has
rendered them less capable of resisting the direct action of the ether ;
or some influence acting on the spinal centres of the opposite side has
rendered them more resistant to the action of that drug.
    These questions must for the present remain unanswered.
    That interference with the 8th nerve or labyrinth plays no part
in the phenomena which follow extirpation of parts of the cerebellum
is abundantly proved by the control experiments which were per
formed in order to decide this question.

    As the history of this subject         was fully detailed in a former paper*
by   the  author   on  the  brachial     plexus    of the Dog, only such experi
mental work as has been done in connexion with the lumbo-sacral
plexus is reviewed in the present communication.
    In dealing with the anatomy of the Monkey it is shown that the
 class of plexus most commonly met with has many features in
                                                                            "

of plexus ; while of the variations met with that which occurred
most frequently has many points in common with the class of plexus
designated
                " postfixed " by that observer ; but that there is one

notable difference between the last two, as in no instance was the
2nd sacral nerve root found to contribute a branch to the sciatic
nerve, a contribution which Sherrington describes in this class of
plexus.
    Certain    indirect   effects   brought about by muscles in connexion
with joints on which they have            no direct action, and the necessity for
the exclusion of such indirect          effects in the study of the movements at
these joints, are discussed.          The methods employed in operating are
detailed, and the plan on which the results are arranged for descrip
tion given.
    Excitation experiments form the first part of the experimental
portion of the paper ; and, for convenience, the compound move
ments obtained by excitation of the whole nerve root are described in
conjunction with the minute differentiation obtained by excitation of
the individual natural bundles of the nerve roots. Following this is
a description of the results of the direct observation (after dissection)
of muscles thrown into action by excitation of the separate nerve roots.
And as a corollnry to this part of the subject, the question as to
whether     a single bundle of nerve fibres representing           a single simple
movement       ever remains     distinct    in a  nerve  root during its course to
the muscles which it supplies without inosculating with other motor

460        Mr.  J. S. R. Russell.     On the Nerve Roots   of   [May  18,
meuts led to the observation       of the alteration in the action of the
posterior extremity   in progression, in climbing or in standing, evoked
by section of one or more nerve roots. A second method of control
consisted in the observation of the influence of section of a root or
roots in excluding part of an epileptic spasm induced in the limb by
intravenous injection of absinthe. As a corollary to this, the question
as to whether   the results differed in any way when the section of the
root or roots was made some time previously, or at the time when
the general convulsions were evoked, was tested. Special attention is
called to the advantages of this method of experimentation, made nse
of by the author in a former research, but otherwise not yet adopted
by other investigators.
                         Excitation Experiments.
   In discussing the results obtained by tins method of experimenta
tion the discrepancies which exist between the results obtained by
Ferrier and Yeo, by Sherrington, and by the author respectively, ate
pointed out. With regard to the upper limit at which nerve fibres
leave the spinal cord for the supply of the lower limb, the first of
these observers are held to have placed the limit too low, while
Sherrington has placed it too high, the author finding that the 3rd
lumbar root is the highest which supplies nerve fibres to muscles
acting directly on the limb.     The author agrees with Ferrier and Teo
in considering the 1st sacral nerve root the lowest of the series
which contributes nerve fibres to the limb, and he has never fonnd
the 2nd sacral nerve root supplying the limb even in that class of
plexus designated "postfixed" by Sherrington, in which, according
to this observer, the 2nd sacral sends a brunch to the sciatic nerve.
   Great difficulty is experienced in attempting to reconcile Sherring
ton's results with those obtained by the author, as regards the
number of nerve roots in which a given muscle is represented, and,
conversely, the number of muscles and, in consequence, movements
represented in certain roots ; unless it be that Sherrington has in
cluded every variation, while the author has only included those
roots in which a given muscle is most commonly represented and
those movements or muscles most commonly found represented in any
given nerve root.
   The author does not think that the developmental processes which
bring about the arrangement of nerve fibres do so on a purely
anatomical basis, without regard for physiological     combination  ; and
arguments in support of this view are adduced.
   Contrary to the observations of Sherrington, who found that each
bundle of nerve fibres which contributes to the formation of a nerve
root represents, as it were, a miniature root, containing nerve fibres    ,

1893.]        the Lumbosacral Plexus of Macacus rhesus.               461
for the regulation of all the movements represented in the compound
root, the author finds that each separate bundle of nerve fibres in a
nerve root represent* a single simple movement, and not all the
movements of the compound root in lessened degree.           The explana
tion offered for this difference in the results is that possibly Sherring
ton did not separate the bundles of nerve fibres from each other for a
sufficient distance in their course, and thus did not effectually exclude
the possibility of diffusion of the current to other bundles of nerve
fibres contained in the same nerve root.
    The single simple movements thus eliminated are found to bear
 an almost constant relation to the nerve roots, the same movements
being as a rule found in any given root, and snch movements always
 bear the same relation to the spinal level.      Further, each bundle of
nerve fibres representing a single simple movement in a nerve root
 remains distinct in its course to the muscle or muscles producing
 such a movement, without inosculating with other motor nerve
 fibres.
    The group of muscles supplied by any given nerve root occupy
 both the anterior and posterior surfaces of the limb ; in other words,
 muscles whose unimpeded action would produce one movement, are
 represented in the same nerve root as others whose action would
 produce a movement diametrically opposite.
    When a certain group of muscles are found to predominate in
 their action in one root, they as a rule predominate in that root. If
 those producing flexion at a certain joint predominate in their
 action in one nerve root, those producing extension predominate in
 another.
    In those instances in which two opposed movements are repre
 sented in three consecutive nerve roots, the middle root of the series
 is that in which both movements are represented, while the root
 above contains the one movement, and that below contains the
 other.
    As regards the order of representation of the movements of flexion
 and extension from above down, they are found to alternate, flexion
 being at a higher level than extension in the highest segment of the
 limb, while extension is above flexion in the next segment, and so on.
 And these results are found to agree with those obtained in connexion
 with the anterior extremity of the Dog, except in the caso of the elbow
 joint in its relation to the knee.
    It is found possible by stimulation   of a single bundle of fibres   in
 a nerve root to produce contraction       of a single muscle, and of     it
 alone ; but this effect is not nearly so easy to obtain as in the case  of
 the cervico- dorsal roots, owing to the   distance between the points   of
  exit of the roots from the neural canal and those where they unite to
  form the plexus being too short to allow of sufficient separation of

the nerve fibres so as to exclude the possibility of diffusion of the
current.
    The same muscle is represented in more than one nerve root,
usually two, and to an unequal extent in these.      And when variation
is met with it is a rule that one of the nerve roots in which the
muscle is represented is different, rather than that it is represented in
more nerve roots.
    When the same muscle is represented in two nerve roots, the
muscle fibres innervated by one root are not innervated by the other,
so that only part of the muscle contracts when a single root is
excited.
                           Ablation Experiments.
    Division of any given nerve root produces paresis of the group of
muscles supplied by it, which paresis is temporary, nearly all of it
being recovered from.      The amount of paresis or paralysis produced
is proportional to the number of nerve roots divided ; and this again
varies according to whether the roots divided are consecutive or
alternate ones, the effect being much greater in the former than in
the latter case.   Such division of one or more nerve roots does not
result in incoordination of the remaining muscular combinations
represented in other      nerve roots   ; the remaining movements      are
 merely more feeble.

    Division of one or more nerve roots produces alteration of the
 position of a limb during an epileptic convulsion, which altered
 position depends on the muscular combinations that have been thus
 thrown out of action. And the effect is identical when the root or
 roots are divided at the time when the convulsions are evoked and
 when they have been divided some weeks previously. No incoordina
 tion is produced in the remaining muscular combinations ; and there
 is no evidence of overflow of the impulses which ought to travel
 down the divided root, into other channels through the spinal centres,
 so as to reach the muscles by new paths.

   In   the paper of which this is an abstract the authors have com
pleted the minute analysis of the movements elicited by excitation of
tbe excitable (so-called motor) region of the cortex cerebri in the
Bonnet Monkey (Macacus sinicus).             The portions hitherto examined
having     been those  in which   the  movements     of the limbs were repre
sented, the facial area was chosen for the present research. After an
historical introduction and a description of the anatomy of the
region investigated, the method of notation and record of results is
discussed.
   Considering that in this part of the cortex cerebri there is well-
defined representation of movements of both sides of the body, the
question of bilaterality of representation is raised, and attention
directed to its importance.         The analysis of the results obtained
showed that there existed precise localisation for the movements of
the individual portions of the face, even to that of half the lower lip.
   The specialisation of the movements of the tongue was rendered
easy of examination by employing the operative device of dividiug
the tongue in the middle line.          This shed unexpected light on the
representation    of the  movements     of this organ.
   Movements of the pharynx were made tho subject of observation,
and some degree of unilaterality was discovered in the movements of
the soft palate.
   Finally, attention is drawn to the fact that the marches of move
ments in succession are in this region very inconstant and difficult to
arrange.

        versity of Aberdeen.              Communicated by Professor M.
        Foster, Sec. R.S. Received March 23, 1893.
     The following is a brief accountf of the main results obtained in
  the course of a prolonged investigation of the above subject.
     The animals employed were chiefly cats and rabbits, anaesthetised
 or narcotised with chloroform or chloral hydrate.                     In the great
 majority of the experiments, cats were used anaesthetised with chloro
 form ; and it is the results obtained in those circumstances that I am
 to be understood as specially dealing with in this paper.
     The chief object of the present investigation was to examine more
 fully the mechanism through which changes in the pnlse rate are
 effected and the nature of those changes, when such are dependent on
 an influence exercised by the central nervous system upon the cardiac
 rhythm, e.g., the changes in the pulse rate induced by afferent im
pulses, >fec.
    In proceeding to examine the influence of the nervous system on
 the cardiac rhythm, it is necessary in the first place to determine the
 conditions depending on the presence of the anaesthetic, as far as they
 bear on the cardiac rhythm, the influence of chloroform upon the
 heart itself and upon the centres of the cardiac regulating nerves.
    I. On the Relation of Chloroform to the Cardiac Rhythm.
    With   a view to the elucidation        of this question,   I  have carried out
 the following series of experiments, to test the action of chloroform
 under different conditions and so determine the manner in which it
may affect the rhythmic mechanism of the heart : —
    1. Experiments in which the entire cardiac regulating mechanism
was intact.
    2. Experiments after section of the cardiac augmentor nerves, the
vagi being left uninjured.
    3. Experiments       in which the vagi were divided, the cardiac
augmentor nerves remaining intact.
    4. Experiments in which the whole of the cardiac nerves were
divided, all direct connexion between the heart and the central
nervous system being thus severed.
   * The expenses of this research were for   the most part defrayed by a grant from
the Royal Society.

 1893.]       Nervous System      on the  Cardiac Rhythm,   fyc.          465
    The main results of     these experiments   I shall now state briefly  : —
    1. Experiments   in which   the Entire Cardiac Regulating Mechanism
                                   was Intact.
    When chloroform is administered by inhalation in the nsual way,
two well-marked stages are usually evident in its action on the
cardiac rhythm : —
    A. A stage of acceleration far beyond the ordinary pulse rate of
the animal.     From the normal rate of 120—130 (cat), the pulse may
rise as high as 240 — 250.       The acceleration occurs during the general
excitement induced by the anaesthetic.
    After a time, as the administration of chloroform progresses, the
 acceleration diminishes and gives place to the second stage.
    B. A stage of moderate or slow pulse rates. In this stage the
 cardiac rhythm falls towards the normal rate ; it may eome to be
 closely similar to the normal rate (120 — 130 per minute), or it may
 stand at a higher or a lower level, though within such limits as to
 render the pulse frequency a comparatively moderate one (90 — 150
 per minute).     This stage usually continues during deep anresthesia,
 and even when the narcosis becomes very profound and dangerous.
    These stages, as seen in the cat, closely resemble, in their general
 character, the similar phases usually recognisable during the admin
 istration of chloroform in man.
    It should be mentioued that in some cases the reduction of pulse
 rate which follows the primary acceleration is comparatively slight,
 the frequency of the beat remaining high above the normal standard
 even during profound anaesthesia.         The conditions determining such
 a difference from the usual course of events cannot be discussed here ;
 they are considered in my detailed paper on the subject.          In some
 other  other  animals   (e.g., the  hare)  the heart  commonly  beats   with
 great rapidity (260, &c.) even during deep anaesthesia, and in this
respect such animals differ notably from the cat and from man.
    During a certain period of chloroform anaesthesia the cardiac
rhythm may readily      be altered to a very important    degree— either in
the direction of slowing or acceleration — by excitation of afferent
 nerves or by changes in the blood pressure, &c. The period alluded
to comprises the latter part of the first stage or stage of acceleration
and the earlier part of the second stage or stage of moderate or
slow pulse rate. I do not wish to imply that at no other phase of
chloroform administration can changes in the heart's rhythm be
brought about by similar causes, but only that the period referred to
is the one most favourable to their ready manifestation, and the one
in which their action is most constant. In the latter part of the
second stage the cardiac rhythm passes beyond the influence of afferent
impulses.

   It  need  hardly   be remarked   that   if strong chloroform  vapour    be
too suddenly administered, well-marked reflex slowing of the heart
may occur, as is well known ; and such slowing may precede what I
have described as the first stage or stage of acceleration.
   Evidence as to the mode in which chloroform brings about the
alterations in the cardiac rhythm which have been mentioned is
afforded by the results of the subsequent series of experiments.
    2. Experiments after Section of the Cardiac Augmentor Nerves,       the
                           Vagi being left Uninjured.
    Those nerves were divided by an operation in which resection of
the two uppermost ribs was performed, artificial respiration being
maintained ; the inferior cervical and the 1st thoracic (stellate)
ganglia, together with the annulus of Vieussens, were completely re
moved on both sides, their connexions with the spinal nerves and the
vagi being followed up for a considerable distance and divided.           The
sympathetic chain was cut through about 2 cm. above the inferior
cervical ganglion, and about the same distance below the ganglion
stellatum.      The vagi themselves were left intact.
    No blood     vessels were tied, and there was nothing beyond      a very
inconsiderable loss of blood in the whole proceeding.
    When the influence of the cardiac augmentor nerves has been ex.
eluded in this way there is no essential change evident in the action
 of chloroform upon the cardiac rhythm ; the stage of acceleration (A)
 and that of moderate or slow rate (B) are still plainly apparent
 during the lighter and the more profound phases of anassthesia. It
 is clear, then, the augmentor nerves are not the essential channels
 through which chloroform produced its important effects upon the
 pulse rate.
 3. Experiments     in which  the Vagi  were Divided, the Cardiac Augmentor
                            Nerves remaining Intact.
    The results obtained in this set of experiments were so essentially
 similar to those of the following group that the two may be taken
 together.    The presence of the intact augmentor nerves does not seem
 to be of any essential importance as far as the effect of chloroform on
 the cardiac rhythm is concerned.
 4. Experiments     in which all the Cardiac Nerves were Divided, all  Direct
       Connexion between the Heart and the Central Nervous System        being
       thus Severed.
    In this condition the heart beats very rapidly, being liberated from
 the controlling influence of the cardio-inhibitory centre in the medulla.

1893.]       Nervous System on    the Cardiac Rhythm, §c.           4G7
The rate of action rises far above the normal, provided the blood
pressure remain good, and the temperature and general condition of
the animal continue satisfactory ; the pulse rate rises from a normal
rhythm of 120 — -130 to one varying from 216 to as high a figure of
240 — 250, according to the depth of the anaesthesia and other cir
cumstances.
    When the heart is beating in this very rapid fashion the further
administration of chloroform deepening the annesthesia, induces, as a
 rule, a very distinct reduction in the pulse rate, whilo at the same
time the blood pressure falls markedly.      The reduction in the pulse
rate is not at all comparable in extent to that which usually follows a
similar dose of chloroform while the vagi are intact : the diminution
m rapidity in the present case (when the vagi or all the cardiac nerves
are cut) is comparatively a slight one, e.g., a reduction from the rate
of 240 to one of 200, &c.
   But, though the slowing of the rhythm is a much less extensive one
than occurs while the vagi are intact, it is at the same time a very
 appreciable and constant one ; and, moreover, it is important, de
pending as it evidently does on some cause affecting the heart itself,
and not exerted through the influence of the regulating (extra-
cardiac) nerves.
   Now, as to the mode in which this slowing effect is produced in the
action   of the cardiac mechanism, the possible influence of the
markedly-lowered     blood pressure has to be taken into account. We
know that in certain circumstances a great lowering of the blood
pressure may lead to a very pronounced slowing of the pulse rate,
and the question arises as to whether such a cause is sufficient to
explain the reduction in rate caused by chloroform in the conditions
now under      consideration.   I  conclude  that it is not, for these
reasons : —
    1. The diminution in the rate of heart beat may begin early when
the fall of pressure is only slightly developed, and
    2. A similar, or indeed a much greater fall of blood pressure
lasting for similar periods, when induced by mechanical causes (e.g.,
compression of portal vein, &c.), entirely fails to cause any diminu
tion of rate like that which occurs when the pressure is lowered by
chloroform.     Experiments in which reduction of blood pressure of
equal amount and duration were alternately induced by (a) chloro
form and (6) mechanical causes have clearly shown this.
    There is good reason to believe that chloroform has a special
influence on the rhythmic mechanism of the heart, an influence not
dependent on the concomitant lowering of the blood pressure caused
by the drug.
   Again, as to the nature of the influence exerted by chloroform in
this way, it can    be shown  that the slowing   is not dependent on a

468    Dr.    J.   A. Mac William.    Influence   of the Central   [May   18,
stimulation  of the local inhibitory mechanism of the heart. For the
administration of atropin in doses sufficient to paralyse that mechan
ism does not obviate the slowing effect of the anaesthetic.        (The
paralysed condition of the inhibitory mechanism was verified by
strong electrical stimulation    of the inhibitory area, described in
                         '
former papers in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. 44,
and the ' Journal of Physiology,' vol. 9, 1888.)
   From these results it appears that chloroform acts on the heart,
and distinctly slows its rate of beat through a depressing or retarding
influence exerted on the intrinsic rhythmic mechanism of the organ.
   Further, it is evident that the reduction in the pulse rate that
occurs in the second stage (B) of chloroform anaesthesia is of a two
fold origin : it partly results from the action of chloroform on the
heart itself, but it very largely depends on the integrity of the vagi.
The vagns centre in the medulla, though rendered incapable of reflex
excitation, is not paralysed even during deep anaesthesia; it con
tinues, as a rule, to exert a very important controlling influence upon
the cardiac rhythm, and it is indeed to the exercise of this controlling
influence that the reduction of the pulse rate from the excessively
high rapidity often present during the stage of acceleration is mainly
due.   Even during profound anaesthesia, section of the vagi leads, as
a rule, to a striking acceleration of the pulse rate, though the rapidity
does not become as great as during a lighter anaesthesia.      When the
anaesthesia   is allowed    to       less deep the rate of heart beat
                                 become
increases decidedly.
   As regards the notable acceleration of the heart which occurs in
the first stage (A) of chloroform administration (stage of excitement),
this is not to be accounted for by an assumed excitation of the cardiac
augmentor nerves, for marked acceleration occurs under the influence
of the anaesthetic even when the augmentor nerves have been excluded
by section.
   On the other hand, the action of chloroform at different stages of
its administration on the heart itself after section of all the cardiac
nerves shows no ground for assuming that the acceleration might be
due to direct influence on the intrinsic rhythmic mechanism.
  Moreover, the general indications of excitement in the central
nervous system (respiratory centre, &c.) point to the probable occur
rence of central changes in the centres of the regulating nerves.
And as an assumed activity of the angmentor nerves has been set
aside as inadequate to meet the facts, there remain only the vagi. A
reduction in the controlling influence of the vagus centre would cause
such an acceleration as that which usually occurs, and it is, I believe,
to such a change that the quickened pulse rate is mainly, if not
entirely, due.
  This change — the diminution in activity of the vagus centre —            ifi

  1893.]        Nervous System    on the  Cardiac Rhythm, §c.             469
  not due simpjy to a fall of blood pressure ; it occurs while the blood
  pressure is still high, and shows no constant relation to alterations in
 the pressure, sometimes occurring when the blood pressure is rising,
  and sometimes when it is falling, and at other times when there is no
 important alteration of level.
     The cause of the alteration of phases of slowing and acceleration is
  to be sought in an alternately increased and diminished activity of
  the vagus centre. Further evidence regarding the occurrence of such
  variations in the conditions of the centre will be adduced later in
  this paper.
     In those   cases alluded  to — when the heart continues to beat at a
  rapid rate even during profound anaesthesia — the cause appears to lie
 mainly in a continued suspension of the activity of the vagus centre,
 a great diminution or a removal of its controlling influence on the
 heart.     In this condition chloroform may still slow the heart, though
 only to a relatively slight extent, by its direct influence on its
 intrinsic rhythmic mechanism of the organ.
 II.  On the    Relation of the Heart's Rhythm to Changes in Blood
                                   Pressure.
    It  is well known, since the work of Ludwig and Thiry up-on the
 subject, that changes in blood pressure may affect the rate of the
 heart's beat otherwise than through the mediation of the cardiac
regulating nerves.
    Many investigators have dealt with this relation, with wide varia
 tions in the results arrived at ; and such variation is not surprising
 when one considers the different conditions that may be present in
 such    experiments, differences as to the animals used, the drugs
 (curare, chloral, morphia, Ac.) administered, the various levels from
 which the change of blood pressure may start, the duration of such
pre-existing level, the character and duration of the change itself, the
conditions as regards intra-cardiac tension (in one or more parts of
 the organ) attendant on changes in the arterial pressure, Ac.
    In view of such circumstances, I have found it necessary to per
form a considerable number of experiments to demonstrate how
far the cardiac rhythm was affected by blood pressure changes in
such conditions      of experiment as those commonly present in the
present investigation (simple chloroform anaesthesia, &c.), especially
as regards the competency of more or less sudden blood pressure
changes of short duration to account for important changes in the
rate of the heart's beat.
    Such experiments I have performed in the following conditions: —
    A.   When- the heart was released  from all direct   influence which may
be   exercised  through  the cardiac regulating  nerves. — By section of all

470      Dr. J. A. Mac William.      Influence of  the Central   [May  18,
these nerves, or by destruction or death of the medulla and cervical
spinal cord (cat and rabbit).
   The general results obtained were these : — a. In this condition it
was found that the existence of an extremely low pressure continuing
for   some time   (minutes) leads to a very pronounced slowiug of the
pulse   rate, and a subsequent elevation of the pressure may cause a
more or less extensive acceleration of the beat.
   6. An exceedingly high blood pressure may cause marked slow
ing of the heart through its influence on the intra-cardiac mechanism.
   c.  When the blood pressure is at a fair height, the occurrence of
a great fall of pressure lasting for short periods {e.g., 30 seconds)
causes no change in the cardiac rhythm.
   Nor   does a rise of pressure  from this low level — established as it
has been for only a brief space of time — to the preceding level, or
even a good deal higher, involve any appreciable change in the pulse
rate.
   A similar negative result is present when, instead of undergoing a
fall from the original level, the pressure is made to rise ; there is no
change in the pulse rate unless the rise attains to such proportions as
to induce the slowing mentioned in (6).
   There can be no doubt that extensive variations in the blood
pressure (e.g., between 30 — 40 mm. and 150 — 160 mm.) if of brief
duration do not as a rule involve any important or constant change
in the rate of the heart's beat.
   B. When all     the Cardiac Nerves were Intact. — The results  here  ob
tained were in complete accordance with those usually described— a
raised blood pressure causing well-marked slowing of the heart, and
a fall of blood pressure carrying with it a notable acceleration— in
the absence of disturbing or complicating causes.
   It may be remarked that similar changes are seen after the cardiac
augmentor nerves have been divided ; they are evidently essentially
due to changes in the activity of the vagi.
   It may alRO be noted that the continuance of an        excessively low
pressure will ultimately lead to a great slowing of      the pulse rate —
following on the primary acceleration — in virtue of     the influence of
such a condition of blood pressure on the cardiac         rhythm already
mentioned (A, a), so that an extreme and prolonged        lowering of the
blood pressure occurring when the heart is beating at an approxi
mately normal rate causes first a remarkable acceleration of the pulse,
which ultimately gives place to a slow rate of beat. The latter
change may be counteracted by an abnormally high temperature if
such is present.

III.  On the   Effrcts   op  Excitation of Afferent Nerves        upon  the
                             Cardiac Rhythm.
   The changes excited in the cardiac rhythm as a result of stimula
tion of afferent nerves in favourable circumstances may be either
of the nature (A) of a slowing or (B) an acceleration of the heart
beat ; whether the former (A) or the latter (B) takes place varies
according to the conditions present at the time — the particular nerve
stimulated, the strength and suddenness of the stimulation, the exact
degree of chloroform anaesthesia, and the state of the medullary
centres in other respects.
     Some Features   in the Results of Stimulation of Afferent  Nerves.
   1. Speaking generally, excitation of visceral or splanchnic afferent
nerves (e g., vagus, cervical sympathetic, abdominal splanchnic, &(-.),
is more readily effective in altering the cardiac rhythm under chloro
form than excitation of somatic afferent nerves. The result may be
acceleration or slowing, or an alternation of these, in the case of
either class of nerves.
   2. Moreover, there is a very important difference between the action
of the splanchnic and that of the somatic afferent nerves upon the
pulse rate. The acceleration resulting from a stimulation of somatic
nerves is accompanied by signs of diffuse motor excitation as indi
cated by the occurrence of more or less general muscular contrac
tion, whereas acceleration often results from stimulating splanchnic
or visceral nerves when there are no concomitant movements and no
sign of any association with general motor excitation at all. In
curarised animals, such as have been used by the great majority of
investigators, this difference would not of course be evident.
   3. Again, strong sudden stimulation         of an afferent nerve may
cause  marked   slowing,  while  weaker   and  more  gradual stimulation of
the same nerve causes acceleration.        Omteris paribus, strong sudden
stimulation is relatively more apt to cause slowing.        (Of course this
does  not  necessarily  hold  good  with   natural  stimulation  of various
afferent nerves.)
   4. Further stimulation of such nerves (e.g., the brachial or inter
costal) may cause notable slowing of the heart in suitable conditions
of anaesthesia (in the period already referred to as the most favour
able one) ; but they commonly cause acceleration as their only effect
on the cardiac rhythm when the anaesthesia is rendered somewhat
deeper ; and at a still later phase the afferent excitation induces no
change at all in the pulse rate. An excitation which causes slowing,
followed by acceleration, of the heart, at a certain phase of anaesthesia,
commonly fails to cause any slowing at all, but only acceleration       — if
                  —
any effect at all when more chloroform has been given.

  Mechanism through which Changes            in the Cardiac Rhythm are induced
                                 by Afferent Impulses.
     A.   "Reflex  Slowing. — The essential mechanism of reflex slowing is
  clear enough, the change being dne, as is commonly believed, to an
  increased activity of the vagus centre; it does not depend on altera
  tions in the blood pressure, or asphyxial conditions, or on any
  influence of the augmentor nerves, for it may be readily excited in
  the usual way after these nerves have been cut.
     B. Reflex Acceleration. — It is evident that this change might be
  due to an alteration         in the regulating influence exercised by the
  central nervons system on the heart through the cardiac nerves (vagi
  and augmentors), or to changed conditions induced in the heart itself,
  or to a combination of such causes.
           Influence of the Cardiac Augmentor Nerves and the Vagi.
     I  have come to the conclusion         that the augmentor    nerves do not
  play the essential part, i.e., that the reflex acceleration is not essen
  tially dependent upon excitation of the augmentor nerves.
     The chief evidence on this point may be briefly stated as follows :—
     1.  The latency and character of the acceleration which often results
 from    excitation   of afferent nerves may be entirely different from what
  has been shown by many observers to be characteristic of the action of the
 augmentor       nerves. — Stimulation of the latter is followed, as is well
 known, by a long latent period, and then a quickening or rhythm
 begins, and gradually increases to a maximum (5, 10, or 15 seconds
 after the beginning of the stimulation, usually) ; later, the accelera
 tion declines and gradually disappears. But when an afferent nerve
 is excited, the resulting cardiac acceleration not unfrequently presents
 itself after an exceedingly short and hardly appreciable interval, oc
 curring with remarkable suddenness, and at once, or almost at once,
 attaining a very high value, or, it may be, its maximum.           Such cases,
though by no means the most common ones as regards the results of
afferent excitation, are sufficiently numerous and unmistakable to be
 highly significant in the present connexion, showing, as they do,
features in the change of rhythm which differ most strikingly from
 those characteristic of the action of the augmentors, and which, on
the other hand, correspond most closely with what occurs when the
controlling influence of the vagi is diminished or removed.
    In  some    cases the extensive acceleration which may follow stimu
lation    of afferent nerves sometimes, after lasting for a variable
period, suddenly cives place to a phase of slow heart beat, the reflex
Acceleration vanishing as abruptly as it had begun. A more or less
rhythmical alternation         of suddenly recurring     phases of acceleration

189;5.]            Kervovs Si/stem   on the   Cardiac Rhythm, $c.            473
and slowing may at times be seen, and strongly suggests the occur
rence of corresponding variations in the activity of the vagus centre
as   their     cause.
     An assumed excitation of the augmentor nerves could not afford
a probable explanation of these facts; and the evidence points very
decidedly to changes in the activity of the vagus centre as the
primary and paramount cause of both the slowing and the accelera
tion reflexly excited in the way referred to.
   2. The result of stimulation of afferent nerves after section of the vagi
while the cardiac augmentor nerves remain intact. — Section of the vagi
in the cat leads to a great acceleration of the cardiac rhythm, the
pulse rate rising to a maximal rate of 216—250;             the maximum
varying to        some extent   in different animals and in different circum
stances.
   In this condition, the augmentor nerves being uninjured, excitation
of afferent nerves gives rise to no further acceleration. But this does
not constitute any proof as to whether the augmentor nerves are
reflexly excited by afferent stimulation or not. For the circumstances
are not favourable for augmentor excitation being effective in causing
any notable change in the cardiac rhythm. It            is,
                                                      indeed, quite clear,
as shown by direct stimulation, that the augmentors can accelerate
the heart after section of both vagi, e.g., when the blood pressure           is
extremely low, and the cardiac rhythm slowed in consequence their        ;
action    not confined to counteracting of the controlling influence of
           is                   a
the vagi upon the rhythmic mechanism.        But when the vagi are cut,
and the heart beats at the high maximal rate mentioned above, the
blood pressure remaining high and the bodily temperature, the
respiration, &c., being satisfactory, direct stimulation of the aug
mentor nerves     without any appreciable accelerating effect upon the
                        is
pulse rate. In such circumstances then, when the heart         beating
                                                                    is
at its high (maximal) rate, the non-occurrence of acceleration in
response to excitation of afferent nervos cannot be taken as evidence
that the cardiac augmentor centre is not reflexly affected by afferent
impulses.
     It  necessary, therefore, to reduce the cardiac rhythm to a lower
          is
level, at which      might be expected (judging from the results of
                         it

is done, an afferent nerve (which waB found to give marked reflex
deceleration as long as the vagi were intact) can now be stimulated
as before, with the result of causing evident manifestations of general
motor excitement, shown by the occurrence of marked convulsive
movements ; but in this case there is no cardiac acceleration. The
moderate rhythm maintained by slight continued excitation of the
vagus is not appreciably interfered with by stimulation of afferent
nerves ; and this negative re-tult I have obtained in every experiment
with complete constancy.           It strongly opposes the idea that the
sudden and extensive acceleration frequently seen on stimulating
afferent nerves is due to a reflex action of the augmentor nerves ; for,
as soon as the vagi are cut, no reflex acceleration occurs, even when,
as in these experiments, the heart was kept beating at a moderate
rate, a condition favourable to the marked manifestation of the in
fluence of augmentor excitation upon the cardiac rhythm.
   3. The results nf excitation of afferent nerves, after section of the
cardiac augmentor nerves, the integrity of the vagi not being interfered
with. — The augmentor nerves were cut by a mode of operative pro
cedure already stated. That the vagi remained uninjured was shown
by their being readily excited through a rise of blood pressure or by
a suitable stimulation of certain afferent nerves, well marked slowing
of the heart being evident in each case.
   In this condition, the cardiac augmentors being now excluded,
stimulation of afferent nerves, which caused acceleration prior to
section of the augmentors, can still cause a very marked quickening
of the pulse rate. In the case of the brachial or intercostal nerves,
for example, stimulation (mechanical or electrical) leads, in favour
able circumstances, to a very decided change in rhythm, provided as
before that the stimulation is also effective in causing general motor
excitation  ;   an acceleration is speedily induced, frequently to the
extent of 20 per cent., but sometimes much more.
   In some cases a brief phase of cardiac slowing is also seen; and
in other instances a more or less regular alternation of phases of
Blowing and acceleration presents itself.           The same general relation
already noted as obtaining between the strength and suddenness of
the stimulation, the excitability of the medullary centres (depending
on depth of anaesthesia), and the nature of the change in rhythm as
regards the occurrence of slowing or acceleration, is again observable
here ; also the notable difference between the splanchnic and somatic
nerves, as regards the constant association of general motor excite
ment with the reflex cardiac acceleration which occurs in the latter
case, and the frequent absence of any such association in the former.
   In   short, the action of afferent excitation upon              the cardiac
rhythm,   as   far at least as its  main   features  are  concerned, is essenti
ally similar whether the augmentor nerves are divided or intact.

sources is in complete accord the evidence derived from (1) a con
sideration of the nature of the cardiac acceleration which may occur,
(2) the negative results obtained after section of the vagi, and
(3) the (complementary) positive results seen in unmistakable form
after exclusion of the augmentors while the vagi remain intact.
        Possibility of Changes in the Peripheral Efficiency of the Vagi.
   It remains to be seen how far a diminution of the controlling in
fluence exercised by the medulla on the cardiac rhythm might be due
to changes in the heart itself — changes leading to an impairment of
the peripheral efficiency of the vagi, e.g., the influence of the pro
ducts of muscular contraction, or of altered conditions of intra-cardiac
tension, especially in the right heart, depending on the occurrence of
convulsive movements, Ac.
   As far as the splanchnic afferent nerves are concerned, these causes
may be set aside, for, as has been already stated, reflex acceleration
frequently occurs without any contraction of the skeletal muscles.
   In the case of the stimulation of the somatic afferent nerves (where
muscular contraction does occur) it is quite clear that the causes
mentioned above are also unessential.   Reflex acceleration sometimes
occurs with an amount of    muscular    contraction far too slight to
cause any such sudden alterations   in either of the ways suggested ;
and, more, it may occur even after the skeletal muscles have been
paralysed by curare.   It has been already stated that there is no
constant relation between the changes in blood pressure (frequently
slight in amount) and the occurrences of reflex acceleration.
   Farther, I have examined the relation borne towards the peripheral
efficiency of the vagi by (a) changes in arterial and intra-cardiac
pressure and (b) well marked convulsive        movements excited by
stimulation of afferent nerves, after all the cardiac nerves have been
cut, or the medulla destroyed or killed (cat or rabbit).    The results
have been as follows : —
   a. Great and sudden changes in arterial pressure (e.g., between 40
and 150 mm.) induced by compression of the descending thoracic or
the upper part of the abdominal aorta, closure of the vena porta, &c.,
for short periods (e.g., 30 sees.) though frequently accompanied by
great changes in intra-cardiac tension had little or no appreciable
effect upon the maintenance of the moderate or slow rate of beat
maintained by slight continued excitation of the vagns in the neck.
  i>.The occurrence of very marked convulsive movements in
response to stimulation of afferent nerves does not, even after several
seconds, cause any perceptible change in the slowing influence of
Blight continued excitation of the vagus.

47u"       Dr. J.  A. MacWilliam.         Influence  of   the Central     [May  18,
    It is obvious that, whatever effects a continuation of altered intra
cardiac tension or muscular action may have upon the peripheral
efficiency of the vagi, those causes are not in any way capable of
accounting for such sudden and extensive reflex acceleration as is
frequently seen when an afferent nerve is stimulated.
    The primary and essential cause of the altered cardiac rhythm is
clearly to be sought elsewhere, and it is obviously to be found in an
altered activity of the central vagus mechanism.                 The acceleration
depends on a diminution in activity of the vagus or cardio-iuhibitory
centre; just as the cardiac slowing is due to an increased activity of
the same centre.*
          Influence of Muscular Exertion upon the Cardiac Rhythm.
    The striking association of cardiac acceleration with motor effort
following excitation of afferent nerves distinctly suggests the
existence of a somewhat close connexion between the motor me
chanism and the cardiac regulating centres in the medulla.                   As has
already been stated, the essential connexion is with the vagus centre ;
a diminished activity of that centre is associated with motor effort
and leads to an accelerated heart beat.
    And there is much to be said in favour of the hypothesis that a
similar lessening of the controlling influence exercised by the vagus
centre on the heart occurs during muscular exertion and constitutes
at least one of the causes of the characteristic quickening of the
pulse.f
    It may be noted that in certain conditions of impaired health the
heart becomes accelerated with extreme readiness from exertions, a
very brief interval elapsing between the commencement of muscular
actions and the change in cardiac rhythm.                  In some such instances
it is difficult to find a feasible explanation either in an assumed in
 fluence of the products of contraction or in a supposed excitation of
 the augmentor nerves.
     It is interesting to note that animals endowed with great staving
powers (dog, horse, &c.) have, in many cases at least, a comparatively
Blow pulse rate in the quiescent condition ; and that the heart is
capable of an immense relative increase in the rate of its action as
seen during mutcular exertion or on section of the vagi.                    The con-
    * Some recent observers (Roy and Adami, ' Phil. Trans.,'

that the cardiac acceleration resulting from stimulation of afferent nerves may be
taken as an indication of the action of the augmentor nerves on the heart.        The
untrustivorthiness of this assumption — in the light of the results stated above —
need hardly be commented on.

in determining tlie pulse rate during erdinary muscular cxerriso.

ditions present, in this connexion, in two such animals as the hare
and the rabbit are very noteworthy.             These animals, though very
closely allied, from a zoological point of view, live under very dif
ferent functional conditions in certain respects : the rabbit is able to
run short distances with great rapidity, but not to traverse long dis
tances without intermission — this being uo doubt in relation to the
fact of their having burrows to flee to ; the hare, on the other hand,
destitute of such means of protection, has to depend, in the open
country, upon its endurance in swift locomotion.           On examining the
cardiac rhythm of this animal,         I find it presents a remarkable con
trast to that of the    rabbit.   In  the  latter animal, section of the vagi,
as is well known, causes comparatively little acceleration.               In the
hare, on the other hand, in which the normal pulse-rate is much
slower (e.g., 64 per minute), the heart beats at an enormously in
creased rate (e.g., 264 in the same animal) after the vagi have been
divided.
   In this animal, while the vagi are intact, the cardiac rhythm shows
very sudden and extensive changes when the animal is disturbed, &c.
These changes are probably due to alterations in the activity of the
vagus centre.
              Influence of Emotion upon the Cardiac Rhythm.
   The characteristic acceleration of the heart induced by emotion in
animals and in man is probably due, largely or mainly, to a di
minished activity of the cardio-inhibitory centre. The acceleration is
sometimes preceded by a phase of slowed action, due to excitation of
the same centre, and the entire effects present a very striking re
semblance to those induced by afferent impulses. This correspondence
strongly suggests that the effects are, in the two cases, primarily de
pendent on similar causes —changes in the activity of the vagus
centre — the primary slowing being due to a heightened activity of
the centre and the subsequent acceleration to a reaction in the way of
diminished activity — resembling what may be seen in certain other
centres under the influence of emotional conditions.          The suddenness
and extent of the alterations in cardiac action sometimes induced
by powerful emotion are easily applicable in connexion with such a
view.
                                   Conclusion.
   From the evidence available on the subject, there is good reason
to believe that, in addition to the well-known influences of blood
pressure, asphyxial blood, &c., upon the vagus centre, the activity
of that centre is affected either in way of increase or diminution
by the play»of      afferent    impulses    from various  parts, by impulses
                                                                    2 L 2

 V.      On the presence of Urea in the Blood of Birds, and its
         bearing upon the Formation of Uric Acid in the Animal
         Body." By Sir ALFRED GARROD, M.D., F.R.S. Received
         May  2, 1893.
    Some experiments upon which I have recently been engaged have
yielded results which appear to be inconsistent with any explanation
yet advanced of the mode of formation of uric acid in the animal body,
and to necessitate a new theory of its formation.        These results I
propose to discuss in the present paper, but before doing so it will be
well to refer briefly to the different views upon this subject which
have been from time to time advanced.
    Until the year 1847 it was commonly supposed that uric acid was
formed in the kidneys themselves, none having ever been detected in
the blood, but in that year I succeeded in demonstrating the presence
of uric acid in the blood of gouty subjects, which led to the conclu
sion that uric acid was formed in certain other organs and tissues of
the body, and was merely eliminated by the kidneys.
    It is now generally supposed that in mammals urea is produced as
the ultimate product of the metabolism of nitrogenised tissues, the
formation of a soluble urate being an intermediate stage of the meta
bolism ; but that in birds the nitrogen is eliminated in the form of
urate of ammonium without having undergone the further change
into urea. Many efforts have been made to explain why these
changes should be so different in animals of these two classes. A
view once very popular and supported by great authority was that
the difference could be accounted for by the amount of oxidation in
the system ; for example, it was assumed that, as respiration in the
cold-blooded animals is slow and imperfect, the uric acid is not broken
up, but is eliminated in the form of urate of ammonium ; whereas in
hot-blooded animals, such as the mammalia, the oxidation processes
are more active and urea is produced.      Those who held this opinion
had in mind only the mammal and the reptile ; altogether overlook
ing the fact that the bird, which throws out uric acid in the same way
as the reptile, has even hotter blood and a more active respiration
than the mammalia themselves.         Hence this view had to be aban

 doned, and the difficulty of explaining the above-mentioned changes
 remained as before.
     Another explanation was that the occurrence of urea or uric acid
 is dependent on the character of the food, and even at the present
 time it is often assumed that a highly nitrogenised food, such as meat,
 leads to the production and elimination of a large amount of uric
 acid. The fallacy of this I showed in a paper read before this Society
 in 1886, in which I proved conclusively that mammals living on raw
 meat threw out infinitely less uric acid in proportion to their weight
 than small birds fed on canary seed and water.       In that paper it was
 shown that the lion and the tiger eliminated probably less than a
 hundred thousandth part of their weight of uric acid per diem,
 whereas a small bird would eliminate as much as an eighty-fifth of
 its own weight.      The amount of uric acid cannot, therefore, depend
 on the mere nature of the food.
     There are, however, physiologists who do not consider it necessary
 to assume that urea must previously have existed as urate of am
 monium, and some few have hinted that there may even be a synthe
 sis in the production of uric acid.    The whole subject is, however, in
 a state of great uncertainty, and, as Dr. Michael Foster has stated in
 bis   '
         Text-book of Physiology,' " The whole story of proteid meta
 bolism consists at present mostly of guesses and of gaps."
     The difficulties in connexion with the formation of uric acid in the
 animal    body have been before my mind    for many years, and the aim
 of this paper is to suggest a solution which, in the first place, accords
 with facts which have been long established, and, in the second place,
 with others which I have recently discovered and proved experi
 mentally.
    It has always been difficult to me to believe that the metabolism of
nitrogenised tissues should differ so completely in animals which are
 so closely allied in most other respects as the toad and the lizard, but
 which excrete their nitrogen, the one as urea, the other in the form
of urate of ammonium, their diet being identical, and I think it will
 be found that the assumption that urea must be a product of the
oxidation of urate of ammonium, has had much to do with the diffi
culties which have arisen in connexion with this subject.
    Let us now consider certain points in the physiology of urea and
uric acid, beginning with urea.
    In mammalia, including man, it has been ascertained that urea is
always present in the blood, and, though the quantity may be small,
it  is sufficient, nevertheless, to be measurable.    I   have recently ob
tained it not only from the blood of man. but also from that of the
ox, the sheep, the goat, and the dog. And I have also confirmed a
statement made by M. Picard that the blood of the renal artery is
                                                               2 l 3

 mnch richer in urea than the blood of the renal vein, in the propor
 tion, according to my experiments, of about three to one; of about
 two to one according to the experiments of M. Pieard.
    As far as I am aware, urea has never hitherto been detected in the
blood of birds.      Possibly it has never been looked for, as it would
scarcely have been imagined that urea could be contained in the
blood of an animal excreting only urate of ammonium.           I have, how
ever, recently found that the blood of birds contains urea in quantities
not less than those found in the blood of mammals.            The views I
entertained    on tho  formation  of uric acid in the animal body led me
to investigate this subject, as they necessitated the presence of urea
in the blood of the uric-acid-excreting animals, as well as in the blood
of those which eliminate urea only.
    As the question of the existence of urea in the blood of different
animals is of so much importance in connexion with the subject of
this communication, I have taken special pains to determine not only
that it is present, but also in what relative amounts, and the methods
 I have made use of have been as follows : —
    In all my experiments 1 made use of dried blood, which form was
by far the most convenient for my purpose.         It was thus obtained : —
Wide-mouthed bottles were half filled with absolute alcohol, and the
blood as it flowed from the animal fell directly into the bottle, after
 which the spirit and the blood were intimately mixed by shaking.
This mixture was then dried on a water-bath, reduced to a very fine
powder, and kept in air-tight bottles. In making experiments, I
assumed that one part of dried blood equalled five parts of liquid blood.
    To determine the amount of urea I adopt tho following method.
 The dried blood is treated with about six times its weight of distilled
water, very slightly acidulated with oxalic acid, and this is heated in
 a water-bath to about 75° C. for at least six hours.     The next day the
residual blood is again treated in the same way with fresh acidulated
water and again heated. The fluids poured off are then filtered and
evaporated to dryness.       Any urea abstracted from the blood is now
in the form of the sparingly soluble oxalate of urea. If any oily matter
is found in the residue of the evaporated fluids, this can easily be re
moved by washing with potassium naphtha, in which the salt of urea
is totally insoluble.     The residue is next treated with distilled water
and a small quantity of the carbonate of barium (sufficient to cause a
slight alkaline reaction) is stirred up with it. By this means the
urea is set free and the oxalic acid fully neutralised. .
    After again evaporating to dryness, the residue is boiled with
absolute alcohol, by which means the urea (together with small traces
of other substances) is dissolved ; and when this has been filtered into
a large watch glass and evaporated spontaneously       the urea is obtained
in  a solid form.

  If    this is again dissolved in distilled water and the solution intro
duced into a small ureometer filled with the solution of hypobromite
of sodium, the quantity of nitrogen given off can be readily deter
mined and the amount of urea in the solution can be deduced from
it.    1 gramme of urea equals 0-46 gramme of nitrogen, or 372-7 c.c.
In practice, however, 354-3 c.c. have been obtained.
    If, on the other hand, we wish to crystallise the salt and directly
weigh the amount, this is best effected by adding a few drops of nitric
acid to the urea solution, so causing the formation of nitrate of urea.
This can be weighed, after purification, by redissolving it in absolute
alcohol.
   The fact that the residue left after evaporation is undoubtedly
nitrate of urea is proved by the characteristic form of the crystals
(either simple rhomboids or aggregated varieties of these), or by a
microscopic test which I have adopted of adding a" drop of the hypo
bromite of sodium to the crystal under the microscope, and seeing the
innumerable bubbles of nitrogen which are given off.

  It will         be   that, if we compare these results, the amount of
                        seen
urea in       the blood of the mammal and of the bird is practically
identical.
   It has been found that in normal human blood the urea varies from
0-020 to 0-040 per cent.     My results, obtained from the different
animals above mentioned, are all within these limits.
   When urea is introduced into the stomach of a mammal, it is
eliminated by the kidneys in an unchanged form.       This has repeat
edly been shown to be the case, and the fact is not questioned by
physiologists.   On the other hand, when urea is introduced into the
stomach of a bird, or other uric-acid-excreting animal, it is not thrown
out in the form in which it is introduced ; but there        instead, an              is,
increased formation  of uric acid. This has been shown to be the case
by H. Meyer and M. Jaffe.*

   The blood of healthy birds, instead of containing uric acid, as
would naturally be supposed,         usually quite free from that sub

I  have recently had occasion to examine most minutely the blood
the goose, the fowl, and the turkey, and have found that, although
fairly rich in urea, no uric acid could be separated from it. We may,
therefore, conclude that birds may throw out uric acid by the kidneys,
               not present in their blood.
             it is
although    it
   Perhaps    will be desirable to mention here that uric acid intro
duced into the stomach of the bird as a soluble urate        absorbed      is
into the blood, which becomes so saturated with         that     it
                                                               can be       it
crystallised out with  the greatest ease.
   Uric acid thus introduced into the system    not thrown out by the
                                                            is
kidneys, as these organs appear to be incapable of eliminating     and            it,
this applies not only to the bird but to the mammal also. This fact
has been proved by the researches of Zabelli.
   Having considered these facts, the correctuess of which    capable       is
of being fully established, we are justified, think, in coming to the
                                                       I
following conclusions —  :
   First. That in mammalia and other urea-excreting animals the
metabolism of the nitrogenised tissues results in the formation                          of
urea as an ultimate product     that an appreciable and measurable
                                    ;
amount of this substance    always found in their blood, and
                               is                               con              is
stantly being excreted by the kidneys   and, further,
                                               ;      that any cause
leading to the decrease of this excretion produces an augmentation                       of
the urea in the blood. It necessarily follows from this that, as stated
above, the blood of the renal artery      richer in urea than the blood
                                              is
of the renal vein.
   Second. That in birds and other uric-acid-excreting      animals the
metabolism   of  the nitrogenised  tissues     exactly  the
                                                       is   same as in
mammals, and that urea        isthe ultimate product of this metabolism                  ;
that urea   is   always present in their blood, in quantities not less than

  1893.J
                      Urej in    the Blood  of Birds, §c.                 483
 in mammalian blood, and that the urate of ammonium is a subsequent
 product of the union of urea with some other principle or principles,
glycine probably being one of them. Consequently, it is not neces
sary that uric acid should be present in the blood of uric-acid-excreting
animals : in health, in fact, it is not detectible.      When it is present,
 its presence is a result of  its  having  been  absorbed  after formation in
 the kidneys or elsewhere.
    With regard to the first proposition but little need be said, as most
 physiologists will agree with the statements it contains.              With
regard to the second, the case is very different, as the views therein
enunciated are totally at variance with those which are held at tho
 present time. The statement that the ultimate metabolism in the
uric- acid-excreting animals is identical with that which takes place
 in mammals requires for its establishment the constant presence of
 urea in their blood.   And I was led to seek for urea by my views on
 the production of uric acid, and from a recollection of having obtained
 urea from the blood of a turkey some few years ago. If no urea
 exists in the blood of birds, my theory falls to the ground.         In this
 paper, therefore, I have laid special stress on the presence of this
principle and the relative amounts contained in the blood of the two
classes of animals discussed.
    The statement that urate of ammonium is synthetically produced
from this urea can easily be shown to be not only possible, but very
probable ; as likewise can the fact that it is not produced within tho
blood itself, bnt is formed, at least chiefly, in the kidneys.      We have
already spoken of the changes which take place when nrea is intro
duced into the system of birds, whether by the stomach or otherwise,
and certain experiments which I have made tend to indicate that
glycine is, at any rate, one of the principles which plays a part in the
building up of urate of ammonium.              In the case of small birds,
feeding   on  canary seed and water, the throwing out of the white
urate of ammonia was observed hour by hour, and the quantity
noted.    When the seed was taken away — water only being left — the
amount of the urate rapidly diminished.            The exhibition of sugar
did not increase the urate, but when a mixture of urea and glycine
was given the amount of the urate was rapidly increased, whereas
urea given alone at this period of the fasting produced little or no
effect in the production of urate of ammonium.           I do not, however,
lay   too much   stress  on  these   observations,  as they were not suffi
ciently numerous, nor were the amounts weighed with sufficient
accuracy.
    From this theory it follows also that, though there is no need for
uric acid to be present in the blood of animals which secrete it, the
presence of urea is absolutely essential.
    One of my observations is to this effect:      — The blood of    a goose

484      The presence  of Urea in the Blood   of Bird*, $-c. [May   18,
being examined, urea was crystallised out from it. Search was then
made for uric acid, but no trace of this substance was discovered, and
yet the renal secretion consisted of urate of ammonium.
   It has been often said that the reason why uric acid is not fonnd
in the blood in any appreciable quantities is owing to the rapidity of
its excretion by the kidneys, but this statement should certainly
apply to urea, which, as I have shown above, is always found in the
blood.
   The existence of uric acid in the blood may be looked upon, there
fore, as a morbid phenomenon.        With birds, and especially those
kept for domestic purposes, as, for instance, caged birds or ducks,
the water they drink is frequently strongly impregnated sith
soluble urate, and this, when taken into the alimentary canal, is
absorbed into the blood.     I was enabled to crystallise uric acid out
of the water of a duck pond, as I stated in a paper read before this
Society in 1886.    On the other hand, I have examined the blood of
many ducks without being able to detect a trace of uric acid.
   In the human subject, in which the average quantity of uric     acid
found per diem is small compared with the formation of urea, the
blood appears, nevertheless, to be frequently contaminated by its
presence, not, however, in the form of urate of ammonium, in which
it is doubtless thrown out by the kidneys, but in the form of biurate
of sodium, in which shape it exists also in morbid deposits — the
so-called chalk-stones of medical authors.
   When uric acid is not introduced into the blood by the alimentary
canal, its presence must, according to my view, be accounted for by
its absorption into the blood from the kidneys after its formation    iu
these organs, and the salt is necessarily changed by the blood from
urate of ammonium to biurate of sodium ; whereas, according to the
old view, it had to bo assumed that urate of sodium was converted
into some superurate of ammonium, which I believe all chemists
would regard as an impossibility.
   In conclusion, I may remark that the facts and deductions brought
forward in this paper must prove, if established, not only of interest
to the physiologist, but must aid the pathologist in the investigation
of several diseases and be of value^ in devising methods for their
treatment.

       OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    James    Thomson, lately Professor of        Civil Engineering and
Mechanics in the University of Glasgow, was born in Belfast on
February    16, 1822.
    His father, a mathematician of very high order, was, in the first
instance, Mathematical Master and Professor of Mathematics in the
 Royal Belfast Academical Institution ; but in 1832 became Professor
 of Mathematics in Glasgow University.
    James Thomson, and his brother William, Lord Kelvin, entered
the classes at Glasgow University at an nnusually early age.             They
were never at school, having received their early education at home
from their father. They passed through the University together,
both with high distinction, the two lads usually obtaining the first
and second prizes in each of the classes they attended.
    At a very early age also James Thomson showed evidence of con
siderable inventive genius. When he was about sixteen or seventeen
he invented a mechanism for feathering the floats of the paddles of
 paddle steamers. Steamboats, even on the Clyde, were comparatively
novel in those days ; and the invention was looked on with much
 interest by the Clyde engineers to whom it was shown.              Unfortu
nately,  from  a commercial   point of view,  however,    it turned  out that
another method of accomplishing the same object had been invented
and patented only a few months earlier.
    After passing through the University curriculum, James Thomson
took the degree of M.A. with honours in Mathematics and Natural
Philosophy at the age of seventeen.
    As he had decided on adopting civil engineering as his profession,
he went, in the autumn of 1840, to the office of Mr. Macueill (after
wards Sir John Macueill), in Dublin.         But unfortunately his health
had, shortly before, to some extent, broken down.            He was obliged
to leave Mr. Macueill's office after about three weeks and return
home.
   In  1840 a new departure was made in Glasgow           University, which
proved   of great importance,  and  which has  had   far-reaching   influence
on the practical teaching of engineering      in this   country.    This  was
the foundation, by Queen Victoria, of the first Chair of Civil Engi
neering and Mechanics in the United Kingdom.             The first professor
was Lewis Gordon, who was succeeded              fifteen years later by
Macquorn Rankine.         James Thomson, at home and in delicate
   voL.  UU.                                                         b

health, attended Professor Gordon's classes in engineering, and was
busy with inventions of various sorts ; and particularly with a curious
boat, which, by means of paddles and legs reaching to the bottom,
was able to propel itself up a river, walking against the stream.
   In 1843 he was able to resume work as an engineer, and he went to
Millwall, to the works of Messrs. Fairbairn and Co., of London and
Manchester.      He was not. however, able to remain with them for the
full time of his apprenticeship.     Illuess returned ; he was obliged to
go home ; and this illness proved the commencement of a period of
delicate health which lasted for years, and, indeed, produced a per
manent effect on his whole life.
   During the months which he spent at Millwall, he was busy with
improvements in furnace construction for the purpose of prevention
of smoke.      The gases of combustion were to be taken downwards
through the    furnace  instead of upwards ; and the fire bars were to be
tubes with water circulating through them.
    After his return to Glasgow he was obliged to confine himself to
work which did not involve bodily fatigue.          He occupied himself
much with invention ; and particularly gave his attention to machines
for the utilisation of water power.
   He constructed a horizontal water-wheel, which he named a
Danaide, being an improvement on the Danaide of Manouri Dectot ;
and somewhat later, after much investigation            and research, he
invented a wheel which, from the nature of its action, he called the
vortex water-wheel.       This form of wheel was patented in 1850. It
was an important advance on water-wheels of previous construction.
The moving wheel was mounted within a chamber of nearly circular
form.    The water, injected under pressure, was directed, by guide
blades, to flow tangentially to the circumference of the wheel ; and was
led through the wheel to the centre by suitably formed radiating
partitions.    Thus the water yielded its kinetic energy derived from
one   half of the fall, and its potential energy from the other half, to
the wheel by pressure on the radial partitions, as it passed inwards to
the centre, whence it quietly flowed away in the tail-race.         A con
siderable number of these wheels were designed by him for various
factories and for different purposes.       They were made and supplied
by  Messrs.   Williamson   Bros., of Kendal,  and gave much satisfaction.
   In 1847 his mind was also busy with a question to which at a
later date he gave much thought and labour, and to the solution of
which he made contributions of great importance.           On April 5 of
this year there appears a memorandum in his handwriting : — " This
morning I found the explanation of the slow motion of semi-fluid
masses such as glaciers."
   During     1848   his first three important scientific papers were
published.     The first of these was on " Strength of Materials as

                                    iii
influenced by the existence or non-existence        of certaiu mutual
Strains among the Particles composing them." The second was a
                      " The
remarkable paper on          Elasticity and Strength of Spiral Springs
and of Bars subjected to Torsion."       In this paper the action of a
spiral spring was explained,  and  important principles connected with
the subject of torsion were brought forward.        These papers were
                   '
published in the     Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical        Journal,'
November,   1848.
   The third was, perhaps, yet more remarkable.  It was contributed
to the Royal Society of Ediuburgh, and was on " The Parallel Roads
or Terraces of Lochaber (Gleuroy)."    These remarkable terraces or
shelves had attracted much attention.  Darwin, Lyell, David Milue,
Sir G. Mackenzie, Agassiz, Sir Thomas Dick Lauder, and others
had discussed the causes of their formation.  James Thomson, how
ever, gave in this paper what is now the accepted explanation.
  Curiously, Professor Tyndall seems not even to have known of
the existence of the paper when he gave his admirable exposition of
this wonderful natural formation at the Royal Institution in 1876.
He attributes the explanation of the Parallel Roads to Jamieson,
1863 ; whereas the whole theory had been given by Thomson in
1848 in the paper just mentioned with details as to necessary climatic
circumstances,   not noticed by Tyndall.
  In January,    1849, he communicated       to the Royal Society of Edin
burgh a paper of great importance, which was printed in the
'                '
  Transactions     of the Society, and was afterwards republished, with
some slight alterations by the author, in the ' Cambridge and Dublin
Mathematical Journal,' November, 1850. The title of this paper was
" Theoretical Considerations on the Effect of Pressure in lowering
the Freezing Point of Water."           The principles expounded in this
paper   were  afterwards,  in   1857, used  as the foundation of his well-
known explanation of the plasticity of ice, discovered by Forbes ; and
later, from 1857 onwards, for several years, the whole subject afforded
him much food for thought ; and extensions and developments in
various directions followed.      The paper of 1849 was of great intrinsic
importance.     In it, by the application of Carnot's principle, an abso
lutely unsuspected physical phenomenon was discovered and predicted,
anil the amount of lowering of the freezing point of water was cal
culated.    The phenomenon was shortly after experimentally tested
and confirmed by his brother, Lord Kelvin.
   But the paper has another title to interest, which is not so generally
known. In it for the first time Carnot's principle was stated, and
Carnot's cycle described, in words carefully chosen, so as not to
involve the assumption of the material theory of heat, or rather, as
Thomson himself puts     it,  the supposition of the " perfect conservation
of heat."

    For the                  may be well to leave here for moment
              sake of clearness,     ifc                        a
the chronological order of James Thomson's life, and to explain
briefly the subsequent development of the ideas first disclosed in
this paper of       1849.
  Forbes had discovered, by observations and experiments on the
Swiss glaciers, the property of plasticity in ice. The fact of plasticity
in ice was at first doubted       but ;  was afterwards admitted, and
                                            it
various explanations were offered of this property, so remarkable in
a brittle and, above all crystalline, substance.
  In this connection, Faraday called attention to the freezing together
of two pieces of ice placed together in water; and from this arose
a  partial explanation, by Tyndall, under the designation of " Fracture
and Regelation." But the theory, and even the not logical juxta
position of the two words, did not satisfy James Thomson.            There
was nothing to show why or how reunion (or " regelation          ")should
take place after fracture.     He saw, however, that an extension     ofhis
own previous principle of lowering of the freezing point by pressure
allowed him to apply       to the effect of distorting stress on solid ice,
                            it
and would give a perfect explanation of all Faraday's observations
and experiments on the union and growth of the connecting link
between two pieces of ice under water, pressed together by any        force,
however small.
   By this extended thermodynamic principle he also accounted for
the yielding of a mass of ice crystals (dry suow, for instance) at
temperatures lotcer than, the ordinary freezing point. He demonstrated
that the mutual pressures must melt the ice at, and close around,
the points of contact  and that, when there
                            ;                relief from the internal
                                                 is
stress by this melting, the low temperature of the main solid mass,
and the extra cold due to the latent beat required for liquefac
tion of the yielding portions, cause the melted matter to re-freeze
in the places to which    has escaped in order to relieve itself from
                                it
strain. Thus a complete explanation, based on a demonstrated physical
principle, was offered of the phenomenon.
   Thomson's explanation did not, certainly at first, commend itself
thoroughly to Faraday.     A very interesting correspondence between
them ensued and Faraday made
                ;                    number of beautiful and interest
                                           a
ing experiments, with the object of showing that the placing of two
pieces of ice on opposite sides of a film of water (between them)
would give rise to the conversion of the film of water into ice, and
cause the union of the two pieces of ice, the   principle being that of
the starting of crystallisation in a supersaturated solution by mean^i
of a crystal of the solid.   James Thomson, however, showed that, in
the experiments adduced by Faraday, pressure between the ice blocks
was not absent. For example, in an experiment in which two pieces
of ice, with  ahole through each, were mounted ou a horizontal rod of

                                       V
glass, he pointed out that the capillary film of water between the slabs
draws them together with not inconsiderable mutual pressure, and
hence the freezing. Thomson further showed that when two pieces of
ice are brought to touch each other at a point wholly immersed under
water, and thus free from capillary action, the most minute pressure
pushing the two together causes the growth of a narrow connecting
neck, which may be made to grow by continued application of the
pressure; while the application of the smallest force tending to draw
the two asunder causes the neck to diminish in thickness, and finally
to disappear.
    In later years James Thomson further developed the theory of
1849. He showed that stresses, of other kinds than pressure equal
in all directions, can relieve themselves by means of local lowering of
the freezing point in ice ; and he showed, by theory and by experi
ment, that the application of stresses may assist or hinder the growth
of crystals in saturated solutions. Somo of these conclusions are of
such importance that they deserve to be better known.          The title of
the paper in which the last-named results were given is,    "  On Crystal
 lisation and Liquefaction as Influenced by Stresses tending to Change
of Form in the Crystals,"* 1861. It included the amended and
extended theory of the plasticity of ice.
    In 1850, James Thomson was engaged in perfecting his design for
the Vortex water-wheel.      He had soon some orders for the wheel ; and
in 1851 he took the important step of settling down as a civil en
 gineer in Belfast.
    His business grew by    degrees.    His health improved, and we find
 him occupied in the next two or three years with scientific investiga
 tions as to the " properties of whirling fluids." This led to improve
 ments in the action of blowing fans on the one hand, and, on the
other, to the invention of a centrifugal pump and to improvements in
turbines which were described to the British Association at Belfast
 in 1852. At this meeting, also, he described " A Jet Pump, or
                                                             "
Apparatus for drawing up Water by the Power of a Jet ; and these
 investigations led to the designing, on the large scale, of pumps of
 this kind. Some of these pumps have done important work in the
 drainage of low lands at places where a small stream, capable of
 supplying the jet, can be found in the immediate proximity. His
 investigations on the mechanics of whirling fluids, again, led to the
 design of great centrifugal pumps, the largest of which are now at
 work on sugar plantations in Demarara.
    It will thus be seen that he was giving much attention to water
engineering ; and in November, 1853, he became resident engineer
 to the Belfast Water Commissioners, a post which he occupied till the
 end of 1857.

      In this year    he was appointed Professor of Civil Engineering
  and Surveying in Queen's College, Belfast.         He became fully occu
  pied with the duties of his professorship, and gave up his office and
   business as a civil engineer, except for the connection which he re
  tained with some of his former clients, and for business in consulta
  tion.
      The professorship in Belfast he held till the death of Macquorn
  Rankine in 1872. By this event the Professorship of Civil Engineering
  in Glasgow became vacant; and James Thomson was in the next
 year appointed by the Government to succeed him.
     In 1888 his sight unfortunately began to fail ; and the malady,
 from which both his eyes suffered, proceeded so far that it became
 necessary for him to resign his University work. This he did after the
 end of the session 1888-89.       Happily, however, he retained more or
 less of his eyesight till the end of his life ; and as he became more
 accustomed to the condition of his eyes he was better able to make use
 of what remained to him, and was able to move about freely with bat
 little assistance, and eveu to read and write a little, and to make on
 a large scale the diagrams     which he used to illustrate his Bakerian
 Lecture on     " The Grand Currents of Atmospheric Circulation."
     His death was almost sudden and was the beginning of a sadly
 tragic time in his family. In a single week Professor Thomson, his
 wife, and youngest daughter were all attacked with cold, which was
 quickly followed by inflammation of the lungs. The next week saw
the death of all three ; his daughter surviving him only three days,
and Mrs. Thomson seven days. Professor Thomson's death took
 place on the 8th of May, 1892.
     It is not possible in the limits to which this notice must be confined
 to refer to all James Thomson's papers, nor to give a complete list of
the many subjects which occupied his attention.
     Already some of his contributions to thermodynamics have been
 mentioned ; but it must be further remarked that during the portion
of his life which was occupied with teaching, he gave great attention
to this subject, endeavouring to improve the nomenclature and modes
of expression of the various principles and propositions connected
 with it, and to simplify modes of explanation and of statement.
    Another very remarkable contribution to thermal science and
thermodynamics was his extension of Andrews' discoveries on the
subject of the continuity of the liquid and gaseous states of matter.
Thomson's mode of conception of the whole subject, which led to the
construction of a model in three dimensions to show the mutual rela
tions between pressure, volume, and temperature of such a substance
as carbon dioxide under continuous changes of pressure, and volume,
and temperature, was perfectly new and most important.          The model
itself threw a flood of light on the question and the imagining of the

                                       vii
extension of the three-dimensional surface so as to include an unstable
condition of the substance, partially realisable and even well known
in the phenomena of a liquid passing its boiling point without forming
vapour, and in similar unstable conditions, was an advance in the
theory of this important question, the consequences of which are not
even now completely realised. The verification of Thomson's theories
on this subject has proved a fruitful field of experimental investiga
tion for many workers.
    Another subject of great importance to which Professor James
Thomson devoted much thought and attention was that of safety and
danger in engineering structures, and the principles on which their
sufficiency in strength should be estimated and proved.           He made
more than one weighty communication on this subject to engineering
societies ; and on his appointment at Glasgow, in 1873, he made it the
 subject of the Latin address which it is the custom for a newly elected
 Professor to read to the Senatus of the University of Glasgow.          An
 address in English on the same subject became his inaugural lecture
 to the students of his class in engineering.
    When he took up the question, about 1862, he felt that ordinary
engineering practice as to testing of structures, boilers for example,
was both illogical and unsafe.        He considered that the tests usually
applied   were   quite  insufficient   to permit  of an engineer    feeling
justified in risking the lives of    men and the property of his employers
to the dangers of breakdown.          It was then a common opinion that
severe testing should not be applied lest the structure should be
weakened by the test itself ; but Thomson denied that the test does
weaken the structure if the structure be good ; and pointed out that
the real reason for not applying a proper test was, frequently, fear lest
the structure should   be found far inferior in strength to that which
it was intended to have. The truth of Professor Thomson's conten
tions is now admitted by the highest engineers ; and the best engineer
ing practice has, happily, undergone a thorough reform in this
respect.
    Certain geological questions possessed much interest for James
Thomson.       We have seen how, at an early age, he investigated the
parallel   roads  of Glen Roy ; and on many subsequent occasions he
examined with great care the places where he chanced to be residing,
and found and described glacier markings.          He traced out, on more
than one occasion, specially interesting features of the ice action,
endeavouring     to determine, by means of an examination of the
markings, details as to the motion of the ice, whether in the form
of glacier or in the form of icebergs taking the ground in shallow
waters.
   His attention was also directed to the jointed prismatic structure
seen at the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and elsewhere.           No satis

                                          VXlt
factory explanation of this remarkable phenomenon had been given.
The old theories, involving a supposed spheroidal concretionary tend
ency in the material during consolidation, seemed quite untenable.
He examined with great care the appearances presented in the sur
faces of the stones, and concluded that the columnar structure is due
to the shrinking and cracking during cooling of a very homogeneous
mass of material.     The cross joints he considered to be in reality
circular conchoidal fractures commencing at the centre of the column
and flashing out to the circumference.
   A very interesting subject, and one of very high importance, to
which Professor Thomson gave great attention, is the flow of water
in rivers. He investigated, with great care, and from a theoretical
point of view, the origin of windings of rivers in alluvial plains, and
his conclusions were published in the 'Proceedings of the Royal
Society,' May 4, 1876.        Later in the same year he constructed, iu
clay,  on a  table,  a model with  which he investigated the movements
of the different parts of the water in passing round the beuds in this
artificial river ; and, finally, he made a large wooden model of a river
flowing on a nearly horizontal bed with many bends and various
obstacles. By aid of fine threads, small floating and sinking bodies,
and coloured streams of fluid coming from particles of solid aniline
dye dropped into the channel, he was able to follow from point to
point the movements of the fluid, and thus to give not only beautiful
and striking ocular evidence of the truth of his early conclusions, but
also to extend his theory.      Papers on this subject were communicated
to the Royal Society in 1876, 1877, 1878.            The paper of the last-
named date was entitled      " On Flow of Water in Uniform Regime in
Rivers and in Open Channels generally." It contains a very clear
and striking account of what does occur in the motion of a river
down its inclined channel ; and, in particular, of the fact which seems
to be ascertained, that the forward velocity of the water in rivers          is,
generally, not greatest at the surface with gradual abatement from
surface to bottom (as would be required under the conditions sup
posed in the laminar theory)       but that, in reality, the average velocity
                                   ;
down stream    is   greatest at some depth below the surface, from which,
up to the surface, there     a considerable decrease, and down to the
                              is
bottom a much greater decrease.      This phenomenon he showed very
clearly to be due to the rising, of masses of slow-going water, from
the bottom, on account of directing action of bottom obstacles. These
masses of slow-going water, when they reach the top, spread them
selves out, and, mingling with the quicker surface water, give to            it,
on the whole, a less rapid movement than      should otherwise possess.

   Finally, in this biief summary must           be mentioned the paper which

                                        ix
was      made the Bakerian Lecture for the year 1892.        In 1857 Professor
Thomson read          a paper  to  the British   Association, on "The Grand
                                              " It
Currents of Atmospheric Circulation.                appears that his attention
was first called to this suhject when, during the period of his early
delicacy, his father asked him to look into the question of the Trade
"Winds and write a short account of this atmospheric phenomenon
for     a new edition of Dr. Thomson's
                                            '
                                               Geography,' which was then in
preparation.         This was done ; but young James Thomson found so
little     satisfaction in the information and theories which he then
studied for the purpose that his mind was keenly directed to the
question ; and in 1857 he himself had formed a theory which he
 expounded to the British Association.
      The subject was before his mind during the rest of his life ; and
 though on account of other pressing work the complete publication of
 the    theory was from time to time deferred, yet it was always his in
 tention to return to the question. When in the last years of his life
 the affliction of partial blindness came upon him, and when he had
 somewhat recovered from the first depressing effects of finding him
 self thus sadly crippled, he set himself in his enforced leisure to
 complete this work, and, with the assistance of his wife and daughters,
  to produce the important paper which was read before the Royal
  Society on the 10th of March, 1892. In this paper a historical
  sketch is given of the progress of observation and theoretical research
  into the nature and causes of the trade-winds and other great and
  persistent currents of atmospheric circulation.             Previous theories
  are discussed and criticised and their merits duly recognized, the
  theory of Hadley, in particular, being shown to be substantially true.
  A much more complete theory is then expounded in full detail ; and
  charts and diagrams in illustration show the nature of the aerial
  motions.
      Here this memoir must close. There are many papers of Thomson
   which have not even been alluded to in it. Nor is it possible or
   necessary for the present purpose to refer to all the subjects to which
  his ever active mind directed itself. A character so truly philosophic
   it is very rare to meet. His was a singularly well ordered and well
   governed     mind.    It was, if one may venture to say so, almost too
   philosophical     and  too well governed for the business of every-day
   life. He could scarcely realise a difference between greater and
   smaller error or untruth. Great or small error and untruth were to
   he condemned and resisted ; and, perhaps, in the matter of public
   business and in this hurrying nineteenth century pressure, there
   were those who, thoroughly conscientious themselves, could not yet
   feel perfect sympathy with his extreme and scrupulous determination
   to let nothing, however small, pass without thorough examination
    and complete proof.       To temporise was not in his nature ; and this

                                   X
extreme conscientiousuess gave rise to a want of rapidity of action
which was perhaps the cnly fault in a singularly perfect character.
   Purity and honour in word and deed and thought, gentleness of
disposition,  readiness to spend his labour, his time, his mental
energies for others, and for the good of the world in general, all were
conspicuous in his life both in public and in private.
   Professor Thomson was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in
1877 ; and he received the honorary degree of D.Sc. from the
Queen's University in Ireland, and of LL.D. from his own University
of Glasgow, and from the University of Dublin.
   In 1853 he married Elizabeth Hancock, daughter of William John
Hancock, Esq., J. P., of Lurgan, Co. Armagh, a lady who detoted
herself to every minutest interest of her husband's life.    They had
one son and two daughters, of whom the son and elder daughter
survive.
