        Shoulder, and Chest, with their transitional Forms and Homo
        logies in the Mammalia."        By John Wood, F.R.C.S., Examiner
        in Anatomy at the University of London.              Communicated by
        Dr. Shakpey, Sec. U.S. Received June 17, 1869.
                                      (Abstract.)
  The muscular varieties described by the author in his paper comprise
  the occipito-scapular,    the levator clavicuUe, and the cleido-occipital,
  among    the  muscles  which   elevate the scapulo-clavicular bone- arch ; the
  sterno-scapular, the sterno-clavicular, and the scapulo-clavicular, of those
  which depress it   ; and the supracostal, placed upon the upper part of the
  thorax.
     The human occipi to-scapular was first observed and described by him in
  the Proceedings of the Royal Society in 1867. Since that time various
  developments of muscular slips connected with the splenii, levator anguli
  scapula, and serrati have been observed, and are described and figured as
  a series of varieties transitional from the occipito-scapular   behind to the
  levator claviculce in front of the neck. The homology of the occipito-
  scapular with the levator scapulas minor vel posterior of Douglass, the
  rhomboideus capitis, rhomboide antirieur of Meckel, and the rhombo'ide
  de la tite of Cuvier, is traced in the different orders of the Mammalia,
  from direct observation, in the following animals, viz. the Bonnet-Monkey,
  the Hedgehog, Mole, Dog, Cat, Badger, Weasel, Rabbit, Guineapig, Nor
  way Rat, and Squirrel, of which drawings from dissections accompanied
  the paper ; and also from various authorities in reference to a considerable
  number of other animals.

in his paper read before the Royal Society in 1864; he has found it
in 6 out of 202 subjects.    In the present paper the author gives an
abstract of the observations of the older and modern anatomists re-
ferring.to this muscle in the human subject under various names, and
enters             into its homologies in the Mammalia, as described by
           at length
writers under its synonyms, — the levator scapulce major vel anterior (Dou
glass), omo- ou acromio-tracMlien    (Cuvier and Meckel), acromio-basilar
(Vicq d-Azyr), basio-humeralis (Kianse),Kop/-Arm-Muskel(Feyer), clavio-
trachelien  (Church), transverso-scapulaire  (Strauss-Diirckheim),     omo-
atlanticus (Haughton), and cervico-humeral (Humphry),        — illustrating
them by drawings from his own dissections.     He enters more fully into
the discussion of the apparently anomalous composition of the muscle in
the Rabbit, gives reasons and comparative illustrations from the Fallow-
deer and Ass for considering the seeming doubling of the muscle to result
from a peculiar development of the cleido-mastoid in apparent conjunction
with     it,
        and considers that the muscle which has gone under the last name
in the Rabbit to be really development of the cleido-occipital.

   The cleido-occipital he described in his paper published in the Proceedings
of the Royal Society in June 1866 and he has found
                                             ;               since that time in

37 out of 102 subjects.    In the present paper he quotes briefly the various
anatomists who have described        as part of the sterno-cleido-mastoid or
                                        it
trapezius, and connects        homologically with the muscles which have
                                  it
been described in the claviculate            mammalia as       a   second   cleido-mastoid,
and in the semiclaviculate as the trapezius clavicularis ("portion cervi-
cale") of that muscle, giving illustrations of its gradual or transitional
forms of development from specimens that have come under his own ob
servation, or which have been gathered from the writings of others, as far
as to the formation of the compound cephalo-humeral or levator humeri
muscle of the Rodents and Carnivora.

double subclavius, with an insertion into the scapula.  In the present paper
he briefly quotes these authorities, and shows the various developments of
the muscle in animals.       In connexion with       he describes

the Rat-mole of the Cape and in the Didelphis marsupialis, and has been
found by the author in the Rabbit, Guineapig, Squirrel, and Norway Rat.

 by the author in his paper published in the ' Proceedings- in 1865, and was
 again noted and recorded by him in 1867 ; it has also been observed in
 the human subject by Professor Turner and others, and is considered by
 the former to be the representative of the rectus thoracicus of animals
 The author, however, is of opinion that the muscle figured by Cuvier as
 the sterno-costal in animals is a better fitting homology, and gives in this
 paper illustrations from his own dissections in animals in support of this
 view.
XI. " Results      of the first year-s performance of the Photographically
       Self-recording Meteorological Instruments at the Central Ob
       servatory of the British System of Meteorological Observa
       tions." By Lieut.-General Edward Sabine, R.A., President.
       Received   June   17, 1869.
    Before the Fellows    of the Society disperse for the long vacation, I am
desirous to bring under their notice the results of the first year-s perform
 ance (January 1 to December 31, 1868) of the photographically            self-
 recording meteorological instruments established at Kew, the Central Ob
 servatory of the British Meteorological System instituted by the Board
 of Trade and superintended by a Committee of Fellows of the Royal
Society.
    The photograms, with tabulations carefully prepared from them, are
 transmitted monthly by Mr. Stewart, the Superintendent of the Kew
 Observatory, to Mr. Scott, the Director of the Meteorological Office in
London, where the results are computed and embodied in Tables, of the
nature of those which are now presented.
    The first of these Tables shows the Diurnal Variation, or the values of the
phenomena at each of the 24 hours, on the mean of the year. It exhibits
    1st. The Temperature.
    2nd. The Elasticity of the Aqueous Vapour.
    3rd. The Barometric Pressure.
    4th. The Pressure of the Dry Air.
    5 th. The  Humidity.
    In meteorology and climatology much instruction may often be derived
                                                                        I
from tracing the modifying influences of diversities of situation ; and have
thought that these Tables might be made more acceptable and interesting
to the Society, and the subject be advantageously illustrated, by the addi
 tion of corresponding results for two other stations, which are very nearly
in the same geographical latitude as Kew, but are very differently situated
in other respects, being in the interior of the European and Asiatic conti
nent — thoroughly continental therefore, and as such contrasted with our in
 sular British stations. Nertchinsk and Barnaoul, both in Siberia, are two of
 the stations of the great Russian system of observatories, established by our
                                                                 b 2

 4                   Lieut. -General Sabine on        the Results     of        [June 17,
 late Foreign Member, Mr. A; T. Kupffer, and ably superintended by him for
 several years until his decease.        I  had been assured by M. Kupffer that I
 might thoroughly rely on the observations made at these two stations ; and
 I  have since acquired experimentally the fullest confirmation of this assu
 rance in the case of Nertchinsk           (as regards the magnetical, and inferen-
 tially therefore    also  as regards the meteorological         observations),      by the
 very delicate and sufficient test adverted to in page 238 of Art. VI. in the
 Phil. Trans. for 1864. Barnaoul is in lat. 53° 20-, corresponding with the
 rough average of the latitudes of our British stations generally, and is 400
 feet above the sea.       Nertchinsk differs only 10' from the latitude of Kew,
 but has otherwise a marked feature- of diversity in being at an elevation of
 2230 feet, whilst      Kew    is only   34   feet above   the sea-level.      At Kew    we
 have only as yet available the records of a single year, necessarily in
 fluenced by the natural irregularities which cause one year to differ from
 another.     These irregularities are lessened, in the case of the Siberian sta
 tions, by combining in the present paper the results of two years of obser
 vation.
     I may now proceed to the Table of the Diurnal Variations, and to
 a  brief notice of the most salient features presented by the comparative
 view of the phenomena of the three stations as shown in that Table.
    In discussing the diurnal variations of the meteorological elements, it is
customary to commence with the temperature, regarding it as in a great
 degree the governing agent in regulating the phenomena of those other ele
ments which are the subjects of the photographical registration.                    In the
middle latitudes, with which alone we have at present to deal, the diurnal
variation   of the temperature is recognized         as a single progression, having
one ascending      and one descending branch, the turning-points                   being a
maximum at an early hour in the afternoon, and a minimum at a little
before sunrise.      We find this to be the order of the phenomena at the three
stations under review, viz.         a maximum between          2 and 3 hours, and a
minimum between 16 and 17 hours (4 and 5 a.m.), the range between
the extremes presenting, however, very marked differences, being 1 0°-7(Fahr.)
at Kew, J4°0 at Barnaoul, and 17°-0 at Nertchinsk.
    It has been the practice for the last thirty years, at the principal European
observatories, to regard the elastic force of the aqueous vapour as an im
portant meteorological element, and to employ it in the separation of the
barometric pressure into its two constituents, viz. the pressure of the dry
air, and the elasticity of the aqueous vapour mingled therein*.                    In con
formity with this practice, we may take the vapour tension next in the order
of succession.      It was remarked by Bessel, in the Astron. Nach. for 1838
(No. 356),    that "  since the invention of Daniell-s hygrometer and August-s
psychrometer, we possess the means of ascertaining at all times with ease
and sufficient exactness the quantity of aqueous vapour contained in the
   * In the publications of the  British Colonial Observatories (1840-1847) this method
was adopted  in the meteorological reductions, being one  of its earliest applications.

G                    Lieut.-General Sabine on       the Results    of       [June 17
atmosphere."   The most convenient mode of photographic investigation
and record which presented itself, and was adopted at Kew, was by the
employment of wet and dry thermometers; the difference between the
two thermometers admits of exact measurement, and supplies the element
which is desired, the accuracy of the record being occasionally tested by
                                                    " hygrometre a con
comparison with the results obtained by Regnault's
densation"*.         The gain of              of observation over a single year
                                   even two years
may be here at once seen by the greater regularity of the two years' record
at the Siberian stations.   Taking these therefore in the first instance, we
find that at both stations the elasticity of the vapour presents a single pro
gression, having maxima about noon, aud minima at 16 hours (4 a.m.).
The difference in the amount of vapour at the two stations is due, of course,
to the greater altitude of Nertchinsk. At Kew the progression is not quite
so regular as where two years are combined   ; the values at 21, 22, and 23
hours are high in comparison with the other hours, possibly owing to pecu
liarities in the weather of the particular year ; in other respects the pro
gression is similar to that at Nertchinsk and Barnaoul, and the time of
minimum is identical at the three stations, viz. at 16 hours.   The higher
elasticity of the   vapour  at Kew,   in comparison with  the two  Siberian
stations,    of course, due to the higher temperature at Kewf.

                                                                   ;

vious, that in the latitudes of 51° and 53° the striking regularity and mag
nitude of the double period which prevail in the tropics do not subsist.
   The minimum of the dry air coincides at the three stations, as nearly
as may be, with the warmest hour of the day             or(2 hours).
                                                                   3   There                 is
also, at each of the three stations, an approximate maximum at or near the
coldest hour.        At Barnaoul and Nertchinsk the progression between                     the
hours of minimum and maximum            uninterrupted
                                          is             at Kew;       obvious
                                                                         it   is

all cases coincident with, or closely following upon, the warmest hour                       ;
and the hour of greatest       humidity that of the lowest temperature.                Kew
   * There have been some few occasions in this, the first year at Kew, when tho con
tinuity of tho trace from the wet thermometer failed, in consequence of the freezing
of the water by which its ball was wetted, or owing to other causes. Arrangements
have now been made to meet these difficulties in continuous registration.
t     Tho Tables employed in tho calculation of tho values inserted in the columns of
" Elastic Force of        " and "
                   Vapour         Humidity" have been the well-known Russian Tables,
'
  Tables Psychrom6triques et Barometriques a l'usage des Observatoires Meteorologiques
de  l'Empire de Eussie.' Very convenient Tables have also been published by the
Smithsonian Institution, computed by Dr. Guyot.          Two of the throe stations of the
present paper being Russian,   it  was deemed advisable to employ the Russian      Tables
                                                                                   '

  and Barnaoul hare, on the mean, almost exactly the same degree of hu
  midity, the greater amount of vapour at Kew being balanced, in its influence
  on the humidity, by the higher temperature.                       Nertchinsk is both the
  coldest and the driest.
      So far as the purposes of the Meteorological Committee can yet be con
  sidered as settled, it is their intention to combine the results of every five
  years of observation into a Table of Diurnal Variations, similar to that
  which is now presented for Kew for a single year. A second period of five
 years will yield a second Table ; and two such combined will form a ten-
 year Table, more satisfactory than either of its two component parts, but
  still open to correction by incorporation with subsequent periods of equal
 duration.
     The other six observatories of the                system    established by the British
 Government,         viz.    Aberdeen,      Armagh, Falmouth, Glasgow, Stonyhurst,
 and Valencia*,        have received       their instruments, which had been prepared
 and verified at the Central              Observatory (Kew), where also those who
 were    to    work    with    them    had received personal instruction in their use ;
 and on the completion of these and all other needful arrangements, the
 six observatories commenced on                July  1,  1868, a continuous      record corre
 sponding in all respects to that at Kew. The photograms and the tabu
 lations prepared from them at the several observatories are transmitted
 monthly to Kew, where they undergo careful examination, and revision if
 required ; and at the expiration of a second month they are sent, with
 the records prepared at Kew itself, to the Meteorological Office, where,
 under the direction of Mr. Scott, they are formed into Tables, and used
 for all meteorological purposes for which they may be available.                           The
mode      and     extent    in   which   the   information    thus   obtained   may    be  most
 suitably communicated to the public are not yet fully determined, but are
 receiving careful consideration.
     Table   II.   (which occupies the next            5 or 6 pages)     exhibits the annual
 variations at the three stations, analogous to the                diurnal variations shown
in Table      I. It    is obvious that such Tables cannot but assist greatly in
studying       the   climatological phenomena in different localities ; but a dis
cussion of them would be premature until a wider observational basis is
provided.
    * It was   the purpose    of the Committee, approved by the Board of Trade, that thero
should have      been   an  eighth meteorological station, viz. one in the north of Scotland.
In   the first  estimate   sent  to the Treasury by the Board of Trade, the necessary cost of
 such a station was included ; but on the receipt of a letter from the Treasury to the
                                                    " in the estimates for the current
 Board of Trade, June 5, 1867, stating that                                             year My
 Lords are aware that they have proposed a less sum than had been estimated for, and
intend that the arrangements to be made by the Committee should be curtailed accord
ingly," the meteorological station in the north of Scotland was in consequence curtailed.

 1868, when the atmospherical conditions over these islands were very re
markable ; easterly winds were prevalent over the central and northern
portions of the area, while in France there were strong westerly gales.
The channels of the currents                 were  so close     to each    other that, while at
Yarmouth there was a strong easterly wind, there was a westerly gale at
Portsmouth. The contrast exhibited by the two currents as regards tem
perature was very marked, and a dense fog was experienced in London.
Barometrical readings were very low over the region which separated the
districts of the respective currents.               Next day pressure rose very rapidly ;
but this was only the precursor                of  an   equally sudden diminution of its
amount, and of the advent of the equatorial current which swept with
great violence over these islands, producing a very serious southerly gale
on the 24 th of January.
    On the 8th of December last, conditions similar to those of January 22
were observed.            Strong easterly winds were reported from Scarborough,
while westerly winds of great force prevailed in the Channel and in France.
This state of things was succeeded, after an interval of two days, by a
southerly storm, the whole sequence of phenomena resembling very
closely what had been noticed eleven months before.

     In order to         trace out this remarkable               succession   of occurrences, it was
resolved to examine all the cases in which the polar and equatorial cur
rents made their appearance at the surface of the ground within the area
of the British Islands, and to record the phases of weather which ensued.
As these currents flow in opposite directions, it is evident that they must
move in channels approximative^  parallel to each other, so that there are
only  two cases to be examined.
   I. The polar current flows in a latitude higher than the equatorial
current.
     II.       The polar current flows in                  a latitude   lower than     the equatorial
current.
     The daily weather reports for                     a    period of 27 months have been ex
amined,             and the result has been                that 27 instances of case I. and 30 of
case      II.   have been discovered.
     These instances            are all    enumerated in two tables, which               are   herewith
submitted*.
     In    accordance      with the relation between the motion of the wind and the
distribution of atmospherical pressure which has been laid down by Prof.
Buys Ballot, viz. that barometrical readings are lower on the left-hand
side   of       a current of air than on the right, we should expect to find that in
case      I.    there would be a relative barometrical minimum, and in case II. a
relative barometrical maximum between the currents.     This supposition is                                    .
found   to be abundantly confirmed by the observations.
   As regards the weather subsequently experienced, Mr. Meldrum states
that when the two currents, the N.W. monsoon and S.E. trade, are noticed
simultaneously over the Indian Ocean, the channel of the latter lying on
the southern edge of that of the former, i.e. in a latitude higher than                                  it,
the barometer between them                      is   low and falling.       Ultimately the reduction
of pressure           becomes    greater at one point than at the others, and                  a   centre
of barometrical depression   formed, resulting eventually in

and are apparently not formed in the immediate district from which our
reports are derived.   The result of the investigation appears, however, to
show that whereas the conditions of case      are indicative of considerable
                                                                 I.

probably be light for some days.
     Case       I.    The polar current flows in            a   latitude higher than the equatorial
current.
   In other words, easterly winds prevail in the north, westerly in the
south.   Northerly and southerly winds are nearly entirely absent.
    Twenty-seven instances have been noticed of these conditions, and they

   These facts appear to show that the conditions of case I. indicate a
deep-seated disturbance of the atmosphere.              In almost every case they
seem to point to the existence, or at least the formation, of a barometrical
minimum over the Atlantic Ocean, which will probably advance to our
coasts and result in a southerly storm.          On only two occasions did the
centre of the disturbance pass to the southward of these islands, viz.
the two instances in which the north-easterly gale followed.
   Case    II.  The polar current flows in   a latitude lower than the equatorial
current.
   In   other words, easterly winds prevail         in the south, westerly in the

   It  would appear from the foregoing that case II. is not, as a rule, indi
cative of the approach of a serious atmospherical disturbance, although
such did occur in five instances (one-sixth of the total number under
consideration).       In the great predominance of instances the weather
either remained unchanged and calm, or else the polar current succeeded
in displacing the equatorial more or less completely, and the winds which
prevailed over these islands generally were from points between N.W. and E.
   It is obvious that, from the very limited area from which our obser
vations are derived, we are at present unable to examine into the mutual
action of the currents on each other (unaffected by any influence exerted
on the wind by inequalities in the earth-s surface, such as those produced
by an irregular coast-line stretching out into the open sea), as has been
done by Mr. Meldrum for the Indian Ocean ; but it is hoped that this
commencement of an attempt to trace a connexion between successive
conditions of weather may be deemed worthy of the notice of the Royal
Society.

XIII.      "On    the presence of Sulphocyanides in the Blood and Urine."
        By Arthur Leared, M.D., M.R.I. A.,                  &c.   Communicated by
        C.  Handfield Jones, M.B.              Cantab.     Received    June 17, 1869.
    In the course of       some    investigations into the composition and uses of
saliva,   I was led to study one        of its components, sulphocyanide of potas
sium, in relation to its presence and action in the system, in a way that
has not hitherto hecn done.
    Treviranus, in 1814, discovered that saliva became reddened by a per-
salt of iron in solution ; and the reaction was afterwards stated by Tiede-
mann and Gmelin to be due to the presence of sulphocyanide of potas
sium*. A. strange difference of opinion has nevertheless prevailed on the
subject.     Thus the reaction has been supposed to be caused by a taint of
the saliva from carious teeth ; whilst Bernard states that he found it took
place only in the saliva of tobacco-smokers.
    It  is unnecessary    to produce here the arguments on both sides              of the
question ; the weight       of   authority is altogether in favour of the existence
of the salt in saliva. By some of those, however, who have admitted that
it is an ingredient of the secretion it has been regarded as a curiosity
rather than as playing any part in the economy.
    I have made numerous experiments for the purpose of satisfying myself
as to the constancy with which a sulphocyanide exists in human saliva.
For this end a solution containing twenty grains of perchloride of iron in an
ounce of distilled water was employed.                Such a solution is of a light-
yellow    colour,  but  it acts better than     the paler solution of the persulphate
of iron. The mode of procedure was very simple. The saliva to be tested
was ejected on a surface of white porcelain, or upon a piece of white
paper, and a drop of the test-solution added. The colour which the saliva
assumed was compared with a scale of four shades of red on paper, re
sembling those produced by the sulphocyanide of iron. These shades
were labelled "very marked," " murked," "faint," "a trace," and cor
responded approximately with the colours struck by iron in solutions of
sulphocyanide of potassium of the relative strength of                   -j'j,           of
a grain to the ounce of distilled water.
    Such a scale is appended herewith.              An examination of the saliva of
fifty persons taken consecutively, half being males and half females, and of
ages ranging from under one year to Go years, gave the following results              : —
                     Very marked.       Marked.        Faint.     A trace.        None.

are insufficient for the deduction of trustworthy results.            Some points,
 however, which it is unnecessary to prove by tabulation, were well borue
 out, and these are sufficient for the present purpose.
     It was   established that in the saliva of the great majority of persons a
 red colour is struck with perchloride of iron.
     It was ascertained that the existence of carious teeth is not requisite
for the production of this reaction, because it occurred in many instances
in which all the teeth were sound.
     It was further ascertained that tobacco-smoking was not indispensable,
because the colour was produced in many cases in which the individual
never used tobacco.
     It  was also remarked that in all the cases      in which the absence   of the
 sulpho-cyanide was noted, although no definite disease was apparent, the
 health was feeble, and that, on the other hand, a marked reaction with
iron usually corresponded with the ordinary indications of sound health.
 To this subject    I  shall afterwards have occasion to return.    It is probable
 that,    by means of evaporation, a sulphocyanide would in every instance
have been detected in the saliva. But for practical purposes it is assumed
 that when not discovered by the means described, it is not present.
    The particular base combined with the sulphocyanic acid in human saliva
 is a matter of little importance.       It has lately been stated that it is not
potassium, but sodium, which was long ago mentioned by Tiedemann and
Gmelin as taking the place of potassium in the saliva of sheep.
    The soluble sulphocyanide          which   exists  in the saliva   cannot    be
regarded      as  an excretion, because it passes with the saliva into the
stomach.       Whatever its use or its ultimate destination, it seemed probable
that a salt of so stable a nature was not decomposed in its passage through
the system.       This suggested that I should look for it in the urine.
    Iron, as is well known, yields a very characteristic test of the presence
of sulphocyanides.        One compound only which it forms, namely, that
with meconic acid, is at all likely to be confounded with the sulpho
cyanide of iron. The great sensitiveness of this test also makes it pecu
liarly adapted for quantitative analysis, by means of colour.
    I   found in my first experiments that when the urine of a person in
whose saliva a sulphocyanide was abundant, was concentrated by evapora
tion, a reddish-brown colour was caused by the addition of perchloride of
iron.      But owing to the dark colour assumed by the concentrated urine,
and the mode in which precipitation occurred, no reliance could be placed
on this as a proof of the presence of a sulphocyanide in the urine.           The
Step   which then suggested itself was to decolorize the urine by means of
animal charcoal.        But it turned out, when this was effected, that the
colourless liquid gave no reaction with the persalt of iron.       The following
experiment was then tried : —
    A solution of one grain of sulphocyanide of potassium in an ounce of

 18           Dr. A. Leared on     the presence  of Sulphocyanides      [June 17,
  distilled water was filtered through animal charcoal.           The filtrate was
 tested with the iron solution.      There was no reaction whatever.
      It was plain from this that animal charcoal possesses the power either
  of separating sulphocyanides from their solutions or of decomposing them.
      Various   other methods for separating the colouring-matter were now
  tried with more or less success.       The most perfect of these, as regards
  the removal of colour, was the addition of a solution of sub-acetate of
  lead.    But the  use of this solution is open to the objection that acetate of
  iron, which is formed in testing for sulphocyanic acid, is itself red.      It is
 true that the colour is not so intense as that which was actually formed in
 most cases ; and it was possible in estimating the amount of the essential
 colouring-agent present by an easy application of the colour-test to deduct
 the amount of colour due to the acetate of iron.
      A modification of the method employed by Professor Harley for sepa
 rating the colouring-matter of the urine, for the purpose of obtaining
 urohffimatin, proved on the whole the best.        It consists in evaporating the
 urine in a water-bath to the consistence of thick syrup, treating with alcohol,
 and adding gradually milk of lime.          The filtrate from this mixture was
 found to be of a light-yellow colour, closely resembling that of the iron
 solution.     The ferric solution was added to this filtrate so long as pre
 cipitation of oxide of iron occurred.        The liquid now assumed a reddish
 colour, varying in depth according to circumstances.           The mixture was
 then filtered ; but it generally happened that, after standing some hours,
 a second filtration was necessary.
     The coloured fluid obtained by either of these methods from evaporated
 urine is of a bright red colour, exactly resembling that formed by an
 aqueous solution of sulphocyanide of potassium with perchloride of iron.
     In some respects the two solutions did not exactly agree.
     The colour of an     aqueous solution of sulphocyanide of iron is only
 affected   by  mineral  acids when in considerable excess.       But the colour
formed with iron in evaporated urine is easily destroyed by these acids.
     The colour of the pure solution is removed by perchloride of mercury,
while that of the organic solution is not affected by the mercurial solution.
     It is well known that in certain cases the presence of organic matter in
solution greatly modifies chemical action.         The action of acids in the
present    instance was a  question  of degree.   The   colour was removed from
the urinary solution by a small quantity of a mineral acid, and it was
removed or impaired in case of a pure solution by a greater quantity of
acid.
    The following observation throws light upon the action of perchloride
of mercury in the respective solutions.
    Perchloride of mercury at once destroys the colour of an aqueous solu
tion of sulphocyanide of iron.       But, as I have ascertained, if the solutiou
has been previously boiled (and boiling was employed in the case of the

  1869.]                     in the  Blood and Urine                               19
  urinary solutions), the red colour     is no longer destroyed by the mercurial
  solution.
      Since, then, these difficulties are capable of removal, the argument by
  the method of exclusion in favour of the red colour being due to sulpho-
  cyanide of iron appears conclusive.        There is in fact no other source from
  which the red colour could proceed in the process by which the urine was
  decolorized by milk of lime.
     Some salt of sulphocyanic     acid   must, then, be admitted to be       a com
 ponent of the urine.
     For the detection of the salt it is only necessary to evaporate eight
  ounces of urine in a water-bath.         If milk of lime be employed as the
  decolorizing agent which, for reasons already stated, is to be preferred,
 the urine should be concentrated to       a  thick syrup.
     In the present stage of my inquiries many details are purposely omitted,
 particularly those which refer to the quantitative determination of the
 sulphocyanide in many different samples of urine.           I may mention, how
 ever, that I found the average quantity present in healthy urine to amount
 to about £ of a grain in sixteen ounces.
     Since, then, a sylphocyanide was found in the urine, and was previously
 known to exist in saliva, it    was natural to look for it in other secretions.
 It was therefore sought for in a large quantity of cow-s milk, and in two
 ounces of human sweat, but with negative results.
    Two    ounces  of pure pus from a cyst on a man-s back were also ex
 amined,    but no sulphocyanide was found.
    But as sulphocyanic acid was proved to exist in a secretion from which
 it may be presumed to enter the blood, and also in an excretion derived
 from the blood, it was to be expected        that it would be found in the blood
itself.
    The blood operated on was in every instance diluted with an equal part
of distilled water.     The mixture was then evaporated in a water-bath
until the red colour was altogether lost, and brown coagula, with appa
rently little fluid, remained. The mass was strained through muslin by
pressure of the fingers.      The filtrate was then decolorized by one of the
processes already described. Briefly stated, then, it was found that a
sulpho-cyanide exists in the blood of man, and in that of the pig, fowl,
turbot, salmon, and toad.
    I also found that when the serum of pig-s blood, procured as free from
colour as possible and diluted with an equal portion of water, to prevent
complete coagulation, was treated with a solution of perchloride of iron, it
became red in a marked degree.          This result has a special interest, because
it was obtained without any previous chemical manipulation, and the pre
sence of a sulphocyanide was thereby proved.            And this curious circum
stance was also ascertained.      If a few drops of a weak solution of sulpho
cyanide    of potassium be mixed    with this reddened and diluted serum, and
the iron solution is again added, no increase of colour is produced. This
                                                                     c 2

20          Dr. A. Leared on        the presence    of Sulphocyanides      [June 17,
shows     that while     the sulphocyanide naturally present in the serum is
capable of combining with added iron, the serum possesses the power of
preventing the formation of sulphocyanide of iron when both compounds
are added and intermixed with it.
    An analogous masking of chemical action is described by Bernard.
He found that when         a  solution of lactate of iron is mixed with serum, and
a solution     of cyanide of potassium is then added, prussian blue is not
formed, as would be the case          if  the solutions were mixed in water instead
of serum.
    I  have not been able to decide positively whether the sulphocyanide is
or is not confined to the serum.           Analysis, after combustion, is unsuitable,
because sulphocyanides are formed             in the combustion of organic matter.
But    so far as  I  have   been able    to determine from the maceration of the
clot in water, the sulphocyanides exist only in the serum.
    The foregoing facts point either to the presence of free sulphocyanic
acid, or of sulphocyanide of potassium, or sodium, or of both, in the serum
of the blood. This leads to the consideration of that much-vexed question,
the cause of the red colour of the blood.            So far as concerns exact colour,
nothing more closely resembles blood than a solution of sulphocyanide of
iron.     This is prima facie evidence that red blood owes its colour to the
iron compound.          The iron is known to be localized in the globules. These
are surrounded by a fluid containing sulphocyanic acid in a combination
which easily yields the acid when required.             Such is the theory at present
suggested.
    I  am not unaware of the difficulties in the way of its acceptance.           The
colour of heematin cannot, it is said, depend upon the iron it contains,
because nearly the whole of the iron may be removed without affecting
the colour of the haematin*.           But it is not stated that all the iron is ever
removed,     and it may be that a very small proportion suffices for the formation
of the colour, while the larger proportion of the metal is held in reserve in
the globules in the same manner as sulphocyanic acid appears to be in the
serum.
    Having found a sulphocyanide in the blood, it next occurred to me to
look for it in the egg3 of birds.          It is natural to suppose that, since in the
process of incubation red blood is formed, its assumed elements of colour
would be found in the egg before incubation.                 This supposition proved
correct.     Fortunately the albumen of the hen's egg affords a ready means
of   research.     It is only necessary to mix it with an equal quantity of dis
tilled water, by which complete coagulation by the iron solution is prevented.
The albumen of a hen's egg weighs about 300 grains, and this quantity was
found to contain           of a grain of sulphocyanic acid. The yolk was inti
mately mixed with water, then evaporated to dryness in the water-bath,
and extracted with alcohol ; but no trace of the salt could be detected. It
is probable, therefore, that the sulphocyanide exists exclusively in the

    The presence of a sulphocyanide in saliva must be referred to one of
 two sources.     It  is either an exclusive product of the secretion itself, or it
 previously exists in the blood and is extracted from it as a component of
 the saliva. The amount of sulphocyanide found in different analyses
 varies greatly ; my own results show only about half a grain in twenty
 ounces of saliva from a healthy subject.            This nearly agrees with the
 observations of Bidder and Schmidt.            Wright makes the quantity very
 much greater.       If  we take the estimate at only half a grain in twenty
ounces   of saliva, and reckon this   to be the quantity  of the secretion swallowed
in twenty-four hours, the salt might          be probably found    in the blood and
in the urine.
    If, however, my experiments have been rightly interpreted, it is certain
that sulphocyanide of potassium or sodium is not a mere product of the
 salivary glands,      We have seen that it is found in the blood of all orders
of vertebrate animals, and we know that fish do not possess salivary organs.
Assuming that it is extracted out of the blood, what is its use in the saliva ?
    Considering its composition, it seemed possible that it acted either as an
antiseptic or else as an agent which prevented fermentation in the ali
mentary canal, and thus indirectly aided digestion.
   The conditions which favour the fermentation               of saccharine matter,
namely, acidity and the proper temperature, are constantly present in the
stomach.      Is sulphocyanide of potassium in saliva destined to check
this fermentation, which, under favourable circumstances, may occur in
less than an hour ?
   Carefully conducted experiments proved that it neither possesses the
power of preventing ordinary fermentation nor that of checking it when
already in action.
   We shall now see what is its action in preventing putrefaction.               Two
equal portions of roast mutton were placed, the one in water, and the
other in the same quantity of a solution of sulphocyanide of potassium of
the strength of 1 grain of the salt to 1 ounce of water.                 After some
weeks the meat which         had lain in water was found to be broken up into
shreds, and was quite putrid ; that in the sulphocyanide solution was
merely softened, and had a sour smell, but was not putrid.
    Sulphocyanide of potassium, therefore, possesses an antiseptic power ;
but whether or not this property comes into operation in the alimentary
canal is  a question I cannot now decide.
    I have made many quantitative analyses to determine the amount of
sulphocyanide eliminated with the urine in various diseases, including
typhus, typhoid, and scarlet fever.
   Not to enter into details at present, it will be sufficient to state what
the results showed      with much uniformity.       In all diseases in which wast
ing of the     body was marked, the excretion in the urine of a sulpho

  cyanide, in common with some other substances, was unusually great.
  This increase of it in the urine was found to correspond with its decrease
  in, or more frequently its disappearance from, the saliva. This circum
  stance     goes to prove that the salt is not formed by the saliva,              but is an
  ingredient of the blood itself.
  XIV. " On           some   Elementary Principles in Animal Mechanics." —
        No. II.          By the Rev. Samuel Haughton, M.D. Dublin,
        D.C.L. Oxon., Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin. Received
         June      14, 1869.
      In   a   former communication to the Royal Society on this subject (Pro
  ceedings, 20th June 1867), I endeavoured to establish the two following
  principles     : —
      I. That      the  force of    a muscle is   proportional    to the area   of its cross
  section.
      II.   That    the  force of     a muscle   is proportional to the cross section     of
  the tendon that conveys           its influence  to a  distant point.
      The first of      these   principles   is true under all circumstances, but the
  second requires to be modified somewhat in its statement.                  If  the condi
 tions as to friction of the tendons that convey the action of the muscles to
 a distant point be the same, then the force of the muscles will be propor
 tional to the cross sections of the tendons ; but if the tendons be sub
 jected to different amounts of friction, then the areas of their cross sec
 tions will cease to be proportional to the forces of the muscles, as represented
 by the areas of their cross sections.
     In my former paper (No. I.),             I selected, in illustration of principle II.,
 the long flexor tendons of the toes of the Rhea and other struthious birds,
 and showed that the cross sections of the muscles and tendons bore, ap
 proximately, a constant ratio to each other. Now, in the Struthionidee, the
 conditions as to friction of the long flexor tendons of the toes are similar
 although different in each species, and hence it was easy to prove that
the ratios of the cross sections of the muscles and tendons were nearly
 constant.
     When, however, muscles and tendons, variously conditioned as to fric
tion, are compared together, the constancy of the ratio of their cross sec
tions disappears, and undergoes a variation depending on the friction                     to
which both muscles and tendons are exposed.
     In   order to ascertain the proportion of the cross section (or force) of a
muscle to the cross section (or strength) of its tendon in the human
subject,      I  made the following observations on the          right arm and hand of a
well-developed male           subject in the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland,
in March         1868.
    I   first ascertained the specific gravities of the muscles and tendons, with
the following results         : —

     From   these specific gravities   it was easy to determine the cross section
 of  either muscles or tendons, by weighing a known length of either one
 or other. In this manner the following Table was constructed : —

    From the preceding Table, it appears that the ratio of the            cross    section
of the muscles to that of the tendons may range from               7 to 28, or be four
times greater in one case than another.            We may also see in general, that
the tendons exposed to the greatest amount of friction have the smallest
coefficients of cross section. Thus the radial tendon of the biceps has a
coefficient of 28 2, while the scapular tendon, which undergoes the friction
of passing over the head of the humerus, has a coefficient of 18-0. Again,
the Ext. oss. met. poll., whose tendon winds round the radius, and has the
duty imposed upon it of binding down the tendons of the radial extensors
of the wrist, has the coefficient of 7-7, as compared with 26-2 and 18-4,
the coefficients of the comparatively free tendons of these extensors.
   As it might be objected that the relative cross sections of muscle and
tendon, in a human subject that died a natural death, might be exceptional

These results, obtained from measurements made upon a freshly killed
animal, confirm those found from observation of the human subject, and
prove that the ratio of the cross section of the muscle to that of its tendon
depends upon the amount of friction experienced by the latter, the co
efficient being greater in proportion as the friction is less.

    It  appears from the preceding investigation that the cross               section   of a
muscle does not bear a constant ratio to the cross section of its tendon,
unless the friction experienced by the muscle and tendon be also constant,
and that there may even be a surplusage of strength in the tendon beyond
what is absolutely necessary to resist the combined force of the muscle and
friction.       This surplusage, however, cannot be supposed to be large, if the
principle of       economy  of material in nature    be admitted.

   After   I had found that the octylalcohol obtained by distilling castor
oil with caustic soda, is methyl-hexyl carbinol, or a secondary alcohol*,
it appeared to me of great interest to study the chemical structure of those
alcohols which can be obtained from the different hydrocarbons of the
formula C, HM, the more so as Cahours and Pelouze assert that the deri
vatives of the octane contained in petroleum are identical with those derived
from the castor-oil alcoholf,        a statement      which was afterwards confirmed
by Chapman J.
   The hydrocarbons which            I   used   for my experiments were hydride of
octyl, or octane from petroleum, and the hydrocarbon of the same com
position, which I obtained by acting upon iso-octyl iodide with zinc and
hydrochloric acid. The two hydrocarbons, as well as their derivatives,
resemble each other in their physical properties so much, that one would
be inclined to consider them as identical ; their chemical properties, how
ever, prove that they are only isomeric.

   The boiling-point of this hydrocarbon               is given differently by different
observers between 116°         and    120°;    according to my latest researches, it
appears to boil a few degrees higher.                 After fractionating it for a very
long time, the greater portion was found to boil between 120° and 125°;
it was now heated with nitric acid and again fractionated over sodium. A
considerable portion distilled now at 119°- 122°, but by far the largest
quantity at 122°-125°.           From this latter portion I prepared the octyl-
chloride, a colourless liquid, which smells like oranges, and boils at 173°-
1/6°. This chloride was heated up to 200° for several hours with con
centrated acetic acid and potassium acetate.               It was thus completely de
composed ; the chief product of the reaction consisted of octylene, besides
that   a  much smaller quantity of octyl-acetate had been formed.                      This
ether is a colourless liquid, boiling at 200°-205°, and having a pleasant
pear-like odour.     It was converted into octyl-alcohol by heating it with
an alcoholic solution of caustic potash.            This alcohol, after being purified
by washing it several times with water, and drying over fused potassium
carbonate, was obtained as a colourless oily liquid, boiling at 180°-182°,
and possessing exactly the odour of methyl-hexyl carbinol.
   The alcohol was oxidized by mixing it slowly with a cold solution of
2 parts of potassium dichromate and 3 parts of sulphuric acid in 1 0 parts
of water, care being taken to avoid as much as possible any elevation of

showed   that a slight excess of chromic  acid was present, no more of the
oxidising mixture was added. The liquid was shaken from time to time,
and distilled after a few hours.   The acid distillate was neutralized with
sodium carbonate ; only a small quantity of an acid was formed ; the
chief oxidation-product  consisted of a neutral oil, having the odour of
methyl-oeuanthol, and, like this compound, it formed with hydrogen-
sodium sulphite a crystalline compound.     The liquid having no constant
boiling-point, and the quantity being only small, I did not analyze it, but
oxidised it further by heating it with the chromic-acid solution. The acid
distillate was neutralized with sodium carbonate, the solution of the sodium
salts was evaporated and distilled with diluted sulphuric acid.       An oily
acid, distilled over the  residue in the retort, contained a large quantity of
acetic acid, which was obtained pure by several distillations                  ;   from it silver

             (2) Derivatives of Octane from Methyl-hexyl Carbinol.
    The alcohol obtained from castor oil is easily converted into its corre
sponding hydrocarbon by treating it first with iodine and phosphorus,
and acting upon the iodide thus obtained with zinc and hydrochloric acid.
    I hare already described this hydrocarbon in a former communication ;
it boils constantly at       124°  C.    The octyl-chloride obtained from it has
only   a faint orange-like smell ;    it boils at 1 74°-l 76°. Heated with con
centrated acetic     acid and potassium-acetate to 200°, it is decomposed after
a few hours, octyl-acetate and octylene being formed in about equal quan
tities, whilst the chloride obtained from petroleum gave about three times
more octylene than acetate.
    This acetate boils at 198°-202°, and has the same pear-like odour as
that described above.         The alcohol prepared from it by heating it with
an alcoholic solution of caustic potash, had no constant boiling-point ; it
distilled between 180° and 190°; the greatest portion between 182° and
 186°; its odour is very much like that of methyl-hexyl carbinol.                As I
 had only about 4 grammes,         I could not subject it to fractional distillation.
 On oxidizing it with the chromic-acid solution, the greatest care was taken
 to avoid rise of temperature, the solution being added very slowly until a
 permanent brownish colour showed that a slight excess of chromic acid
 was present, the vessel being all the time surrounded by cold water.               In
 order to have as decisive results as possible, I oxidised at the same time,
 and under exactly the same circumstances, 4 grammes of methyl-hexyl
 carbinol.     The liquids were allowed to remain together for a day, and
 were frequently shaken, then distilled, and the distillate neutralized with
 sodium carbonate.
     The two results differed very widely ; methyl-hexyl carbinol was, as in
 my former experiments, converted into methyl-oenanthol, a small portion
 of which was oxidised further to acetic and caproic acids. The caproic
 acid was separated by repeated distillation from the acetic acid, and neu
 tralized with ammonia.         From this solution I purposed to prepare silver
 salts by fractional precipitation, but only one precipitate was obtained.
     0-1113 of this salt contained 0-0536 silver.

  as the silver salt, which was obtained by fractional precipitations.

   The percentage amount of silver contained in these salts corresponds better

       From the results of my experiments I draw the following conclusions : —
       (1) The octyl alcohol, obtained from the hydrocarbon C9 Hls, oc
  curring in American petroleum, consists chiefly of methyl-hexyl carbinol,
  CH        i
'
  n rr      r CH OH, and           is   therefore identical      with the alcohol         obtained
  from castor oil.         Not only the physical properties of the two and their
   derivatives agree*, but also their oxidation products are the same ; they
                                                                            CH*
   both give methyl cenanthol or methyl-hexyl                  acetone,              I CO, which,
                                                                                     1
                                                                            C„ H13   J
  by further oxidation, splits up into acetic and caproic acids.
      Besides this secondary alcohol, there is also formed a smaller quantity
  of a primary alcohol, as amongst the products of oxidation an acid con
  taining eight atoms of carbon was found.
       (2) The hydrocarbon,           C8 Hla, which is formed by replacing in methyl-
  hexyl    carbinol   the   group     hydroxyl    HO by hydrogen, is different from that
      * The only   exception    is the boiling-point   of the acetate, which   I found  to be 200°-
  205°, whilst that from castor     oil boils, according to Bouia, at 193°.

 quantity of a primary alcohol, and a smaller quantity of a secondary one ;
the latter is not identical with methyl-hexyl carbinol, but consists most

                                              £a
yields valerianic and propionic acids.
     The primary alcohol appears to differ from the primary octyl alcohol,
which has been found lately by Zincke in the seeds of Heracleum spon-
 dytium*. The essential oil of these seeds consists chiefly of an octyl
acetate, boiling at 206°-208°, and possessing an orange-like smell, whilst
that which       I   obtained smells strongly of pears, and boils at 198°-202°.
By oxydising        his alcohol, Zincke obtained a caprylic acid, which solidified
at 12°, whilst the acid which               I  got remained liquid at 0°.              Zincke's
alcohol is most likely the normal alcohol, and that which I obtained an
alcohol containing the group isopropylf.
    (3) On acting upon the hydrocarbons of the series C„H2n+2 with chlo
rine, a mixture of primary and secondary chlorides is formed.                            This is
proved by     the    fact  that  the  alcohols  derived   from   these     chlorides   yield, on
oxidation, besides an acid containing the same number of atoms of carbon
as the alcohol, also         acetones,    or the characteristic      oxidation products of
 secondary alcohols.          Not only the above researches show this, but also
my former experiments on the oxidation of amyl-alcohol prepared from
 the hydride, which gave, besides valerianic acid, also acetic acid and the
acetone, C5 H10 OJ.
    It is certainly very remarkable that the hydrocarbon from petroleum
yields methyl-hexyl carbinol, whilst the hydrocarbon which is obtained
from methyl-hexyl carbinol is not reconverted into this alcohol, but                       gives
 ethyl-amyl carbinol, and besides a primary alcohol.
    The further investigation of this subject is certainly of the highest theo
retical interest ; but there is great difficulty in pursuing this research, as
I  have already observed, in consequence of the small yield of pure alcohol
from large quantities of the hydrocarbons.

    The chief product          obtained by the action of chlorine upon propane
consists,  as  I   have already stated in my last communication §, of propylene

100° and 200° C.         To obtain the latter in larger quantities,       I took those
portions of the substitution-products which boiled above 80°, and passed
chlorine into them for several days, having them exposed to direct sun
light, as in diffused light hardly any action took place.             By this means a
liquid was obtained which boiled between 120° and 200°. Subjected to
fractional   distillation,  the greater portion boiled between 150° and 160°,
but it was found impossbile to isolate a compound having a constant boiling-
point.    The reaction of this liquid, as well as the boiling-point and the
analysis, show that it consists of triehlorhydrine, C„ H, CI,, mixed with
higher chlorinated products.
    0-275 gave 0-8155 silver chloride.

    The reaction most characteristic of triehlorhydrine is that, on heating it
with caustic potash, it decomposes into hydrochloric acid and epidichlor-
hydrine, C, H4 Cl2, a liquid which boils at 1 00°, and which combines
directly with bromine, forming the compound C, H4 CL, Br2, the boiling-
point of which is 220°.
    On heating the liquid, boiling between 150° and 160°, with powdered
caustic potash, a violent reaction set in, and, besides water, a heavy oil
 distilled over, which possessed the somewhat garlic-like odour of epidi-
 chlorhydrine, and which boiled between 95° and 105°. The higher chlo
 rinated products contained in the original liquid were destroyed by this
reaction, carbonaceous matter being left with the potassium chloride in
the retort.      To the impure epidichlorydrine thus obtained bromine was
added ; this combined with it with a hissing noise and evolution of heat.
 On distillation, the greater portion of the compound boiled at 200°-220° ;
 the part boiling between 215° and 220° was analyzed.
    0-1835 of this compound gave 0-4455 of a mixture of silver chloride
 and silver bromide.

0-1928 silver.

    These experiments prove sufficiently that the liquid boiling between
 150° and 160° contained a large proportion of triehlorhydrine.                   It is
noteworthy     to  remark   that  the   substitution-products    of  the primary pro
pyl chloride are identical with those of the secondary chloride, as, according
to Linnemann,        on passing chlorine       into  isopropyl iodide, the products

which     are formed are (1) the. secondary chloride,              (2) probably propylene

   In my last communication hare already called attention to the dif
ferent behaviour of ethane and propane under the action of chlorine.                          A
further instance is the formation of trichlorhydrine, the chemical struc
ture of which is most probably expressed by the formula C H, CI — C H CI
— CaHCl, whilst by substituting 3 atoms of hydrogen by chlorine in
ethane, the compound C Ha— Cla is formed.
   The liquid from which I had separated the trichlorhydrine was again
treated with chlorine in the direct sunlight for several days. On distilling
it afterwards, it came over between 200° and 250°. The portion boiling
between 200° and 205° solidified               in the receiver as a white,          crystalline
mass.      In order     to remove from      it  an oily  liquid which it contained, it      was
pressed between filter-paper and recrystallized repeatedly from alcohol.

   (1) 0-1462       gave 0-5460 silver chloride and 0-0035 silver.
   (2) 0-1282       gave 0-4051 silver chloride.
                                                              Found.

    Tetrachlorpropane, as this compound may be called, crystallizes from a
hot alcoholic solution in small needles, four or eight of which are generally
grouped together, forming a regular star.                    Its smell strongly resembles
that of camphor.            Exposed to the air, it volatilizes pretty quickly ; heated
in  a  test-tube,   it   fuses, subliming rapidly at the same time.                In a sealed
 capillary tube it melted at 177°-178°, and solidified again at 176°-175°.
   The liquid boiling between 205° and 250° was very little acted upon by
chlorine even in the brightest sunshine and presence of iodine ; also treat
ment with potassium chlorate and fuming hydrochloric acid produced little
effect, as, after acting upon it for several days, the liquid boiled again
between 220° and 250°. The portion boiling between 243° and 250° was
analyzed     : —
   0-1926 gave 0-6580 silver chloride and 0-0034 silver.

   This compound is therefore hexachlorpropane,                     C, Ha CI6, a colourless,
 heavy liquid,      which     smells somewhat like           camphor, and boils without
 decomposition at about 250°.
    From     these experiments       it would     appear that in propane we cannot re
 place by direct substitution more than six atoms of hydrogen by chlorine.
 This observation gains in interest by the fact that in sextane (hexyl-
 hydride) C0HH, from petroleum also not more than six atoms of hydrogen

    The mud brought up consisted chiefly of minute amorphous particles
of carbonate of lime, with a considerable proportion of living Globigerinee
and other Foraminifera, and of the "coccoliths" and " coccospheres,"
so characteristic of the cbalk-mud of the warmer area of the Atlantic.
The    sponges belonged to four genera ; one of these was the genus llyalo-
nema, previously represented by the singular glass-rope sponges of Japan
and the coast of Portugal, and the other three genera were new to science.
One of these latter was the subject of the paper.
    Associated with the sponges were representatives, usually of a small size,
of the Mollusca, the Crustacea and Annelides, the Echinodermata, and the
Ccelenterata,    with numerous large and remarkable rhizopods.             Many of
the higher invertebrates were brightly coloured and had eyes.
    Four nearly perfect specimens of the sponge described in the memoir
were procured.

apparently full-grown specimens are from 9"     to 1' 1" in length, and from 7"
to 9" wide.       The outer wall consists of an open, somewhat irregular, but
very elegant network, whose skeleton is made up of large separate siliceous
spicules. These spicules are formed on the hexradiate stellate type ; but
usually only five rays are developed, the sixth ray being represented by a
tubercle.    To form the framework of the external wall, the four secondary
branches of the spicule spread on one plane, the surface of the sponge,
 while the fifth or azygous branch dips down into the sponge-substance.
 This arrangement of the spicules     gives the outer surface of the sponge a
 distinctly stellate appearance, the centres of the stars being the point
 of radiation of the secondary branches of the spicules. These quinque-
 radiate spicules measure about 1" 5"' from point to point of the cross
 like secondary branches,     and the length. of the azygous arm       is from
 7-5'" to 1".

       Smaller stars,    formed by the radiation of smaller spicules of the same
   class, occupy     the spaces between the rays of the larger stars.
      The rays of each star bend irregularly, and meet the rays of the spi
   cules forming the neighbouring stars.          The rays of the different spicules
   thus run along for some distance parallel to one another, and are held
   together by a layer of elastic sarcode, which invests all the spicules and
  all their branches.       Between the rays of the spicules, over the whole sur
  face, the sarcode forms an ultimate and very delicate network, its meshes
  defining minute inhalent pores.
      At the top of the sponge there is     a  large osculum, about 3" in diameter,
  which terminates a cylindrical cavity, which passes down vertically into
  the substance of the sponge to a depth of 5" 5"'.                 The walls of this
  oscular cavity are formed upon the same plan as the external wall              of the
  sponge ; and the stars, which are even more conspicuous than those             of the
  outer wall, are due to the same arrangement of spicules of the same form.
  The ultimate sarcode network is absent between the rays of the stars of
  the oscular surface.
      The sponge-substance, which is about 2" in thickness between the
  oscular and the outer walls, is formed of a loose vacuolated arrangement
  of bands and rods of greyish consistent sarcode, containing minute dis
  seminated granules and groups of granules of horny matter, and minute
  endoplasts.
      Towards the outer wall of the sponge the sarcode trabecules        are arranged
  more symmetrically, and at length they resolve themselves              into distinct
 columus, which abut against and support the centres of the stars, leaving
 wide, open, anastomosing channels between them. The sarcode of the
 outer wall, and that of the wall of the oscular cavity, is loaded with minute
 spicules of two principal forms, quinqueradiate            spicules   with   one  ray
 prolonged and feathered, and minute amphidisci.
     Over the lower third of the body of the sponge, fascicles of enormously
 long delicate siliceous spicules pass out from the sarcode columns of the
 sponge-body in which they originate, through the outer wall, to be diffused
to a distance of not less than half a metre in the mud in which the sponge
lives buried ; and round the osculum and over the upper third of the
sponge, sheaves of shorter more rigid spicules project, forming a kind of
fringe.
     The author referred all the       sponges   which were found inhabiting the
chalk-mud        to the Order    Porifera  Vitrea, which he had defined in the
'Annals and Magazine           of Natural History' for February 1868. This
order is mainly characterized by the great variety and complexity of form
of the spicules, which may apparently, with scarcely an exception, be re
ferred to the hexradiate stellate type, a form of spicule which does not
appear to occur in any other order of sponges.             The genus Holtenia is
nearly    allied  to  Hyalonema,   and  seems  to resemble  it in its mode of occur
rence.      Both genera live imbedded in the soft upper layer of the chalk

 mud, in which they are supported, — Holtenia by a delicate maze of siliceous
 fibres, which spread round it in all directions, increasing its surface without
 materially increasing its weight, — Hyalonema by a more consistent coil of
 spicules, which penetrates the mud vertically and anchors itself in a firmer
 layer.
     It   appeared    to the author     and to Dr. Carpenter, who had had their
 attention specially directed to this point as bearing upon the continuity and
identity of some portions of the present calcareous deposits of the Atlantic
with the cretaceous formation, that the vitreous sponges are more nearly
allied to the Ventriculites of the chalk than to any recent order of Forifera.
They are inclined to ascribe the absence of silica in many ventriculites,
and the absence of disseminated silica in the chalk generally, to some pro
cess, probably dialytic, subsequent to the deposit of the chalk, by which
 the silica has been removed and aggregated in amorphous masses, the chalk
 flints.
     The Vitreous Sponges along with the living Rhizopods and other Protozoa
 which enter largely into the composition of the upper layer of the chalk-
 mud, appear to be nourished by the absorption through the external sur
 face of their bodies of the assimilable organic matter which exists in
 appreciable quantity in all sea- water, and which is derived from the life and
 death of marine animals and plants, and in large quantity, from the water
 of tropical rivers. One principal function of this vast sheet of the lowest
type of animal life, which probably extends over the whole of the warmer
regions of the sea, may probably be to diminish the loss of organic matter
by gradual decomposition, and to aid in maintaining in the ocean, the
 " balance of organic nature."

     1.  A method of notation is        suggested   by which    material sufficient for
the formation of        a perfectly accurate diagram of a     skull may be registered
by    means   of a line or two   of figures. This is accomplished by marking the
vertical and horizontal distance of a number of points from the postauricular
depression.
     2.  The longest base-lines, from fronto-nasal suture to back of foramen
magnum, are found in savage skulls.               This base-line is distinctly longer
in males than females ; and the proportion which the arch bears to the
base-line is greater in children than in the adult.            In the Irish, the base
line is short, and the arch extensive.

foramen magnum, orbital length or profile distance of fronto-nasal suture
from foramen opticum, and the foramino- optic line uniting the other lines
together, it is found that the long base-line of savage skulls depends both
on amount of orbital length and on long foramino-optic line.
    4. The angle at which the line of orbital length lies to the foramen
magnum is distinguished as the cranial curvature.        This angle in adult Eu
ropeans on an average exceeds 180°, and in negro and other savage types
falls short of that amount.       It is also less in infants than in adults, and
greater in females than in males.      But the variation of the angles at which
the foramen magnum and orbital depth respectively lie to the foramino-
optic line, is much greater than the variation in cranial curvature ; therefore
the two angles mentioned are in a certain degree of mutual relation ; and
according to their size, the base may be termed
                                                     " steep or " level." The
                                                             "
 infant base is much more level than the adult male base ; the levelness of
 childhood sometimes persists in the female.
    5.  The different regions of the arch   do not grow equally.    The parietal
 region reaches its greatest predominance in the last month of fcetal life,
and after birth the frontal region grows most rapidly, and the occipital
 region next most rapidly. There is no foundation whatever, so far as mesial
 measurements are concerned, for the supposition that the lower races of
 humanity have the forehead less developed than the more civilized nations.
 Neither is it the case that the forehead in the lower races slopes more
 backwards on the floor of the anterior cranial fossa than it does in others.
    G. The local prominence of different parts of the arch of the skull being
 measured by means of the angles joining lines passing from point to point
 in the arch, it is shown that the angles furnish a means of collecting various
 precise  details with regard to national characteristics of form, from which
important results may be expected if the plan be worked on an extensive
scale.    Flatness of the angle formed by lines from the extremities to the
midpoint of the parietal arc is shown to be correlated with length of base
line.
    7. As age advances, "gravitation changes" take place, the base being
driven in and the lateral wall bulging out, the forehead becoming more
 retreating, and the condyles flat.
    8. It is sought to be shown that if Dolichocephali and Brachycephali
are to continue to be a natural and not an artificial division of skulls, the
distinction must be based on the various characters pointed out by Retzius,
and not on the mere amount of the " cephalic index." The proportion of
height to length, according to the writer, is more important than the pro
portion of breadth to length.       He proposes that Hindoo skulls should be
considered as belonging to a subdivision Brachycephali angustiores, and
that the Germans should be considered as Dolichocephali latiores.
    9. The value of
                      " radial" measurements from the
                                                           postauricular depres
sion is tested, and it is shown that a classification of some value may be
based on them, but that they are defective in consequence of the variability

of the position of the postauricular depression, in both vertical and hori
zontal direction, as compared with the front of the foramen magnum.
That position varies in different races, and is affected by gravitation changes.
   10. The position of greatest breadth varies according to the time of life,
and as the spaces adjacent to the mesial and lateral roof-ridges are well
filled or ill filled ; and an hypothesis is advanced in explanation of this, and
of the mesial ridge being prominent in savage skulls, although the ridge
on the foetal skull disappears in childhood.
   1 1 . Orthognathism  and prognathism are shown to be concrete results of
a variety of circumstances, some of them not connected with the anatomy
of the face, as, for example, the degree of cranial curvature. The extent to
which the       face projects from underneath the skull must be measured by an
angle contained between the fore part of the face and the floor of the
anterior fossa only of the skull, the curves of the base of the skull further
back having really nothing to do with the matter.      This projection of the
face is great in French skulls, considerable in Scotch, and small in Irish and
German skulls.
   12.    The facial angle      is affected by the height       of the   ear above   the
foramen magnum, while prognathism is not.
   13. The condyles of the skull become more and more prominent in front
from infancy to adult life, and thus tilt the skull more and more back
wards.      By this rotation     is preserved, seeing that the fore part of
                                 balance
the head and the face are the parts which proportionally increase in size
as growth               and their increased proportion of weight is made up
                 proceeds,
for by a greater amount being thrown behind the vertebral column. There
is less tilting back in the female head than the male.
    14.   This principle      is shown to be most important in      Artistic Anatomy.
   15.    In the lower animals the cerebral curvature is of very different
amount in different species, the most advanced             animals having it greatest.

 employed for the preparation of large quantities of nitride, owing to the
 violence of the action and consequent loss of material.            The author, seek
 ing for    a   more economical method, found that          if the ammonium meta-
 vanadate     (NH4 VO,) be heated for a sufficiently long time at a white heat
 in a  current of dry ammonia, pure vanadium mononitride remains behind.
 Analysis of a sample thus prepared gave 79-6 per cent, of vanadium and
 20-2 per cent, of nitrogen, theory requiring 78-6 and 21-4 per cent, re
 spectively. The mononitride may likewise be directly prepared by igniting
 vanadium trioxide (V, 0,) in a current of ammonia at a white heat in a
 platinum     tube, and also by subjecting       the dichloride   to the   same    treat
 ment.
    The Chlorides     of Vanadium. —Three chlorides of vanadium              have   been

 (H=l). — This chloride is formed          as a dark reddish brown volatile      liquid,
 when metallic vanadium or the mononitride is burnt in excess of chlorine.
The first method adopted for the preparation of this chloride             was to pass
 dry chlorine over the mononitride heated to redness ; the whole of the
 nitride volatilizes and a reddish-brown liquid comes over.             In one opera
tion 44 grammes of the crude tetrachloride was thus prepared ; the liquid
 is purified by distillation  first in  a current of chlorine and then in a stream
of carbonic acid gas. On fractionating, the liquid              was found     to boil  at
  154° C. (corrected) under 760mni of mercury.            The    second   method      de
pends upon a fact already noticed in the preceding communication, that
the oxitrichloride (VO CI,), prepared, according to the directions of Berze-
lius, by passing dry chlorine over a mixture of the trioxide and charcoal,
possesses a port-wine colour instead        of the canary-yellow tint of the pure
substance.       This dark colour    is due to the formation      of the tetrachloride
of vanadium, and if the vapours of the oxitrichloride, together with excess
of dry chlorine, be passed several times over a column of red-hot charcoal
the whole of the oxygen of the oxichloride can be removed, and at last
perfectly pure tetrachloride, boiling constantly at 1 54° is obtained.              This
reaction, it will be remembered, served first to demonstrate the existence of
oxygen. in the oxitrichloride.         In each distillation of the tetrachloride a
peach-blossom-coloured        solid   residue   remained in the bulbs ; this sub
stance is vanadium trichloride, and it slowly burns away in excess of chlo
rine when heated, forming tetrachloride.
    The composition of the tetrachloride was established by six well-agree
ing analyses, made from several different preparations.                The mean re

      Owing to the facility with which the tetrachloride splits up into trichlo
  ride and chlorine a solid residue was left in the vapour-density bulb, and
  the density of the vapour (at 219°) was found by Dumas- s method to be
  99-06 (or 6-86) instead of 96-6 (or 6 69).        By volatilising the liquid in a
 small bulb, and allowing the vapours to pass into a large bulb already
 heated above the boiling-point of the liquid this deposition of trichloride was
 avoided, and the density was found to be 96-6 or 6-69 at 205°, and 93-3
 or 6 48 at 215°, the last determination indicating that a partial decompo
 sition into VC1, and CI had occurred.          The specific gravity of the liquid
 tetrachloride at 0° is 1-8584   ;  it does  not solidify at —18°, nor does it at
 this or any higher temperature undergo change of properties on treatment
 with chlorine. It not only undergoes decomposition on boiling, but at the
 ordinary atmospheric temperatures it splits up into VC1S and CI. Tubes in
 which the liquid tetrachloride had been sealed up have burst by the pressure
 of the evolved chlorine. Thrown into water, the tetrachloride is at once
 decomposed, yielding a blue solution identical in colour with the liquid
 obtained by the action of sulphurous or sulphydric acids on vanadic acid
 in solution, and containing a vanadous salt, derived from the tetroxide V,04.
 In   order to prove that a vanadous salt is formed when the tetrachloride is
 thrown into water, the solution thus obtained was oxidized to vanadic
 acid by   a standard permanganate solution.        The calculated percentage of
 oxygen thus needed according to the formula 2VCl4 + 0-|-4HaO=V20,+
 8HC1 is 4-14 ; the percentage of oxygen found by experiment was 4-11.
     The solution of the tetrachloride in water does not bleach ; but         if the
vapour be led into water a liquid is obtained which bleaches litmus.             Va
nadium tetrachloride acts violently on dry alcohol and ether, forming deep-
coloured liquids.     The author is engaged upon the examination of this
reaction.
     Bromine and vanadium tetrachloride, sealed up and heated together, do
not combine ; on the contrary, trichloride is deposited.           Hence it is clear
that vanadium     does not readily form a pentad compound         with the chlorous
elements.
     2. Vanadium Trichloride. — VC1,=157-8.           The trichloride is a solid
body, crystallizing     in splendid peach-blossom -coloured shining tables,
closely resembling in appearance the crystal of chromium sesquichloride.
It is non-volatile in hydrogen, and, when heated in the air, it decomposes,
glowing with absorption of oxygen, and forming the pentoxide.               Heated
in hydrogen the trichloride      first loses one atom of chlorine, forming the
dichloride (VClj),    and  afterwards,  on exposure to a higher temperature,
loses all its chlorine, leaving n.etallic vanadium as a grey lustrous powder.

The trichloride is extremely hygroscopic, deliquescing on exposure to air to
a brown liquid.       The trichloride is best prepared by the quick decomposi
tion of the tetrachloride at its boiling point, or by its slow decomposition
at the ordinary temperature of the air.              The crystalline powder obtained
by either of these methods only requires freeing from adhering tetrachlo
ride by drying in carbon dioxide at 160° in order to yield good analytical
results.

as the crystals get      moistened,   a brown     solution is formed, which becomes
green on addition of a drop of hydrochloric              acid, and contains a hypova-
nadic salt in solution.       This   green   tint   is identical  with that got by re
ducing a solution of vanadic acid in presence of magnesium. According to
the equation 2VCl3-r-Oa+3HilO=Va Os + 6HCl the solution of the tri
chloride requires 10*14 per cent, of oxygen to bring it up to vanadic acid,
whilst analysis showed that 10- 1 per cent, was necessary.                   The specific
gravity of the trichloride at 18° is 3-00.
    3.  Vanadium Bichloride VCla= 122-3. — The dichloride is a solid cry
stallizing in fine bright apple-green micacious plates.               It is prepared by

through a glass tube heated to dull redness.                   If the heat be pushed
further    a  blackish   crystalline powder, consisting of a mixture of lower
chloride and metal, is obtained.          The dichloride, when strongly heated in
hydrogen,     loses  all  its chlorine,  leaving vanadium in the metallic state in
 grey crystalline grains.       Analysis gave    : —

     Vanadium      dichloride    is extremely hygroscopic ; when thrown into
 water a violet-coloured      solution is formed, identical in tint with the liquid
 containing a hypovanadous salt obtained by reducing vanadic acid in solu
 tion in presence of zinc- or sodium-amalgam ; and like this latter liquid,
 the solution of dichloride in water bleaches strongly by reduction.
     Oxidized by permanganate this liquid required 18-78 percent, of oxygen
 (on the dichloride taken) to bring it np to vanadic acid, whereas the equa
 tion 2VC]a+Os+ 2HaO=VaO„+4HCl                     requires 19 6 per cent. The spe
 cific gravity of vanadium dichloride at 18° is 3-23.

taining oxygen would yield the metal by direct reduction, the author has
repeated the experiments of other chemists on this subject, but without
success.        There is no doubt that the metal cannot be obtained by any
of the processes described in the books. The only methods which pro
mised possible results were : —
      1. The reduction of a vanadium chloride (free from oxygen) in hydro
          gen gas, either with or without sodium.
      2. The reduction of the mononitride at      a white heat in hydrogen.
      The first of these     methods    has  proved to be successful, whilst the
 second does not appear to yield metal, inasmuch as the nitride exposed for
 3^ hours in a platinum tube to the action
                                                     of hydrogen at a white heat,
 lost only 8 per cent., whereas it must lose 21*4 per cent, on conversion
 into metal.
       Notwithstanding the apparent simplicity of the method, the author has
 found it exceedingly difficult to obtain the metal perfectly free from oxy
 gen.       This arises from the fact that whilst vanadium is quite stable at the
  ordinary temperature, it absorbs oxygen with the greatest avidity at a red
  heat, and that therefore every trace of air and moisture must be excluded
  during the reduction. Another difficulty consists in the preparation of the
  solid chlorides in large quantity and free from oxygen or moisture, as also
  in the length of time needed to reduce these chlorides in hydogen, during
  which time unavoidable diffusion occurs and traces of oxygen enter the
  tube.       Again, the reduction  can only be effected in platinum boats placed
  in    a porcelain tube, as the metal acts violently on glass and porcelain, and
  tubes     of platinum  are porous at a red heat.
        A description  of the apparatus employed     is then given, the main points
   being to guard against diffusion, and to introduce the powdered dichloride
   into the platinum boat in such a way that it shall not for an instant be
   exposed to moist air.      After all precautions are taken the tube is heated to
   redness, torrents of hydrochloric acid come off, and the evolution of this gas
   continues for from 40 to 80 hours, according to the quantity of dichloride
   taken.      After the evolution of any trace of hydrochloric acid has ceased to
   be perceptible, the tube is allowed to cool, and the boat is found to contain
   a   light whitish grey-coloured powder, perfectly free from chlorine.
        Metallic vanadium thus prepared examined under the microscope re
   flects light powerfully, and is seen to consist of a brilliant shining crystal
   line metallic mass possessing a bright silver-white lustre. Vanadium does
    not oxidize or even tarnish in the air at the ordinary temperature ; nor
    does   it absorb oxygen when heated in the air to       100°.   It  does not de
    compose water even at 100°, and may be moistened with water and dried
    in vacuo without gaining weight.          The metal is not fusible or volatile
    at a bright red heat in hydrogen ; the powdered metal thrown into a
    flame    burns   with the most brilliant scintillations.      Heated quickly in
    oxygen it burns vividly, forming       the pentoxide  ; but slowly ignited in air
    it first glows to form a brown oxide (possibly VaO), and then again ab

 sorbs oxygen and glows with formation of the black trioxide and blue
 tetroxide till it at last attains its maximum degree of oxidation.           The
 specific gravity of metallic vanadium at 15° is 5-5.        It is not soluble in
 either hot or cold hydrochloric acid ; strong sulphuric acid dissolves it on
 heating, giving a yellow solution ; hydrofluoric acid dissolves it slowly
 with evolution of hydrogen ; nitric acid of all strengths acts violently on
 the metal, evolving red nitrous fumes and yielding a blue solution ; fused
 with sodium hydroxide the metal dissolves with evolution of hydrogen,           a
 vanadate being formed.
     One sample yielded on oxidation a percentage increase of 77-94, whereas
that calculated from metal to pentoxide is 77-98.            Another preparation
 gave a percentage   increase  of  70 8, showing the presence     of a small quan
 tity of oxide.   On treatment in      a current  of chlorine   metallic vanadium
 burns and forms the reddish black tetrachloride        ;  heated in a current  of
 pure nitrogen the mononitride is formed.
     The properties of the compounds of vanadium with silicon and platinum
 are then described in the memoir.

    Palceocoryne is a new genus containing two species, and belongs to a new
family of the Tubularidae.       The forms described were diicovered in the
lower shales of the Ayrshire and Lanarkshire coal-field, and an examination
of their structure determined them to belong to the Hydrozoa, and to be
parasitic upon Fenestellae.       The genus has some characters in common
with Bimeria (St. Wright), and the polypary is hard and ornamented.
The discovery of the trophosome, and probably part of the gonosome of a
tubularine Hydrozoon in the Palaeozoic strata brings the order into geolo
gical relation with the doubtful Sertularian Graptolites of the Silurian
formation, and with the rare medusoids of the Solenhofen stones.

    In 1863 the author     announced, in a communication which Dr. Miller
had the kindness to publish in the third edition of his ' Chemical Physics,-
that on partially liquefying carbonic acid by pressure, and gradually raising
at the same time the temperature        to about 88° Fahr., the surface of de

marcation between the liquid and gas became fainter, lost its curvature,
and at last disappeared, the tube being then filled with a fluid which, from
its optical and other properties, appeared to be perfectly homogeneous.
The present paper contains the results of an investigation of this subject,
which has occupied the author for several years. The temperature at
which carbonic acid ceases to liquefy by pressure he designates the critical
point, and he finds it to be 30°-92 C. Although liquefaction does not
occur at temperatures a little above this point, a very great change of
density is produced by slight alterations of pressure, and the flickering
movements, also described in 1863, come conspicuously into view.                In
this communication, the combined effects of heat and pressure upon car
bonic acid at temperatures varying from 13° C. to 48° C., and at pres
sures ranging from 48 to 109 atmospheres, are fully examined.
     Atl3°-l C., and under a pressure, as indicated approximately by the
air manometer, of 48 89 atmospheres, carbonic acid, now just on the point
of liquefying, is reduced to -g^.-g of the volume it occupied under one
atmosphere.      A slight increase of pressure, amounting to ^ of an
atmosphere, which has to be applied to condense the first half of the
liquid, is shown to arise from the presence of a trace of air (idlov part)
in the carbonic acid. After liquefaction, the volume of the carbonic acid,
already reduced to about             of its original volume, continues to dimi
nish   as the pressure augments, and at a much greater rate than in the
case of ordinary liquids.     Similar results were obtained at the temperature
of 21°-5.    A third  series of experiments    was made at 31°-1, or    0°2 above
the critical point.   In this  case the volume    of the carbonic acid diminished
steadily  with the  pressure,  till about  74 atmospheres    were attained. After
this, a rapid but not (as in the case of liquefaction) abrupt fall occurred,
and the volume was diminished to one-half by an additional pressure of
less than two atmospheres. Under a pressure of 75-4 atmospheres, the car
bonic acid was reduced to af T of its original volume under one atmosphere.
Beyond this point it yielded very slowly to pressure. During the stage
of rapid contraction there was no evidence at any time of liquefaction
having occurred, or of two conditions of matter being present in the tube.
Two other series of experiments were made, one at 32°-5, the other at
35°-5, with the same general results, except that the rapid fall became
less marked as the temperature was higher.              The experiments at 350t5
 were carried as far as 107 atmospheres, at which          pressure the volume  of
carbonic   acid was almost the same as that which         it should have occupied
if it had been derived directly from liquid carbonic acid, according to the
law of the expansion of that body for heat.
    The last series of experiments was made at 48°-l, and extended from
 62-6 to 109-4 atmospheres of pressure.         The results are very interesting,
inasmuch as the rapid fall exhibited at lower temperatures has almost, if
not altogether, disappeared, and the curve representing the changes of
volume approximates closely to that of       a gas following the law of Mariotte.

law held good.
   The results just described are represented in a graphical form in the
figure given below.    Equal volumes of air and carbonic acid, measured at
0° C. and 760   millimetres, when compressed at the temperatures mareed
 on each curve, undergo the changes  of volume indicated by the form of the

   The author has exposed carbonic acid, without making precise measure
ments, to higher pressures than any of those mentioned, and has made it
pass, without breach of continuity, from what is universally regarded as
the gaseous               in like manner, universally regarded as the liquid
                    to what   is,
state.     As direct result of his experiments, he concludes that the gaseous
                a
and liquid states are only widely separated forms of the same condition of
matter, and may be made to pass into one another              series of grada  by   a
tions so gentle that the passage shall nowhere present any interruption or
breach of continuity.    From carbonic acid as    perfect gas, to carbonic
                                                                     a

tinuous process, and the gas and liquid are only distant stages of long                       a
series of continuous physical changes. Under certain conditions of tem

instability, and suddenly passes, without change of pressure or tempera
ture, but with the evolution of heat, to the condition which,      the con               by

     The author       discusses     the question, as to what             is   the condition or state
of carbonic acid, when            it   passes at temperatures above 31° from the ordi
nary gaseous                             of the liquid, without giving any
                     state down to the volume
evidence during   the process of the occurrence of liquefaction, and arrives
at the conclusion that the answer to this question       to be found in the   is
intimate relations which subsist between the gaseous and liquid states of
matter.      In the abrupt change which occurs when the gases are compressed
to   a   certain volume at temperatures below the critical point, molecular
forces are brought into play, which produce      sudden change of volume,

carbonic acid which has collapsed from that which has not changed its
volume.         But when the        same change      is   effected   by
                                                                  the continuous process,
the carbonic acid passes through                  conditions which lie between the ordi
nary gaseous and ordinary liquid states, and which we have no valid
grounds for referring to the one state rather than to the other.
   Nitrous oxide, hydrochloric acid, ammonia, sulphuric ether, sulphuret
of carbon, all exhibited critical points when exposed under pressure to the
required temperatures.
   The author proposes for the present arbitrary distinction between vapours
and gases, to confine the term vapour to gaseous bodies at temperatures
below their critical points, and which therefore can be liquefied by pres
sure, so that gas and liquid may exist in the same vessel in presence of
one another.
  The possible continuity of the liquid and solid states referred to as             is                 a
problem of far greater difficulty than that which forms the subject of this
communication, and as one which cannot be resolved without careful in
vestigation.

XXII. " The        Physiological Action of Atropine, Digitaline, and Aconi-

       B. Nunneley, M.D. Lond.                Communicated by Dr.          Bastian.
       Received June 16, 1869.
                                      (Abstract.)
   These experiments were undertaken with the view of determining more
exactly the physiological action of atropine, digitaline, and aconitine on the
heart and blood-vessels,        by methods of experiment which have hitherto
been little followed out.
    My experiments       on atropine have led me to the conclusion that      it exerts
no action on the blood-vessels,        a result which     differs from that    of Mr.
Wharton Jones and of          M. Meuriot.     This opinion was adopted after a
lengthened examination of the natural circulation in the frog's web, and
of the numerous spontaneous changes which it undergoes, and also of those
which are the result of the slightest irritation.       It is some of these changes
which have, I think, been assigned by the observers just named to the
special action of atropine.
   Different    opinions have been entertained with regard to the action of
digitaline on the heart ; the result of my observations is given below. Aco
nitine has also a very marked action on the heart, the opposite of that of
digitaline ;  its physiological effects are stated.
   In actually conducting the experiments, the general symptoms of                   a
poisonous dose were first observed, so as to show the period at which the
heart lost its vitality in relation to the rest of the body.
   Next, the visible effect produced on the heart, exposed in situ, was noted
as regards the quality, frequency and rhythm of its contractions ; and also
the alteration seen to occur in     a  heart removed from the body and immer
sed in a solution    of the alkaloid.
   Lastly, the effect on the blood-vessels of the web, was examined with
the aid of the microscope.
   The results obtained have been thrown into the form of conclusions.
   Atropine, digitaline, and aconitine do not produce any effect on the ves
sels of, or circulation in, the frog's web, whether locally applied in the
form of solution, or injected under the skin at a distant part, so as to in
fluence the animal generally ; in the latter case, as they tend to impair or
abolish the functions        of the heart, the circulation necessarily undergoes
secondary changes      ;   but these alterations do hot occur until the heart is
visibly affected.

continue for some hours.

  gctic, a progressive weakening of its power being the most prominent
  visible effect.  The heart continues to beat for some time after the mani
 festations of life in the rest of the animal have disappeared ; finally it slowly
  dies itself, the ventricle being left in a state of relaxation   ; this occurs at
 the end of ten, twelve, or several more hours.
     3. The heart-s contraction gradually decreases in frequency and there is
 no primary acceleration.
     The rhythm of the heart-s action is not interfered with ; the auricles
 continue to beat for some time after the ventricle has ceased to do so.
     4. When the heart is removed from the body and immersed in a solu
 tion of sulphate of atropine, it ceases to contract in about the same time
 that a heart does placed in water ; its appearance does not undergo any
 change.
     5. The pupil of the frog-s eye is not dilated by atropine, either when
 locally applied or injected under the skin.
     6.  The lymphatic hearts cease to contract long before the blood-heart.
     Digit aline. — 1. After the injection of about       gr. under the skin, the
 frog at first jumps about, then becomes quiet, sinks down on the plate, can
 not be easily roused and dies in about from twenty to forty minutes. Some
 times the frog has paroxysms of gasping movements, lasting from twenty
 to fifty seconds, in which it holds its mouth wide open, leaning on its fore
 pnws. These attacks are paroxysmal, whilst the embarrassment of the
 heart is continuous.      On opening the frog, the heart is found motionless
 and usually unirritable, the ventricle being small and pale.
     Where digitaline if put into the mouth it causes a great secretion of
fluid ; in cats the salivation is very marked.
     2. Digitaline acts with great energy on the heart, throwing it into vio
lent and disorderly contractions which quickly end in a cessation of move
ment.      The first visible effect occurs a short time after the injection under
the skin, and consists in a diminished range of the heart-s movements;
but the most marked alteration is a certain embarrassment and loss of
smoothness in the heart-s contractions, as if there were a want of coordi
nation in the contractions of the individual fibres.
    The ventricular systole presents a peculiar appearance and takes a longer
time for its performance than in health ; it appears to travel along, squeez
ing the heart up, as it were, and forcing the blood into one spot, which
becomes     bright red and projecting ; at the same time there are prominent
muscular bundles on the surface of the ventricle giving it an irregular mo
tion.
    During diastole, the ventricle does not everywhere assume a red colour,
but one or more irregular red spots appear as if it were so firmly contracted
as only to permit the entrance of a small quantity of blood.          These spots
become smaller and smaller,        until at last the ventricle is left very pale,
strongly contracted and motionless, whilst the auricles are distended with
blood.

   3. The frequency of the heart-s contractions is not increased, but is pro
gressively diminished.
   4. The functions of the heart are abolished very early, voluntary power,
as shown by the frog-s ability to      jump about with its heart motionless and
contracted, reflex acts and the contractility       of the lymphatic      hearts sur
viving the death of that organ.
    5.  The rhythm      of the heart-s contractions is but little interfered with
unlil   near the end, when they become irregular in frequency and force.
    6. Immersion      of the heart, removed from the body, in           a  solution    of
digitaline causes the ventricle to become somewhat uneven in outline ; the
contractions get weak and infrequent and at last cease, sooner by some
minutes than in a heart placed in water ; the appearance of the ventricle
when it has ceased to beat, presents little that is peculiar, except that it
often looks uneven.
    Aconitine.  — 1. After the injection under      the skin of about ^ gr. the
frog jumps about for a        few minutes and     then  either sinks down on the
plate, or else falls over on to its back, as if it had lost both muscular power
and the ability to'direct its movements ; in either case it dies in from twenty
to forty minutes.       If the dose is larger, the frog falls as if stunned, almost
immediately after the injection ; from this state it partially revives, but dies
at the end of a few minutes.        On exposing the heart it is found beating,
but rather feebly, and continues to do so for one or two hours.
    2. When the heart is exposed in situ, aconitine is seen to have              a very
distinct and powerful action upon it.         Its contractile power is quickly im
paired giving rise to a peculiar perversion of rhythm. The interval of re
laxation of the ventricle is considerably lengthened, whilst the auricles go
on contracting regularly, the consequence is that the ventricle becomes more
and more distended with blood, at last a limited part of it contracts, this
area   of contraction   increases with each systole until, in time, the blood is
forced,   at each contraction, to one part of the heart which projects as a
nodule, in a short time the whole ventricle becomes involved in contraction
and empties itself in the ordinary way ; soon after the ventricle again enters
into   a state of relaxation when the same series of acts is repeated.         Finally,
the ventricle is left large, dark and distended with blood, in a condition
exactly contrary to that of a heart arrested by digitaline.
    3. When a heart is removed from the body and immersed                in a  solution
of aconitine it   ceases to beat a  little sooner than one does placed        in water,
but presents nothing peculiar in its appearance.
    4. The frequency of the heart-s pulsation is increased by a few beats at
first, but in a short time there is a progressive diminution.
    5. Although aconitine abolishes the functions of the heart in a compa
ratively short time, voluntary power, reflex acts and the contractility of the
lymphatic hearts disappear some time before the blood-heart ceases to beat.
The results obtained in about 1 70 experiments formed the basis for these
conclusions.

    This paper is a continuation of the researches on refraction which have
been already published by the author in conjunction with the llev. T.
Pelham Dale*.
    It is divided into two parts — the data, and the deductions. The data
 consist of the refraction-equivalents of some simple and many compound
bodies,     calculated from the indices observed by various chemists and
physicists, or by the author himself ; together with a series of observations
on about 150 salts in solution.           The method of examining these, and the
nature of the inference to be drawn from such experiments, have already
been explained in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, 1868, pp. 440-
444.
    The deductions consist of      a comparison    of the evidence bearing on each
elementary substance,         beginning with      carbon,   hydrogen, and oxygen,
which were in the first instance determined by Landolt.              In the case of
some elements all the means        of calculation   lead to the same number  within
probable errors of experiment          ;  but in the case of others two or more

different equivalents are indicated.         Thus iron has one value in the ferrous
and another in the ferric salts ; and the more highly oxidized compounds
of sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic, and nitrogen give different numbers from
those given by their simpler combinations.               The refraction-equivalent of
potassium is estimated from a variety of sources, and the number thus
arrived at is employed for the calculation of the other metals that give
soluble salts, and for the radicals with which they are combined.

which the different determinations are not fairly accordant, are marked ?

   The specific refractive energy of a body is in some respects worthy of
more consideration than the refraction-equivalent, since, being only the
refractive index minus 1 divided by the density, it is a physical property
independent of chemical theories as to the atomic weight.                  Among
suggestive   facts are  noticed the extreme energy of hydrogen ; the existence
of pairs of analogous elements having the same, or nearly the same, energy,
— as  bromine and iodine, arsenic        and antimony, potassium and sodium,
manganese    and iron, nickel and cobalt     ; and that among the metals capable
of forming soluble     salts  there is some connexion between their power to
saturate the affinities of other elements, and their power to retard the rays
of light.

      by F. Sibson, M.D.            Received June 17, 1869.
                                     (Abstract.)
   The object of the investigation has been twofold.          First and chiefly, to
endeavour to ascertain minutely the course of the fibres by which the con
volutions of the hemisphere are connected with each other and with the
crus and central ganglia.
   Secondly, to endeavour to ascertain whether there is a constant similarity
between the corresponding sides of different brains as compared with the
opposite sides of the same brain ; and should this be the case, to endeavour to
trace the relation between       any anatomical    difference which might be dis
covered and such physiological difference as seems in the present state of
our knowledge to be indicated by the association of loss of the faculty of
language with disease of the left hemisphere rather than the right.
   The present communication relates almost exclusively to the first branch of
the investigation, and the method pursued has been to harden the brain by
prolonged immersion in strong spirit, by which the fibres are rendered per
fectly distinct and fairly tenacious, so that with care and patience their
course and arrangement may be accurately ascertained.
   Previous researches on the structure of the cerebrum have been mainly
directed to the examination of the course and distribution of the fibres
radiating from the crus and central ganglia, which have been assumed or
supposed to occupy ultimately the axis of every convolution, the different
convolutions being connected by fibres which crossed under the sulci from
one to another.      It is here shown that the commissural communication
                                                                     E 2

  between    different parts of the hemisphere is much more extensive than has
 hitherto    been described, and that the fibres more commonly run longitu
  dinally in the convolutions than cross from one to another, while large
 tracts of convolutions have no direct connexion with the crus, central
  ganglia, or corpus callosum.
     The preponderance of commissural over radiating fibres is indicated by
  a comparison of the sectional area of the latter as they issue from the
  central ganglia with the large surface of white matter displayed in the
  centrum ovale.       The dissection by which this is shown in detail is begun
  on the under surface     of the temporo- or occipito-sphenoidal lobe.
     In this lobe the fibres are almost entirely longitudinal in their general
  direction.     From near the apex fibres can be followed backwards in the
 two or three convolutions on the outer side of the gyrus uncinatus to near
 the centre of this surface of the lobe, where they end in the grey matter of
 a sort of lobule which I have ventured to call the collateral lobule.       From
 the collateral lobule other fibres pass to the convolutions at the occipital
 extremity of the lobe, to convolutions on its outer side and to the calcarine
 end of the uncinate gyrus.        These convolutions, comprising all those of the
 temporo-sphenoidal lobe except the gyrus uncinatus, the infra-marginal
 and parallel gyri, and the continuation of the two latter round the apex
 receive no fibres whatever from the crus, central ganglia or corpus callosum,
 but the ant. commissure spreads into them.
     Beneath these is a beautiful plane of fibres which forms the floor of the
 descending cornu of the lateral ventricle, except at the anterior end ; it
 forms the floor also of the ventricle at the entrance to the cornu, i. e. in the
 eminentia accessoria and of the posterior cornu ; but here fibres of the 0.
 callosum are mingled with those of the plane spoken of. This plane is
 formed as follows : along the axis of the lobe, in the hollow left by the
 removal of the superficial convolutions, runs a band of fibres from the apex
 to the posterior extremity ; anteriorly this band contains numerous fibres,
but in passing backwards they spread out towards the inner border of the
lobe into     a continuous lamina, which rests upon the lining membrane of
the ventricle and its cornua.        Some of the fibres run in the upper wall of
the calcarine fissure to the postero-parietal lobule, others form a layer in
the lower wall of this fissure, i. e. in the calcarine division of the gyros unci
natus.     The G. uncinatus remains as an elevation along the inner side of
the shallow valley resulting from the dissection described, little encroached
upon by it ; its superficial fibres, however, must be removed to display the
plane just mentioned. It incloses the cornu of the ventricle and the hippo
campus, and is thus not a solid mass.         Its fibres can be divided into two
layers, a superficial set, the general direction of which is from the outer or
collateral side anteriorly, backwards and inwards to the grey matter on its
flat surface ; and a deeper set, the fibres of which at the anterior part of
the gyrus, occupy its entire width, in passing backwards they converge, and
near the inner border have a twisted arrangement, the inner fibres passing

wall of the calcarine fissure, in which they pass to the posteroparietal
lobule and to the callosal gyrus.'
   The anterior enlarged extremity of the uncinate gyrus, sometimes called
the uncinate lobule, is connected by bands of fibres with various parts ; it
is very firmly adherent to the subjacent structures, and when torn away
leaves a patch of exposed grey matter, which has been named the internal
grey nucleus.      This is about in the same transverse line with the C.
albicans, a little to the outer side of the optic tract.
  By the removal of the uncinate lobule and gyrus fibres can be seen to
pass from the apex of the lobe forwards in the fasciculus uucinatus, back
wards and inwards along the roof of the cornu to the thalamus, and inwards
to the grey nucleus.
   On further dissection, which will consist in tracing the fibres from the
apex backwards to various parts, and in removing little by little more of the
convolutions along the outer edge of the lobe, and in a careful investigation
of the parts about the calcarine fissure, the following appearances will be
presented.
  Along the axis of the lobe      a          ridge with a slight convexity
                                      longitudinal
outwards, prominent posteriorly, subsiding anteriorly.  On its inner side,
from behind forwards, first the posterior iomu : next the outer wall of the
ventricle, where the cornua enter it ; this is formed by fibres curving
directly backwards into the ridge from the thalamus (also from crus and
corpus striatum, but more deeply), they are crossed transversely, however,
by a thin lamina of fibres from the under surface of the splenium, which
bend down from the roof of the ventricle and then curve forwards in the
ridge : next the posterior end of the thalamus, which bends forwards round
the crus, and gives off forwards from a pointed extremity the optic tract
and lamina? of fibres on the outer side of this, which run above the roof of
he cornu to the apex.      Anteriorly this longitudinal ridge is continuous
with the fasciculus uucinatus, and on its inner side are the internal grey
nucleus, and more anteriorly the anterior perforated space between which
the anterior commissure dips forwards and inwards in its canal.
   On the outer side of the ridge fibres may be seen to start at the edge of
the lobe, run inwards to the ridge, and curve forwards in     it, to leaveit
again on its oater or inner side, or to pass with     to the fasciculus un-
                                                     it
cinatus.
  A   bundle of fibres taken up from the posterior part of the ridge would
pass mainly to the thalamus   ; but some would proceed forwards in the
ridge, and either turn outwards to some part of the inframarginal gyrus
or apex, or inwards to the internal grey nucleus, or behind it. Others
again go on in the F. uncinatus.
  Fibres taken from the middle part of the ridge, and traced backwards,
would mostly curve outwards to some part of the outer edge of the lobe,

54                 Mr. W. H. Broadbent        on the Structure        [June 17,
 but some would go to the tip ; followed forwards, they spread out into a
thin fan, and pass to the various points already indicated.
    By repetition of this process the temporo-sphenoidal lobe will be
 exhausted, with the exception of a considerable lamina of fibres from the
posterior part of the inframarginal gyrus, which passes backwards             and
inwards to the end of the fissure of Sylvius, round which it curves into      the
supramarginal gyrus, and another large band from the posterior end of         the
parallel gyrus, which curves upwards and turns forwards in the axis of        the
parietal lobe close behind the fibres which curve upwards from the corpus
 callosum to the margin of the longitudinal fissure.
    It should be added that large bands of fibres run obliquely backwards in
 the parallel gyrus to the bottom of the sulcus of the same name, under
which they turn to the inframarginal gyrus.        When these are removed, the
 deep parallel sulcus is converted into   a deep  narrow valley.
    The fasciculus uncinatus, in the dissection just described, has been seen
to receive fibres from the occipital extremity of the hemisphere, and from
various convolutions along its outer side, occipital, annectent, angular,
parallel, and inframarginal ; fibres are traceable into it also from the
internal grey nucleus, these mostly lying beneath those from the convolu
tions, and it is probable that a few fibres from the thalamus and splenium
find their way into it. As it emerges from under the temporo-sphenoidal
lobe to cross the entrance to the fissure of Sylvius, it receives a considerable
contribution from the overhanging apex of this lobe, and some from the
uncinate lobule.     Its general direction is forwards ; but a superficial set of
fibrse mainly from the apex of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe, passes inward
as well as forwards, and spreads out mainly to the edge      of the longitudinal
fissure, passing under the olfactory sulcus ; another lamina appears from
beneath the edge of this, having a still more transverse direction, and its
fibres go to the rostrum corporis callosi, and to the callosal gyrus, detaching
the pointed origin of this convolution from the anterior perforated space.
The fibres passing directly- forwards spread out under the orbital convolu
tions to end in the grey matter around the edge of this lobule, some of the
more superficial turning into one or two of the gyri at its posterior and
outer margin.     Deeper fibres run outwards as well as forwards, beneath the
convolutions of the island of Reil to the posterior part of the inferior
frontal gyrus ; this is a tract of considerable size.
   The convolutions of the orbitar lobule being entirely superficial to the
radiating fibres of the fasciculus uncinatus, must be added to those ou the
under surface of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe as belonging to the class
which have no direct central communications.
    To this class also must be added, with a reservation to be noted presently,
 the gyri operti of the island.     The summit and the anterior convolutions
rest upon the part of the F. uncinatus which passes to the outer corner of
 the orbitar lobule and the third frontal gyrus, and the fibres arising in the
 grey matter of this portion of the island curve forwards across the fissure to

    1869.]                     of the  Cerebral Hemispheres.                          55
    the same convolutions      ;  the corner  of the orbital lobule in fact is carried
   away entirely by the fibres from the fasciculus and island.            In the same
   way   fibres  starting   in  the  remaining   convolutions  of the island   cross the
   fissure and turn up in the supramarginal gyrus, leaving the outer surface of
   the C. striatum perfectly smooth, and converting the Sylvian fissure into a
   deep wide valley.       The wall of the C. striatum thus exposed consists of a
   lamina of fibres, which radiate in all directions from a small patch of grey
   matter laid bare at the middle and highest point of the eminence this
   ganglion forms as seen from this aspect ; and it is possible that there may
   be here some sort of continuity or connexion between the grey matter of the
   C. striatum and the overlying part of the convolutions of the island.
  Except at this point, the convolutions are separated from the C. striatum
  by a very distinct plane of fibres.
      The gyri operti are thus connected            mainly with the supramarginal
  gyrus     and  its continuation     along  the  anterior wall of the fissure.    Some
   fibres, however, pass from the grey matter of the overhanging inframarginal
  gyrus near the apex into the corresponding part of the island, and about
  the grey nucleus exposed at the summit of the C. striatum deep fibres from
 the posterior extremity of the hemisphere and from the F. uncinatus seem
 to join both the nucleus and the overlying grey matter of the island.
      The temporo-sphenoidal lobe having been gradually removed, and with
 it a great part of the occipital lobe, a stage of the dissection is reached at
 which the distribution of the fibres of the splenium C. callosi and the rela
  tions of the cms and central ganglia, as seen from the under aspect, may
 be conveniently described.
      On the inferior surface of the posterior extremity of the C. callosum is
 seen a transverse flattened elevation, which may be compared to the
 rostrum at the anterior extremity on a smaller scale and adherent to the
 body of the great commissure. It would thus be looked upon as a re
 curved part of the C. callosum.           In the middle line it is adherent, but the
 fibres it sends transversely outwards leave the C. callosum proper, and
 bend downwards so as to cross the floor of the ventricle instead of the roof ;
 they pass to the hippocampus major and minor, which they contribute to
 form, and run across the eminentia accessoria, and along the floor of the
posterior cornu.
      The hippocampus minor is formed by the projection into the posterior
 cornu of the bottom of the calcarine fissure ; but an incision through the
 bottom of the fissure into the cornu would not split up the hippocampus,
 but would      leave   it attached entire to the upper wall of the cornu. The
 fibres from the splenium, which contribute to the formation of the hippo
 campus minor, run longitudinally along it immediately beneath the lining
 membrane of the ventricle, and when reached by dissection from without
 present a delicate lamina in the form of a groove between two curved
 tracts passing backwards to the posterior extremity of the hemisphere,
the upper from the C. callosum proper, the lower from its recurved
process.

56                 Mr. W. H. Broadbent          on the Structure          [June  17,
    The hippocampus major may be briefly described as u curved groove or
" gutter "    (Gratiolet) of fibres, the upper border of which is formed by the
posterior pillar of the fornix, while the lower is concealed by the gyrus
uncinatus, the grey matter of which folds over it into the groove, and
after reaching the bottom bends up the other wall for a short distance,
forming the plicated
                           " C. fimbriatum," or " Pli godronne." The outer
surface of the case of fibres is smooth, and for the most part free in the de
scending cornu ; it adheres to the inferior wall formed by the plane of
fibres previously described, but can easily be detached.          The course of the
fibres forming the case or groove is from the lower edge backwards and
upwards round the convexity to the upper edge, where they pass into the
pillar of the fornix, or where the hippocampus joins the Bplenium, into
the recurved process. Further details are given iu the paper itself.
    The fibres crossing the floor of the ventricle curve forward, apparently
towards the apex,        but are   too few to be followed absolutely         to their
termination.
    From the body of the C. callosum,       at its posterior part, the fibres mostly
radiate backwards and outwards into the cuneus and occipital lobe generally ;
but a considerable number on the under surface bend from the roof of the
ventricle down its outer wall,        across   the longitudinal fibres from the
thalamus,    &c, and curve forwards in the ridge.          A considerable propor
tion of these has been traced to the internal grey nucleus, others seem to
pass forwards to the grey matter near the apex of the temporo-sphenoidal
lobe.
   The relations of the crus and great central ganglia may be described as
follows.    The crus, as it plunges into the hemisphere, is encircled on its
inferior aspect by the optic tract ; it then expands into a large fan of
fibres, the edges of which are antero-posterior, the surfaces obliquely up
wards and inwards, and downwards and outwards.              The two great ganglia,
the C. striatum and thalamus may be said to sit astride the anterior and
posterior edge respectively of the fan, each having an intra- and extraveu-
tricular part, the C. striatum being much the larger, and situate above, as
well as in front of the thalamus.
   When the optic tract is      removed, the groove in which it rests is seen to
present   fibres  having    the  same general direction rouud the crus ; tbey
have been called by Gratiolet "l'anse du pedoncle," a term which may be
translated by the expression " the collar of the crus."          The most conspi
cuous part of the collar consists of fibres from the thalamus, which curve
forward round the crus to end in the tuber cinereum, or run up in the
wall of the third ventricle to the velum interpositum, &c.             Within this
fibres are seen to turn forwards from the posterior border of both crust and
tegment of the crus, to end in the C. striatum, and auteriorly a consider
able mass of fibres from the tegmentum curves with a bold sweep round the
edge of the crust, and passes backwards and outwards into this same
ganglion.

1869.]                    of the   Cerebral Hemispheres.                                57
                        part of the thalamus is seen in the descending
    The extra-ventricular
cornu curving round the crus.  From its anterior pointed extremity it is
continued onwards by the optic tract, and it sends fibres, — 1. Forwards in
the collar of the crus.                 and outwards to the convolutions
                               2. Forwards
about the apex in a succession of laminae, the deeper fibres passing more
outwards than the superficial sets, and emerging from under them along
the outer edge of the roof of the cornu.   3. From under the fibres which
pass forwards, it sends backwards a large mass along the outer wall of the
ventricle and posterior cornu to the occipital end of the hemisphere.
   The extraventricular corpus striatum has been exposed on two sides ; it
forms a very large mass, and has a large rounded anterior end, while pos
teriorly it narrows to      a tail-like
                                  extremity.   The outer aspect forms an
elongated eminence, rising out of the Sylvian valley, highest at the centre,
subsiding towards each end ; at the summit is the external grey nucleus,
from which radiate fibres forwards, backwards, and outwards.          Those
passing forwards form a large bundle ; they spread out into a fan, and
proceed mainly to the third frontal convolution ; those passing backwards
accompany the fibres from the thalamus to the occipital extremity of the
hemisphere;  those passing outwards with varying degrees of obliquity
descend the wall of the ganglion to the Sylvian valley ; but instead of
crossing it to the convolutions on the other side, as might be expected
from the apparent continuity of the walls and floor, dip between the fibres
of the floor, which are the radiating fibres of the crus issuing from the
C. striatum, and    pass to convolutions         in the frontal lobe.        A   remarkable
fact respecting the planes of radiating fibres which form the limiting wall
of the C. striatum on this aspect          is,
                                       that the fibres all seem to have their
origin in the small patch of grey matter here called the external grey
nucleus, and they come off clean from the mass of soft grey matter forming
the body of the ganglion.
   On the under surface of the C. striatum, which        flat, are seen the
                                                                is
internal grey nucleus and the anterior perforated space, between which the
anterior commissure passes outwards and backwards from the ventricle in
a  distinct canal to emerge on this surface. The external grey nucleus also
appears in the outer border, and     about in the same transverse line as the
                                          is
C. albicans and internal grey nucleus, from which last                  is
                                                              only separated
                                                                  it
by   narrow
     a       band of  longitudinal fibres.  Here  again the planes  of fibres,
which form the limiting wall of the ganglion, end in the grey nuclei, and
seem     to have   uo communication with the mass of soft grey matter they
inclose.
    The anterior      of the fan-like expansion of the crus emerges from
                   edge
the large end of the C. striatum, and, properly speaking, divides the
intra-ventricular C. striatum from the extra-ventricular division  the an         ;
terior perforated space, being on the inner side of the radiating fibres,
 belongs to the former.
   Before the dissection of the fronto-parietal portion of the hemisphere                 is

  58               On  the Structure of the Cerebral Hemispheres.       [June  17,
   described, a brief account is given of the intraventricular      thalamus and
  C. striatum.
     When the      teenia semicircularis  is removed, and the     edge  of the C.
  striatum pushed back, large rounded cords of fibres are seen radiating
  outwards in all directions from the thalamus with the fibres of the crus,
  posteriorly slender flat bands of fibres curve backwards from the narrow
  ing extremity of the C. striatum to dip down between them (together with
  fibres apparently belonging to the taenia) ; they can be traced through the
  fan of radiating fibres to the extraventricular C. striatum.      Anteriorly the
  soft grey matter of the C. striatum fills the spaces between the diverging
  cords ; but no distinct origin of fibres in the mass of grey matter is here
  met with.
     The plan of construction of the frontoparietal portion of the hemisphere
  seems to be as follows    : —
     The C. callosum divides into two main planes of fibres, one of which
 turns up to the margin of the great longitudinal fissure, the other passes
  onward to the supramarginal gyrus of the fissure of Sylvius.        The radiat
 ing central fibres approach the under surface of these at the acute angle,
 and pass obliquely between them before the ascending and descending
 planes have well separated from each other, the central as well as the
 callosal fibres going mainly to the margins of the hemisphere.         An angle
 is thus left along the axis of the frontal and parietal lobes, which is occupied
 by a vast longitudinal system of fibres, some of which have already been
 mentioned as entering this part of the hemisphere from the temporo-sphe-
 noidal lobe.      Large bands turn upwards and then forwards from the
 parallel   and   angular gyri, that from the parallel gyrus running forward
 close behind the ascending callosal lamina; other fibres turn forwards
 from the annectent gyri, and more anteriorly from the posteroparietal lobule ;
 Still furtherforwards some of these fibres coming from behind bend upwards,
and end in the parietal convolutions ; while others start in the same gyri,
and pass forwards, the principle of construction being apparently simple,
but the details extremely intricate.        At the decussation the central and
callosal fibres are worn into a compact inextricable mass, and the difficulty
of following the different sets is increased by the fact that the central
fibres are not transverse      in direction like those of the C. callosum, but
mostly very oblique backwards or forwards, as may best be seen by exa
mining the bands radiating under the C. striatum from the thalamus ;
this necessitates corresponding obliquity in the fissures through which the
central fibres penetrate the C. callosum.        A few fibres from the under
surface of the C. callosum turn inwards to the centres ; but the statement
of Gratiolet that all the fibres of this commissure       can be traced from the
central radiations on one side to the convolutions          on the other, is not
confirmed.
    The detailed dissection of the parieto-frontal convolutions need not be
given here.      It will be sufficient to mention that the posteroparietal and

supramarginal lobules are connected by numerous bands of fibres, that the
ascending parietal gyri have central and callosal fibres entering their extre
mities, the middle portion receiving comparatively few ; the first, however,
sometimes       called the ascending frontal gyrus, seems to have numerous
fibres from the centres and C. callosum along its entire length.              The
second frontal convolution sends bands of fibres obliquely to the two
others, and has fewer radiating fibres than they have. When it is removed,
fibres can be traced transversely across the valley left from the first to the
third.
     A few additional particulars are given respecting the arrangement and
course of the fibres in the callosal and marginal gyri on the internal surface
of the hemisphere, and the contrast between the thalamus and C. striatum
as to structure and relations is pointed out, the thalamus sending large
 masses of fibres in every direction, chiefly with the radiating crus, the
corpus striatum consisting of soft grey matter enclosed in fibrous planes
which arise in the comparatively small grey nuclei, and have apparently no
communication with the main body of the ganglion.              The thalamus again
does not seem to receive terminating ascending fibres, while both divisions
of the crus give off numerous fibres, which            are seen to end  in the C.
striatum.
     The  differences   in naked-eye appearances indicate differences in the rela
 tions between     cells and fibres in the two ganglia, the exact nature of which
 can be ascertained only by the microscope.
XXVI. " On          the Rhizopodal Fauna of the Deep Sea."          By William
        B. Carpenter, M.D., V.P.R.S.              Received June 17, 1869.
                                      (Abstract.)
   . The Author commences by referring to the knowledge of the Rhizopo
 dal Fauna of the Deep Sea which has been gradually acquired by the
 examination of specimens of the bottom brought up by the Sound
 ing-apparatus ; and states that whilst this method of investigation has
 made known the vast extent and diffusion of Foraminiferal life at great
 depths, — especially in the case of Globigerina-mud, which has been proved
 to cover a large part of the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, — it has
 not added any new Generic types to those discoverable in comparatively shal
 low waters. With the exception of a few forms, which, like Globigerina,
 find their most congenial home, and attain their greatest development, at
 great depths, the general rule has seemed to be that Foraminifera are pro
  gressively dwarfed in proportion to increase of depth, as they are by a
  change from a warmer to a colder climate ; those which are brought up from
  great depths in the Equatorial region bearing a much stronger resemblance
  to those of the colder-temperate, or even of the Arctic seas, than to
  the littoral forms of their own region.
     The Author then refers to the recent researches of Prof. Huxley upon

 60                 Dr. \V. B. Carpenter       on the  Rhizopodal        [June 17,
 the indefinite protoplasmic expansion which he names Bathybius, and which
 seems to extend itself over the ocean-bottom under great varieties of depth
 and temperature, as among the most important of the results obtained by
 the Sounding-apparatus.
     By the recent extension of Dredging-operations,           however, to depths
 previously considered beyond their reach, very important additions have
 been made to the Foraminiferal Fauna of the Deep Sea.                  Several new
 generic types have been discovered,           aud new and remarkable varieties
 of types previously known have presented themselves.             It is not a little
 curious that all the new types belong to the Family Lituolida, — con
 sisting of Foraminifera which do not form a calcareous shell, but construct
 a  " test" by the agglutination of sand-grains, — which       was first constituted
                                         '
 as a distinct group in the author's       Introduction to the Study of the Fora
 minifera'   (1862).    The  first  set of specimens described seems referable to
 the Genus Proteonina of Prof. Williamson ; but the test, instead of being
 composed (as in his specimens) of sand-grains, is constructed of sponge-
 spicules, cemented together with great regularity, so as to form tubes,
 which are either fusiform or cylindrical, being in the former case usually
 more or less curved, and in the latter generally straight.           Of the genus
 Trochammina (Parker and Jones), many examples were found of consider
 able  size,  resembling Nodosarians in their free moniliform growth, but
 having    their  tests constructed of sand-grains very firmly cemented to
 gether, with an intermxure of fragments of sponge-spicules, which give a
hispid character to the surface. — The Genus Rhabdammina of Prof. Sars
is based on a species (the R. abyssorum) first obtained in his Son's dredg-!
ings, of which the test is very regularly triradiate, sometimes quadrira-
 diate, and is composed of sand-grains very regularly arranged, and firmly
united by a ferruginous cement.           Not only was this type represented by
numerous specimens in the         '
                                    Lightning' dredgings, but another yet more
considerable collection was formed of irregularly radiating and branching
tubes, which are composed of an admixture of sand-grains and sponge-
spicules, united by ferruginous cement.             These seem to originate in a
"primordial chamber" of the same material, which extends itself into a
tube that afterwards branches indefinitely.           This type may be designated
                  —
R. irregularis. Of the protean Genus Lituola (Lamarck), a large form
was met with, which bears a strong resemblance to the L. Soldani of the
Sienna Tertiaries.      Its nearly cylindrical test is composed of sand-grains
very loosely aggregated together, forming a thick wall ; and its cavity is
divided by septa of the same material into a succession of chambers,
arranged in rectilineal series, each having a central orifice prolonged into
a short tube. — The Genus Astrorhizcis instituted a few years ago by Dr.
0. Sandahl, was represented by a wide range of forms, referable to two prin
cipal types, — the one an oblate spheroid, with irregular radiating prolonga

its thick arenaceous        test is exactly the same as that of the test of the
Lituola found on the         same bottom ; but its cavity is undivided, and there
is no proper orifice, the pseudopodial extensions having apparently found
their way out between the sand-grains that formed the termination of the
radiating extensions or digitations. — The Genua Saccamina (Sars) is cha
 racterized by a very regular spherical test, built up of large angular sand-
 grains strongly united by ferruginous cement, which are so arranged as to
 form a wall-surface        well   smoothed Qff externally, whilst its interior is
 roughened by their angular projections.            The cavity is undivided, and is
  furnished with a single orifice, which is surrounded by a tubular pro
 longation of the test, giving to the whole the aspect of a globular flask.
       The family Miliolida, consisting of Porcellanous-shelled Foraminifera,
  was represented at the depth of 530 fathoms by a Cornuspira foliacea of
  extraordinary size ; and at the depth of 650 fathoms by a series of Bilocu-
  lince, of dimensions not elsewhere seen except in tropical or subtropical regions.
       Of the family Globigerinida a considerable number of forms presented
  themselves     ;  but with the exception of the ordinary Glohigerina and Orbu-
  lina,    these   were not remarkable either for number or size. The Globi-
  gerina-mud brought up in large masses by the Dredge, exhibited the same
  composition as had been previously determined by the examination of Sound
  ings ; but it included a large amount of animal life of higher types, whilst
  it  seemed everywhere permeated by the protoplasmic         Bathybhts of Huxley,
  as described     in the Author-s  " Preliminary Report." The Globigerince vary
  enormously in size ; and the Author gives reason for the belief that this
  variation is not altogether the result of growth, but that many small as well
   as large individuals have (speaking generally) attained their full dimensions.
   He describes the sarcodic body obtained by the decalcification of the
   shell  ;  and discusses   the question whether (as some suppose) Orbulina is
   the reproductive segment of Globigerina, as to which he inclines to a
   negative conclusion. He describes the curious manner in which the shells
   of Globigerinx      are worked-up   into cases for Tubicolar Annelids  ; of which
   cases several different types presented themselves,      the Foraminiferal  shells
   in some of them being combined with sponge-spicules. — A remarkably fine
    specimen of Textularia was met with alive, of which the porous shell was
    encased    by sand-grains   ; this being laid open by section showed the sar
    codic body of an olive-greenish hue, corresponding with that of the
    Lituolce and Astrorhiztz also found alive.— Several Rotaline types pre
    sented themselves sparingly in the Globigerina-mud,          which are specially
    characteristic of the Cretaceous Formation.
        The family Lagenida was represented not merely by its smaller forms,
    hut also by a large and beautiful living Cristellaria, that closely corre
     sponds with one of the forms described by Fichtel and Moll from the
     Siennese Tertiaries, whilst even exceeding it in dimensions.
        These results conclusively show that reduction in the Size of Foraminifera

 62              Capt. Herschel on Spectroscopic Observations            [June 17,
 cannot be attributed to increase of Pressure        ; since the examples of Cornu-
 spira, Biloculina, and Cristellaria found at depths exceeding 500 fathoms,
 vrerefar larger than any that are known to exist in the shallower waters of
 the colder temperate zone.         But as these all occurred in the warm area,
 whose bottom-temperature indicates a movement of water from the Equa
 torial towards the Polar region, it is probable that their size is related to
 the temperature of their habitat, which is found to be in like relation to
the general character of the Fauna of which they formed part.               On the
 other hand, as we now know that the climate of the deepest parts of the
ocean- bottom,     even   in Equatorial regions, has often (if not universally)
Arctic   coldness,   the dwarfing of the abyssal Foraminifera of those regions
is fully accounted for on the same principle.
    Besides these examples of new or remarkable forms of Foraminifera, the
'
  Lightning- dredgings yielded some peculiar bodies, the examination of
which would seem to throw light upon the obscure question of the mode
of Reproduction in this group. One set of these are cysts, of various
shapes    and sizes, composed of sand-grains loosely aggregated, as in the
tests of Lituola and Astrorhiza ; which, when broken open, are found to
be filled  with aggregations of minute yellow spherules, not enclosed in any
distinct envelope.      These are supposed by the Author to be reproductive
gemmules formed by the segmentation of the sarcodic body of a Rhizo-
                                  '            -
pod, in the same manner as zoospores             are formed in Protophytes by the
segmentation of their eudochrome.            Of such segmentation he formerly
described indications in the sarcodic body of Orbitolites ; and corre
sponding phenomena have been witnessed by Prof. Max Schulze.                 But in
another set of cysts, of similar materials but of firmer structure, bodies
are found having all the characters of ova, with embryos in various stages
of development.        In none of    these,  however, does the embryo present
characters sufficiently distinctive to enable its nature to be determined j
and the hypothesis of the Foraminiferal origin of these bodies chiefly rests
upon the conformity in the structure of the wall of the cysts with that of
the tests of Lituola and Astrorhiza, and upon the improbability that such
cysts should have been constructed by animals of any higher type.

also a segment of the true limb, whose light is scattered up and down.  It
is wanting in C-light, and therefore within the C-image of the slit is seen a
dark segment of the sun-s limh, an inversion which nothing but " lumino-

    On the 10th I remarked (and observed till perfectly certain) that the C-
line on the disk varied sensibly in strength ; and at one place, which, I be
lieve, corresponded to the penumbra of a spot-group, near the limb there
was a total absence of the line, and a
strong suspicion of a reversal (fig. 2).
Faculee were noticed round about,
especially between the group and
limb   j  but there was nothing of the
kind visible where the hiatus in
the C-llne seemed to indicate.        The
hiatus extended, as did also the sus
pected    bright part within the spot-
sp.   (a).
    The observation    was repeated     on
the 11th (yesterday) with the same
result, except that the bright part of
the line was not noticed. To-day
(the 12th) the spot was round the
corner.     On no other spot examined
was anything so decided seen, but the suppression        of the dark line has been
more than suspected elsewhere.
    Lastly, I detected to-day, and put beyond doubt, that the bright accu
mulations on the disk (which I believe are the so-called "faculoe") give a
 continuous spectrum !     I first noticed that every now and then there were
 hright streaks up and down the spectrum as the slit passed over the
disk (or vice vend). It is no easy thing in general to identify certainly the
 exact   source  of light whose    spectrum you see ; but in one case      I had a
spot near the limb, and one     of  these luminous streaks between the two ; so,
 knowing the direction of the slit, it was easy, on removing the spectroscope,
 to determine precisely from what point of the disk the light in question
emanated. In this case it was clear that it proceeded from a facula in that
region.
     I do not pretend to speculate on the constitution of the sun's surface,
 but here are three facts which require explanation : —
    (1) A luminous line in the envelope corresponds with no visible line of
  absorption in the solar spectrum.
    (2) The absorption is absent in an (apparently) penumbra1 .egion,
     (3) The facula spectrum is an intensified solar spectrum.

  fitted up for the eclipse ; but      I  have increased the dispersion nearly three
  fold by inserting four compound prisms (extracted from the hand-spectro
  scopes). These amount to 7 inches of glass and sixteen surfaces ; so you
  may imagine that there is some loss of light and definition.                I have also
  had to shorten the focal distance (and therefore diminish the magnifying-
  power) by interposing a hand-telescope's object-glass — an additional ob
  struction and complication.         I  lost a great deal of fine weather (of which     I
  get very little now) while trying to perfect this arrangement.                I can still
 further   increase   the dispersion (without much loss of definition for mono
 chromatic light) by turning the main prism, and so departing from the po
 sition of minimum deviation.             But this is a resource which      I  keep to go
                   I
 on with when tire of the advantage I have gained already.
      The long train of compound prisms (as at present arranged) unfortunately
 bars me from the violet end of the spectrum.                This is unfortunate, as it
 would be in the highest degree interesting to compare the a and y images.
              I
 Some day shall get impatient, pull the whole affair to pieces, and arrange
 afresh with this object.        As it is,     I have to be very chary of quitting
 beaten ground,      as we boast   of  no  instrument-makers       here !
     I wish I had    time to write fully and connectedly on the subject,             Jt is
only necessary     to put people      on the track.      It is one easily followed, and
 will amply repay any expenditure in arranging prisms to get                 a  maximum
 dispersion, for there is any amount of light.

     The length of the coil from end to end          is 9 feet  10  inches, and the dia
meter 2 feet     ;   the whole is cased in ebonite ; it stands on two strong
pillars covered with ebonite, the feet of the pillars being 22 inches in
diameter. The ebonite tubes &c. are the largest ever constructed at Silver-
Town Works.
     The total weight of     the great coil is 15 cwt., that        of the ebonite  alone
being 477 pounds.
     I am indebted to    Mr. Apps for the following details. The primary wire
is made of copper of the highest conductivity, and weighs 145 lbs. j the
diameter of this wire is "0925 of an inch, and the length 3770 yards. The
number of revolutions of the primary wire round the core of soft iron is
6000, its arrangement being 3, 6, and 12 strands.

     The total   resistance of the primary is 2*201400 British Association units ;
and the resistances       of the primary conductors are, respectively, for three
strands 733800        B.A.U., six -366945 B.A.U., twelve -1834725 B.A.U.

the combined wires is 4 inches, and their weight is 1 23 lbs.
  The secondary wire is 150 miles in length; it is covered with silk
throughout; and the average diameter is -015 of an inch.
   The total weight of this wire is 606 lbs., and the resistance 33,560 B. A.
units.  The insulation throughout is greater by 95 per cent, than the strain
upon the coil during its action. The secondary wire is insulated from the
primary by means of an ebonite tube £ an inch in thickness and 8 feet in
length.
     The length of the        secondary   coil is 54 inches, the diameter is 19 inches,
and, without the internal ebonite tube containing the primary wire and                     iron
core, it is a hollow cylinder inches in diameter and 6 inches thick.

   The condenser, made in the usual manner with sheets of varnished paper
and   tinfoil, is arranged in six parts, each containing 125 superficial feet,
 or 750 square feet of tinfoil in the whole.
    A large and substantially made Contact-breaker, detached from the
 great coil and worked by an independent electromagnet, was constructed,
 and worked very well with a comparatively moderate power of 10 or 20
 large Bunsen's cells ; when, however, the battery was increased to 30 or 40
 cells, it became unmanageable.
    A Foucault break, with the platinum amalgam and alcohol above was                    it,
 now tried, and answered very much better than the ordinary contact-
 breaker   :there was no longer any burning or destruction of the contact
 points, although the great power of the instrument appeared to cause con
 tinued decomposition in the water of the alcohol placed above the platinum
 amalgam, and the spirit was frequently ejected, probably                by
                                                             explosion of the
 mixed gases taking place in the amalgam, in which they collected in bubbles                   ;
 the alcohol took fire constantly, and had to be extinguished.      large and     A
 very  strong glass  vessel (in fact the inverted glass cell of a bichromate
 battery) was bored through, and the neck fitted into    cap with cement, a

 thick wire covered with platinum being inserted in the cap the platinum      ;
 amalgam was poured on this, and over     pint of alcohol

 was also very large, and pointed with  thick stud of platinum, and, being
                                                 a
 attached to   spring, contact was easily made and broken.

 ejection of the spirit, which no longer took fire. This break was used for
  eight hours in   continuous series of experiments.

     The Bunsen's battery used in the experiments was made with the largest
  porous cells that could be obtained, and each cell contained about one pint
  of nitric acid, the immersed carbon being              50 superficial inches    in   each cell.

   The longest spark yet obtained          is therefore 29 inches in length.
   In order to ascertain whether any variation in the                size of the condenser
(of which,    as   already  stated,  1,2,  3,  4, 5, or   6   parts  could   be used) would
affect the length of the spark, a number of experiments were tried ; and it
will be noticed in the tabulated results that when half the condenser was
used the spark increased in length up to 20 cells, but not after. The experi
ment of dividing the condenser and using one half led to a very serious
accident, and the coil was rendered useless for a time by the destruction of
the insulating material of a part of the primary coil ; the particular strands
affected threw out minute spicula of metal, which communicated with
each other, and the battery-current, instead of passing through 1257 yards,
now only traversed a very short length.              The accident, however, proved to
be useful, inasmuch as it showed that the coil could be easily taken to
pieces and repaired in a comparatively short space of time.                   In the annexed

     It
      is evident that no material advantage was obtained by the above
arrangement except in the first experiment ; and even where three groups
were connected, as in the last experiment, a decrease in the length of the
spark is observed when compared with the 45 or 50 cells arranged for
intensity, the difference being as 20 to 28.
   The spark obtained from the large coil presents some novel and curious
features.        It   isthick and flame-like in its           appearance,   and therefore       it will
be alluded to         as the " flaming spark."
      When the discharging-point and circular plate are brought within 6 or
7    inches of each other, the flaming nature of the spark becomes still more
apparent.
     Two light yellow              flames curving upwards appear to connect the opposite
poles.      If   a blast           of air from powerful bellows is directed against the
flaming spark, the flaming portion can be blown away and increased in
area ; and thin wiry sparks are now seen darting through     sometimes in       it,
one continuous stream, at another time divided into three or more sparks,
all following the direction in which the flame    blown.          is
   The heat of this       very great, and,
                                   is                       if
                                             passed through asbestos (sup
ported on an insulating pillar), quickly causes the latter to become red-hot.

                                                                  a

  spark in a vertical line and in considerable quantities, the greater part of
  the light is obscured, and the whole form of the flaming spark presents the
  appearance of a black cloud with a line of brightly ignited particles frin
  ging the lower parts.    If the charcoal is dusted through in small quantities,
  each particle becomes ignited, like charcoal blown into a hydrogen-flame.
      When the flaming spark is directed on to a glass plate upon which a
  little solution of lithium chloride is placed, the latter colours the flame
  upwards to the height of 3 or 4 inches in the most beautiful manner ; and
  if  the point of the discharge is tipped with paper or sponge moistened
  with a little solution of sodium chloride, the two colours (the yellow from
  the salt and the crimson from the lithium) meet each other, a neutral
  point being found about halfway, thus illustrating apparently the dual cha
  racter of electricity, and that + passes to — electricity, and vice vend.
     The flaming spark can be obtained in perfectly dry air.
     Whilst passing through common air, if blown against       a sheet of damp
 litmus-paper, the latter is rapidly changed red.         In order to ascertain
 whether the acid product was nitric acid, the flaming spark (9 or 10 inches
in length) was passed through a tube connected by a cork and bent tube
with a bottle containing distilled water, from which another tube passed to
the air-pump ; on drawing the air slowly over the spark, and passing the
former into the bottle, nitric acid was obtained in large quantities — so much
so that it could be detected by the smell and taste as well as by the ordinary
tests.    The popular notion that nitric    acid is always produced during a
thunder-storm would therefore appear to be correct.          To determine the
effect of a cooling surface on the flaming spark, a hole one inch and a half
in diameter was bored through a thick block of Wenham-lake ice, and the
spark passed through the air in the tube of ice    ; uo change took place, and
the spark was still a flaming one.

70                      Mr.  J. H. Pepper   on some     Experiments      [June 17,
   When the spark was received on the ice, it lost its flaming character,
and became thin and wiry, spreading out in all directions.
    If  the discharging-wires were tipped with ice, the spark was always
flaming when any thickness of air intervened between them.               Even over
the ice,    if  the spark passed a fraction of an inch above the surface,      it was
always     a  flaming one, but changed to the thin spark when the point        of the
discharging-wire was thrust into the ice.
    If one    of the discharging-wires of the great coil is brought to the centre of
a large swing looking-glass and the other wire connected with the amalgam
at the back, the sparks are thin and wiry, arborescent, and very bright (see
figure, p. 69), the crackling noise of these discharges being quite different
from that of the heavy thud or blow delivered by the flaming spark.
    When the discharging-wire is brought close to the frame of the looking-
glass, or if a sufficient thickness of air intervenes, the spark again becomes
flaming ; or, as sometimes occurs, if the discharging wire is placed about
 5 inches from the frame, the spark is partly flaming and partly wiry, i. e.
 when it impinges on the glass.
    The examination of the flaming spark with the spectroscope has not as
 yet settled anything definitely.        The spectrum is a continuous one with the
 sodium-line. When the blast of air is used, and the wiry sparks made ap
 parent, then the nitrogen line appears.
    The flaming spark has been ascribed by some experienced observers to
 the incandescence        of the dust in the air,  and especially sodium chloride.
     If the salt    &c. is thus made hot, can the air in which it is mechanically
 diffused remain cool       ?
    Is not the salt &c. in the same condition as a platinum- wire held in the
 non-luminous        part of the hot burnt gas escaping from the chimney of an
 Argand       burner   ?
     Will gaseous elements when combining (and in this case the nitrogen
 and oxygen do unite, as proved by the formation of nitric acid) give a con
 tinuous spectrum ?
     To ascertain whether the " flaming spark " could be obtained with                a
  small number of cells, the large Bunsen's battery was reduced to 3 cells            ;
  and it was found that no appreciable spark could be produced when the
  whole primary wire was used with less than 5 cells.
      By reducing the length of the primary wire, and using the           4 divisions
  separately, the following results were arrived at          :—
                                          5 cells.

    If  the two wires from the secondary coil are placed in water, no spark
is perceptible, even when they are brought very close together, until they
touch.
    If the negative     wire is passed through a cork, on which a glass tube (a
lamp-glass)     is  fixed   containing a depth of 5 inches of water, and the
positive wire is brought within half an inch of the surface of the water in
the tube, it becomes red-hot; and if drawn further away from the surface,
the upper part of the tube is filled with a peculiar glow or light abounding
in Stokes-s rays.
    The experiments with the vacuum-tubes, and especially Gassiot-s cascade,
are, as might be expected, very beautiful.              When a coal-gas vacuum-tube
of considerable      diameter,   and  conveying      the   full discharge from the se
condary coil, is supported over a powerful                  electromagnet    axially, the
 discharge is condensed and heat is produced.
    If placed   equatorially, the heat increases greatly ; the discharge is con
 densed and impinges upon the sides          of the glass tube, which becomes too
 hot to touch ; and if the experiment had been continued too long, no doubt
 the tube would have cracked.
    The enormous quantity of electricity of high tension which the coil
 evolves when connected       with a battery of 40 cells, is shown by the rapidity
 with which it will charge a Leyden battery.
    Under favourable circumstances, three contacts with the mercurial break
will charge 40      square feet  of glass.

 72                        Mr. W. II. L. Russell on the Mechanical                                  [June 17,
     Mr. Gassiot          was present on one occasion,             and particularly observed with
mvself the rapidity with which a series of 1 2 large Leyden jars arranged
in cascade were discharged.   The noise was great ; and each time the
spark (which was very condensed and brilliant) struck the metallic disk,
the latter emitted a ringing sound, as if it had received a sharp blow from
a small hammer.
   The discharges were made from a point to a metallic disk ; and when the
former was positive the dense spark measured from 18| to 18| inches, and
fell to 8^ inches when the metallic plate was positive and the point
negative.
     A variations of the Leyden-jar experiments                      was tried, by connecting the
coil worked          by a quantity battery          of    25   +   25 cells with   six Leyden jars
arranged in cascade              ; and the spark obtained measured               8| inches.
     The    same         six   jars connected with the coil when the 50 cells were
arranged continuously                for intensity gave a spark of         12   inches of very great
density and brilliancy.
  Other experiments are being tried with the great coil, the results of
which will be duly brought before the Society if thought of sufficient
importance.

and   prominences without        spots ; but I do not say that a spot is not ac
companied by     a prominence at some stage of its life, or that it does not re
sult from some action which, in the majority of cases, is accompanied
by a prominence.
    III. At times, when a prominence is seen bright on the sun itself, the
bright   F line varies considerably, both in thickness and brilliancy, within
the thickness of the dark line. The appearances presented are exactly as if
we were looking at the prominences through a grating.
    IV. Bright prominences, when seen above spots on the disk, if built up
of other substances besides hydrogen, are indicated by the bright lines of
those substances in addition to the lines of hydrogen.            The bright lines are
then seen very thin, situated centrally (or nearly so) on the broad absorp
tion-bands caused by the underlying less-luminous vapours of the same
substances.
        I
    V. have at last detected an absorption-line corresponding to the orange
line in the chromosphere.         Father Secchi states * that there is a line cor
responding to it much brighter than the rest of the spectrum.                  My ob
servation would seem to indicate that he has observed a bright line less
refrangible than the one in question, which bright line is at times excessively
brilliant. It requires absolutely perfect atmospheric conditions to see it in
 the ordinary solar spectrum.        It is best seen in a spot- spectrum when the
 spot is partially covered by a bright prominence.
    VI. In the neighbourhood of spots the F bright line is sometimes ob
served    considerably widened out in several         places, as   if the spectroscope
were analyzing injections      of hydrogen    at great pressure     in very limited  re
 gions into the chromosphere.
     VII. The brilliancy of the bright lines visible in the ordinary solar spec
 trum is extremely variable. One of them, at 1871-5, and another, at 1529-5
 of Kirchhoff-s   scale,  I have  detected  in the chromosphere at the same time
 that they were brilliant in the ordinary solar spectrum.
     VIII. Alterations of wave-length have been detected in the sodium-,
 magnesium-, and iron-lines in a spot-spectrum.               In the case of the last
 substance, the lines in which the alteration was detected were not those
 observed when iron (if we accept them to be due to iron alone) is injected
 into the chromosphere.
     IX. When the chromosphere is observed with a tangential slit, the F
 bright line close to the sun-s limb shows traces of absorption, which gradu
 ally diminish as the higher strata of the chromosphere are brought on to
 the slit, until the absorption-line finally thins out and entirely disappears.
 The lines of other substances thus observed do not show this absorption.
     X. During the most recent observations I have been able to detect traces
 of magnesium and iron in nearly all solar latitudes in the chromosphere.
 If this be not merely the result of the good definition lately, it would in
  dicate an increased    general photospheric disturbance as the maximum sun-

regards the possible         results of future laboratory work.                The   same remark
applies to magnesium and barium.
   Dr. Frankland and myself have determined that the widening out of the
sodium-line   in the spectrum of a spot which I pointed out in 1866, and
then stated to be possibly an evidence of greater absorption, indicates a
greater absorption due to greater pressure.
   The continuous widening out of the sodium-line in a spot must there
fore be regarded as furnishing an additional argument (if one were now
needed) in favour of the theory of the physical constitution of the sun first
put forward by Dr. Frankland and myself — namely, that the chromosphere
and the photosphere form the true atmosphere of the sun, and that under
ordinary circumstances      absorption is continuous from the top of the
                                the
chromosphere to the bottom of the photosphere, at whatever depth from
the bottom of the spot that bottom may be assumed to be.
  This theory was based upon all our observations made from 1866 up to
the time at which it was communicated to the Royal Society and the Paris
Academy of Sciences, and has been strengthened by all our subsequent
work    ;   but several announcements madeby Father Secchi to the Paris
Academy of Sciences and other learned bodies are so opposed to      and                       it,
differ so much from my own observations, that     necessary that should

refer to them, and give my reasons for still thinking that the theory above
referred to   not in disaccord with facts.
                 is                          At the same time must state         I
that Father Secchi does not combat this theory        indeed      not to be

gathered from any of his communications that he has seen any of the papers
communicated by myself to the Royal Society.
   Father Secchi states that the chromosphere     often separated from the
                                                                 is
photosphere,  and   that between  the  chromosphere and the photosphere
there exists  stratum giving
                 a              continuous spectrum, which he considers to
                                      a
be the base       of the solar atmosphere, and in which he thinks that                        the   in
version of the spectrum takes place.
  With regard to the first assertion,    may first state that all the observa

78                    Spectroscopic Observations      of  the Sun.            [Recess,
   With regard to the second assertion,            I would remark that if such a
continuous-spectrum-giving        envelope existed,    I  entirely fail to see how it
could be regarded as a region of selective absorption.            Secondly, my obser
vations have indicated no such stratum, although injections of sodium,
magnesium, &c. into the chromosphere not exceeding the limit of the
sun's limb by 2" have been regularly observed for several months past.
To-day    I  have even detected a low level of barium in the chromosphere not
1" high.       This indicates,  I think, that my instrument is not lacking in
delicacy   ;  and as  I have never seen anything       approaching to    a continuous
spectrum when my instrument has been in perfect adjustment, I am in
clined to attribute the observation to some instrumental error.                  Such a
phenomenon might arise from a local injection of solid or liquid particles
into the chromosphere, if such injection were possible.              But I have never
seen such an injection.       If such an occurrence could be observed, it would
at once settle that part of Dr. Frankland's and my own theory, which re
gards the chromosphere as the last layer of the solar atmosphere ; and if
it were possible to accept Father Secchi's observation, the point would be
settled in our favour.
   The sodium experiments to which I have referred, however, and the
widening out of the lines in the spot-spectra, clearly indicate, I think, that
the base of the atmosphere is below the spot, and not above it. I there
fore cannot accept Father Secchi's statement as being final against another
part of the theory to which I have referred — a conclusion which Father
Secchi himself seems to accept in other communications.
    Father Secchi remarks also that the F line is produced by the absorption
of other bodies     besides hydrogen, because    it never disappears. This conclu
sion is also negatived by my observations ; for it has very often been ob
served to disappear altogether        and  to be replaced by a bright line. At
times, as I pointed out to the Royal Society some months ago, when
a violent storm is going on accompanied by rapid elevations and depressions
of the prominences, there is      a black line on the less-refrangible      side  of the
bright    one   ; but this is a phenomenon due to           a change of wave-length
caused by the rapid motion        of the hydrogen.
    With regard to the observation of spot-spectra, I find that every increase
of dispersive power renders the phenomenon much more clear, and at the
same time more simple.           The selective absorption I discovered in 1866
comes out in its most intense form, but without any of the more complicated
accompaniments described by Father Secchi. I find, however, that by using
three prisms this complexity vanishes to a great extent. We get portions of
the spectrum here and there abnormally bright, which have given rise doubt
less to some-of the statements      of the distinguished Roman observer ; but the
bright lines, properly so-called, are as variable as they are in any other
part of the disk, but not much more so.            I quite agree that the " interpre

         ceived July 14, 1869.
     1.   It has been pointed out by one        of us that the vapours  of magnesium,
iron, &c.      are sometimes injected into the sun-s chromosphere aud are then
 rendered sensible by their bright spectral lines *.
     2. It has also been shown (1) that these vapours, for the most part,
 attain only a very low elevation in the chromosphere, and (2) that on rare
 occasions the magnesium vapour is observed like a cloud separated from the
 photosphere.
     3. It was further established on the 14th of March, 1869, and a draw
 ing was sent to the Royal Society indicating, that when the magnesium
 vapour is thus injected the spectral lines do not all attain the same height.
     Thus of the b lines, bl and 62 are of nearly equal height, but 6' is much
 shorter.
     4.   It  has  since  been   discovered that of the 450 iron lines observed by
 Angstrom, only a very few are iudicated in the spectrum of the chromo
  sphere when iron vapour is injected into it.
     5. Our experiments on hydrogen and nitrogen enabled us at once to
 connect these phenomena, always assuming, as required by our hypothesisf,
 that the great bulk of the absorption to which the Fraunhofer lines are due
 takes place in the photosphere itself.
     It  was only necessary,     in fact, to  assume that, as  in the case  of hydrogen
 and nitrogen, the spectrum became simpler where the density and tempe
 rature were less, to account at once for the reduction in the number of
 lines visible in those regions where, on our theory, the pressure and tem
 perature of the absorbing vapours of the sun are at their minimum.
     6. It became important, therefore, to test the truth of this assump
  tion by some laboratory experiments, the preliminary results of which we
  beg to communicate in this Note, reserving details, and an account of the
  further experiments we have already commenced, for another paper under
  the above title.
     We took the spark in air between two magnesium poles, so separated
  that the magnesium spectrum did not extend from pole to pole, but was
 visible only for a little distance, indicated by the atmosphere of magnesium
  vapour, round each pole.

    We  then carefully examined the disappearance       of the b lines, and   found
that they behaved exactly as they do on the sun.           Of the three lines the
most refrangible was the shortest ; and shorter than this were other lines,
which one of us has not yet detected in the spectrum of the chromosphere.
    This preliminary experiment, therefore, quite justified our assumption,
and must be regarded as strengthening the theory on which the assump
tion was based — namely, that the bulk of the absorption takes place in the
photosphere, and that it and the chromosphere form the true atmosphere of
the sun. In fact had the experiment been made in hydrogen instead of
in air, the phenomena indicated by the telescope would have been almost
 perfectly reproduced ; for each increase in the temperature of the spark
caused the magnesium vapour to extend further from the pole, and where
 the lines disappeared a band was observed         surmounting them, which is
 possibly connected with one which at times        is observed in the spectrum
of the chromosphere itself when the magnesium lines arc not visible.

    The object of the     present   investigation is to determine the relations
which    must exist between      the laws of the elasticity and heat of any
substance, gaseous, liquid, or solid, and those of the wave-like propagation
of a finite longitudinal disturbance in that substance — in other words, of a
disturbance consisting in displacements of particles along the direction of
propagation, the velocity of displacement of the particles being so great that
it is not to be neglected in comparison with the velocity of propagation. In
particular, the investigation aims at ascertaining : — in the first place, what con
ditions as to the transfer of heat from particle to particle must be fulfilled
in order that a finite longitudinal disturbance may be propagated along a
prismatic or cylindrical mass without loss of energy or change of type —
the word type being used to denote the relation between the extent of dis
turbance at a given instant of a set of particles and their respective undis
turbed positions ; and, secondly, according to what law the type of a wave
of finite longitudinal disturbance must change when the substance through
which it is propagated has, under the circumstances of the disturbance, no
appreciable power of transferring heat from particle to particle, being in
the condition which, in the language of thermodynamics, is called adiabatic.
The disturbed matter in these inquiries may be conceived to be contained
    a straight tube of uniform cross section and indefinite length.
    The investigation is facilitated by the use of a quantity which the author
calls the Mass-velocity or SomalicVelocity — that is to sny, the mass of matter
through which a disturbance is propagated in a unit of time while advan
cing along   a  prism of the sectional area unity,  — also by expressing the      re

    by means of the masses of matter contained between them, instead of by
    their distances apart.
       Let such a transverse advancing plane coincide with that part of a wave
    of longitudinal disturbance at which the pressure P and bulkincss S* are
    equal to those corresponding to the undisturbed condition ; it is shown
    that the value of the square of the mass-velocity is

    The linear velocity of advance of the wave is obviously mS.
        Let a second transverse plane advance along with the wave in such a
    manner that an invariable mass of matter is contained between it and the
    first advancing plane.   The condition of permanence of type of disturbance
.   is,    that      the distance           between        those          planes shall      be    invariable.     Let

               §   1. On the Action   of Hydrochloric Add   on Codeia.
     In Part  II.   (Proc. Roy. Soc. vol. xvii. p. 460) it was shown that when
codeia is heated       with excess of hydrochloric acid under pressure that it
splits up into chloride of methyl, water, and apomorphia, thus —
               Cu   HS1  N0a + HC1=    CH, CI + Ha O + C17 H17 NOa.
     At the time it appeared probable that one of the two following reactions
would first take place, forming an intermediate product : —
                 I.   0„ Hal N0a+HC1=CH, Cl+C17 Hl0 N0,.
              II.     CMHalN0,            = HaO + CuHuNOa.
     On investigation, however, it has been found that neither the one nor the
other takes place, at least as the chief reaction ; for by heating codeia with
excess of hydrochloric        acid on the water-bath, a body is obtained by the
following reaction —
                    Cl, Hal N0a + HC1= Ha O + Cla H,, CI NOa    ;
and this base, when heated under pressure with hydrochloric       acid, splits up
into chloride of methyl and apomorphia,
                       Cu  H20 CI NOa=CH, C1+ C17 H17 NOa.
    The   new    base   may be obtained in a state of purity thus: — codeia is
heated under paraffin on the water-bath with ten to fifteen times its weight
of strong hydrochloric acid for twelve to fifteen hours, and the resulting
brownish liquid evaporated to dryness on the water-bath ; the residue is
dissolved in water, and excess of bicarbonate of sodium added, whereby a
voluminous white precipitate is formed, consisting chiefly of the new base
mixed with a trace of apomorphia.          The filtrate contains the unaltered
                                                                  g 2

water to remove the trace of apomorphia (which is much more soluble in
ammonia than the new base), and is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid
and fractionally precipitated by bicarbonate of sodium : the second fraction
is pure white, and is free from apomorphia and codeia ; this is then ex
tracted with ether, which dissolves almost the whole.                 The clear ethereal
solution is then shaken up with a few drops of hydrochloric acid, and the
solution of hydrochlorate thus obtained, if coloured, must be fractionally
precipitated by bicarbonate of sodium, and the ether and hydrochloric-acid
process repeated ; the resulting product is a viscid colourless solution of
the hydrochlorate of the new base, which refuses to crystallize.              When    eva

     From these numbers it appears that the new base is formed from codeia
by the replacement of  an atom of hydroxyl by one of chlorine, thus —

     If codeia     be regarded as being formed on the mixed type                   jj3   q, then      the
new base may be looked upon as formed on the mixed type                                  jl^l   ;    and,
using Professor Foster-s nomenclature* for these types (viz. oxynitride and
chloronitride respectively), codeia would be oxycodide, and the new base
chlorocodide   but until further investigation affords some knowledge of the
                   ;
nature of the radicals occurring in codeia and morphia,     would be prema it
ture to attempt to give rational formulae for these bases.

     It is worthy of notice that this reaction probably takes place gradually,
 while that whereby apomorphia and chloride of methyl are formed direct
  from codeia appears to occur suddenly, thereby bursting the large majority
  of sealed tubes   used   : this never occurred with chlorocodide.
          § 3. Action    of Water    on the   Hydrochlorate of Chlorocodide.
     When the hydrochlorate           (obtained by dissolving the base freed from
  codeia &c. by the process previously described in as small an excess of hy
 drochloric acid as possible) is sealed up with ten to fifteen times its weight
 of water and heated for three hours to 130°-140°, it splits up into hydro
 chloric   acid and hydrochlorate       of codeia, no      gas whatever being formed
 during the reaction.

     In two experiments the amount of free hydrochloric acid thus formed
 was estimated by titration with a solution of carbonate of sodium, and after
 subtraction of the small amount due to the excess of hydrochloric acid in
 the original liquid (estimated in the same way), was found to amount re
spectively to 9 and 10 per cent, of the hydrochlorate employed, the theo
retical amount according to the above equation being 10'3; the amount of
undecomposed chlorocodide was found to be very small, the                   liquid result
ing from the digestion giving but a minute precipitate with                   carbonate of
sodium. The filtrate from the carbonate-of-sodium precipitate               was extracted
with ether, and the ethereal solution obtained shaken with a                few drops      of
hydrochloric acid      j  an  oily liquid    was   thus obtained, which on standing
several hours      deposited crystals     ;  these, when drained       from the mother
liquors and recryslallized, had the character of hydrochlorate of              codeia, and
gave the following numbers after drying in an ordinary water-bath till con
stant in weight.
     As crystallized hydrochlorate of codeia        is stated to lose one-fourth       of its
water of crystallization at 100°, a sample          was prepared by dissolving codeia
in hydrochloric acid and recrystallizing the product; after drying in the
same water-bath it was also burnt as a comparison (III.).

  Some time ago* I pointed out the action which takes place when
cyanogen gas is passed into an alcoholic solution of amidobenzoic acid.
The principal product of this reaction                       is,
                                       as have shown, yellow compound

of cyanogen and amidobenzoic acid of the formula            H^NHJO.,, 2CN,            C7
which separates in large quantities as soon as the alcoholic solution of amido
benzoic acid   nearly saturated with cyanogen.

body isomeric with amidobenzoic acid,       submitted under the same condition

                               a                               In this case the
solution remains either perfectly clear, or only traces of similar yellow com          a
pound are precipitated.  By allowing the alcoholic solution of anthranilic
acid, saturated with cyanogen, to stand for several days, the acid almost                                   is
entirely converted into new compound of the empirical formula C10H10N2O2;
                                   a
two other new compounds (an acid and an indifferent body) are at the
same time formed.      It worthy of remark that none of these compounds
                                     is

from amidobenzoic acid.                    Each of them belongs to perfectly different type.
                                                                                  a
 I   propose on this occasion to treat only of the principal product of the
reaction, viz. the compound C10 H10 Na Oa.    It prepared in the following   is
manner.    An alcoholic solution of anthranilic acid    saturated with cya            is
nogen gas and left to stand for about eight days. The alcohol  then evapo                         is
rated at low temperature, and the crystalline residue washed several times
           a
with dilute solution of carbonate of ammonia,      which any traces of the    by
new acid (one of the by-products of the reaction) are removed.   It then                                         is
further purified             by
                     recrystallization from alcohol with the addition of                                               a
little animal charcoal. The indifferent body already referred to, which

are very little soluble in boiling water, but dissolve readily in boiling
alcohol and ether.   It fuses at 173° C., and can be distilled in small quan
tities without undergoing decomposition.     Its formation may be expressed
as follows —   :

    This   new compound,         C, H,  Na O2, is very      difficultly soluble in boiling
 water, alcohol, and ether, and crystallizes in small white brilliant plates.
 It is likewise disolved by solutions of caustic alkalies, but is again, however,
 separated     by carbonic acid.        On adding a solution of silver salt to its
 aqueous    or  alcoholic   solution   (neither of which has any action on vege
 table colours), a white precipitate is formed. Fuming nitric acid converts
 this body into a nitro-compound, crystallizing in honey-yellow prisms of
 the composition C„ H, (NOa)Na Oa.             On treating the latter with sulphide
 of ammonium or with tin and hydrochloric acid, it is reduced and fur
 nishes a basic amido-compound crystallizing in slightly yellowish- tinted
 needles,    difficultly soluble in all neutral liquids.                Its composition is
 C, H5 (NHa) Na Oa. Compounds of this amido-body with acids crystallize

    I consider it highly probable that the base C„ H7 N, O will split up in
like manner with the formation of the above-described compound C, HtNa0a,
according to the equation
                     CiH7N10+H,0-C,H.N,01+NH,.
    Indeed this latter compound exhibits great resemblance              in its chemical
deportment to the methylhydantoine of Herr Neubauer.
    In conclusion,   I   should   point out that the azodioxindol described by
 Herrn Baeyer and Knop in their paper on indigo-blue* is isomeric with the
before-mentioned compound, C, H„ Na 02.             These two bodies show, more
over, great similarity in other respects, so much so that I should feel
inclined to view them as identical if their fusing-points did not differ
essentially.    Herrn Baeyer and Knop state that the fusing-point of their
azodioxindol is 300° C., while the compound I obtained fuses above 350° C.
Should it turn out, however, on further investigation that the two bodies are
identical, the compound C„ He Na 0, would have to be regarded as the
first derivative of indigo which has ever been prepared synthetically, and
which, like indigo-blue itself, contains eight atoms of carbon.
VI. "On       the successive Action       of Sodium and Iodide of Ethyl on
       Acetic Ether."           By J.  Alfred Wanklyn, F.C.S. &c. Com
       municated by Professor Williamson.               Received      July   16, 1869.
    In a remarkable paper which appeared in the Philosophical Transac
tions, vol. clvi. p. 37 (1806), Frankland and Duppa described the products
obtained on treatment with iodide of ethyl of the yellow wax-like mass
given by the action of sodium on acetic ether.            Besides the description
of the compounds, Frankland and Duppa give a theory of their origin,

92      Action of Sodium and Iodide of Ethyl on Acetic Ether,                  [Iteccss,
which theory is embodied in four equations expressive of Frankland and
Duppa-s view of the origin of the wax-like mass . As 1 have already pointed
out, each one of these four equations affirms the evolution of an equi
valent of hydrogen by every equivalent of sodium employed.
    I have shown that acetic ether does not evolve hydrogen by reaction
 with the alkali metals.        Equations which assume evolution of hydrogen
in  these  reactions   are  therefore,   in my opinion, inadmissible.
    At the  end   of my paper in the January Number of Liebig-s ' Annalen,-
 I promised to give an explanation of Frankland and Duppa-s products,
which should not involve the assumption of evolution of hydrogen.                  That
explanation I now give.
    On reference to Frankland and Duppa-s paper just cited, it will be found
that the products described by them as obtained from the "wax-like
 mass
       "  and iodide   of ethyl  are the following    : —
            A.    C„   HuO,, liquid boiling      at 195°C.,
             B.   C10 HM 0,, liquid boiling      at 210° C. to 212°     C.,
butyric ether, caproic ether, and also some unacted upon acetic ether, and
a considerable quantity of common ethylic ether.
   The history of these compounds is therefore the task set before me.
    I have already shown that the direct products of the action of sodium on
acetic   ether are ethylate of sodium and sodium-triacetyl.               Nothing else
seems to be produced directly.            But the excess of acetic ether, which is
necessarily taken, acts on some of the ethylate of sodium, producing alcohol
and acetate of ethylene-sodium in the manner described by me on a
former occasion.       (Of course the extent to which this secondary action
takes place will be determined by the exact circumstances of the experi
ment.)      We have, therefore, in the wax-like mass got by prolonging               the
action of sodium on acetic ether : —
            Ethylate of sodium                                   Ca H5  NaO
            Sodium-triacetyl                                     C6 H, O, Na
            Acetate of ethylene-sodium                           C, H7 Na   02
            Alcohol                                              CaH,0.
   On the first three iodide of ethyl acts, giving iodide of sodium and
organic liquids.
   From the ethylate of sodium comes the common ether.
   From the sodium-triacetyl comes ethyl -triacetyl, which is A = C,            Hu  0,,
having been got by Geuther from the pure sodium-triacetyl.
   From isolated acetate of ethylene-sodium and iodide of ethylene               1 have
recently obtained liquid B,      C10 H1H   0,, thus : —
          Acetate of ethylene-
               sodium.                                  Alcohol.
           2C, H7 NaOa + 2C, H5        1  = 2Na I + Ca Hc O +       Cl0 Hl, 0a.
   The liquid prepared by         me boiled at 212°        C., and  gave carbonate    of

    By the action of liquid A upon ethylate of sodium Geuther has recently
shown that butyric ether is produced.             Geuther- s reaction I write thus : —
                                          Acetate  of ethylene-

VII. "    On Approach caused by Vibration." By Frederice                      Guthrie.
       Communicated by Prof. G. G. Stoees, Sec. R. S.                           Received
       August 26, 1869.
                                       (Abstract.)
    The author     observes that when a vibrating tuning-fork is held near to a
niece of   cardboard,    the latter has a tendency to approach the fork.            Start-
  ng from this experiment, a series of experiments is described having for
  heir object the determination of the cause and conditions of the funda
mental observed fact.
    It is shown that no sensible       permanent air-currents, having their source
at the fork-s surface, are established ; and hence that the approach of the
card to the fork is not due to the expansion of such currents as in M.
Clement-s experiment.
    The modifications are examined which           Mr. Faraday-s surface-whirlwinds
on a vibrating tuning-fork       undergo when the fork vibrates in the neighbour
hood of a sensibly rigid plane.
    It is shown that a delicately suspended card approaches the fork when
either of the three essential faces of the fork is presented to the card, and
 that the approach takes place from distances far exceeding the range of
 Mr. Faraday-s air-current.         That the action     between    the card and fork is
 mutual is shown by suspending the latter.              Also one vibrating fork tends
 to approach another in whatever sense their planes                of vibration    may  be
 towards one another.
    The mean tension of the air surrounding a vibrating fork is examined by
 enclosing one limb of the fork in a glass tube.                   It appears that the
 vibrating   fork  displaces air.
    The question whether the equilibrium between two equal and opposite
 forces acting on a body is disturbed by submitting one of the forces to
 successive, rapid, equal, and opposite alterations in quantity, is answered in
 the negatire     by an experiment which shows that the equilibrium of a
 Cartesian diver is not disturbed by submitting the water in which it floats
 to vibration.
    Various modifications       are  introduced     into the nature      of  the   surface

which receives the vibrations, such as making it a narrow cylinder with one
end closed, making it of cotton-wool, &c.        It is found that in all cases the
suspended body approaches the vibrating one.
   The author concludes that the effect of apparent attraction is due to
atmospheric pressure, and that this pressure is due to undulatory disper
sion.   It is suggested that the dispersion of the vibrations which consti
tute radiant heat may cause bodies to approach, being pushed not pulled.

    The President theu addressed    the Society as follows     : —
       Gentlemen,
One of the first subjects to which I have to draw your attention is the
 Royal Society-s Catalogue of Scientific Papers, the printing of which, I am
happy to report, proceeds satisfactorily.          The third volume, which I lay
before you, is now completed, carrying the Index of Titles in alphabetical
order as far as L e z inclusive ; and good progress has been made in cor
recting the proofs of the fourth volume.          Each succeeding volume of the
work, of course, adds to its practical utility, which continues to be thank
fully acknowledged by cultivators of science in various parts of the world.
    But while the aid to be derived to scientific research from the index
arranged according to authors- names is fully recognized, there can be no
doubt that the value of the Catologue will be greatly enhanced by the ful
filment of the second part of the plan announced in the preface, namely,
by the publication of an Alphabetical Index of Subjects.              The prepara
tion of such an "Index Serum" as is contemplated has been for some
time a subject   of anxious  as well as careful consideration       by the  Library

  1869.]                         President's   Address.                         103
  Committee, and they have at length arrived at what, they have reason to
 hope, will be a most satisfactory solution of the question, through a com
  munication with Professor Julius Victor Carus, of Leipsic, who they found
 would be willing himself to undertake the task.           I am happy to announce
  that the Council, acting on the recommendation of the Library Committee,
  have entered into a very satisfactory arrangement with Professor Carus,
  who will be able to commence his labours in the ensuing spring.             From
  the well-known     scientific  accomplishment of Professor Carus, and his
  extensive  experience   in  the  peculiar work to be performed, as well as the
  confidence which will be reposed in him by all acquainted with the nature
  of the undertaking     and interested    in its success, we may consider the So
 ciety most fortunate in securing his services.
     The Meteorological Department of the Board of Trade, superintended
 by a Committee of the Royal Society, is making good progress, under the
 able direction of Mr. Robert Scott, towards the fulfilment of the objects
 for which it was constituted.       In respect to the Meteorology of the United
 Kingdom, the seven observatories distributed over its surface and maintained
 at the public expense    are all in thoroughly good working order, transmitting
 their self-recorded results monthly to the central establishment, where they
 undergo a careful revision before their final acceptance.        The first publi
 cation of the numerical results, which will be complete for each of the
 seven observatories for the year 1869, will take place towards the end of
 the first quarter of 1870, and similarly in subsequent years, and will be
 followed at brief intervals by graphical representations illustrating the
 phenomena of the weather at times of its most important disturbances.
    The other departments of the office show also a healthy activity.           As
 regards Ocean Meteorology, the Committee have been enabled to increase
 their staff, and so to accelerate materially the investigations alluded to in
 my address of last year ; while the collection of new observations of a high
 character is also going on steadily.       The system of Weather Telegraphy is
 making solid advances.         The Drum Signal is now hoisted at upwards of
  100 British Stations, and intelligence of atmospheric disturbances felt on
 our shores    is transmitted to the coasts of the continent from Norway to
 Spain.     The results of the transmission of such news to Hamburg have
 been especially satisfactory.
    The extension of telegraphic communication to the north of Scotland has
 enabled the Committee to adopt Wick as an observing-station, while the
Norwegian authorities have resolved to make use of the direct cable laid
down last summer between Scotland and their coast, to exchange informa
tion daily with the office in London.         Hitherto the reports from Norway
have always reached us vid Paris, whereby delays were occasioned.
    The attention of the Committee has also been directed to instituting
discussions of the statistics of our weather.         The results already obtained
in this field lead us to hope that the practical value of such inquiries will
soon be manifested.

104                             Anniversary Meeting.                      [Nov. 30'
    The great Melbourne Telescope arrived at its destination in November
1868, without injury of any importance — which, perhaps, could hardly
have been expected after a voyage of 1 6,000 miles, for an instrument at
once so massive and so delicate        !
    The Visitors of the Melbourre Observatory thought it advisable to adopt
the suggestion of Dr. Robinson to provide the telescope with a covering,
and for this purpose they preferred the second of the plans which he pro
posed — a rolling roof.        This appears to have been satisfactorily executed.
It protects the telescope completely, and can be removed by a single work
man, leaving the telescope fully exposed to the sky.
    In erecting the instrument some trifling difficulties seem to have been
experienced, and it was not fit for actual work until the beginning of last
June, which is midwinter there, a season when cloudy weather prevails to
an extent which we were scarcely prepared to expect, and which is stated
to have been this year excessive.         For  these reasons   the habitual work   of
the telescope had not been commenced up to September.
    Its performance since erection does not appear to have given altogether
the same satisfaction at Melbourne that it did at Dublin -, but the defects
complained      of may     arise  partly  from an imperfect knowledge of the
principles of the instrument and inexperience in the use of so large a tt le-
scope, partly from experimental alterations made at Melbourne, and partly
from atmospherical circumstances.            Those who are acquainted with the
difficulties which Sir J. F. W. Herschel experienced at the Cape, will not
be surprised that they should be felt at Melbourne to a much greater ex
tent, on account of the far greater 6ize of the speculum.                  I
                                                                     But have no
doubt that    if the  instrument be kept in its origiual condition and as care
fully adjusted     as   it was at Dublin, it will perform as well in ordinary
observing-weather.
    The high impression of its power produced by the trials which were
made of it when at Dublin, is maintained by a sketch of a portion of the
Great Nebula near ij Argus, made by           M. Le Sueur during two nights in
June last.
    Some change in this nebula from the time when           it was described by   Sir
J.  F. W. Herschel had        been indicated by Mr. Powell and other observers,
 though with instruments so much inferior in power to his 20-foot re
 flector, that little reliance could be placed on them ; howerer, here the
evidences of change are indisputable.         The peculiar opening in the nebula,
 which Sir John Herschel has compared to a lemniscate, is still very
 sharply marked, but its shape and magnitude have altered.              Its northern
 extremity is opened out into a sort of estuary ; one of the remarkable con
 strictions seen in 1834 has disappeared, and the other has shifted its place.
Two stars which were then exactly on the edges of the opening are now
at some distance       within the bright nebulosity      ; the nebula has become
comparatively faint near »; Argus.
    Another remarkable change is the formation of a V-shaped               bay south

1863.]                               President-s    Address.                                105
and preceding the lemniscate, whose edges are so bright that if it had
then existed it could not have been overlooked in the 20-foot reflector.
Another feature, which, however, was perhaps not within reach of that
telescope,      is an oval which     M. Le Sueur      describes   as   " full of
                                                             complicated
dark markings and pretty bright nebular filaments."   The angular mag
nitude of the changes which have been thus observed is so great as to
suggest a strong probability that this nebula is much nearer to us than
the stars which are seen along with it.  It may be also noticed that M.
Le Sueur         saw nothing     to make him believe         in any development of stars
in addition to those seen by Sir J. F.              W. Herschel.
   The spectroscope and photographic    apparatus belonging to the instru
ment have by this time reached     Melbourne, and will no doubt give good
results, subject to the condition that the fascination of their use shall not
be permitted to interfere with the primary destination of the telescope, viz.
the observation of nebulae.
   Celestial spectroscopy has indeed attained such importance, that it
requires for its successful prosecution the undivided attention of the astro
nomer who devotes himself to            it,
                                   as well as an observatory specially designed
for it.  Our great national observatories cannot supply this want, for they
have  their own specific destination   and the high optical power which
                                              ;                                                  is
required,   we wish to make further progress,
                if                                scarcely within the reach
                                                             is
of amateurs.
   These considerations have             induced      your   Council    to believe       that an
attempt to encourage           and aid this most interesting class        of   researches   is   an
object    full unison with the highest purpose of the Royal Society-s exist
           in
ence   and they have therefore, after most careful deliberation, resolved to
       ;
act on this conviction          by
                           providing   telescope of the highest power that
                                              a                                                  is
conveniently   available for spectroscopy and its kindred inquiries.    The
instrument   will, of course, be the property of the Society, and will be
intrusted to such persons as, in their opinion, are the most likely to use                       it
to the best advantage for the extension of this branch of science     and, in        ;
the first instance, there can be but one opinion that the person so selected
should be Mr. Huggins.
   The execution of this project              was    much facilitated      by   the receipt of
.£1350 from     bequest made to the Society by the late Mr.
                     a                                                          Oliveira; and
in the beginning of the year proposals were received from the chief opticians
of the time, of which that of Mr. Grubb was accepted last April.
   The conditions proposed were, that the object-glass of the telescope
should be of 15 inches aperture, and not more than 15 feet focus, that
the arrangements of its equatorial should be such that       could be easily
                                                                          it
worked       by
             the observer without an assistant, and that the readings of its
circles could be made without leaving the floor of the observatory.    Mr.
Grubb was fortunate enough to secure two disks which had been exhibited
 byMessrs. Chance at the French Exhibition.      They are of first-rate
transparency         ;   and as the construction which         has been adopted admits           of

 10G                           Anniversary Meeting.                    [Nov. 30,
 the lenses being cemented,     this object-glass will transmit an unusually large
 portion of light. The respective indices of the glasses were determined by
 making facets on their edges at an angle of 60°, and observing spectral
 lines through the prisms thus formed with a spectroscope of such magni
 tude as to admit of their being placed on its table. The distinctness with
 which even faint lines were seen through 12 inches of the glass is a most
 satisfactory proof of its purity and clearness.     From these Professor Stokes
 computed the curves for the lenses ; and his numbers were almost identical
 with those which Mr. Grubb had obtained.
     I may mention that some fears had been entertained that the equality of
 curvature in the adjacent surfaces might call up a ghost, if the lenses were
 used uncemented, and that this has been tried and no such effect was
visible.     Subsequently a rather novel addition has been made, bearing
 upon the    radiation  of heat from the stars. An object-glass intercepts so
much of the heat-rays that, to economize the infinitesimal effect which is
expected, a metallic mirror is more promising.           The equatorial is there
fore, at the suggestion of Mr. De La Rue, provided with the means of
changing the 15-inch achromatic for an 18-inch reflector; and this has
 been accomplished by means notable for their facility and their safety.
    The instrument will be ready for trial in December of the present year.
 In the meantime it may be said that the object-glass, notwithstanding the
difficulty of working one of so short a focus, gives promise of very high
 excellence.
    With   respect   to the equatorial, it has been ascertained that a force    of
2 lb. applied at the eyepiece is sufficient to move the telescope easily on its
declination axis, and 1| lb. on its polar axis; however, when all its parts
are put together, these forces may require to be increased \.
    The anticipations which I ventured to express in may last year's Address,
of the renewal in the summer of the present year of the researches on the
temperature of the sea at great depths, and on the nature of the sea-
bottom and the life existing in its vicinity, have been realized by an ample
provision on the part of Her Majesty's Government, and a devotion on the
part of the Fellows of the Royal Society, viz. Dr. Carpenter, Prof. Wyville
Thomson, and Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, meriting the highest praise. The ex
istence of persistent deep-sea currents of very different temperatures in
proximity to each other, and their influence on the inhabiting forms of
life and on the nature of the sea- bed, together with the great extension of
our knowledge of the variety and characteristics of the new forms of life
which have been discovered, justify the belief that we have embarked on a
field of discovery and research which will not soon be exhausted, and which
will have no unimportant        bearing on the earlier geology of our globe, as
well as on our knowledge of the life at present existing on the submerged
portions of its surface.
    It  had long been inferred by naturalists       that species  of the marine

  Invertebrata may have a far wider extension on the surface of the globe
 than is the case with the inhabiters of the land.     The correctness of this
 inference received   the fullest confirmation  by the researches   of the  late
 Admiral Sir James Clark Ross, whose dredges brought up from the
  depths of the Antarctic Ocean individuals of species which were well
 known to him from his earlier dredging operations in the Arctic seas.
 These animals are known to be particularly sensitive in regard to tempe
 rature; and we have no reason to doubt his conclusion, that water of
 similar temperature to that of the Arctic and Antarctic seas exists in the
 depths of the intermediate ocean, and may have formed a channel for the
 dissemination of species.      The barrier which the heated regions of the
tropics present to the migrations of the land animals of colder climates
 does not exist in the case of many of those inhabitants of the sea whose
 remains constitute a large portion of the fossiliferous strata of the globe.
    The Fellows will not have forgotten the important paper on the Flora of
 North Greenland by Prof. Oswald Heer, which was read last winter, and
 which will speedily be in their hands in the fortheoming volume of the
 Transactions.     The inquiries carried on by this eminent botanist have
 determined, beyond the possibility of cavil, the climatological conditions of
 the Arctic regions at a geological epoch which is comparatively recent (the
 Miocene),    and have shown that they must have        resembled very closely
 those now prevailing in latitudes at least 20° lower   ; for such is the zone
inhabited by the living representatives of the plants found fossil by him in
 the localities in which they grew.
    The specimens brought by the recent Swedish Expedition from Spitz-
bergen have also been submitted to his examination ; and it appears that a
portion of these, from Advent Bay, belong to the Quaternary Epoch.            It
will therefore be a matter of no small interest to determine accurately the
changes of climate which took place in that locality at the expiration of the
Miocene era.
    I proceed to the award of the Medals.
    The Copley Medal has been awarded to M. Victor Regnault, Foreign
                                                                 '

au calcul des Machines a Feu,- including his elaborate investigations on
the Specific Heat of Gases and Vapours, and various papers on the Elastic
Force of Vapours.
    The  name   of M. Victor Regnault has been associated for the last quarter
of a century with the most refined and delicate experimental inquiries con
nected with the measurement of heat. The amount of labour involved in
his researches upon the specific heat of simple and compound bodies, upon
the dilatation of gases and vapours, upon the comparison of the air-thermo

meter with the mercurial thermometer,          upon the elastic force of aqueous
vapour, upon the determination of the density of gases, and upon hygro-
metry must excite the astonishment of all who can estimate the difficulty of
the problems attacked, the precision of the results attained, and the funda
mental character of the data which he has determined.
   These researches      were published  before  the year 1850 ; many of them
were embodied       in the first volume of       '
                                             his Relation des Experiences pour
determiner les lois et les donnecs physiques nccessaires au calcul des Ma
chines a Feu."        The Royal Society marked their sense of the importance
of these earlier labours     of M. Regnault by the presentation of the Rum ford
Medal   in  the  year 1848.
   He has since published the second volume of that great work, to
which more especially the Copley Medal is now awarded.             It embraces a
series of researches even more delicate and difficult ; to use the words of
one whose     recent   loss we  all deplore, and whose opinion on this subject
possesses a weight which is equalled by few, viz. the late Mr. Graham,
                                                                               " in
these researches       a degree of precision is attained, where precision is all-
important, which appears never to have been surpassed, or perhaps even
appioached before in similar inquiries.         The results are data of a funda
mental character, to the completion of which chemists and natural philoso
phers have been looking anxiously for years past, and which they have
now received      from the hands of      M. Regnault with    a   feeling of entire
confidence."
   The   researches    on the specific heat of gases and vapours, alone, consti
tute a monumental work.           Upon this subject the most discordant results
had been obtained by experimental investigators of tried skill and inge
nuity; and the problem, notwithstanding its importance, exhibited          a series
of perplexing contradictions.
   Before commencing his own experiments, M. Regnault submitted the
various methods of previous inquirers on the subject to a minute compa
rison and criticism, particularly those of Delaroche and Berard, of Hay-
craft, and of Apjohn and Suesman.          M. Regnault finally adopted a method
based upon the one proposed by           Delaroche  and Berard.     The principle
of it may be explained in a few words.
   A current of the compressed gas under experiment is made to traverse
at  a uniform velocity a metallic worm maintained at      a uniform temperature.
The heated gas is then transmitted through a calorimeter, and the amount
of the following quantities determined, viz. : — 1, the weight of the gas
employed ; 2, the cooling of the gas ; 3, the rise of temperature of the
water in the calorimeter.        From these data the specific heat of the gas is
calculated.
   Amongst various special contrivances required for avoiding error, it whs
necessary to have the means of regulating the escape of the gas with suffi
cient uniformity, and for preventing its issue from the calorimeter at vary
ing pressures.

   Some idea of the enormous amount of labour bestowed upon these re
searches may be formed from the fact, that not fewer than eighty-four ex
periments were made upon the specific heat of air, under different pres
sures and temperatures, forty-three upon aqueous vapour, twenty-four
upon carbonic acid, and a considerable number upon other important
gases    and vapours, embracing no fewer than thirty-six different elemen
tary and compound bodies, many of which required special modifications
of the method and apparatus employed.
    Besides this remarkable series of researches, M. Regnault has embodied
in his work : — investigations on the compressibility of gases under wide vari
ations of pressure, and on the specific heat of liquids at different tempera
tures ; also a second memoir on the elastic force of saturated vapours at
different pressures, which he has extended to the compressed gases, and to
the density of vapours emitted by saline solutions and by mixed liquids.
In addition to all these, he has a memoir on the latent heat of vapours at
different tensions.
    This extended       series  of investigations is carried out with minute and
scrupulous precision,         and   the sources and limits of error are traced and
guarded against with unvarying skill and sagacity. The publication of
this work, the greatest experimental contribution of any single individual
to the science of heat, must indeed mark an era in the history of thermotics,
and furnish data of enduring value both to the chemist and the physicist
in all that concerns specific and latent heat, and the laws of elastic force
as acting on aeriform bodies.
       Professor Miller,
    We greatly regret that          we are deprived     of the pleasure of Monsieur
Regnault's presence by reason of illness in his family.                  I  will there
fore request you to receive         the  Medal on his     behalf, and to transmit it to
him with the assurance of the Society's highest respect.
    The Council has awarded a Royal Medal to Sir Thomas Maclear, Astro
nomer Royal at the Cape of Good Hope, for his Measurement of an Arc
of the Meridian at the Cape of Good Hope.
    Our   sole knowledge      of the figure of the southern hemisphere     rests on the
arc   of the meridian measured by La Caille, and now remeasured and                 ex
tended by Maclear.           The original measurement, notwithstanding the well-
known ability of the great astronomer under whose superintendence it was
executed, has not commanded confidence.                The magnitude of the degree
inferred    from  it is  far  too  great, and,  if accepted, would lead to the con
clusion that the dimensions of the two hemispheres are dissimilar.                  But
 La Caille's angles were observed with a quadrant, not with a circle, and
were therefore liable to errors of eccentricity and of figure ; while the
 effects  of local attraction,     if  recognized at all, were very imperfectly ap

predated.    These considerations induced Maclear, shortly after his ap
pointment to the Cape Observatory, to plan the verification which he has
now accomplished.      Pursuing the still earlier inquiries of Sir George
Everest, he succeeded, though with considerable difficulty, in recovering
La Caille's terminal stations ; and, aided by the advice and encouragement
of Sir John Herschel (then at the Cape) and of the Astronomer Royal, he
commenced the work of a remeasurement in 1836.         The proceedings were
necessarily tedious : the measurements of the base, of the triangles, and of
the zenith-distances were repeated to an extent and with precautions un
practised at the earlier period.   The zenith-distances were observed with
the sector with which Bradley discovered the aberration of light and the
nutation of the earth's axis, intrusted to Maclear by the Admiralty.    The
terrestrial angles were taken with a 20-inch circle by Jones, and a smaller
theodolite by Reichenbach, both of remarkable precision.     The base, from
which all the distances were derived, was measured              with the compensation
bars used in the Irish triangulation. Thus, in respect to the means em
ployed, this arc of the meridian may be regarded as inferior to none on
record. A full account of the whole was completed in 1866, and has been
published by the Admiralty in two quarto volumes.      It does not confirm
the abnormal value obtained by La Caille, but shows a probable cause for
the discordance.  La Caille's northern station was in a hollow surrounded
by mountains, one of which, half a mile distant to the north, was a mass of
rock 2000 feet high ; and others, at distances somewhat greater, were still
near enough to create disturbance.   A station so situated was obviously ill
suited to be        a   terminal  and the triangulation was therefore ex
                                   station   ;
tended across an immense plain of sand to a point without any visible source
of local attraction. By this extension, and by a similar one to the south,
Maclear's arc has an amplitude nearly four times as great as that of La
Caille, and    on this account, as well as on account of the greater accuracy
                  is,
in detail, far more deserving of confidence.    The degree which      derived  is
from   it   is   11 33 feet    shorter than that of La Caille   ;   and as La Caille's   is
1051   longer than that given by the spheroid which, according to Airy,
represents the average of northern arcs, Maclear's determination   evidently  is
a near approximation to the truth.    This    even more distinctly shown
                                                   is                                    by
the close agreement   of the latitudes computed from the geodetic measure
ments with those given by the sector — that of the north extremity being
0-4" in defect, that of the south extremity 0"'5 in excess.
       Captain Richards,
    We should indeed  have been happy to have had Sir Thomas Maclear's
presence among us but in his present unavoidable absence
                           ;                                     will request

 1869.]                         President-s   Address.                        Ill
    A Royal Medal     bas been awarded to Dr. Augustus Matthiessen, F.R.S.,
 for his researches   on  the electrical and other physical properties of metals
 and their alloys.
    The earlier of Dr. Matthiessen-s published researches related to the
 preparation   of the    metals of the alkaline earths.      Having succeeded in
 establishing   or  perfecting   methods    for the production of these, he pro
 ceeded to institute a far more complete examination of their physical
 properties than had previously been attempted.          These researches appear
 to have led to his investigation of the more important physical properties
 of the principal metals and their alloys. In some of these investigations
 Dr. Matthiessen associated himself with younger workers in science of
 proved ability, Messrs. Holzmann, Box, and Vogt ; and the results arrived
 at were included in    a series  of nine papers published in the ' Philosophical
 Transactions.-     They embrace the determinations of the specific gravities,
 the expansion due to heat, the thermo-electric properties, the electric con-
 ducting-power, and the effects of temperature upon the electric conducting-
 power.
    The laws   deduced   from the results of Dr. Matthiessen-s electrical expe
 riments are now in constant use by telegraphic engineers.         The causes of
 the great variations observed in the electric conducting-power of com
 mercial copper were first elucidated by him, and an important report was
 made by him on this subject in 1860 to the Committee appointed by
 Government to inquire into the construction of Submarine Telegraph
 Cables.    His investigation of this subject has resulted in very great im
 provement of the conducting-power of the copper wire used in submarine
 telegraphy.     Closely connected with this branch of his researches are the
 investigations which Dr. Matthiessen carried out for the Electrical- Standard
 Committee of the British Association, of which he was one of the most
 active members.       The resistance-coils issued by that Committee, which
 have been very generally adopted as standard instruments, are all con
structed of an alloy of platinum and tin, which, after a long series of experi
ments, Dr. Matthiessen recommended as specially fitted for that purpose.
    Under the auspices of the British Association, Dr. Matthiessen under
 took, a few years ago, the investigation of the chemical constitution of
cast iron, and   of the influence exerted upon the physical properties of that
metal by the several other elements which generally occur in association
with it. With these objects in view he has laboured most perseveringly
in the preparation of iron in a chemically pure condition, and in quanti
ties sufficient to admit    of the attainment of thoroughly trustworthy results
in the study of the physical and chemical properties of the pure metal and
of its alloys.     His researches in this direction have recently been crowned
with success ; and the method of producing pure iron, which he has elabo
rated, promises to be fruitful in interesting and important results in the
hands of himself and the other chemists with whom he has been associated
in this inquiry.

112                             Anniversary Meeting.                         [Nov. 30,
   Dr.Matthiessen's     researches,   published in the Philosophical Transactions,
on the action of oxidizing agents upon organic bases and on the chemical
constitution of narcotics (the latter investigation having been condncted in
conjunction with Professor G. C. Foster), furnish proofs of the success of his
labours in organic chemistry. The accounts published in our * Proceedings,'
of the results of his most recent researches in this branch of chemical
science, show that he has entered upon a line of investigation as productive
of interesting and important results      as any which he has yet pursued.        Thus,
he has already established an intimate relation          between    the organic bases
morphia and codeia,       and  has shown that when either         of  these is treated
with hydrochloric acid, a new base is produced, which he has called apo-
morphia, and which, though only differing from the powerful narcotic
morphia by the elements of water, possesses the very distinct characteristics
of  a most powerful emetic. The substance known as Papaverine, hitherto
regarded as a distinct organic base, is at the present time the subject of
Dr. Matthiessen's study, and promises to yield results of considerable
interest.
    Dr. Matthiessen's     researches   are distinguished    as well for their diversity
as for their uniformly      complete and trustworthy       character.
       Dr. Matthiessen,
    I have great pleasure in presenting you with this Medal, which you              will
receive    as a mark    of the value which the Royal Society attaches to your
researches,    and the interest with      which it regards your continuation of
them.
    Before concluding, I have to acquaint you that the Society will in future
years have an additional Medal to bestow.            Dr. John Davy, brother of Sir
 Humphry Davy, has bequeathed to the Royal Society, in fulfilment of an
expressed     wish of his illustrious    brother,  a service   of Plate,  presented  to
Sir Humphry Davy for the invention of the Safety Lamp, to be employed
in founding a Medal to be given annually for the most important dis
 covery in Chemistry made in Europe or Anglo-America.                   The directions
 given  in  the will, respecting    the  manner   in which    the plate  should be dis
 posed of, have been fulfilled, and the proceeds invested in India securities,
 yielding a little more than a630 a year ; and it now remains with your
 Council to determine the form of the Medal, and to specify the conditions
 under which it will be awarded.

                                         (Abstract.)
  I  submit to the Society the present exposition of some of the elementary
principles of an Abstract m-dimensional geometry.      The science presents
itself in two ways, — as   legitimate extension of the ordinary two- and three-
                           a
dimensional geometries    ; and as a need in these geometries and in analysis
generally.  In    fact whenever we are concerned witli quantities connected
together in any manner, and which are, or are considered as variable or
determinable, then the nature of the relation between the quantities is fre
quently rendered more intelligible by regarding them (if only two or three
in number)  as the coordinates of a point in a plane or in space ; for more
than three quantities there        is,
                               from the greater complexity of the case, the
greater need of such     representation
                           a              but this can only be obtained
                                                 ;                                        by
means   of the notion of  space of the proper dimensionality
                               a                                and to use ;
such representation, we require the geometry of such space.      An impor
tant instance in plane geometry has actually presented itself in the ques
tion of the determination of the curves which satisfy given conditions the         :
conditions imply relations between the coefficients in the equation of the
curve   and for the better understanding of these relations
        ;                                                    was expedient
                                                                      it
to consider the  coefficients as the coordinates of point in  space of the
                                                                 a     a
proper dimensionality.
  A  fundamental notion in the general theory presents               itself, slightly    in

plane geometry, but already very prominently in solid geometry ; viz. we
have here the difficulty as to the form of the equations of a curve in space,
or (to speak more accurately) as to the expression by means of equations
of the twofold relation between the coordinates of a point of such curve.
The notion in question is that of a A-fold relation, — as distinguished from
any system of equations (or onefold relations) serving for the expression of
  — and giving rise to the problem how to express such relation
it,                                                                    means                           by
of  system of equations (or onefold relations). Applying to the case of solid
     a
geometry my conclusion in the general theory,     may be mentioned that   it                                     I
regard the twofold relation of curve in space as being completely and pre
                                                a
cisely expressed by means of system of equations
                                               a                                (P=0, Q=0,            . .   T=0),

constant or variable                     integral   coefficients,        of   the    others of them, and
when   every surface whatever which passes through the curve has its
equation expressible in the form U=AP+BQ               +KT, with constant     .
                                                                              .

      In the preparation of the bromide for                      the purposes of our experiments,
we followed the direction given by                         Fittig and Konig, by whom this sub
stance was first described.   Bromine was added drop   drop to well-cooled           by
ethylbenzol in the proportion   of  mol. bromine to 1mol. ethylbenzol, and      1
the mixture was allowed to stand one or two days before distillation.  The
action of bromine upon ethylbenzol     extremely energetic, each
                                                           is                                            drop of

hydrocarbon, the mixture, unless carefully cooled, becomes very                                         hot, and
large quantities of hydfobromic acid are evolved.   It   easy to                          is                perceive

 the succeeding drops of bromine disappear with far less rapidity, a fact
 which evidently indicates that the substitution of the first atom of bromine
 is more easily effected than that of the second.           After standing for about
 forty-eight hours, the liquid was shaken with a dilute solution of caustic
 soda, and then repeatedly washed with water, dried over calcium chloride,
 and submitted to fractional distillation.
     The liquid    commenced     to boil at about 145°, and a comparatively large
  quantity passed over between       150° and 160°; a still larger fraction distilled
  over between 1/0° and 180°; but the greater portion came over between 180°
  and 190°, after which the temperature rapidly rose, and the residue in the
 flask became nearly solid, owing to the formation of a mixture of metastyrol
  and styrolbromide.        Throughout the process of distillation large quantities
  of hydrobromic acid       were   evolved,  and   the portion boiling between 150°
  and   1 60° was found by the characteristic bromine reaction to consist mainly
  of styrol,

  An analysis of the portion boiling        between 180°-190° showed it to contain
  very nearly    the theoretical   amount    of bromine calculated for

     This compound is very unstable ; on renewed distillation it invariably
 commences to boil at about 140°, and unless the distillation is very rapidly
 conducted,     a large proportion is transformed into styrol and hydrobromic
 acid. So easily is this decomposition effected, that on exposing 4 or 5
 grms. of the liquid in a sealed tube to a temperature of about 200° for a
 few minutes, it is almost entirely converted into metastyrol, and on open
 ing the tube torrents of hydrobromic acid are evolved.             The formation of
 styrol may, however, be almost entirely avoided by conducting the distil
 lation in a partial vacuum ; and for this purpose the water-pump of Bunsen
 may be very conveniently applied.            The accompanying figure shows the
 disposition   of  the  apparatus employed for this purpose ; as it may here
 after be found useful in operations of a like nature, the following descrip
 tion of its arrangement may not be superfluous : —The apparatus may
 easily be adapted to the process of fractional distillation in vacuo ; by a
 slight modification it is possible to change the receiver without disturbing
the partial vacuum in the remaining parts of the apparatus.
    A represents the flask from which the liquid is distilled ; it is fitted
with a good cork pierced with two holes, into one of which fits a thermo
meter,     and into the other     a piece   of thermometer tubing (B), one end of
which nearly reaches to the bottom of the flask, and is drawn out into a
fine capillary tube ; to the other end a screw-clamp is fixed by means of a
short piece of caoutchouc tubing.             The object of this capillary tube is to

deliver a minute      stream of air-bubbles, and thus to prevent the violent
"bumping" which almost invariably occurs during ebullition in vacuo;
the supply of air may be regulated at will by increasing or diminishing the
pressure of the screw-clamp on the caoutchouc tubing.           This little device
succeeds admirably ; it is due to my friend Mr. W. Dittmar, who has
already applied it in the distillation of sulphuric acid : so rapidly and effec
tually does the "water-pump" of Bunsen exhaust, that the minute amount
of air passing through the liquid, and serving        to maintain   it in regular
 ebullition, is without appreciable effect upon the manometer.           The flask
is attached, as represented in the figure, to a long tube C, made preferably
 of thin glass, so as to allow the condensation and cooling to take place as
rapidly as possible : over the end of the condennser slides a short length
 of wider glass tubing, which is fastened air-tight on to the condenser by
 an inch or two   of caoutchouc tubing    ; the other end fits into a  caoutchouc
 cork adapted to the receivers ; on this short piece of wider tubing another
 piece of glass tubing is fixed at right angles, in order to connect the entire

 apparatus with the caoutchouc tubing leading to the water-pump."             The
 mode of using the apparatus hardly requires description ; it will be self-
 evident to anyone familiar to the working of the Bunsen pump.
    Distilled in a partial vacuum (about 0 5 m.) in the apparatus above de
scribed, the bromide boiled nearly constantly at 1480-152°, and left scarcely
any residue of styrolbromide or metastyrol.         The bromide thus obtained
is  a heavy colourless liquid, possessing the characteristic penetrating odour
peculiar to all the aromatic substitution products in which the substitution
 has occurred in the lateral group ; its vapour is extremely irritating, and
 excites a copious flow of tears when incautiously inhaFed.         When heated
 with solution of ammonia or potash in alcohol, it gives up its bromine witli
 the greatest  facility.
    The monobromethylbenzol,        C8H4Br{C2Hs, described by Fittig, is a
 colourless aromatic-smelling     liquid, possessing the sp. gr. l-34, boiling
constantly at 199° C, and capable of being distilled without decomposition.
 It may be boiled or heated in sealed tubes for any length of time with al

coholic solution of potash or ammonia without giving up the least trace of
bromine.      It is evident, therefore, that the two bromides, although pre
pared under circumstances apparently exactly similar, are not identical.              In
all probability the bromide we obtained is identical with that recently pre
pared by Berthelot by acting upon boiling ethylbenzol with the vapour of
bromine.      To this compound the formula C^HjfCjHjBr is assigned ; it
cannot be distilled without      a considerable portion undergoing decomposition
into styrol and hydrobromic acid, and loses easily its bromine by double
decomposition.
   It remained now to discover the cause of the variation in the position of
the bromine atom.        In the preparation of the two products the conditions
were apparently identical    ;   why, then, should the substitution have occurred
in the phenyl group in the bromide obtained by Fittig, and in the ethyl
group in our own ? The cause of the difference was soon found to reside
in the bromine employed.          The bromine used by Fittig doubtless contained
iodine.    By digesting    a   few grains   of   the bromine employed in our expe
riments with water and granulated zinc, and, on the complete disappear
ance of all colour, filtering the solution, adding a small quantity of chlorine-
water,   and then shaking the mixture with a few drops of benzol, the absence
of  even a trace     of iodine was shown by the benzol remaining perfectly
colourless.      By adding about     0-5  %   iodine to the bromine before allowing
it to act upon the ethylbenzol,       I  easily succeeded in obtaining monobrom-
ethylbenzol with the properties described by Fittig.            It distilled constantly
without decomposition at 203° C, and completely resisted the action of
boiling alcoholic potash.        A similar series of comparative experiments on
cymol obtained from camphor was attended with like results.                   We have
thus  a  ready method of effecting at will the kind of substitution required
without the employment of heat, the presence or absence of iodine deter
mines the position of the substituting bromine ; in the one case substitution
occurs in the phenyl group, in the other in the lateral group.                The bro
mine obtained by      Berthelot   is described    as boiling between   200°  and 210°,
whilst the bromide which          I  obtained distilled     at 190°.    I  am disposed,
however, to consider the higher number to be a nearer approximation to
the truth.      The difference observed in my case is probably due to the fact
that  in  distilling the substance I operated on a larger scale than did Ber
thelot, and kept the liquid exposed to the influence of the high temperature
for a comparatively longer time, thus working under conditions more
favourable to the production of styrol and hydrobromic acid, the formation
of which would necessarily tend to lower the boiling-point.
   Nearly seven years ago Dr. Hugo Miiller drew attention to the remark
able  effect of iodine in facilitating the action of chlorine upon organic
compounds.         He showed that many substances which were acted upon
with great difficulty by chlorine alone, and some of them only with the aid
of direct sunlight, yield chlorine products with great ease when acted upon
by chlorine in the presence of iodine.             He failed, however, to point out

any difference in the hind of substitution                         effected   by the halogen in the
presence or absence of iodine.
   Beilstein also has recently shown tha} the action upon toluol varies ma
terially with the conditions under which the experiment is performed.
When a stream of chlorine is passed through carefully cooled toluol, chlor-
toluol,     C0     H1C1{CH.:,         only    is    formed; this body         is characterized by a
high degree of stability, resisting completely the action of potassium cyan
ide, potassium sulphide, and silver-salts. On the other hand, if the toluol is
previously heated, or      through the energy of the action, its temperature be
                                    if,
allowed to rise, the relative position of the substituting chlorine atom essen                      is
tially changed, and under these circumstances chlorbenzyl, C6H,{CHaCl,
is  found to be the main product of the reaction   this substance differs:
from the isomeric chlortoluol by the facility with which    yields up its              it

            double decomposition.   But     small quantity of iodine be

added to the hydrocarbon before treatment with chlorine, chlortoluol only
is produced, no matter whether the chlorine acts upon boiling or upon cold
toluol.

which the compound yielded its bromine to alcoholic ammonia,   was in

duced to attempt the preparation of the corresponding amines.    quantity
of the bromide was sealed up in wide glass tubes with about four times its
volume of absolute alcohol              saturated with ammoniacal gas, and the mix
ture exposed to           a   temperature of 100° C. for about three hours.  When
all action had apparently ended,  the tubes were reopened and the liquid
portion drained from the bulky precipitate of ammonium bromide.        On

heated with about 40 grms. potassium acetate     to 100°      flask placed in       in   a
a   water-bath.          The liquid   filtered from the mass of potassium
                                          was then

reopened and the contents treated with water, and the non-miscible portion
separated       and dried over calcium chloride.
                                               On standing over the calcium
chloride,   crystalline precipitate was slowly formed, which was afterwards

ing the characteristic        fragrant odour of the acetic ethers and boiling at

further investigation, or any attempt to prepare the alcohol.

     I have attempted to repeat this reaction with the bromide obtained by
 treating ethylbenzol with bromine free from iodine, but without success,
  although the experiment has been frequently made under the exact con
  ditions described by Fittig.           So easily, according to Fittig, is the transfor
  mation effected, that this chemist has recommended the reaction as afford
  ing the best method of obtaining phenylpropionic acid.                  I am unable to
  discover any reason for the discrepancy in the results of our observations.
  It is certainly very remarkable that the reaction should occur in the case
  of the chloride and not in that of the bromide.
      The experiments which led to the discovery of the above method of
  effecting the substitution of hydrogen in the phenyl or in the lateral group
  at will had for their object the preparation by synthesis           of ethylbenzoic acid
  from    the bromide, Ce H4 Br{CaH5.                It therefore became interesting to
  trace the reaction which occurs on submitting the new bromide to a similar
  treatment.      A small quantity (about 7 grms.) of the bromide was mixed
  with about five times its volume of anhydrous ether, and a large excess of
   sodium cut into slices as thin as possible added, and a slow continuous

reaction was perceptible in the cold.          The sodium remained perfectly me
tallic-looking, even after the expiration of twenty-four hours.               On gently
heating the liquid for a few minutes, a vigorous reaction at once set in ;
the mass became suddenly very hot, and gave off abundant fumes of hy-

"   Some Account of the Suez         Canal, in      a Letter to the President."
     By   J.  F. Bateman, Esq., F.B.S.           Received January        3, 1870.
                                                  1G Great George Street, Westminster.
                                                          27th December,   1869.
     My dear Sir Edward, — On my return from the opening of the Suez
Canal, where, by your kind selection, I had the honour of representing the
Royal Society as the guest of the Viceroy, I think it incumbent on me to
 give a short account of my journey and my impressions of the great and
 important undertaking which was so magnificently inaugurated.
     Nothing could exceed the splendid hospitality of the Viceroy, who had
 in every possible way provided for the accommodation and the comfort of
 his guests.     The crowd of visitors, however, was so great, and his own
 personal attendance was so constantly given to the Empress of the French,
 the Emperor of Austria, and other Royal personages who honoured him
  with their company, that it was almost impossible for him to bestow any
  special attention on other individual guests ; but few or none could com
  plain of any want of attention or of any material inconvenience.
     I was fortunate in being present at every important point and on every
  important occasion, and in receiving all the civilities which might be con
  sidered   due to the representative  of  the Royal Society.
     Of the work itself I have no hesitation in pronouncing it a decided
  success — not all that could be desired, nor all that was promised, and very
  far from being finished, even on the contracted scale on which it has been
  executed.     A reef of rocks at Serapeum, extending for about 85 metres
  in length, at a depth of 16 or 17 feet below the surface of the canal,
  and which was not discovered        till just   before   the period fixed for the
  opening, at present limits the      draft of vessels which can use the navi
  gation.     There are some objectionable curves and narrow places, and many
  miles of unprotected slopes, all of which must be improved or remedied
  before    the canal  can  be placed in a satisfactory condition.         Still, in its
  present state, vessels drawing not more than 1 6 feet can pass from end to
   end with facility and safety ; and when the rocks alluded to are removed,
   the depth will be increased to 21 or 22 feet.
      For years before the commencement of the project which has been, so
   far, happily concluded, the practicability of forming and maintaining a
   maritime canal between the lied Sea and the Mediterranean was a much-
   disputed point among modern engineers.             It was known that a water
   communication between the two seas had existed and been maintained for
   600 years before,   and for about 800 years after, the commencement of the
   Christian era  ; subsequent to which time it was allowed to fall into decay,
   and for a thousand years has so remained.
      The first idea, in modern times, of restoring this ancient water commu

  nication, or of forming another more suitable to existing circumstances,
  seems to be due to the Emperor Napoleon I.
                                                       (then General Bonaparte),
  who, nt the close of the last century, during his occupation of Egypt,
  directed that     a complete survey of the ancient canal should be made-
  under the direction of M. Lepere, a French engineer of reputation.         This
  survey was completed, and a project for a canal was designed in accordance
  with the apparent facts resulting from M. Lepere-s survey. The evacuation
  of the country by the French put          an end to further investigation,  and
  arrested all progress in this direction for many years.
     The conclusion at which M. Lepere arrived was, that the level of         the
  Red Sea at high water at Suez was 30j feet higher than low water in         the
  Mediterranean in Pelusium Bay ; and his scheme was projected in             ac
 cordance with the existence of such a difference in the level of             the
 two seas.       He  also  ascertained  that the rise and fall of the tide in the
  Red   Sea   was 5^ or 6 feet, and in the Mediterranean about 1 foot,
 leaving   still  a difference of 25 feet between the respective low waters of
 the two seas.
     Doubts of the accuracy of the statement as to the difference of these
 levels were entertained by those who carefully considered the subject ;
 but it was not till the year 1847 that these doubts were set at rest.
  In that year the late Mr. Robert Stephenson, in conjunction with M.
 Talabot,   a  French engineer, M. de Negrelli, an Austrian engineer, and Li-
  nant Bey, a French engineer in the Egyptian service, directed a series of
  independent levellings across the Isthmus, which determined beyond all
  doubt the important fact that " at low water there was no essential dif
  ference  in the level of the two seas, and that at high water it was not
  more   than 4 feet, the rise of tide being about 1 foot in the Mediter
  ranean and about 6 feet in the Red Sea."          Up to that time Mr. Stephen
  son seems to have been in favour of the proposal to form a canal across
  the Isthmus, in accordance with the views of Linant Bey, who " proposed
 to carry a canal from the Red Sea through the Bitter Lakes to Lake
 Timsah, and thence through the lagoons of Menzaleh to Tineh (Pelusium)
 on the Mediterranean :" it was " thus expected to create a current through
 the canal of three or four miles an hour;" and " the project appeared very
 feasible, and was calculated to excite high hopes of success."           When,
 however, it was ascertained that the level of the two seas was practically
 the same, Mr. Stephenson remarked "it became evident that it would
 not be practicable to keep open a level cut or canal without any current
 between the two seas, and the project was abandoned."
     The fact of there being no difference in the level of the two seas led
 other men to very different conclusions ; for shortly after the period here
 referred to, M. Ferdinand Lesseps conceived the idea which has since been
so successfully realized.         His project was to cut a great canal on the
level of the two seas by the nearest and most practicable route, which lay
                                                                    L 2

  along the valley or depression containing Lake Menzaleb, Lake Ballah,
  Lake Timsah, and the Bitter Lakes. The character of this route was well
  described in 1830 by General (then Captain) Chesney, R.A., who examined
¦
  and drew up a report on the country between the Mediterranean and the
  Red Sea.    At that time a difference of 30 feet between the two seas was still
  assumed, and all proposals for canals were laid out on that assumption.
  Allowance must, of course, be made for this error, in so far as it affected
  any particular project of canal ; but it would not affect the accuracy of
  any general   description of the district to be traversed.     General Chesney
                                        '' as to the executive part, there is but
  summed up his report by stating,
  one opinion : there are no serious difficulties ; not a single mountain in
  tervenes, scarcely  what deserves to be called   a hillock ; and in a country
  where labour can be had without limit, and at a rate infinitely below that
  of any other part of the world, the expense would be a moderate one for
  a single nation, and scarcely worth dividing among the great kingdoms of
  Europe, who would all be benefited by the measure."
     M. Lesseps was well advised therefore in the route he selected, and
  (assuming the possibility of keeping open the canal) in the character of
  the project he proposed.
     From 1849 to 1854 he was occupied in maturing his project for a
 direct   canalization of the Isthmus.        In the latter year Mahomet Said
  Pasha became Viceroy of Egypt, and sent at once for M. Lesseps to con
 sider with him the propriety of carrying out the work he had in view.
 The result of this interview was, that on the 30th of November in the
 same year a Commission was signed at Cairo charging M. Lesseps to con
 stitute and direct a Company named "The Universal Suez Canal Com
 pany." In the following year, 1855, M. Lesseps, acting for the Viceroy,
 invited a number of gentlemen eminent as directors of public works, as
 engineers,  and distinguished in other ways, to form an International Com
 mission for the purpose of considering and reporting on the practicability
 of forming a ship canal between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.
 This Commission, which included some of the ablest civil and military
 engineers of Europe, was honorary, and its members were considered as
 guests of the Viceroy.
    The Commission met in Egypt in December 1855 and January 1856,
and, accompanied by M. Lesseps, and by Mougel Bey and Linant Bey,
engineers, and other gentlemen in the service of the Viceroy, they made
a careful examination of the harbours in the two seas and of the in
tervening Desert,     and   arrived at the conclusion that a ship canal was
practicable between the Gulf of Pelusium in the Mediterranean and the Red
Sea near Suez.       They differed, however, as to the mode in which such a
canal should be constructed. The three English engineering members of the
Commision     were   of opinion that   a ship canal raised 25 feet above the
sea-level,  and communicating      with the Bay of Pelusium at one end and

  1870.1               Mr.  J. F. Bateman on      the Suez     Canal.              135
  the Red Sea at the other, by means of locks, and supplied with water
  from the Nile, was the best mode of construction.             The foreign members,
  on the contrary, held that a canal 27 feet below sea-level, from sea to sea,
  without any lock, and with harbours at each end, was the best system : the
  harbours to be formed by piers and dredging out to deep water.
     The whole of the Members of the Commission, with the exception of
  Mr. Rendel, met at Paris in June 1856, when the views of the English
  engineers were,      after full   discussion, rejected, and the report to the
  Viceroy   recommended      the system which has since been carried out.         The
 Commission estimated the work to cost £8, 000,000.
     Two   years   from the date of this report were spent in conferences and
 preliminary     steps before M. Lesseps obtained the necessary funds for
 carrying out the works.         About half the capital required was subscribed
 on the Continent,       by  far  the larger portion being taken in France, and
 the other half was found by the Viceroy.             Further time was necessarily
 lost in preparation, and it was not till near the close of I860 that the work
 was actually commenced.
     In this interval two " Reports on the subject of the Deposits of the
 Delta of the Nile" were made by Admiral (then Captain) T. Spratt, R.N.,
 C.B., F.R.S., extracts from which were printed by order of the House of
 Commons in 1860.          They embraced       "An   Enquiry into    the Soundness   of
 M. Lesseps-s Reasonings        and Arguments on the practicability       of the Suez
 Canal," and "An Investigation of the effect of the prevailing Wave-in
fluence on the Nile-s Deposits, and upon the Littoral of its Delta." These
documents were dated respectively 30th January and 9th July 1858.
    The conclusion      to which    Captain    Spratt arrived was adverse to M.
 Lesseps-s project.       He was of opinion that it would be next to impossible
to keep open any harbour to the eastward of the mouths of the Nile; and
he warned "the commercial interest against risking their millions in the
undertaking."        He contended that the material brought to the sea by
the Nile, and which is carried eastwards by the prevailing winds and cur
rents, would accumulate against the piers or jetties proposed to be carried
out to deep water at Port Sai8d, so rapidly and to such an extent as to
prevent     the maintenance       of  a  sufficient  harbour.     He thought " the
sands of the Nile would mount over the piers of Said," and he did not
believe that any amount of dredging would overcome the difficulties.
    It was against such opinions from high          authority that M. Lesseps had
to contend     ; but his confidence in his project and his courage and per
severance     never failed him.      As time went on, he had other difficulties
ahead.
    The original concession granted extraordinary privileges to the Com
pany.     It included or contemplated the formation of a " sweet-water "
canal for the use of the workmen engaged ; and the Company were to be
come proprietors      of all the land which could      be irrigated by means   of this

136                 Mr.  J.  F. Bateman on     the Suez   Canal.            [Jan. 6,
canal.     One of the conditions of the concession also was, that the Viceroy
should procure forced labour for the execution of the work ; and soon after
the commencement of operations, and for some time, the number of work
men so engaged amounted to from 25,000 to 30,000.           The work, thus com
menced,     steadily proceeded until 1862, when the late Viceroy, during
his visit to this country at the time of the International Exhibition, re
quested Mr. Hawkshaw, F.R.S., to visit the canal and report on the con
dition of the works and the practicability of its being successfully com
pleted and maintained.       His Highness-s instructions were, that Mr. Hawk
shaw should make an examination of the works quite independently of the
French     Company and their engineers, and report, from his own personal
examination and consideration, the result at which he arrived.                If his
report were favourable,    the  work  would  be proceeded  with  ; if unfavourable,
it would at once be stopped.
   Mr. Hawkshaw proceeded          to Egypt upon this important commission in
 November of the same year; and in February 1863 he wrote a well-con
sidered report which may be said to have in great measure contributed
to the rapid and successful completion of the work.                Mr. Hawkshaw
described the works of the canal which had been already executed, and
those which remained at that time unfinished.             He examined and dis
cussed the dimensions of the various parts then in progress, recommend
ing various alterations ; and having carefully gone into all the details of
construction, he proceeded to investigate the question of maintenance, with
reference to which it had been urged by opponents : —
   " 1st. That the canal will become a stagnant ditch.
   " 2nd. That the canal will silt up, or that the moving      sands   of the Desert
will fill it up.
   " 3rd. That the Bitter Lakes through which the            canal is to pass    will
be filled up with salt.
   "  4th. That the navigation of the Red Sea is dangerous and difficult.
   " 5th. That shipping       will not approach Port Said, because of the
difficulties that will be met with, and the danger of that port on a lee-
shore.
   " 6th. That it will    be difficult, if  not impracticable, to keep open      the
Mediterranean entrance      to the canal."
   Having analyzed      each  of  these objections, and fully weighed the ar
guments on which they were based, he came to the following conclusions
as to the practicability of construction and of maintenance : —
    "1st. As regards the engineering construction, there are no works on
the canal presenting on their face any unusual difficulty of execution, and
there are no contingencies, that I can conceive, likely to arise that would
introduce difficulties insurmountable by engineering skill.
   "  2ndly. As regards the maintenance of the canal, I am of opinion that no
obstacles    would be met with that would prevent the work, when completed,

being maintained with      ease and   efficiency, and without the necessity of
incurring any extraordinary or unusual yearly expenditure."
    The whole of Mr. Hawkshaw-s report is well worthy of perusal ; and I
 must congratulate him on the sound conclusions at which he arrived, and
 on the foresight by which he was enabled to point out difficulties and con
 tingencies which have since arisen.       Could he at that time have seen the
 full realization of the work, he would scarcely have altered the report
 he wrote.
     Said Pasha died between the period of Mr. Hawkshaw-s examination of
 the country and the date of his report.         He was succeeded by his brother
 Ismail, the present Viceroy or Khedive, who, alarmed at the largeness
 and uncertainty of the grants to the Canal Company, of the proprietor
 ship of land which could be irrigated by the Sweet-water Canal, and
 anxious to retire from the obligation of finding forced labour for the con
 struction of the works, refused to ratify or agree to the concessions
granted by his brother.      The whole question was referred to the arbitration
of the present Emperor of the French, who kindly undertook the task,
and awarded      the sum of ^63,800,000        to be paid by the Viceroy        to the
 Canal Company as indemnification for the loss they would sustain by the
withdrawal of forced or native labour, for the retrocession of large grants of
land, and for the abandonment of other privileges attached to the original
Act of Concession. This money was applied to the prosecution of the
 works.
    The withdrawal of native labour involved very important changes in the
 mode of conducting the works, and occasioned             at the time considerable
 delay.     Mechanical appliances  for the   removal   of  the material, and Euro
 pean skilled labour, had to be substituted ; these had to be recruited from
different parts of Europe, and great difficulty was experienced in pro
curing them.       The accessory canals had to be widened for the conveyance
of larger dredging-machines, and additional dwellings had to be provided for
the accommodation of European labourers.               All   these difficulties   were
overcome, and the work proceeded.
    Since the date of  Mr. Hawkshaw-s Report, viz. February         1863, much has
been said    and written upon the operations of the canal as they were going
on, and upon its prospects of success.       Sir William Denison, K.C.B., R.E.,
presented the Institution of Civil Engineers, in April 1867, with a paper
on the condition of the works as he found them at the end of 1866, which
led to an animated discussion upon the whole subject.              The conclusions
at which Sir William Denison himself arrived were : —
    '' 1st. That (subject, of course, to the condition that the relative levels
of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean are as stated by the French autho
rities) there will be no extraordinary difficulty in carrying an open salt
water channel from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea of the depth pro
posed, namely 8 metres.                                                                ,

   "   2nd. That no special difficulty   in maintaining    this channel   need be
anticipated.
   " 3rd. That it will be necessary to modify the section proposed by the
French engineers, making the side slopes much more gradual.
   " 4th. That the cost of maintaining the above-mentioned depth of water
will be found at first to be largely in excess of the amount estimated.
Eventually, it is by no means impossible that means may be found to fix
or check the drift of sand, or to shut it out from the canal.              But for
some years it must be expected that the ordinary action             of the   atmo
sphere, which has filled up former excavations made in this dry
                                                                            desert,
will   have the same effect on the new canal.
    " Looking    at the work as an engineer, there does not appear to be any
difficulty which    a skilful application of capital may not overcome."
    In the discussion which followed, while       on the one hand Sir William
Denison's views     were well supported, much was said, on the other hand, of
the difficulties which would attend the construction, and the impossibility
of keeping open the harbours and the canal. The old questions of silting
up and stagnation were discussed ; and quotations from the correspondence
of Mr. R. Stephenson with M. de Negrelli were read, with the object of
showing the absurdity of the whole scheme.            In one of these quotations
Mr. Stephenson thus expresses himself :       —
    " In conclusion, Sir, I will only say that I have — indeed I can have —
no hostility to a maritime canal through the Isthmus of Suez.          If  I could
regard such a canal as commercially advantageous, 1 have already shown
that I should be the first to give it the advantage of my time, my money,
 and my experience.        It was because, after elaborate investigation, and in
 conjunction with such men as M. Talabot, I arrived at a clear conclusion
 that the project was not one which deserved serious attention, that I
 refused to give it support.      I should be delighted to see a channel like the
 Dardanelles or the Bosphorus penetrating the Isthmus that divides the
 Red Sea from the Mediterranean.          But I know that such   a channel is im
 practicable — that nothing can be effected even by the most unlimited
 expenditure of time and life and money beyond the formation of a
 stagnant ditch, between two almost tideless seas, unapproachable by large
 ships under any circumstances, and only capable of being used by small
 vessels when the prevalent winds permit        their exit and their entrance.    I
 believe   that the project will prove abortive in itself and ruinous to its con
 structors ; and entertaining that view, I will no longer permit it to be said
 that, by abstaining from expressing myself fully on the subject, I am
 tacitly allowing capitalists to throw away their money on what my know
 ledge assures me to be an unwise and unremunerative speculation."
     It was shown also by calculations that the evaporation from the Bitter
 Lakes alone, without taking into consideration the long length of canal,
 was such that the channel from the Red Sea to the lakes was much too

small to supply the loss, and that the result would be that the water in these
Lakes must settle to a level below the low water of a spring tide in the Red
Sea.    It was urged too that there would be great difficulty in maintaining
the entrances    to the harbours and the harbours themselves, and that bars
would inevitably form at each end of the canal.
   It will be seen therefore that, so recently as 1 867, opinions were strongly
against the success of the canal, those persons who entertained contrary
views being in a considerable minority.
   In the commencement of this year Mr. John Fowler, C.E., wrote an
                      '               -
excellent letter to      The Times      on the condition in which he then found the
canal, and upon its prospects.           The observations which he made, and the
conclusions   at  which he      arrived,  seem to have been carefully formed and
well grounded.       He stated that the cost would greatly exceed the original
estimate,   although      the works were      carried out of much less than the
originally proposed dimensions — that the works             were in truth simple in
character, and in a soil favourable to execution, but of such vast magnitude,
and in a country presenting such peculiar difficulties in climate, and in the
absence of fresh water, that special organization and adoption of means of
no ordinary kind were required for their realization.             He was of opinion
that large quantities of alluvium would find their way into the harbour at
Port Said, and that it would be necessary to make the western break
water solid to prevent the deposit being carried through, as at present —
nevertheless    that no apprehension need be entertained as to the channel
and  harbour    being silted up and destroyed, but that considerable expense
in dredging would be constantly required.           He agreed with Mr. Hawkshaw
that the amount of drifting sand would not be such as materially to inter
fere with maintenance, that various means            might be adopted for limiting
the amount, but that, after every precaution, it would be necessary to
employ one or two powerful dredges to keep the canal clear from the sand
blown in.     He   was further     of opinion that the protection of the slopes by
stone would     be necessary.        With reference to the evaporation from the
Bitter Lakes, and the current from the Red Sea to those Lakes, he be
lieved that it would not be strong enough to affect injuriously the bottom
or sides of the channel, after they had been properly protected by stone
pitching.     Mr. Fowler then entered into a consideration of the mode in
which the traffic should be carried on and the probable use to be made of
the canal, and concluded his letter with         a well-deserved compliment to the
remarkable energy and perseverance of M. Lesseps, to the skill and re
sources of M. Voisin, the Engineer-in-chief,             and the district engineers
acting  under   him,    and  to the  great powers  of organization and high qualities
of M. Levalley, the contractor.
   The total length of the canal from Port Said              to Suez is 99 miles ;  it
varies in width from 196 feet to 327 feet, having, however, in each case a
width of 72 feet in the centre, the slopes on each side of this centre

 width    varying with the character of the material cut through.             Near
 Port   Said,   and through the shallow lake of Menzaleh, the material is very
 sandy ; and here and elsewhere, under similar circumstances, the slopes
 must be protected by stone pitching or facing, or they will wash down
 by the action of passing vessels, and the material thus deposited in
 the bottom of the canal must be removed by dredging.              Further south,
 the material generally becomes more argillaceous and stony ; and here the
 slopes will be much more easily maintained, though nearly throughout the
 whole length of the canal some stone protection at the level of the water
 will  be required.
     Before reaching Lake Timsah, which lies about midway between Port
 Said and Suez, the canal passes through the deep cutting of El Guisr, which
 at its greatest depth is 85 feet to the bottom of the canal. The lower
 part of this excavation, at and a little above the level of the water, con
 sists of soft clay, above which is a concreted mass of shells and sand ;
 and this is covered by loose sand liable to be acted on by the wind.          The
 canal   here   is curved and narrow, and      ought to be improved in both re
 spects.    It   is  again  restricted in width    through the deep cutting at
 Serapeum     ;  but here, the material being argillaceous and strong, the slope
 will  be easily maintained in shape.      From the Bitter Lakes to     Suez  it is
 a wide, noble, and well-finished      canal.
    Out of the whole length, nearly 30 miles are through Lake Timsah and
 the Bitter Lakes, 5 \ miles in the first, and 23£ in the latter.        In these
 lakes a deep channel has been dredged out, which is marked by buoys and
 stakes.    These vast sheets of water in the midst of the Desert, on which
 so many noble vessels were floating,        had been but a few months before
mere dry depressions,       covered by a stratum of salt. The filling them with
water commenced         in February from the Mediterranean, and in July from
the Red Sea.        They were filled by the beginning of October, thus belying
one of the many unfavourable prophecies, that the absorption and evapo
ration would be so great that they would never fill at all, or, if they did, the
current inwards in both directions would be so great       as to be destructive of
the canal.
    On our voyage from Port Said to near Lake Timsah there was a cur
rent setting against us towards the Mediterranean.            We anchored about
f   mile from the end of this portion of the canal, and at daylight the next
morning there was a current in the same direction of nearly 1| mile an
hour.     Our time of starting from Lake Timsah was purposely delayed till
near midday, that we might have the tide from the Red Sea against us,
and deep water over the rocks at Serapeum.             The current towards Lake
Timsah was strong ; and on the following morning, between the Bitter Lakes
and Suez, it ran at 3| miles per hour, but a strong southerly wind accom
panied the tide. We had no opportunity of making observations our
selves, or of obtaining information ; but my impression is that at this season

   This is an interesting as well as important question ; and it is to be hoped
that regular observations will be taken at all points along the canal, and at
each end, which may show accurately the rise and fall of tide, the velocity
and duration of the currents in each direction, and the relative height of the
various portions of the canal and the Lakes it traverses.

register), and including   fleet of British "iron-clads," which anchored within

harbour   is   formed   by
                      two jetties built of concrete blocks, the western one
being run out to sea, at right angles to the shore, for    distance of 2400   a
metres, and then turned eastwards for 300 metres more.           The eastern
jetty   starts from shore at      a    distance of 1400 metres from the western pier,
is   continued out to sea for            a   length of about 1700 metres, gradually
approaching to within about 700 metres of the western jetty at its termi
nation.
   The western jetty has been erected for protection, and for the purpose of
intercepting the sand and alluvial matter which are undoubtedly drifted
from the mouth of the Nile eastwards.               This work       is   too light and too open
effectually to answer its purpose, and requires improvement. Close in shore
a  considerable amount of the drifting sand has been arrested, and where
the sea recently flowed there     already an accumulation of dry land.

On the land thus formed    were erected  the temple in which the Viceroy
received his principal guests at the inauguration, and the temples for
the worship of the- Mahometan and Christian churches, where all the
religions of the world were supposed to be present and to ask blessing on             a
the great undertaking the opening of which they were assembled to cele
brate.   In its present condition, the jetty favours the deposit of material
within the harbour     and not until the passage of the sand through the

towards the seaward         end  of  the jetty.  The Company will no doubt     see
the necessity of completing the necessary works here and elsewhere. The
harbour at Port Said and portions of the canal will require pretty constant
dredging for some time ; but in my opinion neither this nor any other work
will entail any very serious expense in maintenance.
    The cost of the whole undertaking is stated to have been about
 £  16,000,000    sterling; and it may require from £2,000,000 to £4,000,000
 more to complete the work satisfactorily on its present scale of dimensions ;
 but interest has to be paid at present on about half only of the capital
hitherto raised.
    Many persons who           are  competent to form sound opinions on this
 point believe that the traffic will be quite sufficient to pay all cost of main
 tenance and handsome dividends ; but I am not sufficiently well informed
to hazard any conjecture on the purely financial part of the question.          In
an engineering point of view I consider the canal a great and most im
portant undertaking — great, however, only as respects its magnitude and
the country in which it has been executed.           There is not a work of art or
of difficulty     from one end to the other ; but there have been about
80,000,000      cubic yards of material excavated, and at one time nearly
30,000 labourers were employed in the works.            For their sustenance, and
before operations could be carried on with any vigour, sweet water had
 to be brought from the         Nile at Cairo, and distributed along the whole
length of the       canal.    This work was in itself one of considerable magni
tude.     It is a navigable canal from Cairo to Ismai-lia, and thence to Suez.
From Ismai-lia to Port Said and intervening places, the fresh water is con
veyed in pipes.        The surplus water has been applied to irrigation, the
fertilizing  results   of which are already visible, and may be expected to
perform an important part in the improvement of the country.
    The   canal   must be regarded as a great work, more from its relation
to the national and commercial interests of the world than from its en
gineering features.        In this light it is impossible to overestimate its im
portance.      It will effect a total revolution in the mode of conducting the
great traffic between the East and the West, the beneficial effects of which
1 believe it is difficult    to realize. It is in this sense that the undertaking
must be regarded as a great one ; and its accomplishment is due mainly to
the rare courage and indomitable perseverance of M, Ferdinand Lesseps,
who well deserves the respect he has created and the praises which have
been bestowed.        By cutting across the sandy ligaments which have hitherto
united Asia and Africa, a channel of water-communication has been opened
between the East and the West which will never again be closed so long as
mercantile prosperity lasts or civilization exists.

     The canal is intended throughout           to be 8 metres,     or 26 ft.  4 in. in
 depth.      In every case this depth is to be maintained for a width at the
 bottom    in   the centre of 72 feet, with slopes on each side of 2 horizontal to
  1 vertical to within a few feet of the surface.       In the wider portions of the
 canal  the   sides  above   this level are formed  with  flat slopes of 5 horizontal
 to 1 vertical, with a horizontal bench between the two slopes of 58 feet
 in width.       A  narrower bench is left where the canal is of the smaller
 width.

28  ft., often   above    30  ft. ; and the same may be said of the canal between
the Bitter Lakes and the Red Sea at Suez.                  On each side of the deep

 I.   The Application       of   the Microscope to the Investigation     of Meteorites.
      The difficulties in        of the complete investigation of a meteorite
                             the way
resemble     those we meet with in terrestrial rocks. In both the ingredient
minerals are minute, and are often, especially in the case of the aerolitic
rock, very imperfectly crystallized.    Moreover the methods for separating
them, whether mechanically or chemically, are very incomplete. With a
                  more satisfactory means of dealing with these aggre
view to obtain some
gates of mixed and minute minerals, I sought the aid of the microscope, by
having in the first place sections of small fragments cut from the meteorites
so as to be transparent.
   One may learn, by a study and comparison of such sections, something
concerning the changes that a meteorite has passed through ; for one soon
discovers that it has had a history, of which some of the facts are written in
legible characters on the meteorite itself; and one finds that it is not
difficult roughly to classify meteorites according to the varieties of their
structure.   In this way one recognizes constantly recurring minerals ; but
the method affords no means of determining what they are.          Even the
employment of polarized light, so invaluable where a crystal is examined by
it of which the crystallographic orientation is at all known, fails, except in
rare eases, to be  certain guide to even the system to which such minute

crystals belong. It was found that the only satisfactory way of dealing with
the problem was by employing the microscope chiefly as a means of select
ing and assorting out of the bruised debris of a part of the meteorite the
various minerals that compose           it,
                                   and then investigating each separately by
means     of the goniometerand by analysis, and finally recurring to the
microscopic     sectionsidentify and recognize the minerals so investi
                             to
gated. The present memoir deals with the former part of this inquiry.
Obviously the amount of each mineral thus determined, after great care
and search, can only be extremely small, as only very small amounts of                    a
meteorite can be spared for the purpose, notwithstanding that as large                    a
surface as possible of its material requires to be searched over for instances
of any one of the minerals occurring in less than usually incomplete form.

On this account      one has to operate with the greatest         caution in performing,
the analysis of      such    minerals  j      and the desirability of determining the
silica with more precision than            is   usually the case in operations on such
minute quantities of    silicate suggested to me the process, which, after

   II.  On the Method    of Analyzing Silicates that     do not gelatinize  with
                               Hydrogen     Chloride.
    The  process is conducted in an apparatus      of the following construction.
A platinum retort, 30 cub. centiras. in capacity, is fitted with       a tubulated
stopper of the same material, which reaches nearly to the bottom ; a small
tube entering the vertical tube of the stopper at an angle, above the neck of
the retort, conveys hydrogen to its interior.          The vertical tube can be
closed either by a stopper of platinum or by a funnel of that metal, stopped
in like manner at the top, and having a fine orifice at its lower extremity.
    To the side of the retort, just below its neck, a straight delivery-tube is
fixed, which in its turn fits into another platinum tube that, after taking a
curve into a vertical position, is enlarged into a cylinder, which passes a
considerable distance down a test-tube.         The latter, into which the de
livery-tube is fitted with a cork, holds 7-5 cub. centims., or 6-6 grammes
of strong ammonia of the spec, gravity 0-88.
    The gas-delivery tube inserted in the side of this receiver dips into some
more ammonia in a second test-tube.
    The pounded mineral, from 0-2 to 0-5 gramme in quantity, and a small
platinum ball, are placed in the retort, and the stopper luted to it with
gutta percha, and cemented air-tight in its place with caoutchouc and gutta
percha varnish.     The funnel, filled with perfectly pure hydrogen fluoride,
is now introduced into the tubulure of the stopper, the tap opened, and
the acid allowed to run down into the retort.           This acid contains about
32 per cent, of absolute hydrogen fluoride — that is to say, a funnel of this
reagent contains 1-12 gramme of acid, capable of rendering gaseous 0-84
gramme of silica, and of neutralizing 0-o5 gramme of ammonia.                 The
funnel is now replaced by     a little platinum stopper, and the orifice secured
air-tight with    gutta-percha varnish.        Pure hydrogen is then allowed
slowly to traverse the entire apparatus, the retort is placed in a water-bath
at 100°C. for two hours, and occasionally slightly shaken to set the ball
rotating. During the operation a trace only of silicium difluoride passes over.
    The retort is next transferred to a parafKn-bath, and the temperature is
cautiously raised.    At first hydrogen fluoride passes over, and at this point
of the process the flow of hydrogen requires some attention to prevent
regurgitation of the ammonia.         At about 132° C., in the case of the sili
cates mentioned in this memoir, the silica first becomes visible in fine flocks
in the ammonia of the receiver, and in another minute the whole is cloudy.
    In eight minutes the rise of the thermometer to 145° C. has brought
over so much difluoride that the contents of the tube are semisolid, and
nearly the whole of it has passed over.        The temperature is then raised to
150° C., and the retort allowed to cool. The process is next repeated with
a fresh charge of acid and ammonia.            If  no more than 0-2 gramme of
silicate be taken, twice charging of the retort is sufficient ; but with 0-5
gramme three or four repetitions of the process are required.            In short,
the operation is continued with fresh reagents till no flock of silica forms
    VoL. XVIII.                                                       M

in the    receiver.   Finally, 0v5 cub. centim. of sulphuric acid is introduced
into the retort, and the temperature again raised to 160°C, the stream of
 hydrogen being continued as before.
     The several ammoniacal charges are poured into a platinum dish, together
 with the washings of the delivery-tube and the two test-tubes, and slowly
 evaporated in a water-bath, with continued stirring.
     At a point in the evaporation just before the solution becomes neutral
 and the ammonium fluoride begins to turn acid, the entire silica in the dish
 will have been dissolved by the fluoride.       The process is gradual, but the
 moment when the solution is complete is easily determined.              Then, the
 dish being removed, potassic chloride is added in slight excess, together
 with absolute alcohol equal in volume to the contents of the platinum
 vessel.      Potassium fluosilicate precipitates, which, after the lapse of
 twenty-four hours, is filtered, washed with a mixture of equal volumes of
 absolute alcohol and water, dried, and weighed.          The results are accurate.
  In the retort are the bases in the form of sulphates, the treatment of which
  calls for no further remark.
                           III.  The Busti Aerolite  of 1852.
      This meteorite fell on the 2nd of December, 1852, about six miles
  south of Busti, a station halfway        between Goruckpoor and Fyzabad in
  India, and nearly in lat. 26° 45'       N. and long. 82° 42' E. For an ac
  count of the circumstances attending its fall I am indebted to Mr. George
  Osborne, at that time resident at Busti, and who presented this stone (the
  only specimen of the fall that he was able to procure) to the East India
   Company.         Mr. Osborne states that the fall took place at ten minutes past
  ten in the morning, and was attended by an explosion louder than a thunder
   clap, and lasting from three to five minutes.         At Goruckpoor the report
   appeared to approach in a direction from N.N.W. ; at Busti the sound
   seemed to come from the zenith, and proceed in a somewhat easterly course.
      The explosion that shattered the meteorite must have occurred soon after
   its passing the longitude of Goruckpoor.         There was no cloud in the sky
   at the time.      The  stone, which weighed  about  3 lbs., was presented to the
    collection at the British Museum by the Secretary of State for India.
       The Busti aerolite bears a great resemblance to the stone that fell on
    the 25th of March, 1843, at Bishopsville, South Carolina, U.S.          A crust,
    coating the larger part of the stone, was of a dark yellowish brown, with a
    few yellowish-white porphyritic-looking      patches at it flat end, whilst a
    yellowish    enamel,   mingled with dark grey, covered     a hollow portion on
    one side   of the  stone.
       It is difficult to refer  these markings to the minerals underlying them,
    a similar   crust covering both the augite and enstatite of the meteorite.
    They are probably due to the alterative action of the oxidized products of
    the nickeliferous iron on the silicates in a state of fusion during the rapid
    passage   of the  stone through the atmosphere.

1870.]                  Mineral Constituents of Meteorites.                      149
    The meteorite consists for the most part of the mineral enstatite ; at one
end, however, was imbedded a number            of small chestnut-brown spherules,
in which     again a lens enabled me to detect minute octahedral crystals,
having the lustre and colour of gold.
    These two minerals seem scarcely to have been affected by the heat that
fused the silicates which surround and encrust them.
                      IV.  Sulphide    of Calcium (Oldhamite).
    This mineral occurs in the Busti aerolite, and sparsely in that which fell
at Bishopsville, imbedded in augite, or enstatite, or both of them.                 It
has a pale chestnut-brown colour, and forms small, nearly round spherules,
whose outer surface is generally coated with calcium sulphate.            It cleaves
with equal facility in three      directions, which give normal angles, averaging
89° 57', and are no doubt really 90°.             Its system, therefore, is cubic;
indeed in polarized light it is seen       to be  devoid of double refraction.     Its
specific gravity is 2-58, and its harduess 3-5 to 4.         With boiling water it
yields calcium polysulphides, and in acids it easily dissolves with evolu
tion of hydrogen sulphide.           Chemical analyses indicated the following as
its composition : —
                                                                 t              n.

    The    presence   of such  a  sulphide in a meteorite shows that the condi
 tions under which the ingredients of the rock took their present form are
 unlike those met with in our globe. Water and oxygen must have alike
 been absent.       The existence of iron in a state of minute division, as often
 found in meteorites, leads to a similar conclusion.         But if we bear in mind
 the conditions necessary for the formation of pure calcium sulphide, the
 evidence imported into this inquiry by the Busti aerolite seems further
 to point to the presence of a reducing agent during the formation of its
 constituent minerals ; whilst the crystalline structure of the Oldhamite
 and of the Osbornite must certainly have been the result of fusion at an
 enormous temperature.           The detection of hydrogen in meteoric iron by
 Professor Graham tends to confirm the probability of the presence of such
 a reducing agent.

     The golden-yellow microscopic octahedra imbedded in the Oldhamite
 were furnished by the analyses of that mineral to the amount of only
 0-0028 gramme, and though upwards of 150 in number, were capable of
  oeing measured by the goniometer.
     This microscopic mineral I wish to name Osbornite, in honour of             Mr.
                                                                      m 2

150                    Mr. N. Story-Maskelyne     on the             [Jan.  13,
Osborne and in commemoration of the important service that gentleman
rendered to science in preserving and transmitting to London in its entirety
the stone which his zeal saved at the time of its fall.
   That the octahedra of Osbornite     are regular  was proved by angles     of
even such microscopic crystals giving measurements over the edges and
solid angles that accorded within 3' with those of the regular octahedron.
   The crystals are brittle, and their powder retains the beautiful yellow
colour of the surface, which is therefore intrinsic, and        not a tarnish.
The amount of them available for analysis being so minute,      their chemical
examination was attended with much difficulty.       Boiled for a long time  in
the strongest hydrogen chloride, they were unchanged,           and  hydrogen
fluoride was apparently without action on them. They passed unscathed
through    a fusion with potassio-sodium carbonate.       When heated on a
splinter of porcelain in a current of dry chlorine, the crystals glowed for a
few seconds, lost their metallic lustre, and became of a honey-yellow
colour, while a white sublimate formed on the walls of the tube.      Exposed
to the air, the altered crystals deliquesced, and assumed a pasty consist
ence ; in water they dissolved partially, forming an alkaline solution, in
which   ammonium oxalate produced a precipitate.        The insoluble portion
was taken up for the most part by hydrogen chloride, and its solution     gave
a decided precipitate with the above reagent.      The water through which
the chlorine was allowed to escape, and the sublimate in the tube, after
treatment with hydrogen chloride, were taken together, and found, on
examination, to give a white precipitate with barium chloride, the filtrate
from which, after the excess of barium had been removed, furnished with
ammonia a precipitate resembling alumina, which, however, was insoluble
in potash, and was thrown down from slightly acid solutions with sodium
hyposulphite,    and potassium sulphate.    It was examined for titanic acid
by means of magnesium wire in a slightly acid solution, but with a nega
tive result.   The only alternative left was to conclude that the substance
which exhibited this deportment was either titanium or zirconium, and
that the gold-like crystals were a combination of this element with calcium
 (perhaps a little iron) and sulphur in some remarkably stable form. That
this mineral should be a compound of the sulphides of these metals merely
is scarcely conceivable when its power to withstand the action of acids is
considered ; possibly its composition, if it could be quantitatively ana
lyzed, would be found to be that of a compound of titanium or zirconium
and calcium of the obscure kind that is known as an oxysulphide.
   Mr. Sorby, who has made the zirconium and titanium group of metals
the subject of special study, formed a microscopic borax bead, into which
he introduced some of the oxide obtained from the Osbornite.         He found
it to behave as titanic acid.
   The occurrence of Osbornite occasionally in the augite presently to be
described, and the fact of the latter mineral lying chiefly in that part of the
meteroite where the Osbornite is found, suggested the possibility of the

  1870.]                   Mineral Constituents of Meteorites.                      151
  presence    of this metal of the zirconium group in the augite itself, — an
  assumption confirmed by experiment.             The dichroism of this augite is
  strongly marked, especially through the face 0 10, which in one position
  exhibits a tint resembling that of the blue anatase of Brazil, due apparently
 to minute scales permeating the crystal, and visible only in the microscope.
 These scales may possibly be the Osbornite sufficiently thin to be trans
 parent, and may be the cause of the beautiful golden metallic reflection
 which characterizes the face 1 0 0 of the augite.
                VI.  The Augitic Constituent     of the Busti Aerolite.
     Associated with the spherules of Oldhamite that have been described as
 occurring in a nodule of this aerolite, and less plentifully distributed
 through the rest of its mass, is the silicate already alluded to as a variety
 of augite, and as containing traces of titanium or zirconium oxide. This
 silicate occurs in crystalline grains of a pale violet-grey colour, intimately
 mixed with another silicate presently to be described.              When isolated,
 these grains present a few crystal faces, among which one as a cleavage-
 plane is prominent.          So imperfect are the rest, that they furnished reli
 able measurements         only with extreme difficulty.       These determinations,
 however, together with its optical characters, proved that the mineral
 belongs to the oblique system. The measurements gave the following
 approximate values      : —

  Such a formula does not accord with those of the ordinary varieties of
augite, in which calcium is usually present in at least as high a ratio in
equivalents as the magnesium.   A deduction, however, of a certain amount

                               enstatite

of   the augite as derived from analysis, increasing the magnesia.

                         a

 mentioned silicate, these minerals are enstatite. The angles          are                     1   0   0,   1

showing them to be enstatite under different aspects.                        When lime is ab
sent it presents itself as a simply prismatic mineral, the dark-grey tabular
variety.    When lime is present, though to an amount less than two per
cent., the crystalline structure becomes more complex.                          The augite may
perhaps be tessellated, as it were, in the enstatite, somewhat as this latter
mineral has been shown to occur intercalated to a small amount in layers
of augite.      I    did not succeed in establishing this point, however, by an
examination of microscopic sections of this mineral.
   The crystalline fragments frequently show, when examined by polarized
light, a composite structure, the principal sections of the different parts of
the mineral being disposed at every angle of mutual inclination.

    As in the     case    of the augite, the       soda is probably derived from the            hy
drogen chloride ; the iron occurs partly as metal, minutely subdivided,
partly as oxide combined with the magnesium silicate.                          In each case the
bases slightly exceed the amount required by the formula of enstatite.                           On
comparing     these      with   known      analyses,   and those  which    I  shall shortly    sub
mit to the Society, it seems highly probable that, where the conditions
 under which a meteoric silicate has been formed were such that silicic acid
was present in excess of that required by the formula of enstatite, this acid

 remains uncombined         in the form of crystallized silica with the specific
 gravity of     a fused quartz, and that where magnesia and other bases are in
  excess, a basic silicate with the formula       of olivine absorbs the supplementary
  portion of these bases.        Calcium, when present, would convert into augite
  its equivalent ratio of what would otherwise constitute enstatite, and it is
  possible that this is true even when this element is distributed in small
  quantities throughout the mass.
      No alumina, and consequently            no feldspathic ingredient, has        been de
  tected in this meteorite.
                      VIII.   Composition      of the entire Meteorite.
      With the view of determining the different ingredient minerals present
  in the Busti meteorite, fragments and dust from the neighbourhood of the
  nodule of sulphide and augite were analyzed.                 The mineral was treated
  with hydrogen chloride, carbon disulphide, and potash, which removed
  16-873 per cent., leaving a residue of 83-127 per cent. ; the composition
  of these two portions, soluble and insoluble, is given below : —

     The ratio of the silicic acid          to the magnesia and lime in the latter
 analysis corresponds with the composition (| MgjCa)0, Si02.                     Regarding
 the calcium of the white and grey varieties of enstatite to be present as
 angite intercalated with the enstatite, we may assert that while all the
silicates of this meteorite present the typical formula MO, SiO2, three
equivalents of the rock near the nodule may be treated as composed of two
equivalents of augite and one of enstatite ; in other parts of the stone the
latter mineral predominates.
     A   formula   for the augite with magnesium and calcium in equal pro
portions     would   no doubt more truly represent its composition ; it is, how
ever, as impossible to separate the enstatite intercalated with it as it is to
remove this mineral when blended with the enstatite.
              IX. Solubility of the Minerals of the Busti            Meteorite.
     As it appears of importance          to   determine the degree to which these

 meteoric minerals were soluble in acid, the augite and enstatite were sub
 mitted to this solvent action.       Digested for several hours at 100° C. in
 hydrogen chloride diluted with half its volume of water, and subsequently
 in potash for some hours to remove the         free   silica, the augite and each
 of the three forms of enstatite proved to      be acted upon, the results in      all
 cases showing that the acid simply exercises a solvent action on the mineral,
 without separating it into two or more distinct silicates.
    The subjoined Table gives the results of the experiments.              The degree
 in which the acid dissolved the mineral was due to the more or less com
 plete trituration of the material before treatment.          In one case, for which
 the transparent variety was selected, a repetition of the process three times
gave results that left no doubt as to the nature of the action of the acid.
    Of the greyish-white variety of enstatite, after treatment for 20 hours
 with acid and 12 hours with potash, 9-414 per cent, dissolved, an analysis
 of which is given in column I.
    Of the grey tubular variety of enstatite, after treatment with acid for
 16 hours and with potash for a similar time, 7- 779 per cento dissolved,
 that gave on analysis numbers the approximate value of which is found in
 column II.
    Of the white variety, after the first treatment for 20 hours with acid
 and subsequently with potash, 12-68 per cent, dissolved, the composition
 of which    is given in column III.    By  a second     treatment of the residual
 enstatite from this experiment, after 2 hours- trituration with acid for 30
 hours and potash for 12 hours, 67-84 per cent, dissolved; and on sub
jecting the mineral to a third treatment in a similar way, 5W8 per cent,
 were dissolved in acid and potash.        In the last of these experiments the
 ratio of the silica to the bases, neglecting the small amount of the former
 dissolved in the acid, is as 58-4 to 42-0, that of an analysis of an enstatite
being as 58-4 to 41-6.
    The solubility of the augite was determined by subjecting it to similar
treatment with acid during 18 hours, and with potash for a like time, these
reagents removing 7-384 per cent, of the mineral.

   This meteorite fell at Manegaum in Khandeish, India, on the 26th

was given by the Asiatic Society of Bengal to the British Museum in 1862.

coloured transparent crystalline silicate in small grains, loosely cemented

    The result of the above analyses is to show that, except for a little
chromite and a little augite, with possibly in the crystallized mineral a
little free silica, both that mineral and the collective silicate of the stone
consist of a ferriferous enstatite.

II.    " On Fluoride of Silver.— Part I.            By George Gore, F.R.S.

     This communication treats of the formation, preparation, analysis, com
 position, common physical properties, and chemical behaviour of fluoride
 of silver.
      The salt was prepared by treating pure silver carbonate with an excess
 of pure aqueous hydrofluoric acid in a platinum dish, and evaporating to
  dryness, with certain precautions.       The salt thus obtained invariably con
  tains a small amount of free metallic silver, and generally also traces of
  water and of hydrofluoric acid, unless special precautions mentioned are
  observed. It was analyzed by various methods : the best method of deter
  mining the amount of fluorine in it consisted in evaporating to dryness a
  mixture of a known weight of the salt dissolved in water, with a slight
  excess of pure and perfectly caustic lime in a platinum bottle, and gently
  igniting the residue at an incipient red heat until it ceased to lose weight.
  By taking proper care, the results obtained are accurate. The reaction
   in this method of analysis takes place according to the following equation,
   2AgF+CaO = CaF2+ 2Ag+0. Sixteen parts of oxygen expelled equal
   thirty-eight parts of fluorine present.     One of the methods employed for
   determining    the  amount   of  silver consisted in passing dry ammonia over
   the salt in a platinum boat and tube at a low red heat.         The results ob

tained in the various analyses establish the fact that pure fluoride of
silver consists of 19 parts of fluorine and 108 of silver.
   Argentic fluoride is usually in the form of yellowish brown earthy frag
ments ; but when rendered perfectly anhydrous by fusion, it is a black
horny mass, with a superficial satin lustre, due to particles of free silver. It
is extremely deliquescent and soluble in water ; one part of the salt dis
solves in -55 part by weight of water at 15°-5 C. ; it evolves heat in dis
solving, and forms a strongly alkaline solution.     It is nearly insoluble in
absolute alcohol.  The specific gravity of the earthy-brown salt is 5*852
at 150,5 C.   the specific gravity of its aqueous solution, at 150-5 C, satu
                ;
rated at that temperature, is 2-61.     By chilling the saturated solution, it
exhibited the phenomenon of supersaturation and suddenly solidified, with
evolution of heat, on immersing a platinum plate in it.       The solution is
capable of being crystallized, and yields crystals of a hydrated salt ; the
act of crystallization is attended by the singular phenomenon of the remain
der of the salt separating in the anhydrous and apparently non-cry stalline
state, the hydrated salt taking to itself the whole of the water.  The fused
salt, after slow and undisturbed cooling, exhibits crystalline markings                upon
its surface.
   The dry salt        is not decomposed by sunlight        ;   it melts below   a visible
red heat, and forms a highly lustrous, mobile, and jet-black liquid. It is
not decomposed by a red heat alone ; but in the state of semifusion, or of
complete fusion, it is rapidly decomposed by the moisture of the air with
separation of metallic silver ; dry air does not decompose it. In the fused
state   it slightly   corrodes   vessels   of platinum,   and much more freely      those
of silver.
   The salt in a state of fusion with platinum electrodes conducts elec
tricity very freely, apparently with the facility of a metal, and without
visible evolution of gas or corrosion of the anode ; a silver anode was
rapidly dissolved by     and one of lignum-vitae charcoal was gradually cor
                           it,
roded.     A saturated aqueous solution of the salt conducted freely with
electrolysis, crystals of silver being deposited upon the cathode, and                   a
black crust of peroxide of silver upon the anode       no gas was evolved
                                                                ;                        ;
with dilute solutions gas was evolved from the anode.      By electrolysis               of
anhydrous hydrofluoric acid with silver electrodes, the anode was rapidly
corroded.
  The electrical order of           substances    in the fused salt    was    as follows,
the first-named being the most positive silver, platinum, charcoal of
                                                   :                                    lig
num-vitae, palladium, gold.  In   dilute aqueous solution of the salt, the
                                            a
order found was aluminium, magnesium, silicon, iridium, rhodium, and
                      :
carbon of lignum-vitae, platinum, silver, palladium, tellurium, gold.
   The chemical behaviour of the salt was also investigated. In many
cases considerable destruction of the platinum vessels occurred, either                 in
the experiments themselves,    or in the processes              of cleaning   the vessels
from the products of the reactions.

     Hydrogen     does not decompose      the dry salt, even with the aid of sun
light, nor    does a stream    of that gas decompose     an aqueous solution of the
salt, but the dry salt is rapidly and perfectly decomposed by that gas at an
incipient red heat, its metal being liberated.
     Nitrogen has no chemical effect upon the salt, even at a red heat, nor
upon its aqueous solution. Dry ammonia gas is copiously absorbed by the
dry salt.     In one experiment the salt absorbed about 844 times its volume
of the gas. The salt in a fused state is rapidly and perfectly decomposed
by dry ammonia gas, and its silver set free.          A saturated solution of the
salt is also instantly and violently decomposed            by strong aqueous am
monia.
     Oxygen has no effect either upon the dry salt at 15° C., or at a red heat,
nor upon its aqueous solution.          Steam perfectly and rapidly decomposes
the salt at an incipient red heat, setting free all its silver.          No chemical
change took place on passing either of the oxides of nitrogen over the salt
in   a state of fusion.
     By passing anhydrous hydrofluoric acid vapour over perfectly anhydrous
and previously fused fluoride of silver, at about 60° Fahr., distinct evidence
of the existence of an acid salt was obtained. This acid salt is decomposed
by a slight elevation of temperature.
     Numerous experiments were made to ascertain the behaviour of argen
tic fluoride in a state of fusion with chlorine, and great difficulties were
encountered in consequence of the extremely corrosive action of the sub
stances when brought together in a heated state.               Vessels of glass, plati
num, gold, charcoal, gas carbon, and purified graphite were employed*.
By heating the salt in chlorine, contained in closed vessels, formed partly
of glass and partly of platinum, more or         less corrosion     of the glass took
place, the chlorine united with the platinum and fluoride of silver to form
 a- double salt, and a vacuum was produced.              By similarly heating it in
vessels composed wholly of platinum, the same disappearance of chlorine,
 the same double salt, and a similar vacuum resulted.             Also, by heating it
in vessels composed partly of gold, an analogous double salt, the same
absorption of chlorine and production of rarefaction were produced.                And
by employing       vessels partly composed    of  purified graphite,      a new   com
pound of fluorine and carbon was obtained.

        at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.                     Received October
         13, 1869.
     About twelve months ago I began to make observations upon the heating-
power of the stars.         My first arrangements were simply these :           I made
    * In the next communication will be described    the  results obtained  with vessels
formed of other materials.

160                      Mr. E. J.   Stone on the Heating-Powers   of        [Jan. 13,
use   of      a delicate reflecting astatic galvanometer, and a thermo-electric      pile
of nine elements.  The pile was screwed into the tube of                a negative   eye
piece of the Greenwich Great Equatoreal, from which the                 eye-lenses   had
been removed.
  I    soon convinced myself that the heat, condensed by the object-glass              of
twelve and three-quarters inches upon my pile, was appreciable in the case
of several of the brighter stars ; but the endless changes in the zero-point
of the galvanometer-needle, and the magnitude of these changes, compared
with those arising from the heating- power of the stars, prevented me from
making any attempts to estimate the absolute magnitude of the effects
produced.     Every change in the state of the sky, every formation or dis
sipation of cloud, completely drove the needle to the stops.
  At the February   Meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society I first
became aware  of what Mr. Huggins had done upon this question. His
arrangements, however, did not appear to me to meet the difficulties which
I had encountered. After some trials, I arranged my apparatus as follows,
and with its present form            I am satisfied.
  a  and (i are two pairs of plates of antimony and bismuth.      The areas
are about (0-0"5)a inches, and their distance is about 0-25 inch.
  The poles         are joined over in opposite directions to the terminals        of the
pile and galvanometer. The whole pile is screwed into a tube of one of
the negative eyepieces of the great equatoreal. This completely shuts the
pile up in the telescope-tube.  A thick flannel bag is then wrapped over
the eyepiece and terminals.  The bag is prevented from actually touching
the case of the pile, and is useful in preventing the irregular action of
draughts upon the case of the pile and terminals.   The wires are led from
the terminals of the pile to the observatory library, where I have placed
the reflecting galvanometer.   This separation of the galvanometer from
the telescope is most inconvenient, but it was absolutely necessary on
account of the large moving masses of iron in the observing-room.
   The two faces a and /3 of the pile are so nearly alike, that the resultant
current generated        by any equal heating of them is exceedingly feeble.
      The     telescope is first directed so that the star falls between the faces a
and     /3,   and allowed to remain thus until the needle    is  nearly steady at the
zero.
  The star     then placed alternately upon the faces a and
                    is                                            and the    /3,
corresponding readings of the galvanometer taken as soon as the needle
appears to have taken up its position, which usually takes place in about

those readings by comparing a reading with star on face a with the mean of

     With this precaution              I     have       never   met with any anomalous results,
although in making the observations                       I     have usually joined over the ter
minals, without knowing the direction for heat, and have left this unde
termined until the completion of the observations.    mention this because        I

                                             have usually taken readings
at three distances, one at about 23-5 inches, another at 11-9 inches,
another at 2-5 inches. From a comparison of these readings with those
taken before the heat from the cube fell upon the thermometers,   infer              I
the heating-power of each half of the cube upon the thermometers, with
faces     of pile in contact.         Calling this quantity for one inch of distance

   The thermometers being placed in contact with the faces of the pile, and
the galvanic connexions made, we may be certain that the temperature of
the thermometers has been imparted to the faces of the pile when the

with two different amounts of resistance in circuit.  Such observations
have been considered satisfactory only when the two resistances for ther
mometers in contact and without thermometers are sensibly equal. This
condition can be obtained by making the thermometers touch along the
lines of junction of the antimony and bismuth      but the connexion being

164       On the Heating- Powers           of Arcturus    and a   Lyra.      [Jan.   13,
The   mean result   of the observations on        these two nights is
                                        0°-0198    F.
as a measure    of the heating-effect of Arcturus in raising the temperature
of the plate of antimony and bismuth when the heat is condensed by the
object-glass of 12-75 inches.
   If the absorption by the object-glass be considered insensible, the             direct
effect upon the pile would be
                                     0° 000000685      F.
   I  have not yet determined the coefficient of absorption for the object-
glass, but if it be provisionally taken at            the direct heating-effect of Arc
turus
                                    = O°-0O000137 F.
   The result may be otherwise stated as follows: — That the heat               received
from Arcturus is sensibly the same as that from the whole face of               the cube
containing boiling water at        <>30  yards.

   Observations were subsequently made of a Lyroe, but the zero was un
steady ; and as the night advanced clouds appeared, and ultimately inter
rupted the observations.

   The night   was very clear, and the air steady, but completely saturated with
moisture, at a temperature of about 52°. The mean of fourteen observa
tions of the difference of reading for a Lyrse on a and /3 gave only 1 1 divs.
I have no doubt but that the small effect here obtained was due principally
to the amount of moisture in the air.

    This result is again     so much smaller than those obtained from Arcturus,
although the observations of Arcturus were made under more unfavourable
circumstances with respect to altitude, that I cannot but regard it as a fact

that the star Arcturus does give us more heat than a Lyra, — a result probably
due to the same cause which gives rise to the difference in colour between
these stars, viz. the greater absorption of the red end of the spectrum in the
case  of a Lyra than in the case          of Arcturus.
    I may here mention that on            June 25, 1869, I made a direct comparison
between Arcturus and aLyrae.               The result gave for the heat received from
Arcturus : that from a Lyra : : 3 : 2 ; but on account of the observations of
a  Lyra having been interrupted by cloud, they were not sufficiently
 numerous to eliminate mere errors of reading.
    From the whole of these observations I think we may conclude that
 Arcturus gives to us considerably more heat than a Lyra ; that the amount
of heat   received is diminished very rapidly as the amount of moisture in the
air increases ; that nearly the whole heat is intercepted by the slightest
 cloud; that as first approximations, the heat from Arcturus, at an altitude
 of 25°, at Greenwich is about equal to that from a three-inch cube contain
ing boiling water at a distance of 400 yards.
    The  heat from      aLyrae     at an altitude  of 60° is about equal to that from
 the same cube at       a  distance of about 600 yards.      The form given to the pile
 appears  likely  to be    useful in many inquiries respecting differences of heating-
 power.

    It is remarkable that from the earliest times mechanical assistance has
 been employed in mathematical computation.           The use of pebbles, of the

    fingers, and of the abacus of the Greeks and Romans may be adduced as
    examples.       Mathematicians have constantly delighted in devising me
    chanical modes of calculations, as in the case of Napier-s bones, mechani
    cal globes, slide rules, &c.      Actual machines for performing difficult cal
    culations have been designed or constructed at various times since the
    early part of the 17th century, by Pascal, Morland, Leibnitz, Gersten,
    Babbage, and Scheutz.
       In logic, on the contrary,      we meet with a total absence of any actual
    mechanism, although logical works abound with expressions implying the
    need of such aid.       The name of Aristotle-s logical treatises, the ' Organon,'
    or Instrument, and many definitions of logic, clearly express this idea,
    which    is also distinctly stated by Bacon in the second aphorism of his
    'New Organon.5
       This inability of logicians to realize their notions of a mechanical logic
   in a material form, analogous to the many kinds of calculating machines,
   can only be explained by the extreme incompleteness of their doctrines.
   It is the advance of logical science, chiefly due to the late Dr. Boole,
   Prof. De Morgan, and George Beutham, which now enables us to pro
   duce a   truly mechanical logic.
       Boole, in his celebrated work on the ' Laws of Thought,- first put forth
   the problem of logical science in its complete generality : — Given certain
   logical premises or conditions, to determine the description of any class of
   objects under     those conditions.    The ancient forms of logical deductions
  are but a few isolated cases      of this general problem, which Boole solved
  in   a  complete but exceedingly obscure manner.            In my ' Pure Logic -
   (London, 1864, Stanford) and my 'Substitution of Similars- (London,
   1869, Macmillan), I have endeavoured to show that the mysterious mathe
  matical form of Boole-s logical system is altogether superfluous, and that
  in   one point   of great importance he      was deeply mistaken.       His logical
  views, when simplified and corrected, give us a method of indirect de
  duction of extreme generality and power, founded directly upon this most
 fundamental Law of Thought.             A proof of the truthfulness and power of
  this system is to be found in the fact that it can be embodied in a machine
 just as the Calculus of Differences is embodied in Mr. Babbage-s calcula
 ting machine.
      To explain the nature of the logical machine alluded to, it may be
 pointed out that the third of the fundamental Laws of Thought allow us to
 affirm of any object one or the other of two contradictory attributes, and
 that we are thus enabled to develope a series of alternatives which must
 contain the description of a given class or object.          Thus, if we are consi.

                                     Metal is element,
we can      at once    affirm of iron that it is included  among the four alterna
tives    i—

                           Not metal, not element.
    But according to the second Law of Thought, nothing   can combine con
tradictory attributes, and this law prevents us  from  supposing that iron
can be not metal, while the first premise affirms that it is metal.   The
second premise again prevents   our supposing  that the combination metal,
not element can exist.   Hence the only combination of properties which
the premises allow us to affirm of iron is metal, element.  In a similar
manner a complete solution of any logical problem may be effected by
forming the complete list of combination, in which the terms of the pro
blem can manifest themselves, and then striking out such of the combi
nations as cannot exist in consistency with the conditions of the problem.
   The logical machine actually constructed represents the combina
tion, 1 6 in number, of four positive terms, denoted by A, B, C, D, and
their corresponding           negatives, a,       b,   c, d.         The instrument   is provided
with eight keys, representing          these terms when appearing in the subject                 of
a  proposition, with eight keys, placed to the right hand of the former,
representing the terms when occurring in the predicate of a proposition,
and with the certain operation keys denoting the eopular of the proposi

   The machine thus embodies almost all the powers of Boole-s logical
system up to problems involving four distinct terms, and to represent pro
blems of any complexity involving any number of terms only requires the
multiplication of the parts of the machine.     The construction involves
no mechanical difficulties, and depends upon  peculiar arrangement of pins
                                                                 a

   mistake.
      It  is believed that this logical machine may be usefully employed in the
  logical class-room to exhibit the complete analysis of any argument or
  logical problem ; and it is superior for this purpose to a more rudimentary
  contrivance, the logical abacus, constructed by me for the same purpose
  and previously described. But by far the chief importance of the machine
  is in a theoretical point of view as demonstrating, in the simplest and most
  evident manner, the character and powers of a universal system of logical
  deduction, of which the first, although obscure solution, was given by
  Dr. Boole.
  II. " Preliminary        Paper on certain Drifting Motions of the Stars."
          By Richard A. Proctor, B.A., F.R.A.S.                     Communicated by
          Warren De La Rue, V.P.R.S. Received October 26, 1869.
     A   careful examination of the proper motions of all the fixed stars in the
  catalogues published by Messrs. Main and Stone (Memoirs of the Royal
  Astronomical Society, vols. xxviii. and xxxiii.) has led me to a somewhat in
  teresting result.     I find that in parts of the heavens the stars exhibit a well-
 marked tendency to drift in a definite direction.        In the catalogues of proper
 motions, owing to the way in which the stars are arranged, this tendency is
 masked      ; but when the proper motions are indicated in maps, by affixing
 to each star a small arrow whose length and direction             indicate the magni
 tude and direction of the star-s proper motion, the star-drift (as the phe
 nomenon may be termed) becomes very evident.
     It is worthy of notice that Miidler, having been led by certain considera
 tions to examine the neighbourhood of the Pleiades for traces of a commu
 nity of proper motion, founded on the drift he actually found in Taurus
 his well-known theory that Alcyone (the lucida of the Pleiades) is the
 common centre around which the sidereal system is moving.                      But in
 reality    the community     of motion   in Taurus    is only  a single  instance, and
 not the most striking that might be pointed out, of a characteristic which
 may be recognized in many regions of the heavens.              In Gemini and Cancer
 there is a much more striking drift towards the south-east, the drift in
 Taurus being towards the south-west.             In the constellation Leo there is
also a well-marked drift, in this case towards Cancer.
     These particular instances     of star-drift  are not the less remarkable, that
they (the stars) are drifting almost exactly in the direction due to the proper
motion which has been assigned to the sun, because the recent researches
of   the Astronomer Royal have abundantly proved that the apparent proper
motions of the stars are not to be recognized as principally due to the sun-s
motion.        Mr. Stone has shown even that we must assign to the stars a
larger proper motion, on the average, than that which the sun possesses.

Looking, therefore,             on the stars as severally                in motion, with velocities        ex
ceeding the sun's on the average, it cannot but be looked upon as highly
significant that in any large region of the heavens there should be a com
munity of motion such as I have described.      We seem compelled to look
upon the stars which exhibit such community of motion as forming a
distinct system, the members of which are associated indeed with, the ga
lactic system, but are much more intimately related to each other.
   In other parts of the heavens, however, there are instances of                                       a star-
drift    opposed to the direction                 due      to the solar motion.             A remarkable
instance may be recognized among the seven bright stars of Ursa Major.
Of these, the stars   y,       ft,

and almost exactly at the same rate, towards the " apex of the solar mo
tion," that         is,   the point from which all the motions due to the                       sun's trans
lation    in   space should be directed.                  If these   five stars, indeed, form       a   system
(and I    can see no other reasonable                     explanation of
                                                             community        so singular   a
of motion), the mind  lost in contemplating the immensity of the periods
                                 is
which the revolutions of the components of the system must occupy.
Madler had already assigned to the revolution of Alcor around Mizar
(£ Ursse)    period of more than 7000 years. But
                a                                         these stars, which       if
appear so clear to the naked eye, have     period of such length, what must
                                                                 a

     In like manner the              stars a,    ft,   and   y of Arietis appear to form     single a
system, though the'motion of a                       is   not absolutely coincident either in mag
nitude or direction with that of                     ft   and y, which are moving on absolutely
parallel lines with equal velocity.
   There are many other interesting cases of the same kind.    hope soon                    I
to be able to lay before the Society  pair of maps in which all the well-

graphic projection.              In the        same maps also the effects               due to the solar
motion are exhibited     means of great circles through the apex of the

the first place, accounts for the small effect which the correction due to
                          it
the solar motion has been found to have in diminishing the sums of the
squares of the stellar proper motions.   Again,     explains the fact that  it
many double stars which have    common proper motion appear to have

   Jacobi discovered the theorem that fluid ellipsoid revolving with uni

form angular velocity round its least axis might be in equilibrium. Ivory
discussed the theorem, and made several statements                       regarding the limita
tions of the proportions of the axis.                      Ivory's statements contain various
errors and truths based on erroneous reasoning.      The object of the pre
sent memoir     to correct Ivory's errors, to supply his imperfections, and
               is
to add something           to what      is   already known respecting the theorem.

        the sinking of the Rose Bridge Colliery, Wigan, Lancashire,
         1868-69." By Edward Hull, M.A., F.R.S., Director of the
         Geological Survey of Ireland.              Received November 27, 1869.
     In  an elaborate    paper by Mr. W. Hopkins, F.R.S., entitled "Experi
 mental Researches on the Conductive Powers of various Substances," pub
 lished in the Philosophical Transactions for 1857, an account is given of a
  series of experiments made under the general supervision of Mr. Hopkins
 himself and Mr. W. Fairbairn, F.R.S., during the sinking of the Astley
  Pit of Dukenfield       Colliery in Cheshire*.            At the time this paper was
  written the depth attained was only a little more than 1400 feet ; and the
 rate of increase between the depths of 700 feet and 1330 feet was found to
  be 1°  F. for about    65 feet. These observations were subsequently continued
 until the pits    had   attained   their full depth of 717 yards from the surface.
 The last observation made was in the shale overlying the coal-seam, known
 as the
          " Black Mine," which it was the object of the proprietor, Mr. Astley,
 to reach, and the temperature was found to be 75° F. Assuming the stra
                                                                                        "
 tum of constant temperature," or, as it is also called by Humboldt,
                                                                                          " the

 invariable
 temperature of      51°  F.,  the total increase of temperature would amount to
 24° F., giving as the rate of increase 1° F. for every 88-925 feet.                   This is
 much below the average          rate  of increase.
     During a part of the period above referred to (from 1854-56) another
 coal-pit was being sunk at Wigan, which reached the depth of 600 yards,
                               "

 the temperature of the strata were made very carefully by the manager,
Mr. Bryham, which were kindly communicated to myself for publication,

  174                Mr. E. Hull    on the Temperature     of Strata.     [Jan. 27,
 result obtained by       Professor  Phillips, F.R.S.,    at the   Monkwearmouth
  Colliery.
      Since the time above referred to, the proprietor of the Rose Bridge Col
  liery, Mr. J. Grant Morris, determined to carry down the shafts from the
  "Cannel"      seam to the   " Arley " seam    of  coal, which was known to lie
 more than 200 yards below it ; and consequently in the spring of 1 868
  preparations were commenced for carrying out this project.           In the incre
 dibly short time of one year and two months the Arley coal was struck,
 and was found to be      of good thickness and quality. The total depth reached
 was 808 yards, and the ultimate temperature in the coal itself was found
 to be 93£° F.       The manager of the colliery, Mr. Bryham, sensible of the
 value of observations on the temperature of the strata at such unusual
 depths (this being probably the deepest colliery in the world, certainly in
 Britain), made a series of observations with as much care as the circum
 stances would admit, and has entrusted them to me for publication.
      The mode of taking the observations       was as follows  : — On a favourable
 stratum, such as shale,       or even coal, having been reached, a hole was
 drilled with water in the solid strata to a depth of one yard from the
 bottom of the pit.        A thermometer was then inserted, the hole having
 been sealed and made airtight with clay. At the expiration of half an hour
 the thermometer was taken up and the reading noted.
     It might possibly be objected that the time allowed (thirty minutes) was
 insufficient for the imbedding of the thermometer, and that the readings
 are liable to error from this cause.       I feel sure, however, that if any error
 has arisen it is inappreciable, and does not in the least invalidate the ge
neral result.      In fact I am assured by Mr. Bryham that, from actual test
ing on several occasions, he found less than this time of thirty minutes suf
ficient for the purpose required.
     While the temperatures of the strata were being measured, observations
were also carried on pari passu on those of the open pit during the descent.
These are given in the Table annexed.            By a comparison of the results in
the two columns, it will be observed that as the depth increased the differ
ences between the corresponding temperatures in the pit and the strata
tended     to augment ; in other words, the temperature of the strata           was
found to augment more rapidly than that of the open pit.
     The  effects of  the high temperature and pressure on the strata        at the
depth of 2425 feet are, as      I am informed by Mr. Bryham, making them
selves felt, and cause an increase in the expense both of labour and timber
for props. This colliery, in fact, will be in a position to put to the test our
views and speculations on the effects       of high temperature and pressure     on
mining operations.
     In order to obtain the average rate of increase of lien', as shown by the
experiments at Rose Bridge Colliery, we may assume (in the absence of
direct observation) the position and temperature of the invariable stratum
to be 50 feet from the surface and 50° F., which is probably nearly             the

  1870.]           Mr. E. Hull    on the Temperature         of Strata.           175
 mean temperature      of the place.   With   these data, the increase    is 1° F. for
  every 54-57 feet,   which approximates to that obtained by Professor Phil
 lips at Monkwearmouth of 1° F. for about every 60 feet.
     If, on the other hand, for the purpose of comparison, we adopt the mea
 surements for the invariable       stratum as obtained at Dukenfield, we find
 the rate of increase to be lu F. for every 47-2 feet as against l°F. for every
 83-2 feet in the case of Dukenfield itself.        So great a discordance in the
 results is remarkable, and is not, in my opinion, attributable to inaccuracy
 of observation in making the experiments. On the other hand, I may ven
 ture to suggest that it is due, at least in some measure, to dissimilarity in
 the position and inclination of the strata in each case.          These  I now pro
 ceed to point out.
    Position of the Strata at Rose Bridge and Dukenfield Collieries. —
 Rose Bridge Colliery occupies a position in the centre of a gently sloping
 trough, where the beds are nearly horizontal ; they are terminated both on
 the west and east by large parallel faults which throw up the strata on
 either side. The colliery is placed in what is known as " the deep belt."
    Dukenfield Colliery, on the other hand, is planted upon strata which
 are  highly inclined.    The  beds  of  sandstone,    shale, and coal rise and crop
 out to the eastward    at angles varying from 30° to 35°.          Now I think we
 may assume     that strata consisting of sandstones, shales, clays, and coal
alternating with each other are capable of conducting heat more rapidly
along the planes of bedding than across them, different kinds of rock
having, as Mr. Hopkins-s experiments show, different couducting-powers.
If  this be so, we have an evident      reason   for the dissimilar results in the
two cases before us.      Assuming a   constant supply of heat from the interior
of the earth, it could only escape,     in the   case   of Rose Bridge, across the
planes of bedding, meeting in its      progress upwards the resistance offered
by strata of, in each case, varying conducting-powers.           On the other hand,
in the case of Dukenfield the internal heat could travel along the steeply
inclined strata themselves, and ultimately escape along the outcrop of
the beds.
    I  merely offer this as a suggestion explanatory of the results before us,
and may be allowed to add that the strata at Monkwearmouth Colliery,
the thermometrical observations at which correspond so closely with
those obtained at Rose Bridge, are also in          a  position not much removed
from the horizontal, which is some evidence           in corroboration of the views
here offered.

       Macquorn Rankine.                  Received December       9, 1869.
                                          (Abstract.)
   The chief object of the            present communication         is to remedy      some
acknowledged        defects   in the     theory    of the above-mentioned subject.
The principal      steps by which it has        reached its present state of develop
ment are also noticed, and may be briefly recapitulated as follows : —
   In 1825 M. Navier investigated the conditions of a straight continuous
beam resting on any number of supports.                    His method, though perfectly
correct for the assumed conditions (which                embraced most cases occurring

1870.]                      Theory    of Continuous Beams.                         177
in practice),    was so exceedingly intricate when the number          of openings be
came at all large, that in such instances        it was of little  practical use.
     In 1849 M. Clapeyron, a distinguished engineer and savant, devised a
much more direct and easy means of treating such cases, though he did
not at first succeed in giving to his own method all the simplicity and ele
gance      of which it was capable.
     This was first done in 1856 by M. Bertot, civil        engineer, who, by effect
 ing an elimination     which   had    escaped Clapeyron, arrived at a remarkable
 equation which has been the key to all subsequent treatment of the sub
ject.      This equation involves the bending moments over any three conse
 cutive points of support, and is well known in France by the name of the
 " Theorem of the three Moments."
      In 1857 M. Clapeyron himself and M. Bresse, Professeur de Me-canique
  appliquee & l-Ecole Imperiale des Ponts et Chaussees, appear to have dis
 covered this theorem independently of M. Bertot, and M. Bresse shortly
  afterwards extended it to a much greater degree of generality.
      M. Bresse-s researches on this subject are published in the third volume
  of his < Cours de Mecanique appliquee,- Paris, 1865 ; but they had been
  communicated by him to the Academy of Sciences in 1862, and fully com
  pleted in the previous year.           M. Bresse not only contributed to the ad
  vancement of the theory, but entered largely into the best methods of its
  application to practice, and framed rules which have since, under an              Im
  perial Commission, acquired the character of legislative enactments.
      M. Belanger, Professeur       de Mecanique appliquee a l-ficole centrale, ap
  pears,    about the  same  time   as  M. Bresse, to have made an independent in
  vestigation of this subject, and to have brought the theory of it to about
  the same stage of advancement.
       Little has been since added to this theory in France, but valuable con
  tributions to its development in reference to practice are to be found in
  the works of MM. Renaudot, Albaret, Molinos et Pronnier, Colignon,
  and Piarron de Mondesir.
       In  England Professor Moseley is the first writer on mechanics who ap
  pears to have occupied himself with this subject.              In his work on ' The
  Mechanical Principles of Engineering and Architecture,-              he gives several
   examples    of the  application  of  M.  Navier-s  method    to  important   practical
   cases.     This work    was   published in 1843,     and no doubt furnished the
  groundwork for       Mr. Pole-s more extended investigations.
       In 1852 Mr. Pole had to examine the case of the bridge over the Trent
   at Torksey, involving some new conditions not treated by Moseley, but
   which he found the means of treating with perfect success.                About the
   same    time  Mr.  Pole  had  to  deal  with  the  much    more    complex and im
   portant case of the Britannia bridge, in which, besides variation of load
   from one span to another, variation of section also had to be considered,
   and imperfect      continuity over the middle pier. These conditions were
   successfully imported into this method of Navier, which was, however,

only known to Mr. Pole through the examples of its application given in
Moseley's work, and the results ohtained were identical with those which
would have followed from the application of the method of Clapeyron in
its most improved and generalized form.
   In 18a8, the present writer, being then in India, had occasion to con
                     a continuous girder of five spans, and finding the me
sider the condition of
thod of Navier unmanageable, was forced to seek for some other.          He
first came upon the equation which he afterwards found had been for some
years     known in France as the                 " Theorem of the three Moments," and
afterwards extended           it,   so as to take      in all the conditions of the Britannia
bridge and to verify allMr. Pole's results. In this form  was absolutely       it
identical with the equation given    M. B61anger, and nearly so with that
                                                  by
of M. Bresse.
    The great         defect in   all this theory up to the present time            has been   that,
in order      to avoid an inextricable complexity,            it   has been necessary     to con
sider the load         in
                   each span as uniformly distributed over        and the mo    it,
ment of inertia of the section as uniform throughout each span.
   In many cases these hypotheses are false, notably so in the case of the
Britannia    and the conclusions are affected by their falsity, to what extent
              ;
being    matter of uncertainty, though good grounds have been shown for
         a
believing that the errors cannot attain to importance.
   The method now given treats these conditions,             hoped, rigo  it   is
rously   and
          ;   although   the equations obtained are such as necessarily re
quire some laborious computation to obtain numerical results, they are
certainly      by
               no means inextricable.
    It   satisfactory to find that in the case of the Britannia, where these
         is
new conditions enter with much greater force than in most cases, their
effect on the resulting stresses            is
                                 very unimportant so that the inference
                                                                     ;
may legitimately be drawn that in all ordinary cases the method of
Bresse may be confidently applied.
   It scarcely possible in short abstract to give an idea of an ana
         is                             a
lytical investigation. The equations obtained are of the same form as those
of the previous methods, each containing, as unknown quantities, the
bending moments over three consecutive supports      but the coefficients are
                                                                    ;
somewhat involved functions of the varying loads and sections.        An ab
breviated functional notation has, wherever possible, been used, by means
of which    certain degree of clearness and symmetry
              a                                         preserved in ex   is
pressions which would otherwise become inextricably complex.

   With    a view    to the instruction   of students in engineering  science,  he
proposes an abridged way of stating the theoretical principles of Mr. Hep-
pel's method, considering at the same time that Mr. Heppel's more detailed
investigation forms the best model for numerical calculation.
   He then uses Mr. Heppel's improved form of the " Theorem of the three
Moments" to test the accuracy of the formulas which he obtained in an
other way, and published in ' A Manual of Civil Engineering,' for the case
of a uniform continuous beam with an indefinite number of equal spans,
the successive spans being loaded alternately with a uniform fixed load
 only, and with a uniform travelling load in addition to the fixed load ; and
he finds the results of the two methods to agree in every respect.
V. " Remarks         on the recent Eclipse     of the Sun as observed in the
       United States."        By J. N. Lockyer, F.It.S. Received December
       7, 1869.
   By the kindness of Professors Winlock, Morton, and Newton, I              have
been favoured with photographs, and as yet unpublished accounts, of the
results of the recent total eclipse of the sun observed in America.          I am
anxious, therefore, to take the opportunity afforded by the subject being
under discussion, to lay a few remarks thus early before the Royal Society.
   The points which       I   hoped might be more especially elucidated by this
eclipse were as follows     : —
    1. Is it possible to differentiate between the chromosphere and the corona ?
    2. What is the real photographic evidence of the structure of the base
of  the chromosphere in reference to Mr. W. De La Rue's enlarged photo
 graphs of the eclipse of 1860 ?
    3. What is the amount of the obliterating effect of the illumination         of
 our atmosphere on the spectrum of the chromosphere ?
    4. Is there any cooler hydrogen above the prominences?
    5. Can the spectroscope settle the nature of the corona during eclipses ?
    With regard to 1, the evidence is conclusive. The chromosphere, includ
ing a " radiance," as it has been termed by Dr. Gould (the edge of the radi
 ance as photographed being strangely like the edge of the chromosphere in
 places viewed with the open slit), is not to be confounded with the corona.
    On this subject, in a letter to Professor Morton, Dr. B. A. Gould
 writes  : — " An examination of the beautiful photographs      made at  Burling
 ton and Ottumwa by the sections of your party in charge of Professors
 Mayer and Haines, and a comparison of them with my sketches of the
 corona, have led me to the conviction that the radiance around the moon
 in the pictures made during totality is not the corona at all, but is actually
 the image of what Lockyer has called the chromosphere.
     " This interesting fact is indicated by many different considerations. The
 directions of maximum radiance do not coincide with those of the great
 beams of the corona ; they remain constant, while the latter were variable.
   VOL.    XVIII.                                                     °

180        Mr.    J. N. Lockyer   on the recent   Eclipse of  the Sun  [Jan. 27,
There is a diameter approximately corresponding to the solar axis, near
the extremities of which the radiance upon the photographs is a minimum,
whereas the coronal beams in these directions were especially marked
during a great part of the total obscuration.          The coronal beams stood in
no apparent relation to the protuberances, whereas the aureole seen upon
the photographs is most marked in their immediate vicinity ; indeed the
great protuberance, at 230° to 245°, seems to have formed a southern
limit   to the radiance on the western      side, while a sharp northern  limit is
seen on all the photographs         at about 350°, the intermediate arc being
thickly studded with protuberances which the moon displayed at the close
of totality.     The exquisite masses of flocculent light on the following limbs
are upon     the  two sides of that curious prominence at 93°, which at first
resembled an ear of corn, as you have said, but which, in the later pictures
after it had been more occulted, and its southern branch thus rendered
more conspicuous, was like a pair of antelope-s horns, to which some ob
 servers compare it.       Whatever   of this  aureole  is shown upon the photo
 graphs was occulted or displayed by the lunar motion, precisely as the
 protuberances were.        The variations in the form of the corona, on the
 other   hand,   did not seem to be dependent in any degree upon the moon-s
 motion.       The singular and elegant structural indication in the special
 aggregations of light on the eastern side may be of high value in guiding
 to a further knowledge of the chromosphere.              They are manifest in all
 the photographs by your parties which I have seen, but are especially
 marked in those of shortest exposure, such as the first one at Ottumwa.
 In some of the later views they may be detected on the other side of the
 sun, though less distinct ; but the very irregular and jagged outline of the
 chromosphere, as described by Janssen and Lockyer, is exhibited in per
 fection."
    The second point is also referred to in the same letter. I think the
 American photographs afford evidence that certain appearances in parts of
 Mr.De La Rue-s photographs, which represent the chromosphere as billowy
 on its    under side,    are really due to some action either of the moon-s
 surface or of a possible rare lunar atmosphere ; so that it is not desirable to
 confound these effects with others that might be due to a possible suspen
 sion of the chromosphere in a transparent atmosphere, if only a section of
 the chromosphere were photographed.
    Dr. Gould writes : — " You will observe that some of the brighter, petal
 like flocculi of light have produced apparent indentations in the moon-s
 limb at their base, like those at the bases of the protuberances.          These
 indentations are evidently due to specular reflection from the moon-s sur
 face, as  I  stated to the American Association at Salem last mouth.         Had
 any doubt existed in my mind previously, it would have been removed by
 au inspection     of the photographs."
    Where the chromosphere is so uniform a light that the actinic effect on
 the plate is pretty nearly equal, the base of the chromosphere is absolutely

  continuous in the American            photographs ; but in the case of some of the
  larger prominences, notably those at +146 (Young) and —130 (Young),
  there are strong apparent indents on the moon-s limb.
        I next come to the obliterating effect of the illumination of our atmo
  sphere on the spectrum          of the chromosphere.
        This is considerable ; in fact the evidences of it are very much stronger
   than one could have wished, but hardly more decided than 1 had anticipated.
   Professor Winlock-s evidence on this point, in a letter to myself, is as
   follows : — " examined the principal protuberance before, during, and after
                    I
   totality.      1 saw three lines (C, near D and F) before         and after totality
   and eleven during totality ; eight were instantly extinguished on the first
   appearance       of sunlight."
*   .   This  effect was observed     with two flint prisms and 7 inches aperture.
   Professor Young, with five prisms of 45° and 4 inches aperture, found the
   same result in the part of the spectrum he was examining at the end of
   the totality.
         He writes   :
                       " I had just completed the measurements       of 2602, when the
   totality ended.        This line disappeared instantly, but 2796 [the hydrogen
   line near Gr] was nearly a minute in resuming its usual faintness."           These
    observations I consider among the most important ones made during the
    eclipse ; for they show most unmistakably that, as I have already reported
    to the Secretary of the Government-Grant Committee, the new method to
    be employed under the best conditions must be used with large apertures
    and large dispersion.
         On the fourth point the evidence is but negative only, and therefore in
    favour of the view I have some time ago communicated to the Royal
     Society.
         We next come to the question of the corona, —a question which has
     been made more difficult than ever (in appearance only I think) by the
     American observations.
         I propose to discuss only the spectroscopic observations of Professors
     Young and Pickering in connexion with Dr. Gould-s before quoted re
     marks.
         Professor Pickering, with an ordinary chemical spectroscope            merely
      directed to the sun-s place during totality, obtained the combined spectrum
      of the protuberances and corona. He saw a continuous spectrum with
     two or three bright lines, one "near E," and a second "near C."
         Professor Young, who used a spectroscope            specially adapted for the
      work, in which only one part of the prominence at + 146° was being exa
      mined, saw C, near D, a line at 1250 + 20, and another at 1350 + 20 of
      Kirchhoff-s    scale.  The   rest  of the observations I give in his own words.
         " Then    came the 1474    K  line, which was very bright, though by no means
      equal to C and Da ; but attention was immediately arrested by the fact
      that, unlike them, it extended clean across the spectrum ; and on moving
      the slit away from the protuberances, it persisted, while Da, visibly in the

 182           Mr.   J.   N. Lockyer on      the recent   Eclipse   of the Sun    [Jan. 27,

           OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   Jean Victor Poncelet, Foreign Member of the Royal Society, was
   born at Metz on the 1st of July, 1788. After having studied Mathe
   matics for two years at the Lycee Imperial of Metz, he was admitted to
   the Ecole Poly technique, where he remained till 1810, his studies in
   the meanwhile having been interrupted by a serious illness.           He then
   entered the Ecole d-Application of Metz as Sublieutenant of Engineers,
   and left it in March 1812, in order to assist in constructing the defen
   sive works of Ramekens in the island of Walcheren.        His first engineering
   work here was the erection of a casemated fort in a very limited time, on
  a peat   soil, without having at his command proper materials for a foundation.
   In the month of June 1812 he was called away to take part in the Rus
  sian campaign, and joined the invading army at Vitepsk.          On the 18th of
  August he reconnoitred Smolensk, exposed to the fire of the garrison, and
  afterwards took an active share in the battle fought the same day. On the
   1 9th he was employed in throwing bridges over the Dnieper below Smolensko,
  under the fire of the Russian batteries on the opposite bank of the river.
  Deceiving the enemy by an ostentatious display of preparations for cross
  ing at a particular spot, he succeeded in constructing bridges at other
  points better protected from the Russian fire. During the retreat from
  Moscow, at Krasnoi, not far from Smolensko, seven thousand French sol
  diers under the command of Ney, without artillery, encountered twenty-
 five thousand Russians with forty-five pieces of artillery, under Prince
 Miloradowich, on the 18th of November, 1812. In this battle Poncelet
 charged the Russian batteries at the head of a column of sappers and
 miners ; his horse was killed under him, and he was taken prisoner. After
 a painful four months- march through snow, half naked and ill fed, in a
 season when mercury was        repeatedly frozen, he arrived at Saratoff on the
 Volga.      In April 1813, on recovering from an illness brought on by the
 hardships he had endured, he resolved to occupy his unwelcome leisure
 with the study of descriptive geometry.           But his recollections of the
 teaching of Monge, Carnot, and Brianchon had been totally effaced by the
 privations and sufferings he had undergone.       Without books to aid him he
 was obliged, with much labour, to construct bit by bit the elementary pro
positions required for the line of research he was desirous of following. The
results of his labours at this time were afterwards published in Gergonne-s
 'Annales,- from 1817 to 1821 ; and the original manuscripts, written at Sara
toff, were published in 1862. On the conclusion of peace in June 1814, he
quitted Saratoff for France, where he arrived in September of the same
year.      From 1815 to 1825, as Captain of Engineers, he superintended the
construction of machinery in the arsenal of Metz.         From 1825 to 1835 he
was Professor of Mechanics ; and while he imparted to the young officers
clear ideas of mechanical science, capable of immediate practical applica
tion, he delivered, at the suggestion of Baron Dupin, gratuitous evening
     voL.   xviii.                                                    a

                                           li
lectures on geometry to the artisans of the place, and thereby contributed
largely to the establishment of those courses of public lectures that have
brought the most fertile results of scientific research within the grasp of
 the whole nation.        In addition to these labours he wrote his 'Traite des
 Proprietes     Projectives des Figures' (1822), 'Cours de Mecanique applique
 aux Machines' (1826), and many memoirs on Geometry and Applied
 Mechanics in Gergonne's and Crelle's journals.          He also invented a draw
 bridge with a variable counterpoise, and an undershot water-wheel with
 curved buckets, now known throughout Europe by the name of Poncelet's
 wheel, which nearly doubles the useful effect of a given water-power.
 He was promoted to the rank of Chef de Bataillon in 1831, and became
 a   Member of the Institute       in 1834.     From  1835 to 1848 he was   on the
 Committee for constructing the Fortifications of Paris, and was successively
 appointed Professor of Mechanics at the Sorbonne and at the College de
  France   ;  became Lieutenant-Colonel      in 1841, Colonel in 1844, and General
  of Brigade on the 19th of April, 1848. A few days later he was ap
  pointed Governor of the ficole Polytechnique, a post which he held till
  1850.      During the troubles of June 1848, placing himself at the head of
  the pupils of the Ecole Polytechnique, he led them through the barricades
  to the Luxembourg, where they formed a guard of honour for the pro
  tection of the Provisional Government.          For this important service Gene
  ral Cavaignac appointed him to the command of the National Guards of
  the Department of the Seine.        He was also elected a Member of the Con
  stituent Assembly.        As President of the Scientific Commission sent to
  the English Exhibition of 1851, he drew up a Report on the progress of
  the Arts involving the application of Science during the last half cen
  tury.      Besides the works already mentioned, he wrote a large number
  of Memoirs and Scientific Reports in the Memorial du Genie, les Avis
  du Comite des Fortifications, and the Comptes Rendus.             He was Grand
  Officier of the Legion of Honour, Chevalier of the Prussian Order " Pour le
  Merite," Corresponding Member of the Academies of Berlin, St. Petersburg,
  Turin, and of many other learned Societies ; his election as Foreign
  Member of the Royal Society took place in 1842.                After a long and
  painful illness, he died in Paris on the 23rd of December, 1867.
      Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward, F.R.S., F.L.S.,               who died on June 4th
   1868 in his 77th year, was a sonnd practical        botanist, and was especially
  known as the inventor of the closely glazed cases for the growth of plants,
  which bear his name.        When quite young he evinced a taste for natural
  history and made his little collections of plants and animals.       A voyage to
   Jamaica when he was thirteen years old, and the contemplation of the
  luxuriant vegetable life of that island, inspired him with an ardent love for
   the science of botany.      He was educated to the medical profession, and
   for many years of his life wa3 engaged in its practice in the east end of
  London.       His leisure time, however, was devoted to the study and culti

                                          iii
ration of plants ; and his house in Wellclose Square was conspicuous for the
vegetation which surrounded it.         But the deleterious atmospheric influ
ences to which it was exposed subjected him to continual vexation and
disappointment     ;  and the only way in which he could maintain a fluctuating
appearance of freshness and verdure was by bringing back a renewed supply
of plants on the occasion of any visit to nursery grounds or the country.
In the summer of 1829, a solution of his difficulties presented itself. He
had placed the chrysalis of a moth in some mould in a glass bottle covered
with   a lid, in order to obtain   a perfect specimen of the    insect ; after a time
a  speck   or  two of vegetation appeared on the surface         of the mould, and
turned out to be a fern and a grass.          His interest was  excited  ; he placed
the bottle in a favourable situation and found that the         plants continued to
grow and to maintain a healthy appearance.           On reflecting upon the matter,
he found that the conditions necessary to the life of the plants were main
tained, and deleterious agents, as soot, noxious gases, drying winds, &c.,
were excluded.       The first Wardian case gave rise to numerous others ; and in
two or three years the success of the plan was satisfactorily demonstrated.
In 1836 Mr. Ward wrote upon the subject to the late SirW. Hooker;
and the letter was published in the Companion to the Botanical Magazine
for May of that year.         In 1 838 Mr. Faraday lectured upon the " cases "
at the    Royal Institution; and subsequently Mr. Ward himself explained
his plan at various Societies and at Meetings of the British Association.
In 1842 the first edition of Mr. Ward-s work on "The Growth of Plants
in Closely-glazed      Cases
                              " was published;     and a second    edition appeared
a  few years later.
    It was soon recognized that Mr. Ward-s method was susceptible of various
valuableapplicatious.of which the following maybe noticed : — I . Thegrowth
 of plants in the dwellings of all classes, in town as well as country.       2. The
transport of plants to and from different countries : the tea-plant and
the cinchona-tree have by means of the Wardian cases become esta
 blished in India. 3. For purposes of philosophical investigation.              4. To
 the study and conservation of animals : the Vivaria were first established
 as a modification of the cases by Mr. Ward himself.
    When residing at Wellclose Square, Mr. Ward gave frequent microsco
 pical soirees.      Out of these sprang the Microscopical Society in 1840,
 Dr. Bowerbank and the late Messrs. Quekett and Jackson having also taken
 part in its foundation.      He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in
 1852. In 1856, a large number of friends combined to recognize Mr. Ward-s
services by having his portrait painted by J. P. Knight, R.A., and placed
 in the meeting-room of the Linnean Society.
    The estimation in which the subject of this notice and his scientific ser
 vices were held by those best capable of forming an opinion, will be shown
 by the following extracts from a letter written by Dr. Hooker to the editors
 of a scientific journal : —
     " During the whole period that I knew Mr. Ward, and, I believe, for
                                                                       a 2

                                                  iv
 many years before, his hospitable house, first in Wellclose Square, and
 afterwards at Claphara Rise, was the most frequented metropolitan
 resort of naturalists from all quarters of the globe of any since Sir
 Joseph Banks's day.            Ilis   unpretending entertainments were frequent, for
 many years periodic, and often weekly.                      On these occasions his many
 scientific  friends    flocked    to  see  himself,   his   live plants, and the many spe
 cimens, instruments, and preparations he had collected to instruct and
 entertain them       ;  and on such occasions           it  was that many a country and
 colonial naturalist was introduced for the first, and too often for the last
 time in his life, to some of the most eminent naturalists in Europe.
    " Of   the value       of that contrivance which justly             bears   his name,    the
 Ward's    case, it  is impossible to speak too strongly            ; and  I feel safe in saying
 that without its aid        a large proportion of the most valuable economic and
 other tropical plants,        now    cultivated in England, would not yet have been
 introduced."
                    "   Of even more consequence was the application of these cases

polis far greater and purer pleasures than all artists, house-decorators, &c.
have contributed ; for a primrose placed in flower under a bell-glass at
Christmas in a London drawing-room will charm when a Raphael does not,
and will charm none the less when a Raphael charms also."
                                                                                       " In the
memory of all who knew him, Mr. Ward will live as a type of a genial,
upright, and most amiable man, an accomplished practitioner, and an en-
thuiastic lover of nature in all its aspects."
    Mr. Robert Porrett                 was   born on the 22nd September 1783.                His
father held the office of Ordnance Storekeeper in the Tower, and resided
 there ; and the son, having early shown an aptitude for such a situation, was
employed as his father's assistant, and, succeeding him in his appointment,
eventually rose to be chief of the department.                    His official work, not being
of an engrossing nature, left him leisure to apply his intelligent and inquiring
mind to scientific pursuits, especially to chemistry ; and inasmuch as he
received a medal from the Society of Arts for a chemical discovery in
1809, he was probably at the time                of his death the oldest representative
of experimental chemistry in this country.                  In fact he was a worker in che
mistry   before   the     introduction     of  the   atomic     theory, and was among the
first to apply the new doctrine to the verification of chemical analysis.
Mr. Porrett's earliest researches were on hydro-ferrocyanic and hydro-
sulphocyanic acids, of which he was the discoverer.                      The investigation of
the constitution of these acids (which he named ferruretted and sulphu
retted chyazic acids) and of their salts forms the subject of various papers
which he contributed between 1809 and 1819 to the ' Philosophical Trans
actions' and other scientific publications : they are as follows: — "OnPrussic
and Prussous Acid," Trans, of the Soc. of Arts, vol. xxvii. 1809, p. 89;
" On the Nature of the Salts termed triple Prussiates," &c, Phil. Trans.
1814, p. 527; " Further Analytical Experiments relative to the                    Constitution

  of  the Prussic,   of the Ferruretted Chyazic, and of the Sulphuretted Chynzic
  Acids, and on that of their Salts; together with the application of the
  Atomic theory to the analysis of these Bodies," Phil. Trans., 1815, p. 220 ;
  '' On the
              Anthrazothion of Von Grotthus, and on Sulphuretted Chyazic
  Acid," Thomson-s Annals of Philosophy, vol. xiii. (1819) p. 356 ; "On
  the Triple Prussiate of Potash," Ann. Phil. vol. xii. p. 214, which contains
  a discussion of his own analyses of " ferruretted chyazic acid," and that of
  Dr. Thomson, published in a previous part of the same volume ; " On
  Ferrochyazate of Potash, and on the Atomic weight of Iron," Ann. Phil,
  vol. xiv. 1820, p. 205.
     In 1813 Mr. Porrett was engaged with Messrs. Wilson and Rupert Kirk
  in an investigation of chloride of nitrogen, with a view chiefly to the ex
  amination of the physical properties and chemical composition of that
 dangerously explosive compound, and the discovery of safe and suitable
 processes for preparing it.
     In 1816 he communicated to Thomson-s Annals of Philosophy, vol.
 viii. p. 74, an account of " Two Curious Galvanic Experiments," in which
 he showed that a fluid is made to pass against gravity by the electric cur
 rent through a membrane from the positive to the negative pole when the
 conducting wires of a battery are connected with water placed at different
 levels on each side of the membrane.          The fact so discovered by him is
 by German writers generally associated with his name as " das Porrettsche
 Phiinomen."        He also described the increase of action which is produced
 in an exhausted voltaic battery by removing a portion of the fluid, whereby
the still moist plates are exposed to the action of the air.         In 1817 he
mnde some       " Observations    on the Flame of a Candle," which were pub
                  '
lished in the       Annals of Philosophy,- vol. ix. p. 337.
     After  an interval of twenty-six years, he again, in 1846, at the age of
sixty-three, took up chemical investigation, and contributed, in conjunction
with the late E. F. Teschemacher, a paper " On the Chemical Composition
of Gun Cotton" (Memoirs of the Chemical Society, vol viii. 1845-1848,
p. 258).       His last paper "On the existence of a new Vegeto- Alkali in
Gun Cotton," for which he proposed the name of Lignia, was read before
the Chemical Society on December 21st of the same year, and is printed
in the Memoirs, vol. iii. p. 287.
     While devoting his leisure time principally to chemistry, Mr. Porrett
also    occupied himself with antiquarian pursuits, especially the study of
ancient arms and armour, for which his residence in the Tower afforded
favourable opportunity.          He retired from official duty in 1850, after a
service of 55 years.         On that occasion his long and useful service was
honourably recognized by his superiors, and he received most gratifying
expressions of regard and attachment from his subordinate officers.           He
was a Fellow of the Astronomical and Antiquarian Societies, and one of the
original members of the Chemical Society ; his election into the Royal Society
was in 1848.        He died   on the 25th November   1868, at the age  of 85.

                                           vi
    Carl Friedrich Philipp            von     Martius,  Foreiga Member of the
Royal Society, was boru on the 17th of April, 1794, at Erlangen, where
his father, Ernst Wilhelm Martius, was Court Apothecary, and Honorary
Professor of Pharmacy in the University.             The family is said to have
come from     Italy, but had for    several generations been settled in Germany-
After a careful and judicious training at home, for which he was indebted
chiefly to an intelligent and accomplished mother, young Martius received
his general education in the school and the gymnasium of his native
town.      From his father he had inherited a taste for Natural History; and
under the tuition of Professors Richter and Besenbeck, of the Gymnasium, he
acquired a well-grounded knowledge of classical literature ; so that a good
foundation was laid for that well-balanced general mental culture of which
 the fruits are conspicuous in his writings.       When not quite sixteen years
 of age, he entered the University of Erlangen.           His main object was the
 study of medicine, but he also followed his early bent towards Natural
 History, and especially Botany. The Botanical Professor of that day was
 Schreber, who had himself studied under Linnaeus ; but Martius' s attach
  ment to the science was greatly fostered and promoted by the friendship of
  the brothers Nees von Esenbeck, then his fellow students, who afterwards
  rose to eminence    as botanists.    From the elder of the brothers Martius
  also received  a tincture of the then prevalent " Natur-Philosophie," which
  may be perceived to colour his earlier writings ; but its influence seems to
  have been but transient.
      In March   1814 he was promoted with distinction to the degree of Doctor
   of Medicine, and published his inaugural dissertation under the title
   "Plantarum Horti Academici Erlangensis Enumeratio," a critical catalogue
   of plants arranged according to the Linnean system.
      An event had happened some time before which decided Martius's
   future career.     The Academy of Sciences of Munich, on the death of
   Schreber, sent to Erlangen two of its members, Schrank and Spix, to
   acquire his botanical collections for the Academy ; and these naturalists,
   having seen the promise of future excellence evinced by the young man,
   invited Martins to apply for admission into the " Institution of Eleves,"
   then existing in the Academy, in which the pupils had the advantage of
   following out the higher study of selected branches of science under the
   auspices of the Academy and the immediate guidance of certain of its mem
   bers. Through the prospect thus set before him, the wish which Martius
    had already entertained of devoting himself entirely to botany, became a
    settled resolution.   After going through the prescribed trials, he was in
    May 1814 received among the Eleves of the Academy, and appointed,
    under the direction of Schrank, now advanced in years, to be assistant in
    the management of the Botanic Garden at Munich, with an annual salary
    of 500 florins. Two years later he was advanced to the rank of " Adjunct
    of the Academy," an order which no longer exists, having been abolished,
    together with the Institute of Eleves, by King Louis in 1827.
               *

                                       vii
    Martius not only laboured zealously in the superintendence of the Garden,
but made frequent excursions through Bavaria and the adjacent regions for
the study of the indigenous flora ; aud it was on one of these occasions that
he made the friendship of Hoppe, the Director of the Botanic Garden of
Ratisbon, and began with him a scientific correspondence which was long-
enduring.     At this time he published the ' Flora Cryptogamica Erlan-
gensis- (Norimbergi, 1817), which contained the results of his first inde
pendent researches, and met with high approval from his fellow workers in
the science.    His earnest devotion to study, his conspicuous talents, and
his untiring activity, could scarcely fail to earn for him the regard of his
older academical colleagues, such as Schrank, Schlichtigroll, Soemmerring,
and the Conservator General von Moll — all of them men fitted to produce
a beneficial influence on his mental development.          In like manner he
attracted the kindly notice and favourable consideration of the King
Maximilian Joseph I., who, being a great lover of plants, paid frequent
visits to the Garden under the welcome guidance of the young superin
tendent   ; and this had an important effect on his future fortune.
    This enlightened prince had for       some time entertained the project of
 sending a scientific expedition to America ; and as the Emperor of Austria
was about to send out scientific explorers to Brazil in the retinue of the
Archduchess     Leopoldina, who was about to sail for that country as the
bride of the Crown Prince of Portugal, afterwards the Emperor Don
 Pedro I. of Brazil, King Max. Joseph availed himself of the opportunity
offered to him of sending out two Bavarian naturalists on that occasion.
The choice fell on Spix as Zoologist, and Martius as Botanist, who was
 selected by the king himself.    After but a brief time allowed for equip
ment, the two travellers sailed from Trieste on the 2nd of April, 1817,
 with the imperial cortege, and, after touching at Malta, Gibraltar, and
 Madeira, arrived at Rio Janeiro on the 15th of      July. There they parted
 from the Austrian savans, and set out on their own journey.
    It is unnecessary here to trace the course of their travels ; suffice it to
 say that, after traversing the vast territory of Brazil in various directions,
 and ascending the River Amazons and its tributary the Hyapurd as far
 as the confines   of Peru and New Granada, they arrived      at  Para on their
 return journey on the 16th of April, 1820, three years after they had sailed
 from Europe.      From Para they were conveyed to Lisbon in a Portuguese
 ship of war, and reached Munich on the 8th of December, 1820.
    This expedition, irrespective of the sea voyage, extended over nearly 1400
 geographical miles, and for months led through the most inhospitable and
 dangerous regions of the New World.          Both explorers, however, escaped
 without any important disaster on the road, and they had the rare good
 fortune to preserve and bring home their collections complete and un
 injured.
    The material fruits of the expedition consisted of about 6500 species of
 plants, the majority dried ; but several living species, as well as seeds, were

                                        viii
also brought home.       The zoological collections (to which Martius contri
buted also on his solitary voyage up the Hyapura) numbered 85 species of
Mammals, 130 of Amphibia, 350 of Birds, 1 16 of Fishes, 2700 of Insects, 80
of Arachnoids, and 80 of Crustacea. The species, especially the plants, are
represented, many by numerous, and all by well-preserved specimens.
    On their return home, the king nominated the travellers Knights of the
Order for Civil Merit ; and Martius received the appointment of ordinary
member of the Academy of Sciences, and second conservator of the Botanic
Garden.
    In consequence of this expedition, the direction of Martius-s future
scientific activity was decided.     Brazil was thenceforward the country to
which    he devoted    the greater part of it.       Before everything else his
energy was centred on the flora of Brazil.
    The first work made public relative to the Brazilian expedition was the
Narrative of the Journey.         It appeared in 1823-31, in three quarto
volumes, accompanied by an atlas.            The compilation of this work was
originally intrusted conjointly to both travellers by Maximilian Joseph I. ;
but Spix did not long survive the completion of the first volume, and so it
happened that by far the greater portion of the work proceeded from Mar
tius-s unaided pen. Of course in the ' Narrative of Travels natural products
                                                                 -
are treated of more or less in detail ; but it could not be occupied with the
special discussion and elaboration of scientific matter.        This was reserved
for a separate work, which appeared contemporaneously in a magnificent
series of volumes.     In the first place Martius undertook only the botanical
section,  and Spix the zoological ; but, on account of the death of the latter
in 182G, when he had only worked up the mammals, the birds, and a part
of the amphibia, the continuation of this part of the work also fell upon
 Martius. He acquitted himself of the task in the most satisfactory manner,
having secured the assistance of Agassiz, Andreas Wagner, and Pertz, for
 the actual work, whilst he acted as editor.       The publication of the bota
nical treasures took the form of a selection of the most interesting novelties.
 The Phanerogamia, or flowering plants,          were  illustrated  in the ' Nova
 Genera et Species PlantarumBrasiliensium-        (3 vols.fol., Munich, 1823-32),
 and the Cryptogamia in the ' Icones Selectae Plantarum Cryptogamicarum
 Brasiliensium,- 1 vol., 1827).     The first volume of the former work was
 prepared by Martius-s colleague, Zuccarini, the remainder entirely by
 Martius, except the chapter in the ' Icones Selectae - on the internal
 structure of Tree-Fern stems, from the pen of Hugo von Mohl —a chapter
 that served to enhance the value of the work in the highest degree.
 In these publications not only were many new and highly remarkable plants
 made known (more than 400 species and more than 70 genera), but they
 were also so  fully and lucidly described that botany received        an essential
  enrichment.     A practised and quick sight for natural affinities, a happy
  gift of combination — in short, an essentially "systematic tact," placed
  Martius in the rank of the first botanists of his time.

                                           ix
   A third work     was taken    in hand by Martius in 1823, and, indeed, the
one with which his name will be most closely and enduringly connected.
This was the Monograph of Palms, ' Historia Naturalis Palmarum (3
                                                                               -
vols. imp. fol., Munich, 1823-50).            The peculiar richness of Brazil in
Palms, the beauty     of Brazilian   forms,   and the honour likely to accrue from
a new and comprehensive work on this group of plants induced Martius
to concentrate his attention upon them immediately after his arrival             in
Brazil.   The fulfilment of this great undertaking        cost twenty-eight years
of labour and research.
   For the matters with which he was less conversant, Martius obtained
the cooperation of distinguished colleagues. The chapter on the ana
tomy of palms was written by H. von Mohl ; the fossil palms fell to the
share of F. Unger; and Sendtner and A. Braun contributed to the mor
phology.     But by far the greater part came from the pen of Martius him
self, notably  : — the chapter on the geographical distribution of palms, in
which Martius enunciated his views on phyto-geography in general ; and
the whole of the third volume, containing descriptions of all known palms,
systematically arranged, and forming in itself an almost complete mono
graph of the family.        The scientific merit of this work was universally
acknowledged.       Not only was the -special knowledge of palms thereby
greatly  extended,    but the science of botany in general was signally pro
moted ; and it may be said, in the words of a great naturalist, that, "so
long as palms are known and palms are grown, the name of Martius will not
be forgotten."
   The last great work by Martius to which we can refer on this occasion
is the ' Flora Brasiliensis.-     He had made an attempt, in conjunction with
Nees von Esenbeck, to publish such a work on a small scale, but soon aban
doned the idea ; but in 1839, encouraged by Prince Metternich, he planned
a far more ambitious          publication, in conjunction with the celebrated
Viennese botanist Endlicher.          The groundwork of it was to consist of an
entirely new and       scientific  elaboration of all the accessible materials
brought    together from      Brazil, accompanied by numerous plates, thus
forming a splendid systematic whole.           To comprehend in some degree the
magnitude of such an undertaking, it must be remembered that the flora of
Brazil numbers almost five times as many species as that of the entire area
of Central Europe.       It was plain that the carrying out such a work could
be accomplished only by the joint labours of many scientific men ; and
Martius was fortunate enough to obtain the services of the most
eminent German and foreign botanists for this purpose.               The Emperor
Ferdinand    I.  of  Austria,   and  the  Emperor   Don  Pedro  II. of Brazil, and
also King Louis of Bavaria took the work under their special patronage.
After Endlicher-s death in 1849, Fenzl, his successor in office, supplied his
place, as co-editor with Martius.           At first the work proceeded slowly,
on account of the novelty and costliness of the undertaking j but since the
year 1850, in consequence of the increased interest taken in it by the Bra

                                             X
zilian Government, it has gone on more rapidly, and has now reached
the 46th part.    The completion, which Martins so longed to see,
has been intrusted to his friend Dr. Eichler. It was one of Martius-s
last cares to take the needful steps to ensure its continuance ; so that we
may reasonably hope to see this noble monument of German industry in
science brought to a close.  Even now the parts that have appeared form
the most comprehensive work in botanical literature yet published.  Nearly
10,000 species are described, and these are illustrated by more than 1100
folio plates. It is evident that the editing and publication alone of so
enormous a mass of matter is a performance worthy of the highest acknow
ledgment ; but Martius-s merit was by no means limited to that.   True,
of all the monographs published, two only were by Martius ; but then he
supplemented nearly all the others by valuable explanations on the geo
graphical       distribution   and the medicinal, technical, and economical im
portance of the several plants.          He also contributed a series of charac
teristic plates representing the vegetation (' Tabulae Physiognomies                  -),
accompanied        by
                 masterly definitions, in elegant Latin. He also contributed
maps of the floral districts, routes of travel, &c.  Several of the mono
graphs in the Flora Brasiliensis     are esteemed as masterpieces; for in
                    '                    -
many  cases the  men  who    wrote them   had previously devoted years of
study to the respective groups.   The mere enumeration of Martius-s other
writings would  fill   long space, for there are more than
                          a                                  50 separate 1
works.   Among these may be specially mentioned his Beitriige zur Eth-
                                                                '
nographie und Sprachkunde Braziliens as evidence, besides what appears
                                                 -
in the narrative of his travels, that he devoted himself to other objects in
Brazil besides the study of its natural history.
   Reverting to the main facts of Martius-s life, we left him in 1820, just
after his return from Brazil, when he was nominated ordinary member of
the Academy, and second conservator of the Botanic Garden.    For some
years his position remained unchanged.   -When, however, in 1826, King
Ludwig     ascended the throne, and the University of Landshut was re
           I.
moved to Munich, he was appointed Professor of Botany in that institu
tion   and six years later, upon the retirement of the aged Schrank, he
       ;
received the post of first conservator. With the exception of occasional
journeys to England, France, Holland, &c., he discharged almost un
interruptedly the duties of both appointments until 1854.                    In 1840
he was elected Secretary to the Mathematical and Physical                   Class of
the Munich Academy,            and continued in the office     till the time of his
death.
   With    budget of only 4500 florins, Martius succeeded, with the assist
           a
ance of the highly meritorious gardener Weinkauff, in making the Botanic
Garden     model establishment.
           a                         The Garden had just been rearranged
with great  care, and partially replanted, when in 1854,            by
                                                           the erection of
a   glass building      for an industrial exhibition, the beautiful plan was marred.
Martius, who had vainly remonstrated against this intrusion,                 ceased   to

                                           si
interest himself in the garden ; and his principal occupation thereafter was
                             '
the publication of the Flora Brasiliensis.-
     Whatever the world could offer in acknowledgment of his merits Mar-
 tius received.      He was elected member of nearly all the academies and
learned bodies in; Europe, and kings and emperors honoured him with the
 most distinguishing marks of favour.          His election as Foreign Member of
 the Royal Society was in 1838.           He rejoiced in the esteem and friend
 ship   of  his most   distinguished contemporaries ; and plants and animals,
 and even a mountain        (Mount Martius in New Zealand), were named in his
 honour.      But   the most gratifying   expression of homage and veneration was
 presented to him on the 30th of March, 1864, the 50th and jubilee anni
 versary of the day on which he was invested with the degree of Doctor.          His
 friends caused a medal to be      struck, with the inscription,   " Palmarnm patri
 dant lustra decem tibi palmam.          In Palmis resurges." And on the 15th
 of December, 1868, the remains of the departed were lowered into their last
  resting-place bedecked with Palm-leaves.
     General Thomas Perronet Thompson                    was born at    Hull, on the
  15th of March,      1783, the eldest of three sons of Thomas Thompson, Esq.,
  a  merchant and banker of that town, and for several years M.P. for Midhurst.
  His mother was the grand-daughter of the Rev. Vincent Perronet, vicar of
  Shoreham in Kent, a Swiss Protestant by descent, and one of the few
  clergymen of the Church of England who joined John Wesley at the com
  mencement of his mission.         The youth-s early education was received at
  the Hull grammar school, under the Rev. Joseph Milner, author of the
  " Ecclesiastical History ; " and in October        1 798 he entered    Queen-s Col
  lege, Cambridge,      where in due time he took his         B.A.   degree with the
  honour of Seventh Wrangler — no bad start in life for a boy under nineteen.
      In 1803 he sailed as a midshipman in the 'Isis - of 50 guns, the flag
  ship of Vice-Admiral (afterwards Lord) Gambier, on the Newfoundland
   station, and was shortly after put in charge of a West-Indiaman recaptured
  in the mouth of the Channel,        and ordered with other prizes to Newfound
  land, where she arrived, the only one that had stuck by her convoy through
   those foggy latitudes.      In the following year he received information of
   having been elected to a Fellowship at Queen-s,
                                                          " a sort of promotion," he
   remarks, " which has not often gone along with the rank and dignity of a
   midshipman."        Trafalgar, for which he saw Nelson embark on board the
   '          -
     Victory    at   Portsmouth in September 1 805, closed the prospect of
   active service in the navy, and in 1806 he joined the " old 95th Rifles
                                                                                  " as
   a second Lieutenant, and was among the prisoners captured, together with
   General Crawford, by the Spaniards in the Convent of San Domingo, in
   Whitelock-s attack on Buenos Ayres, on the 5th July, 1807.
       After his liberation and return to England he was sent in the spring of
    1808, at the age of twenty-five, as Governor, to Sierra Leone, through the
   influence of Mr. Wilberforce, an early friend of his father-s.            Here his

 efforts to put down the Slave Trade, which secretly existed under the name
 of " apprenticeship," marked the man who ever after stuck " closer than a
 brother
          " to the dark-skinned   races of the earth.   "  There was no time  for
hesitation" (he wrote long afterwards).
                                              " Of  two things he must do one,
either withdraw under the pressure of the acknowledged danger of meddling
with a dishonest system, or push forward for the present abatement of the
mischief, with the almost certainty of being abandoned by the government
at home."       He chose the latter, and was recalled. When the official
 documents connected with his proceedings were subsequently required          for
 discussion in Parliament, reply was made that they could not" be found.
    After marrying, in 1811, Anne Elizabeth, daughter of the Rev. Thomas
 Barker, of York, he joined the 14th Light Dragoons in Spain as Lieu
tenant, and was present at the actions of Nivelle, Nive, Orthes, and Tou
louse, for which    he received  the Peninsular    War-medal with four   clasps.
During the campaign of 1814 he was taken off regimental duty and attached
to the staff of General (afterwards Sir Henry) Fane, of whose kindness
and ability be preserved a grateful recollection.     " Some old dragoons, dis
charged on eightpence a day," he writes of himself,
                                                          " may remember that
he was a careful leader of a patrol, a good look-out on picquet, could
feel a retiring enemy,   and carry off a sentry for proof, as well as another, a
great hater of punishment, and a man of very small baggage, consisting of
something like a spare shirt and an Arabic grammar."
    His youngest brother, Charles, B.A. and Travelling Bachelor of Queen's,
and Lieutenant and Captain in the 1st Foot Guards, was killed in action
at  Biarritz, in the South of France, on the 12th December, 1813 ; and the
survivor, in the irresistible desire of seeing his face once more, had him
taken up a few days after and reinterred in the garden of the Mavor of
Biarritz, where he rests among the strawberry beds with two other officers
of the same regiment, over whose graves the gallant Frenchman has placed
a stone with an appropriate French inscription.         This striking incident
was commemorated by        the muse of Amelia Opie, who on this occasion felt
as a friend, a relative, and a poet.
    Promoted at the peace ot 1814, Captain Thompson exchanged into the
1 7th Light Dragoons, serving in India, where he improved his knowledge
of Arabic, which he had begun to study as a subaltern of dragoons in
Spain.     Arriving at Bombay in 1815, he soon after served in the Pindarry
campaign, and had charge of the outposts of the force under Sir William
Grant Keir, whom he accompanied in 1819 as Arabic interpreter to the
expedition against the Wahabees of the Persian Gulf.         In this capacity he
assisted at the reduction of Ras al Khyma and other places on the coast,
and had a prominent part in negotiating          the treaty with the defeated
tribes, the most remarkable article in which     was the declaring the Slave
Trade to be piracy ; the earliest declaration to that effect in point of time,
though the American one reached England first (see
                                                          " Exercises," vol. iv.
p. 29).

                                           xiii
    When the main body of the expedition returned to Bombay, he was
left in charge of Ras al Khyma with 1 100 men, Sepoys with a detachment
of European artillery, and was eventually ordered to demolish the town,
and withdraw the troops to the island of Kishme on the Persian coast.
A misunderstanding having arisen           between the Bombay Government and
the Arabs of      Al  Ashkerch on the coast of Oman, who had plundered certain
boats, the former sent an order to Captain Thompson to act against them from
Kishme in the event of their clearly appearing to be piratical, but to address
a  letter to them previously to any attack being made. This attempt at nego
tiation failing through the murder by the hostile tribe of the messenger
bearing the letter, the injunction to communicate appeared to be fulfilled
and answered.         Few will see any  alternative but to execute  the orders to
act   ; and military men will comprehend the duty of acting with decision
under the circumstances which had arisen.                Landing at Soor, on the
Arabian coast, forty-six English miles from the town of the hostile tribe
of Beni Bou Ali, Captain Thompson-s small force of 320 Sepoys and four
guns was joined by the Imam of Maskat with 2000 men of his own.                  The
force of the enemy was reported to be 900 bearing arms.               On the 9th
November, 1820, as the column was toiling through the sand, the hostile
sheik, Mohammed Ben Ali, advanced to the attack, sword in hand. What
followed is best described in Captain Thompson-s own words, written in a
                                     "
private letter the next day : — The Arabs made the guns the point of
attack, and advanced upon them.            The instant I heard a shot from the
light troops, which showed the Arabs to be in motion, I ordered the
Sepoys to charge with the bayonet.             Not a man moved forward.       I then
ordered them to fire.       They   began a straggling and ineffectual    fire, aided
 by    the artillery,  the Arabs    all the while    advancing, brandishing their
swords. The Sepoys stood till the Arabs were within fifteen yards, when
 they turned and ran.        I immediately galloped to the point where the
 Sepoys were least confused, and endeavoured to make them stand ; but
 they fired their musquets in the air and went off. The Imam-s army began
a fire of matchlocks, and went off as soon as the Arabs approached.                 I
 rode    to the Imam -and found him wounded.             The people just ran like
 sheep.     I saw  some  of the European artillerymen, and ran to endeavour to
 make them stand       ; but they were too few to do anything."
     In the midst of the meUe the writer was struck on the shoulder by a
 matchlock ball, which passed through coat and shirt, grazing the skin, as
 he used to say, " like the cut of a whip."          The loss of the force in men
 and guns was most severe, "as must always be the case," he observes,
 "  when troops wait to be attacked with the          sword and then give way."
 The remnants were at length rallied at the            town of Beni Bou Hassan,
 about three miles from the scene of action,          and after repulsing a night
 attack, were led back overland to Maskat by          Captain Thompson in person,
 eight days after the fight.
     Another expedition       was  quickly   sent  from   Bombay.   The town      was

taken, and the defenders    were conveyed as prisoners to Bombay, where, at
the meeting between the captive sheik and his original assailant, they agreed
heartily on one point, that it would have been a happy thing for both if
the letter, lost by the murder of the messenger, had reached its destination.
   A court-martial followed, as usually happens in cases of disaster, how
ever undeserved.      He was " honourably acquitted
                                                         " of the two
                                                                          graTer
charges  affecting his personal conduct, and only
                                                       " found guilty of so
                                                                        "
much of the remainder as, in the opinion of the Court, warranted a repri
mand for " rashly undertaking the expedition with so small a detachment,"
and for " having addressed an Official Report to Government, in which,
from erroneous conclusions, he unjustly and without foundation ascribed
his defeat to the misbehaviour before the enemy of the officers and men
under his command."        The Report alluded to is in the Supplement to the
*
  London Gazette' of the 15th and 18th May, 1821 (copied in the 'Times'
of the 19th), and may be usefully compared with the finding of the Court.
   Their position no doubt was painful, as standing between the incensed
Bombay Government and its unsuccessful officer ; and it was difficult to
reconcile the logic of facts with a natural regard for the wounded feelings
of the Company's service.      The wars of Affghanistan, Sind, the Punjab,
and the Mutiny had not taken place to prove the inferiority of Sepoys to
a hardier race ; and Indian public opinion was slow to believe anything to
their disadvantage.      Under these circumstances, and viewed by the       light
of subsequent experience, the result of the trial was alike honourable to
the Court and to the accused ; but it nearly broke his heart at the time,
 and left traces for life on his mind and spirits.    Yet it is characteristic of
his generous disposition that he retained no prejudice against the Sepovs
 as a body ; and when they were punished, as he thought, with undue se
 verity after the mutiny, his voice and pen were vigorously exerted in their
 behalf.
    In 1822, his regiment being ordered home, Captain Thompson retained
 with his wife and child by the Red Sea, Cosseir, Thebes, the Nile, Cairo,
 and Alexandria, through Italy and France.          The " overland route " of
 that day was a very different undertaking from what it is now ; and the
 voyage, performed in country vessels, was protracted by contrary winds,
 so that more than a year was consumed in reaching England.            In 1827
 he was promoted to a Majority in the 65th Regiment, then in Ireland, and
 in 1829 to an unattached Lieutenant- Colonelcy of Infantry.         His subse
 quent promotions bore date, Colonel 1846, Major-General 1854, Lieu-
 tenant-General 1860, and General 1868.
    And now, after his return to England, commenced the literary and poli
tical portion of his life.   To the first number of the ' Westminster Review '
he furnished the article on the " Instrument of Exchange," the result of
eleven   years' continuous study.       In 1 829 he became virtually the sole
proprietor ; and beginning with the article in support of Catholic Emanci
pation, of which 40,000 copies were dispersed under the title of the

                                           XV
"Catholic State Waggon,"          he continued   to write at the rate of three or
four articles per number, making         upwards of a hundred in all, till the
Review was transferred in 1836.          In 1825 he wrote, to serve the Greek
cause, two pamphlets in modern Greek and French on the service of
outposts, and on a system of telegraphing for field service. In the follow
ing year he published the * True Theory of Rent,' in support of Adam
Smith against Ricardo and others ; in which view he was borne out by
Say.     And in 1 827, eleven years before the Anti-Corn Law League was
formed, and when he was only a Major in a marching regiment, he pub
lished his celebrated 'Catechism on the Corn Laws,' a work which went
through many editions, and to which Mr. Cobden always acknowledged
the obligations of the Free Trade cause.          " For breadth of principle,"
                                                                                says
a generous political        opponent, "humorous         and telling illustration, a
strong racy Saxon style, there is nothing in Cobbett superior to this little
pamphlet."
    He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1828. The following
year he wrote      " Instructions   to my Daughter for Playing on the Enhar
monic Guitar       ; being an attempt to effect the execution of correct har
mony, on principles analogous to those of the ancient Enharmonic."                He
followed this up by the construction on the same principle of an Enhar
monic Organ, which was shown at the Great Exhibition of 1851, and
 " honourably     mentioned
                              " in the Reports of the Juries.      In 1830 he pub
lished    'Geometry without Axioms,' being           an   endeavour   to get rid of
Axioms, and particularly to establish the Theory of Parallel Lines without
recourse to any principle not founded on previous demonstration.                 The
work went through several editions, with successive amendments, but at
 tracted more attention in France than here ; and an accurate translation
was published by M. Van Tenac, Professor of Mathematics at the Royal
 Establishment at Rochefort, and subsequently attached to the Ministry of
 Marine at Paris. In 1830 he also published a pamphlet on the ' Adjust
 ment of the House of Peers,' which obtained the remarkable compliment
 of being republished in Cobbett's Register.            The same year, at the in
 vitation of Jeremy Bentham, he edited the Tenth Chapter (on military
                             " Constitutional Code," and wrote the notes and
 establishments) of his
 " Subsidiary Observations " at the end. In 1834 he published at Paris,
 in answer to the EnquSte, or Commercial Inquiry then carried on by the
 French Government, the " Contre-Enquete ; par l'Homme aux Quarante
 Ecus ;" in which the principles of commercial freedom were developed
 under   a  familiar form.     In 1842   he collected all his writings in six closely
 printed volumes, under the title of
                                           " Exercises, Political, and others," — a
 mine of literary, political, military, mathematical, and musical informa
 tion. This was followed, in 1848, by his * Catechism on the Currency,'
 the object of which is to show that the best currency is one of paper, in
 convertible, but limited.       The views set forth in this publication are em
 bodied in a motion      of which   Colonel Thompson gave notice in the House

                                                    xvi
 of Commons         1 7th July, 1850,
                 on the               and in                   of twenty-one Reso
                                                               a series
 lutions which he moved  in the House on the          1 7th June,  1852, and which
 were negatived. (3 Hansard, cxxii. 899).             His ' Fallacies against the
 Ballot,- afterwards reprinted as a " Catechism," first appeared in 1855.
    At the general election in January 1835, he polled 1386 votes at Preston
 without being present.       In June following he was elected, after a sharp con
 test, by a majority of five, for Hull, his native place, and was, as he expressed
 it, " laid down and robbed at the door of the House of Commons " to the
 amount of .£4000          by
                            petition of which none of the charges were proved
                                a
 before the Committee.        While in Parliament, both at that time and after
 wards, he maintained          constant correspondence with his constituents,
                                    a
 addressing them generally twice    week through local newspapers in short
                                              a
 and pithy reports, which were republished under the title of " Letters of                     a
                        "
 Representative," and Audi Alteram Partem," this last consisting chiefly
 of an indignant commentary               taken to suppress the Indian
                                         on the measures
 Mutiny. He was also an          promoter of  the abolition of corporal
                                         active
 punishment in the army, and an opponent of the restriction of marriage
with   a   deceased wife-s sister.
   Defeated     at Maidstone            by   Mr. Disraeli in 1837, and subsequently            at
Marylebone,       Manchester,           and Sunderland,        he was     elected   in   1847 for
Bradford, again defeated there in 1852                    by
                                          six votes, and finally, in 1857,
returned without   contest. The dissolution of 1859 closed his career in
                       a
Parliament, for which he never stood again, although he continued to
write in various periodicals on public matters under the signature of " An
Old Reformer," and latterly as "      Quondam M.P.," in strenuous defence
                                               A
of the Irish Church.    As one of the leaders of the Anti-Corn Law League,
the pioneer and fellow-labourer of Cobden and Bright, he will live in the
grateful remembrance of many whose cheap loaf      due to the Father of
                                                                  is
Free Trade, -'the literary soldier who wrote the 'Corn Law Catechism."-
   In person he was short, active, and well made, and in middle age might
be, as he described himself,            " stouter than would become     Light Dra
                                                                                a

larities of hours and seasons.            Of his acquirements and ability the fore
going sketch may give some idea        but only those who knew and loved
                                               ;
him in private life can tell the depth of his learning, of his goodness, be
nevolence, and kindness of heart.     After life so long, so varied, and at
                                                          a
times so stormy, his end came peacefully at   Blackheath, early on the 6th
of September, 1869, in the 87th year of his age. He had written letters on
various subjects, including his favourite Enharmonic Organ, up to the
middle of the day before, in full possession of his mental and bodily facul
ties, and he may be said to have died, as he lived, pen in hand — "Qualis
ab incepto."      He   was followed           by   his children and grandchildren to Ken-
sal Green, where he rests not far from an old friend                 aud fellow reformer,
Joseph Hume.

 I  have first to do with the continuous spectrum, deduced from Professor
Pickering's observations.

conditions.

        By Geokge Biddell Airy, Astronomer Royal.                 Received De
        cember 22, 1869.
                                   (Abstract.)
     The author, after referring to his paper in the Philosophical Transac
  tions for 1868 on the comparison of Magnetic Disturbances inferred from
  Galvanic Currents    recorded by the Self-registering Galvanometers     of the
 Royal Observatory of Greenwich with the Magnetic Disturbances             regis
  tered by the Magnetometers, on 1 7 days, states that he had now         under
 taken the examination of the whole of the Galvanic Currents recorded
 during the establishment of the Croydon and Dartford wires (from 1865
 April 1 to 1867 October 24). The days of observation were divided
 into three groups, — No. 1 containing days of considerable magnetic dis
  turbance, and therein including not only the 1 7 days above mentioned,
  but also 36 additional days, No. 2 containing days of moderate dis
  turbance, of which no further use was made, and No. 3 containing the
  days of tranquil magnetism.
      The comparisons of the additional 36 disturbed days were made in the
  same manner as those of the preceding 1 7 days, and the inferences were
  the same. The results were shown in the same manner, by comparison
   of curves, which were exhibited to the Society. The points most worthr
  of notice are, that the general agreement of the strong irregularities, Gal
   vanic and Magnetic, is very close, that the galvanic irregularities usuallv
   precede the magnetic, in time, and that the northerly magnetic force
   appears to be increased.   The author remarks that no records appeared
   open to doubt as regards instrumental error, except those of western de
   clination ; and to remove this he had compared the Greenwich Curies
   with the Kew Curves, and had found them absolutely identical.
      The author then proceeds with the discussion of the Galvanic Current-
   Curves on days of tranquil Magnetism, not by way of comparison with the
   magnetic curves, but for independent examination of the galvanic laws.
   The method was explained of measuring the ordinates and connecting the
   measures into expressions for magnetic action, at every hour, and group

ing the measures      at the same nominal    hour by months, and taking their
monthly means       for each hour.   As these exhibited sensible discordance,
they were smoothed by taking the means of adjacent numbers, taking the
means of the adjacent numbers of the new series, and so on, repeating the
operation six times. The author explains the theory of this process, and
the way in which it tends to degrade the periodical terms of higher orders.
He then explains an easy method of resolving the numbers so smoothed
into periodical terms recurring once in the day, twice in the day, thrice in
the day, &c., and applies the method to the numbers for every month.
     When   these quantities  (which from month to month are perfectly inde
pendent) are brought together in tables, they present such an agreement,
with gradual change accompanying the change of seasons, as leaves no
 doubt on their representation of a real law of the diurnal changes of the
 galvanic currents.      They also show the existence of a constant turn
 towards the north (which explains the apparent increase of force to the
north observed in the results for days of great disturbance), and a still
 larger force towards the west (which also is well marked on the days of
 great disturbance).      No light is obtained on the origin of these terms,
 but they appear to be probably pure galvanic accidents, depending on the
 nature of the earth-connexions.
     The author then exhibits in curves the diurnal inequalities of mag
 netism which the galvanic currents must produce.           The form generally
 consists of two parallel lobes, making with the magnetic meridian an angle
 of nearly G0° from the north towards the west. The greatest east-and-
 west difference of ordinates, in the month of April, is 0-00044 of Total
 Horizontal Magnetic Force      ; it corresponds, in the hours to which those
 ordinates relate, nearly with the Ordinary Diurnal Inequality.         But it is
 much smaller than the ordinary diurnal inequality, and the daily law of
  the galvano-magnetic inequality differs greatly from that of diurnal in
  equality.    For the greater part, therefore, of diurnal inequality the cause
 is yet to be found.

    In this paper the author communicates descriptions, with figures of the
fossil remains at his command, of Diprotodon australis, which have been
received from various localities in Australia, since the first announcement of
the genus, founded on a fragment of the lower jaw and tusk, described and
figured in the 'Appendix- to Sir Thos. Mitchell-s 'Three Expeditions
into the Interior of Eastern Australia,-    8vo, 1838.
    The fossils in question include the entire cranium and lower jaw with
most of the teeth, showing the dental formula of : — i. — , c. — , m. 5=^=28 ;
                                                         1—1   0—0     6—5
portions of jaws and teeth exemplifying characteristics of age and sex          ;
many bones of the trunk and extremities.
    After some introductory remarks, the author proceeds to the descrip
tion of the skull and teeth, which are Illustrated by many figures, those
of the teeth being of the natural size.           The result of the compari
sons detailed establishes the marsupial character      of Diprotodon,   and the
combination of characters of Macropus and Phascolomys with special modi
fications of its own.     These latter are more fully and strongly manifested
in the   bones of the trunk and limbs, subsequently described.        The pelvis
and femora present resemblances to those in Proboscidea, not hitherto
observed in any other remains of large extinct quadrupeds of Australia.
But in all the bones described essentially marsupial characteristics are
more or less determinable.        The paper concludes with a summary of the
 characters of Diprotodon, throwing light upon the conditions of its ex
 tinction, its analogies with the Megatherium, its affinities to existing
forms of Marsupialia, and the more generalized condition which it mani
fests of that mammalian type.

        the Oxides of Uranium."               By H. C. Sorby, F.R.S.            Received
        December       27, 1869.
    When     a scientific man has been led into an error             and afterwards dis
covers his mistake,        I think it a matter of duty that he should take an
early opportunity to correct it.           I therefore now write the following notice
of certain remarkable peculiarities in the spectra of some compounds of
the oxides of uranium with zirconia which led both myself and others* to
conclude that they were due to a new elementary substance.
    Though the       spectra   of the different salts of  those bases which show well-
marked absorption-bands often differ in detail, yet they usually resemble
each other so much that there is no difficulty in recognizing each particular
element. This is so constantly the case in the various compounds of erbium,
didymium, and cobalt, and in the ordinary salts of uranium, that for a
long time the more I studied this question, the more did it appear to be a
general rule, and there seemed to be no reason to suspect that a few special
compounds of uranium would give spectra with nbsorption-bands as unlike
as possible those of all others.            Such, however, turns out to be the fact,
when its oxides are combined with zirconia.
    As   an excellent illustration       of important    differences  in mere detail, but
general correspondence, I would refer to the spectra of didymium in different
states of combination-)-, and would especially refer to the most distinct of
the numerous absorption-bands which occurs in the yellow.                    The various
compounds agree in showing this band in the same general position ; but
by careful management, and by the use of sufficient dispersive power, it
may be resolved into a very variable number of narrow bands or black lines.
For example, in the case of the crystallized sulphate containing compara
tively little lanthanum, it can be resolved into seven narrow lines, two of
those near the centre being the darkest, whereas                when much lanthanum is
present, one      line on the side next the green is so much darker than the
rest that the others are comparatively absent.                    On fusing the mixed
oxides with borax, the same spectrum is seen as with oxide of didymium
alone, and I can resolve the above-named band into only two narrower bands ;
whereas when the saturated bead is made to deposit crystals by being kept
some time at a very dull red heat, this band can easily be resolved into eight
equal and very distinct black lines.           Although these and similar differences
in detail are of much interest, yet in no case are they so considerable as to
prevent our recognizing at once that the spectra are all due to didymium.
It is also important to notice that the amount requisite to give a most
splendid spectrum when the bead is crystalline will scarcely show any trace
of bands when it is in         a vitreous condition, dissolved in the borax.      This  is

  analogous to what occurs in the case of solid and powdered crystals of
  sulphate of didymium ; for the absorption-bands in the spectrum of the
 light transmitted by       a thin layer of the fine powder, strongly illuminated
 from the other side, are as distinct as in that transmitted by a niany times
 greater thickness of solid and transparent crystal. We may very conveniently
 take advantage of this fact in studying the spectra of such substances, when
 the amount of material at command is otherwise too small.                 This seems to
 be because the transmitted light does not simply pass through the crystals,
 but is in great measure reflected from them backwards and forwards, and
 thus, as it were, passes through a greater thickness.             It is also to a con
 siderable extent similar to      that reflected from   the powder when illuminated
 from above,   as  may be clearly proved by what occurs in the case of uranic
 salts.   These   when     in a state of moderately fine powder transmit light,
 giving a spectrum showing not only the absorption-bands in the blue, which
 alone are met with in that transmitted by a clear crystal, but also the bands
 in the green, which depend on fluorescence, characteristic of that reflected
 from the powder*.        These two kinds of bands can be easily distinguished
by means of a plate of deep blue cobalt glass, which has an entirely different
 action, according as it is placed below or above the object when the bands
 are due to fluorescence,     but has no such effect when they are due to ordinary
 absorption.    It  would perhaps be well to mention here that I have in this
 manner proved that the abnormal bands seen in the spectra of the com
pounds of zirconia with the oxides of uranium described in this paper are
 due to genuine absorption, and uot to fluorescence.
    The remarkable spectrum of some jargons has been already described by
me in the 'Chemical News -t, and in the Proceedings of the Royal SocietyJ.
 One of its most striking peculiarities is that when light passes in a direction
perpendicular to the principal axis of the crystal, and the spectrum is divided
by means of a double-image prism into two spectra, having the light polarized
in opposite planes, though some of the absorption-bands are of equal inten
sity in both images, yet others are comparatively absent, some in one and
some in the other ; whereas in the case of other dichroic crystals which
give spectra with absorption-bands, they are usually all more distinct
in one image than when the light is not polarized, and all fainter, or even
comparatively absent, in the other. No sooner had I observed this spectrum
(No. 5, given below), than I made various experiments in order to ascertain
whether uranium was present or not ; and the then known tests that could
be applied to the amount of material at my command seemed to show that
it  was absent.     This    was quite   in accord with the results of the various
analyses published by other chemists, none of whom mention the existence
of any trace of that substance.           Moreover the general character of the
spectrum was entirely unlike that of all the known compounds of uranic
oxide.    The various artificial salts all agree in giving a variable but small

 number of moderately broad absorption-bands in the blue end (Nos. 1, 2,
 and 3); and the same is also seen in the case of several natural minerals;
whereas the jargon gave a most unusually large number of narrow black
lines (fourteen quite distinct, besides others more faint, and a single broader
band which I cannot separate into lines), extending from the red end, so
that nearly all occur in that part of the spectrum which is entirely free
from bands    in all previously known compounds of uranic oxide.            This
same general   fact was also seen in the spectrum (No. 6) of the opaque blow
pipe-beads gently flamed, as described in my former paper. These differ
ences will be better understood by means of the following drawing, which
shows three of the most striking spectra of uranic salts, that of uranate of
soda, and the two which are rendered so abnormal by the presence of zirconia.

to be every reason to believe that spectra which thus differed 80 much from
those of any previously known substance were characteristic of this new
earth. Judging from the facts then known, it was more probable that spectra
of such    a new type were due to a new element, than that they were due
merely to a combination of two such elements as zirconium and uranium.
Some of these chemical and physical facts can now be explained by the
presence of uranium ; but besides this and several of the more common
earths and oxides,       I  have   detected      in some zircons erbium, didymium,
yttria, and another substance which exists in such small quantity that have        I
not yet been able to ascertain whether or no it is the suspected new earth.
These accidental constituents do not indeed occur in sufficient quantity to
be   of importance, except      as modifying the physical and optical properties,
the didymium giving its       usual    characteristic absorption-bands (zircons from
Sveneroe, Norway), and the manganese the same spectrum as that of
garnets (zircons from an unknown locality in Siberia*).                    This method,
however, fails to give evidence of a new earth ; for since the publication of
my former paper, I have proved that the very abnormal spectra, which
 seemed sufficient to establish its existence, are really due to compounds of
 zirconia with the oxides of uranium, which have such a powerful action on
 light,   that an almost inappreciable amount is sufficient to produce the
 spectra to great perfection — in fact so small an amount, that the total
 quantity which misled me was only a few thousandths of a grain ; and its
 presence     might easily have remained unsuspected, if I had not made a
 number of experiments, which at first did not seem to have much con
 nexion with the lubject.
    In studying the spectra of crystalline blowpipe-beads, it seemed desirable
 to examine those made with carbonate of soda, with or without a little
 borax.      This when melted dissolves certain oxides ; and though it crystal
 lizes on cooling, so as to be only partially translucent, yet with strong
 direct sunlight well-marked spectra may be seen.                    For example, in the
 oxidizing flame uranic oxide is easily dissolved by carbonate of soda alone ;
 and when quickly cooled, an orange-coloured bead is obtained, probably
 containing uranate of soda in a vitreous condition, which gives a single
 well-marked absorption-band            in the    green  (see spectrum    No. 4) with so
  small a quantity of the oxide      ;  that in   a bead  £  inch  in diameter  shows the
                                                        i
 spectrum to the best advantage, and even ti}l6u grain can be easily de
 tected.     We need not be surprised that this spectrum differs so much
 from the usual type of uranic salts (Nos. 1, 2, and 3), since in this case
 the oxide plays the part of an acid.              It may be only an accidental coin
 cidence, but this difference is analogous to the change which commonly
 occurs ou adding an alkali to neutral solutions of vegetable coloursf. When
 gently reheated it seems as if the uranate passed into a crystalline state,
 for the spectrum then shows four absorption-bands, and is more like the
         * For both of  these I am indebted    to my kind friend  Mr. David Forbes.

ordinary type ; but this change does not occur if a little borax has been
added. The addition of more and more borax causes the absorption-band
to become more and more faint, and to advance towards the blue end, until
we obtain a spectrum     with very faint bands but of the usual character.
    In examining the various products into which          I  separated jargons in
order to study the supposed new earth in a state of purity,           I obtained a
small quantity of a dark-coloured substance, apparently zirconia containing
some oxide which communicated a green tiut to a glassy, borax blowpipe-
bead, but yet not sufficiently distinct to show that it was due to uranous
oxide.   1 therefore thought that the carbonate-of-soda method might throw
light on the question ; and though the presence of zircouia prevented
solution by pure carbonate of soda, the addition of a little borax enabled
me to prove that uranic      oxide is really present in some jargons.        Such,
then, being the case, it seemed desirable to ascertain whether the oxides of
uranium would give rise to any special spectra when present along with
zirconia in crystalline blowpipe-beads.       To my astonishment I found that
the spectra were precisely the same as those obtained in the case of what
I had thought to be an approximately pure new earth*. When, however,
 I had ascertained the quantity of oxide requisite to give this result, I was
no longer surprised that I had not suspected its presence.           In the case of
transparent blowpipe-beads of borax with microcosmic salt, it is requisite to
have as much as about -fa grain of uranous oxide to show faintly the charac
teristic absorption-bands, whereas, when present along with zirconia in
 the crystalline beads, Bgo00 grain gives an equally well-marked spectrum ;
and -^fac grain shows it far better than a larger quantity, which makes the
beads   too opaque.     These very minute quantities were obtained by the
repeated division of a small known weight, either before or after fusion
with borax. This spectrum also differs very considerably from the spectra
 of the usual salts or blowpipe-beads of uranous oxide.             On comparing
 them side by side, the only common peculiarity is the fact of there being
 numerous absorption-bands distributed over a large part of the spectrum,
 but they do not correspond in either number or position.         On the contrary,
 they differ almost as much as possible, and the darker bands in the
 spectrum of this zirconia compound occur where the transmitted light is the
 brightest in other cases.
     The oxide of uranium is so easily reduced at a high temperature to the
 state of protoxide in a borax-bead, with excess of boric acid, and is so
 readily peroxidized at a dull-red heat, when crystallized along with borate
 of zirconia, that there    seemed good reason to refer the change in the
 spectra to temperature rather than to the state of oxidization, until after it
 was found that they were due to uranium.          By gently flaming the crystal
 line bead, the spectrum is entirely altered, and becomes like No. 6, which
 seems to be characteristic of a compound of borate of zirconia with uranic
 oxide.     This  gives a spectrum with five well-marked         absorption-bands,

all of which occur at the red end, where no trace of bands exists in the case
 of ordinary salts, as will be seen on comparing it with Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
 I have tried many experiments in order to ascertain whether any other
 element besides zirconia       will cause uranium to  give similar abnormal spectra,
but none show anything of the kind, at all             events   in similar conditions.
 A  few have    special    characters, as described below, but the majority exert
little or no influence ; and even when the blowpipe-beads are crystalline,
they show only the usual spectra of the oxides of uranium.                 Moreover no
such great change in the character of the spectra of any other elements
which give absorption-bands is to be seen when they are combined with
zirconia   ; and, as far as my present experience goes,        it seems as  if such very
 abnormal spectra were met with only in the case of these remarkable
compounds of zirconia with the oxides of uranium.
    Such, then, being the facts, it appears to me that we are now in a
position to explain why certain zircons give three different spectra, as
described in my former paper.               Some jargons (usually those of a green
 tint)  contain  a little   uranium    so combined  that the characteristic spectrum
is only faintly visible, whereas, after ignition, the intensity of the absorp
tion-bands is permanently increased to a variable extent, occasionally only
a little, but in some cases as much as twenty-five times.          This more powerful
action on light is accompanied by an increase in hardness and in specific
gravity (sometimes as much as from 4-20 to 4-60), as described in my
                          I
former paper ; and have since found that these changes are approximately
proportional     to the amount of uranic         oxide in the various specimens, as
 shown by comparing            the spectra of the blowpipe-beads.          This change
may partly depend          on   the  oxidization of  the  uranous    oxide,  since some
specimens slightly increase in weight when ignited ; but I think it cannot
be mainly due to that ; for sometimes there is no such increase, and uranous
oxide combined with zirconia gives rise, not to a spectrum without bands,
but to one with several of very marked character, as described below. On
 the whole, since this abnormal type of spectrum is so characteristic of
combination with zirconia, it appears to me more probable that the effect
of a high temperature is to cause the uranic oxide to combine more specially
with the zirconia, as though the greater part existed naturally as a silicate,
but after ignition as a zirconiate.           We may also apply the same explana
tion in the case of zircons more or less strongly coloured by other oxides,
which become almost colourless when heated, and thus this unexplained
peculiarity of zircons may depend on the fact of zirconia being able to play
the part of both a base and an acid, which, as compared with silica, has
an affinity for bases varying according to the temperature.
    The brown-red zircon from Ceylon, named at page 514 of my former
paper, kindly presented to me by Mr. E. L. Mitford, of Rusthall, gives a
spectrum precisely like that of the borax blowpipe-beads crystallized after
treatment in the deoxidizing flame, and therefore no doubt contains uranous
oxide.     This spectrum being given by only one part of the crystal, probably

   1870.]             of Zirconia and    the Oxides   of Uranium.               203
   depended    upon the presence of some substance which either reduced the
  uranic oxide or prevented the oxidization of the uranous.
      These facts thus clearly show that the various spectra which seemed to
  indicate the presence of a new element existing in three different physical
  conditions, are in reality only characteristic of the two oxides of uranium
  combined with zirconia, or not in combination.          Perhaps some may think
 that my having been thus led astray shows that little or no reliance can be
 placed on the method of investigation employed ; but           I contend that the
 mistake was due to its being such an unexpectedly delicate test for uranium;
 and, as explained above, the error was ultimately corrected by a further
 development of the same method.             As far as the interests of science are
 concerned, there is no need to regret the general result.            We have lost
 what appeared to be good evidence of a new earth, but have gained an
 almost entirely new system of blowpipe testing, which enables us to detect
 such a minute quantity of some substances as could not be recognized
 by the ordinary means.        I shall not now attempt to give anything like a full
 account of this subject, since it would be much better to let it form part of
 a paper on various improvements in blowpipe chemistry, but will merely
 mention a few facts which have a special bearing on the question before us.
     In  the first place,  I would say that zirconia and the oxides of uranium
 are most useful reagents in detecting the presence of certain substances
 with which they unite to form compounds having very special characters.
 The most striking of these are the compounds already described, which
 are distinguished by the spectra,      and not by any well-marked colour, — the
 compound of eerie oxide with uranic oxide, which is of a splendid deep
 blue colour, but shows no absorption-bands ; and that of yttria with uranic
 oxide, which is characterized by a deep orange-colour and extreme fusibility.
 Thorina     and oxide    of lanthanum form with uranous oxide compounds
 which give spectra with absorption-bands in special positions, but of the
 usual type, and not of such a marked character as to be useful in detecting
 minute quantities of those substances in mixtures.
     In order to see the spectra of the zirconium-uranium compounds, it is
 requisite that both elements should be combined in a crystalline condition.
 When both constituents are melted in borax and are held in solution, or
if    when    crystals are deposited any other substance replaces either the
 zirconia or the oxides of uranium, the characteristic spectra cannot be seen.
 The most simple application of this test for uranium is in the case of various
zircons. As much of the powdered mineral as will dissolve should be melted
with borax in a circular loop of platinum wire about £ inch in diameter, so as
to give a bead of moderate thickness.           A little boric acid should then be
added,     which not only tends to keep the uranium in the state of protoxide,
but also facilitates the crystallization of the borate of zirconia, which is far
less soluble when there is excess of boric acid.          The bead should then be
kept    at a bright red heat, just within the deoxidizing flame, until so much
 borax has been volatilized that small needle-shaped crystals begin to be

just requisiteto cause the borate to crystallize out, or else the uranium will
rapidly pass into the state of peroxide.   Such beads must be examined                                         by

be too  thick and opaque. If thus properly prepared, the presence of more
or less uranium will be shown by the greater or less intensity of the absorp

                          I
tions has enabled me to detect another distinct band in the extreme red,
not shown in fig.   of my former paper, and also an additional faint band

   In applying this test to detect minute quantities of uranium       other                             in
minerals,    itrequisite to bear in mind that zirconia may play the part
                  is                                                                                               of
both an acid and base, and that various oxides and acids so combine with
                          a
the zirconia or with the oxides of uranium as to prevent the formation                                             of
the compounds which give rise to the characteristic spectra.   The zir
conia appears to combine with some rather than with the uranous oxide,
and with others rather than with the uranic, so that,     one spectrum
                                                                                      if if
 cannot be obtained, the other may                       ;   and there are few,          any,   cases when

 1870.]               of Zirconia and    the Oxides     of Uranium.             205
 neither can be seen, especially if cnre be taken to use excess of zirconia.
 If, however, the amount of uranium be very small, and so much of other
 oxides be present as to make the bead very dark, or too opaque from
 deposited crystals, before it is sufficiently concentrated for the compounds
 with the oxides of uranium to crystallize out, it may be impossible to detect
 it.    In order   to apply the test  in the   case  of complex minerals,  a bead  of
 borax,     boric acid, and pure zirconia should be prepared, then a small
 quantity of the mineral added, and, after fusion and sufficient concentration,
 the bead made to crystallize in the manner already described.            If needle-
 shaped crystals be not deposited in         the bead when very hot, and if it do
 not suddenly turn opaque when reheated, the result may not be satisfactory.
 In this manner it is easy to detect uranium in ^Jj-rt grain of such minerals
 as Fergusonite, tyrite, and yttrotantalite, even when they contain no more
 than    1  or 2 per cent.    If in such cases the spectrum of the uranous com
 pound cannot be obtained, the bead should always be flamed and reexamined,
 to see if that of the uranic compound is thereby developed.
     In  a  similar manner we may make use of a little oxide of uranium to
 detect zirconia   ; but the test is far less delicate than the converse, because it
 is almost impossible      to obtain the compound in a crystalline state, unless
 there be an excess of zirconia.       Not more than j utts grain of uranic oxide
 should be employed, or the bead may be too opaque. There is no difficulty
 in thus detecting zirconia in zircons, or in katapleiit ; but the presence of so
 much of other bases in minerals like eudialyte prevents our obtaining a
 satisfactory result.      There certainly could not be a more characteristic test
 to confirm the results of other methods, or to identify such a small quantity
 of approximately pure zirconia as could not easily be distinguished in any
 other way.
     The only other compound of uranic oxide of very abnormal character
 which     I have so far discovered is that with cericic oxide. So much of both
 oxides should be fused with borax in the oxidizing flame as will yield a bead
 which is perfectly clear, and of pale yellow colour when rapidly cooled,
 but crystallizes when gently reheated.         If  the constituents be present in a
 certain proportion, it then turns from pale yellow to a deep blue, as though
 coloured by oxide of cobalt.        In mos cases the bead is rendered nearly
 opaque by the number of crystals ; but sometimes, though it turns deep
 blue, it remains transparent, owing to the compound being set free in a
 state similar to that of the red oxide of copper in a borax blowpipe-bead,
 with carbonate of soda and oxide of tin, treated in the reducing flame.
The spectrum of        these blue beads shows no absorption-bands, but merely
 a general absorption at the red end      ; and it is curious to find that the com
bination of two yellow substances         gives rise to a deep blue, in much the
same manner as when the yellow ferrocyanide of potassium is added to               a
yellow ferric salt. The production of this blue colour on the addition of          a
little uranic oxide might be employed with advantage to identify moderately
small quantities of cerium, even when mixed with a number of other

substances        ;    but unfortunately         the presence   of much         oxide   of   lanthanum,
which is so commonly associated with                     it,
                                            interferes, as though the eerie
oxide had    stronger affinity
                  a            for the oxide  of lanthanum than for uranic
oxide.
   The most characteristic peculiarity of the compound of yttria and uranic
oxide    that
         is       will not crystallize out from
                           it                     borax blowpipe-bead, and
                                                                is a
that the affinity of the uranic oxide for yttria stronger than for zirconia.
Perhaps erbia may prove to act in the same way, but      have not been able I
to examine that earth quite free from yttria.    On adding yttria to    bead                     a
with zirconia and little uranic oxide, and gently flaming
                                a                           in the oxidizing      it
flame, the uranic oxide combines with the yttria and rises to the surface as
an orange-coloured scum, which has         great tendency to collect on the
                                                        a
platinum   wire  and    sufficient
                           ;         if
                                   yttria be  added, the crystallized borate
of zirconia   left in the interior almost colourless, and so free from uranic
                      is
oxide that no absorption-bands can be seen in the spectrum.          We may
take advantage of this circumstance to detect yttria in small quantities                                    of
compound minerals like Gadolinite and Fergusonite        and    may here say;         I
that by combining such means with the observation of the spectra of the
transparent or crystalline beads, and of the form of the crystals when
slowly deposited, with or without the addition of suitable reagents*, we may
often detect twice as many constituents in minerals as could be accomplished
by the ordinary methods of blowpipe chemistry — an advantage which am                                1
sure will be appreciated by those engaged in the study of rocks, when                                  it
often so important to obtain satisfactory results with small quantities                                     of is
material.     have also found these methods of great practical use

mining  small  residues in the qualitative analysis of minerals, and have thus
unexpectedly discovered small quantities of comparatively rare elemenU.
I    have tried the effect of many other substances along with zirconia and
the oxides of uranium, and find that most of them have no sensible influence,
unless they are present in considerable relative quantity.   The most stri
king effect  that of oxide of tin, which causes the two absorption-bands
                  is                                                                                        in

the manner in which certain substances, having no special action on light,
influence by their presence the properties of another.     The oxides                                       of
uranium are unusually sensitive to such actions, and thus not only lend
themselves to us as blowpipe-reagents, but also seem more than any others
to afford the means of explaining the relation between the physical condi

II. " On    the  Mathematical Theory of Stream-lines, especially those
       with four Foci and upwards."   By William John Macquorn
       Rankine, C.E., LL.D., F.Il.SS. Lond. and Edinb., &c. Re

                                          (Abstract.)
   A Stream-line is the line that is traced by a particle in a current of
fluid.   In a steady current each individual stream-line preserves its figure
and position unchanged, and marks the track of a filament or continuous
series of particles that follow each other.  The motions in different parts
of a steady current may be represented to the eye and to the mind by
means of a group of stream-lines.
   Stream-lines are important in connexion with naval architecture ; for
the curves which the particles of water describe relatively to a ship, in
moving past her, are stream-lines ; and if the figure of a ship is such that
the particles of water glide smoothly over her skin, that figure is a stream
line surface, being a surface which contains an indefinite number of
stream-lines.
   The author in a previous paper proposed to call such stream-lines
Neoids ; that     is,
                  ship-shape lines.
   The author refers to previous investigations relating to stream-lines, and
especially to those of Mr. Stokes, in the Cambridge Transactions for 1842
and 1850, on the " Motion of       Liquid past Solid," and of Dr. Hoppe,

Mathematics for   1856,  and to his own previous papers on "Plane Water-
lines in Two Dimensions," in the Philosophical Transactions for 1864, and
on " Stream-lines," in the Philosophical Magazine for that year.          He
states that all the neoid or ship-shape stream-lines whose properties have
hitherto been investigated in detail are either unifocal or bifocal that          ;    is
to say, they may be conceived to be generated                   by
                                                      the combination of                a
uniform progressive motion, with another motion consisting in   divergence    a
of the particles from   certain point or focus, followed by

continuous closed curves when unifocal are circular, and when bifocal are
blunt-ended ovals, in which the length may exceed the breadth in any given
proportions.    To obtain a unifocnl or bifocal neoi-d resembling a longitu
dinal line of a ship with sharp ends, it is necessary to take a part only of a
stream-line, and then there is discontinuity of form and of motion at each
of the two ends of that line.
  The author states that the occasion of the investigation described in the
present paper was the communication to him by Mr. William Froude of
some results       of experiments of his on the    of model boats, of lengths
                                                   resistance
ranging from three to twelve feet. A summary of those results is printed
at the end of a Report to the British Association on the
                                                         " State of Existing
Knowledge of the Qualities of Ships."     In each case two models were com
pared together of equal displacement and equal length ; the water-line of
one was a wave-line with fine sharp ends, that of the other had blunt
rounded ends, each joined to the midship body by a slightly hollow neck —
a form suggested, Mr. Froude states, by the appearance of water-birds when
swimming.    At low velocities, the resistance of the sharp-ended boat was
the smaller    ;    at a certain velocity, bearing a definite relation to the length
of the model, the        resistances became equal, and at higher velocities the
round-ended         model had a rapidly increasing advantage over the sharp-
ended model.
   Hence it appeared to the author to be desirable to investigate the mathe
matical properties of stream-lines resembling the water-lines of Mr. Froude-s
bird-like models ; and he has found that endless varieties of such forms,
all closed curves free from discontinuity of form and of motion, may be ob
tained by using four foci instead of two. They may be called from this
property quadrifocal stream-lines, or, from the idea that suggested such
shapes to   Mr. Froude, egenoids; that            is,   swan-like lines*.
  Those lines are not to be confounded with the lines of yacht having at    a
a distance the appearance of      swan, which was designed and built some
                                      a
years ago by Mr. Peacock, for the figure of that vessel    simply oval.is
   The paper contains four chapters. The first three are mainly cinemati-
cal and geometrical, and relate to the forms of stream-line surfaces in two
and in three dimensions, especially those with more than one pair of foci
and surfaces of revolution, to the methods of constructing graphically and
without calculation, by means of processes first applied to lines of magnetic
force by   Mr. Clerk Maxwell, the         traces        of such   surfaces,     which methods
are exemplified   by diagrams drawn to scale, and to the motions of the
particles of  liquid past those surfaces. The fourth chapter       dynamical       is          :
it treats of the momentum and of the energy of the disturbance in the
liquid, caused by the progressive motion of        solid that
                                                           a   bounded by     is               a

by the total energy of the disturbance in the liquid to that of the disturb
ing body when that body displaces       mass of liquid equal to its own mass,

retardation of ships as affected by the disturbance in the water, and espe
cially of the use of experiments on the retardation of ships in finding their
resistance ; and of the disturbances of pressure    which accompany the
disturbances of motion in the liquid. Up to this point the dynamical
principles arrived at in the fourth chapter are certain and exact, like the
geometrical and cinematic principles in the three preceding chapters. The
results obtained in the remainder of the fourth chapter are in some respects
approximate and conjectural, and are to a great extent designed to suggest
plans for future experiments, and rules for their reduction.   These results
relate to the disturbances of level which accompany the disturbances of
motion when the liquid has a free upper surface, to the waves which
originate in those disturbances of level, and the action of those waves in
dispersing energy and so causing resistance to the motion of the vessel,
to friction, or skin-resistance, and the "wake" or following current which
that kind of resistance causes the disturbing solid body to drag behind                                it,

                                               overcoming different kinds
of resistance.
     The     resistance    caused by viscosity    is   not treated of, because its laws have
been completely investigated by               Mr. Stokes,     and because for bodies of the
size  of ships, and moving at their ordinary velocities, that kind of resistance
is inconsiderable compared with skin-resistance and wave-resistance.         The
resistance caused by discontinuity of figure     stated to be analogous in its
                                                               is

        Received January 6, 1870.
                                    (Abstract.)
     From a comparison of the different accounts of " Hemiopsia," " Half-
 vision," or " Half-blindness," given by Dr. Wollaston (Phil. Trans. 1824,
 p. 222), M. Arago (Annalcs de Chimie et de Physique, torn, xxvii. p. 102),
 Sir David Brewster (Phil. Mag. 1865, vol. i. p. 503, and Transactions of
 Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xxiv. part 1), the Astronomer Royal
 (Phil. Mng. July 1865, vol. ii. p. 19), Professor Dufour (in a letter to the
 Astronomer Royal), Sir John Herschel (Familinr Lectures on Scientific
  Subjects, p. 406, Lecture IX., and private letters), Sir CharlesWheatstone
  (in a private letter), Mr. Tyrrell (On the Diseases of the Eye, 1 840, vol. ii.
 p. 231), and the author of this paper, it is plain that there are different
 forms of transient Hemiopsia, irrespective of the wide primary distinction

1870.]                     form of Transient Hemiopsia.                          213
between the transient and permanent forms, which have            all been included
under the same name Hemiopia or Hemiopsia.
    It seems that Wollnston, Arago, Brewster, and Tyrrell are describing
one form of the transient affection, while Sir John Herschel, Sir Charles
Wheatstone, the Astronomer Royal, Professor Dufour, and the author agree
in describing another.
    In the experience of the former group, the limits of the blind region, as
projected on the field of view, are ill-defined ; there is no variety of colour,
and the progress of the disease presents no remarkable features.
    In the latter group, the blind region is at first very small, and gradu
ally spreads outwards, to left or right, with a zigzag margin of bright and
dark lines, tinged in most cases with various colours, — clear vision gradually
returning in the centre and following the outward advance of the curved
cloud   ;  usually the blindness occupies only one lateral half of the field of
view ; but in one very remarkable instance recorded by Sir John Herschel,
the course of the cloud was from the extreme left to the extreme right,
sweeping over the whole of the visual area.
    Possibly the gap between these two forms may be filled by connecting
links, as further evidence arises, and it may be found that they differ only
in degree of prominence of different features. The remarkable account
given by Sir Charles Wheatstone (who has kindly given permission for its
 publication), where the zigzag luminous lines are strongly marked, but
without colour, perhaps offers the first link in the connecting chain.
    The author-s     experience  dates from 1854.      Since then he has repeatedly
 suffered from these attacks.       The circumstances and features of the com
 plaint   have  varied somewhat    in different attacks, but the type has remained
 unaltered from that time to this.
    The blindness     comes on usually while the eyes are engaged in toilsome
reading :    some word or letter on the page near the sight-point (generally
 below to the left) is found to be obliterated ; this germ of blindness slowly
 spreads, with zigzag margin, defined by alternate bright and dark lines,
 with gleams of colour, the margin rapidly trembling and slowly rolling at
 the same time.
     These three orders of motion, ( 1 ) gradual outward growth of the whole,
 (2) slow rolling of parts, (3) rapid tremor of the margin, are especially
 characteristic of this affection.
     The region of blindness takes a horseshoe shape ; the upper arm points
 to the centre of sight, while the lower spreads downwards and outwards
 away from the centre.        The zigzag pattern is minute near the centre, and
 grows larger the further it recedes.           The gleams of colour, most con
 spicuous    at the  margin,  are red and   blue, yellow, green, orange, in order of
 frequency.       As the blindness spreads outwards, clear vision returns gradu
 ally in the concavity of the horseshoe.        The sight of both eyes is affected at
 once, exactly in the same manner and in the same degree ; though naturally
 that eye seems most affected which corresponds to the obliterated side            of

 the field of view, because the nasal half of the field of view of either eye is
 more limited, and vision there is less distinct than on the temporal side.
    Looking    at any surface of uniform colour, the cloud partakes of the
 general  hue  of the field on which it lies, and shows little that is charac
 teristic except its bright margin, tremor, and boiling.
    Against bright light a faint shadowy curved cloud is seen, with bright
 margin, tremor and boiling, and slight colour.
    Against dark shade the cloud is seen to show faint light.
    When part of the cloud is seen against dark shade and part against
 bright light, the boundary between the light and shade is wholly obliterated.
    Viewed in the dark, the cloud presents inherent luminosity, especially at
 the margin.      Its various colours are seen as well in dark as in light.
    The cloud spreads outwards in horseshoe shape till it reaches the out
 skirts of the field of view, and fades away after great boiling and turbu
lence.    The lower arm      is the first to fade, then the middle, and finally the
upper arm, which remains pointing to the centre             of the field to the very
last.
    The climax is reached in about twenty-five minutes from the first be
ginning.     The whole duration of the attack is just half an hour.
    Often, midway in the attack, a fresh germ of blindness arises near the
birthplace of the first, but always proves abortive unless it takes root on
 the opposite side, when a second attack may develope itself immediately
 after the first.
    This half-bindness      is followed    by oppressive headache, lasting many
hours.
    From the    resemblance     of the angular margin of the cloud      to a fortified
 wall  " with  salient and reentering angles, bastions, and ravelins
                                                                           "
                                                                             (to use
 Sir John Herschel-s words), the author ventures to suggest the name
 Teichopsia for this striking form of transient half-blindness.
    Among the circumstances that have seemed to favour an attack may be
mentioned sudden change of air and living, over-exercise, and insufficient
sleep.    The attack    has sometimes been nocturnal.
    The most    usual  position of the germ of blindness is 3° or 4° below, and
3° or 4° to the left of the centre of vision.
    In one or two cases, after reaching a certain stage, the cloud has parted
in the middle, and died away without ripening.
    The cloud, whether developed in the right or the left half of the field,
has never (the author believes) transgressed the vertical median line.
    Lately, one or two attacks have been followed by a slight disturbance of
hearing.
    Of three cases coming under the author-s immediate observation, in
one these attacks have been very frequent, from an early age to middle
life. The bastioned outline is always present, with more or less colour.
Formerly the attendant headache used to be very severe, accompanied with
prolonged vomiting. Latterly the blindness has been more oppressive than

  1870.]                   form of Transient Hemiopsia.                           215
 the headache, and its advent greatly dreaded.        The speech is often affected,
 and sometimes the memory ; and on one occasion the mouth was noticed to
 be drawn to one side.        The cause has seemed to be mental anxiety.
    In   the second case, which is adduced for the sake of contrast, the phe
 nomena are much less definite. There is no serrated margin, no colour,
 no curve, nothing of which a picture can be made. The obscurity grows
 from a small but ill-defined germ, and gathers like a cloudy film or gauze
 over the field, oppressive to the eyes, and accompanied by headache and
 nausea, and passes away after a doubtful period, leaving the impression
 that it is caused by disorder of the stomach.
    In the third    case, the blindness is sometimes brought       on by looking at
 a striped wall-paper or a striped dress.       The appearance before the eyes
 is described as zigzag, wavy, quivering, without colour.           The first attack,
 in adult age, was followed by partial paralysis of one side, and later
 attacks have almost always had a sequel of defective speech, and tingling
 at the tip of the tongue, at the tip of the nose, and in the fingers and
 thumb.
    At    any rate it is certain that there does exist a distinct form of transient
hemiopsia, presenting the following main characteristics : —
    1 . Dependence on mental anxiety, bodily exhaustion, overwork to the
eyes, gastric derangement (?), want of exercise.
    2. Origin from a small germ near the centre of vision.
    3. Orderly centrifugal growth from the original germ.
    4. Blindness to boundaries, but not to general impressions of light and
colour.
    5. Proper luminosity in the dark .
    6. Bright-bastioned margin, with gleams of various colours.
    7. Tremor and " boiling."
    8. Gradual occupation of one lateral half of the field of view.
    9. Gradual recovery of clear vision in rear of the outward-growing
cloud.
    10. Disappearance of the phenomenon after about half an hour.
    1 1 . Sequelae : headache and nausea, and sometimes         affection of speech
and hearing, and even symptoms of hemiplegia.
    As   to the actual seat  of the visual derangement, the exact agreement of
the two eyes in        the  nature, extent, and degree of their affection proves
(assuming the semidecussation of the optic nerves at the chiasma) that
the seat of the affection must lie at some point behind the chiasma of
these nerves. All the causes that are found to lead to transient half-
blindness point to the brain as the seat of disturbance.         Still clearer is the
evidence given by the loss of speech and of memory, the derangement of
hearing, and the partial paralysis that sometimes follow an attack of
teichopsia. Such cases as Sir John Herschel's, where the cloud passed over
the whole field from left to right, can only be explained by supposing the
disturbance to lie in some region of the brain where the opposite halves are

in contact.        The mischief may possibly be Eeated in the corpora quadri-
geminaor geniculata, or even in the cerebellum itself.
     As to the nature of the mischief in the brain, it is difficult to do more
than hazard guesses.          Is it a temporary suspension of function among the
nerve-cells of the visual sensorium, due to vascular congestion, and relieved
by the relief of that congestion ? Does the headache tell of the further
propagation of the nervous disturbance into parts of the brain where
disturbance is ache, as in the visval tract disturbance is abnormal sensation
of light ? And the detriment to speech and hearing, — does it mean exten
sion of the same disturbance still further into the regions of brain-sub
stance appropriate to those functions ?          Or is the attack in any way analo
gous     to a fit of  epilepsy  ?
     The phenomena are so definite and so localized, and their course is so
regular, that we can hardly avoid the conviction that their cause is equally-
definite and equally localized ; and it is difficult to admit so vague an
agent as nervous sympathy with gastric derangement, except as acting
through the medium of some secondary local manifestation in the brain.
 II.    "Account of the Great Melbourne Telescope                 from April 18G8
         to its commencement          of operations  in Australia in 1869."      By
         Albert Le Sueur.              Received   January 8, 1870.      Communi
         cated by the President.
     A   description of the great Melbourne reflector, and its history, up to the
 time of inspection by the Committee, have been communicated to the
 Royal Society      ;  the following additional account of the doings connected
 therewith      since   the instrument was consigned to my care may be of in
 terest to the Society.
     Mr. Grubb commenced taking down the telescope at the end of April
  1868 ; this was accomplished in no great length of time, and without any
  difficulty.     The specula (by the advice of Mr. Lassell, who had found
 this method answer perfectly) were coated over with shellac varnish to pre
  vent oxidation on the voyage out ; they were then protected in their cells
  and on their lever supports by strong double wood casings, and the other
  parts of the telescope and machinery cased or otherwise protected.            The
 only casualty      which   there seemed to be any reason to fear could give rise
 to any serious consequences was a tilting over of the speculum cases ;
 their great weight was, perhaps, a sufficient guarantee from such an event :
  it was nevertheless thought prudent that the telescope, and machinery gene
  rally, should not be left entirely to the tender mercies of the shipping
                             I
  and crane labourers ; was therefore present at the shipping in Dublin on
  board a steam-tug hired for the purpose, and at the transshipment in Liver
  pool, on board the 'Empress of the Seas.'
      Both these operations were          performed satisfactorily, and without any
  serious casualty.

  1870.]                   Great Melbourne       Telescope.                   217
    The ' Empress of     the Sens- sailed    from Liverpool on the 17th or 18th
 of July ; I followed by the August Overland Mail.
    On my arrival in Melbourne I found that, beyond the selection of a site
in the Observatory grounds, nothing had yet been done towards the erection
 of piers or building ; this was principally owing to the fact that Mr. Ellery
 nnd the Board of Visitors had not considered the information which they
 possessed sufficiently definite to warrant their placing the matter in the
 hands of the Works Department ; it had therefore been thought advisable
 to await my arrival.
    Some necessary modifications having been made in the drawings, the
 construction of the piers was soon proceeded with, and satisfactorily ter
minated at the beginning of this year.
    In the  mean time the ' Empress       of the Seas,- with her precious cargo,
 had arrived, after a very long voyage, which for some time was the cause
of much uneasiness ; parts of the instrument were unpacked and tempo
 rarily housed   : the whole appeared      in fair order ; there was certainly no
 material damage done to anything.
    Arrangements being in progress for the erection of a suitable building, it
 was thought advisable to delay mounting the telescope until part of the
 building was constructed     ; little therefore was done for some time beyond
 setting up, as accurately as possible, the plummer-blocks which contain
 the polar axis bearings.
    The building was commenced early in the year, and when it was
 thought that sufficient progress had been made, the crane which had been
 used in the erection of the piers was removed to a more convenient posi
 tion, and the various heavy parts of the instrument lifted on to the floor of
 the telescope-room, over the walls or through a gap left for that purpose,
 and, for convenience in after operations, in the north wall and north end of
 the west wall.
    The mounting     was then proceeded with, and satisfactorily accomplished
in little more than      a week,    ns regards the main parts, without      much
difficulty.
    Attempts were made on one or two occasions to use the instrument for
adjustment and observation, but it was found that the dust (a dreadful
enemy in the summer) and the grit caused by the building accumulated
to such an extent as to lead to fear of considerable damage to the bear
ings and more delicate parts of the machinery ; it was therefore deemed
prudent to cover up the telescope as well as possible with tarpaulins, and
leave it in that state for some time.
    The building is rectangular, 80     feet  long meridionally by 25 wide, with
walls 1 1 feet high.    Of the meridional length the telescope-room occupies
the north 40 feet j the next 1 2 feet are appropriated to the polishing-ma-
 chine, crane, and engine; the remaining 28 feet are divided into two rooms,
 one  of which  is at present used as an office, the other, 25 by 14, is intended
                                                                    r2

218                          Mr. A. Le Sueur       on the                 [Feb. 17,
for  a laboratory.      The moveable roof is 40 feet long, and runs on rails
laid the whole length of the walls ; the telescope-room may therefore be
completely covered in, and as completely uncovered when required, the
roof in the latter    case resting on the south building,    which on that   account
has a very low permanent roof.
    The roof is constructed of six triangular wrought-iron principals,         cross-
braced, which abut at each side on         a broad horizontal plate formed of two
parallel lengths of stout angle-iron, connected at various points by iron
bands ; for additional strength, a broad vertical plate is bolted to the
outer angle-iron piece.       There are four pairs of wheels, 26 inches in dia
meter, flanched on the inside       ; these lie along the middle  of  the horizontal
plate, the journals being bolted to the          angle-iron pieces which form      the
plate.
    The roof is covered with galvanized corrugated iron ; it is therefore on
 the whole a somewhat heavy affair.             The mechanical arrangements for
moving are, however, simple and effective ; a stout iron shaft runs across
the building, and gears by wheel and pinion on the axles of the two south
end wheels ; to this shaft is fixed a spoked hand-wheel, by means of
which     the operator readily sets the roof in motion,           and   standing    on
a small platform connected therewith, is himself carried along at the            same
time.
    The design of the roof       is clue to   Mr. Merrett, of the Works       depart
ment.      On the whole, there is much to be said in favour of this rectan
gular    form   of roof : the temperature even in this climate frequently de
 scends too low to be pleasant ; b'ut'the occasional bodily inconvenience pro
 duced thereby is more than counterbalanced by perfect freedom to the
 observer, and the gratification of knowing that the instrument is in the best
possible conditions for satisfactory performance.           Only one really serious
 annoyance have I found connected with complete exposure ; I allude to
 occasional heavy dew rendering it almost impracticable to use the sketch
ing and other papers, the speculum meanwhile remaining free from de
 posit if precaution is taken not to work at too great an altitude.
    The   telescope, when housed, lies meridionally on the east side of the
 pier,  and   nearly in a horizontal direction, provision having been made to
prevent the tube being lowered beyond a certain small inclination.
    The piers are in keeping with the massiveness of the instrument ; they
 are constructed of large, not to say huge blocks of basalt axed            to a  fine
surface, altogether a substantial and beautiful piece of work.
    The height of the walls with reference to the piers is such             that very
little of the sky range is curtailed. The^iorth wall cuts off objects        having*
lesser altitude than about 10°. When resting on the east or west            walls  the
telescope is nearly horizontal ; in both these directions trees interfere,
especially on the west side, where the ground rises. This curtailment
will probably be a matter of very small importance, as with a four-feet

 1870.]                      Great Melbourne    Telescope.                    219
 aperture observations at low altitudes are almost impracticable, and would
probably never have to be resorted to except in the case of comets.           The
roof itself cuts off some of the range near the subpolar meridian j this,
again, is not likely to be of much consequence.
   The steam-engine, polishing-machine, and crane have been mounted in
the room devoted       to them   ; this room adjoins and is on the same floor
(raised 4 feet from the ground, and 3 to 6 feet from the floor of the other
rooms) as the telescope-room.          To the east end of this machine-room,
and communicating          therewith, a small Slean-to boiler-house has been
added ; in the west wall is a window which, when open, will leave sufficient
clear space to admit of viewing       a distant nearly horizontal  object for the
purpose of testing the mirrors.
   The large speculum (A) was originally attached to the tube in its var
nished condition ; on the first favourable occasion it was taken down and
unvarnished — a process which proved more troublesome than had been
anticipated. The lac was very refractory, and the difficulty of removal ex
aggerated by the extreme heat then prevalent ; after a process of solution
in alcohol, mopping up, and washing with water frequently repeated, although
there seemed no lac which would still dissolve, a large number of markings
caused originally by the varnish brush were apparent, and the whole
surface had an unpleasant mealy appearance.
   It was thought, however, that the light lost would not prove serious,
and in any case it did not seem that any further operation except polishing
would improve matters ; the speculum was therefore remouuted and tried ;
and although it was of course impossible to say what would have been the
effect of a more perfect polish, the views given of the brighter     nebulae were
grand in the extreme, and left nothing to be desired.
   By  degrees,   however, and without      much exposure, the surface became
more and more tarnished, with evident effect on the performance.
   In the meantime the second mirror (B) had been unvarnished ; in this case
 naphtha was used as the solvent, the solution mopped up, and the surface
washed with soap and water. After a frequent repetition of this process, the
surface seemed clear of impurities, and though not so bright as        I had fre
quently seen   it in Mr. Grubb-s workshop, there      were no signs of mealiness,
the only unpleasant casualty being a considerable pitting of two patches
some two inches square, produced by droppings from the muriate used in
soldering the tin cover. These pittings are deep and unsightly ; but the
extent of surface    corroded is comparatively so small that the effect must
be inconsiderable.
   The specula    were exchanged about two months ago, and        A   put on the
machine ; but nothing has yet been done towards repolishing, as the ne
cessary arrangements have not been got together for performing that delicate
operation with due convenience.
   Of work done,     I  cannot yet speak with any satisfaction since it became
at all practicable to use the telescope ; the history which I have to relate is

reluctantly given up, will, however, be again soon resumed.

any material degree the configurations of the nebula or the smaller stars
sketched in by eye.]

effort,    I have been unable to catch them     ;  the borders, however, stretching
to the stars, as in the figure, are occasionally pretty well seen.         On one or
two occasions I have suspected the existence of a link between the nebu
losity about the star No. 10 and the lower portion of the ISi this, however,
requires verification.
    At the f. end the upper and smaller semicircle is plainly marked, the
lower and larger very faint, and consequently its exact figure uncertain ;
 there is certainly some very faint nebulosity leading through the groups of
 stars north of the three bright f. end stars, but it has not been added to
 the sketch on account of its uncertain figure and extreme faintness.

 solvable     ; the greater brightness of these knots is not particularly shown
in Sir John Herschel-s sketch (Plate I.), but is mentioned in the observa
tions   ;   the general ground is only slightly nebulous.
    Of work out of the regular course, amongst other things, Neptune has
been observed on some five or six occasions for figure and a second satellite,
 with only negative results.
    In the absence of a photographic apparatus to be used at the uninter
 rupted focus of large mirror, attempts have been made to utilize the 2nd
 or Cassegrain image ; an average exposure of near ten minutes on an eight-
 day moon produced pictures which (by no meatfs good) were of sufficient
 promise to make it worth while to resume the attempt under more
 favourable conditions.
    The time of exposure is somewhat surprising, and would seem to accuse
 a  great loss of chemical rays by a second perpendicular reflexion ; but
 perhaps the more legitimate conclusion would be that the inactivity was
mainly due to absorption at the surface of the large mirror, which was
 then very yellow.
    The     spectroscope   arrived some time ago, but has not been much used ;
it is thought that for star work of any value some modification will be
 required, principally the exchange of the present collimator for one of
 longer focal length.        A greater dispersion, moreover, seems desirable ; for
 nebular work,      however,   for which it was mainly designed, the spectroscope
 in its present form, which is handy and compact, will be of much service.
    For spectroscopic work on objects having a sensible diameter, the great
 telescope itself labours under some disadvantages       ; the enormous focal length
 and consequent        magnification of the  image    is a serious  inconvenience in
 the case of faint objects, and may be only partially remedied by a suitable
 condenser. This magnifying of the image may, however, in some cases be
 advantageous : I allude to the possibility thereby afforded of viewing small
 definite portions of moderately bright objects ; unfortunately           the objects
 with which we have to deal are seldom of such a character.

 sence of others, or of a continuous spectrum, I am unable to speak with
certainty.
     With    respect to future operations,            it   is intended that at first the routine
work shall consist of a detailed delineation of the objects figured by Sir
John Herschcl, or any others which may prove interesting : this will
take some time ; for even without the impediment of cloudy weather, the
delineation, with       any degree of satisfactory correctness, of a moderately
large nebula        requires a considerable amount of work and careful and
frequent scrutiny.   It is hoped, however, that this work will by practice
be found less painfully difficult than it is at present.
     The    spectroscope     will      be used as much           as possible, the moon photo
graphed, and attempts made to photograph                            the nebulae, when a photo

 operation,   as they  were much interlaced.
                                   Umea barbata.
    In order to extract   the usnic acid from this lichen,     it  was macerated    for
 about   thirty minutes with   a  dilute solution of sodic carbonate, squeezed,
 again treated once or twice     in  a similar manner, and the turbid solution
 precipitated by a slight excess of hydrochloric acid.         The crude dark-green
acid thus obtained was mixed with       milk of lime and a considerable quantity
of warm water (40° C), filtered, and the clear lemon-coloured solution of
usnate of calcium acidulated with hydrochloric acid.             The acid was thus
precipitated in pale yellow flocks, which were collected.
   The reason that I adopted this modification of the process I formerly
proposed* is, that although usnic acid readily dissolves in milk of lime
when    it has been extracted, yet in order to exhaust this and other compact
lichens, it requires to be treated a great many times if lime be employed,
whilst two or three arc sufficient with carbonate of sodium.
   The partially purified usnic acid obtained in the manner above described
was easily rendered quite pure by taking advantage of the peculiar pro
perty which this acid possesses of forming an insoluble calcium salt when
boiled with lime.       The crude yellow acid was placed in a flask with a
quantity    of water and  an excess of slaked lime, and the mixture boiled for
twenty minutes or half an hour.          The insoluble calcium usnate was col
lected, well washed with hot water, and the lime then removed by boiling
it with a slight excess of hydrochloric acid. The tolerably pure usnic
acid was then collected, and well washed with boiling water.                    It was
advisable to continue the digestion with hydrochloric         acid for half an hour,
as  it rendered the   acid more compact and easy to collect.         By this alternate
treatment    with lime and acid, a large quantity of some dark-coloured im
purity was removed.         This forms the best process for recovering usnic
acid in a state of tolerable purity from residues.
   It  was  found, however, to be better, when considerable quantities of usnic
acid were    to be prepared, to boil the pale yellow usnic acid paste, as ob-
taiued by precipitation from the lime solution, with a small quantity of
water, to which strong caustic soda solution was gradually added, sufficient
to dissolve nearly the whole of the usnic acid.       It was then set aside to
crystallize, and when cold the very dark coloured supernatant mother
liquor decanted, and the crystals of sodic usnate washed once or twice by
decantation, with a small quantity of cold water.          It was then redissolved
and recrystallized once or twice     in the same manner.
   The nearly pure sodic    usnate was now dissolved in a considerable quantity
of hot spirit, filtered, and the boiling solution strongly acidulated with
acetic acid.      The usnic acid then separated in fine needles, which when
 cold were collected, well washed with cold spirit (in which they are almost

    When pure usnic acid was moistened with spirit, and then rubbed up in
a mortar    with milk of lime, it combined and formed a deep yellow paste,
which, on the addition of more water and nitration, yielded a lemon-coloured
solution, containing calcium usnate, and hydrate.                  When this solution
was heated    it became  turbid,   and   after boiling    some  time,  the whole of the
usnic acid was deposited as an insoluble calcium compound, in the form of
small deep yellow rhomboidal crystals.              Although I made several analyses
of this compound, prepared at different times, I was unable to obtain it of
a   constant composition, probably owing to its being mixed with variable
quantities of calcium carbonate and hydrate.
    The formation of this insoluble calcium salt is very characteristic of usnic
acid, and is an excellent test of its presence.             As with the sodium salt,
carbonic anhydride entirely decomposes the calcium compound.                     Usnic
acid appears, therefore, to be a very feeble acid.
     An attempt was made to prepare ethylic usnate by treating usnate of
silver with ethylic iodide, but without success.                When usnic acid was
treated with bromine it was completely decomposed, and converted into
an orange-coloured uncrystallizable          resin.
                        Evernia prunastri — Evernic Acid.
     The  evernic and usnic acids that this lichen contains were extracted by
 the lime process, which      consists in macerating the lichen two or three
 times successively with milk of lime for about half an hour each time.
 The solution of the mixed acids was then filtered, precipitated by a slight
 excess of hydrochloric acid, and the precipitate collected and dried.               In
 order to extract the evernic acid from the mixture, it was agitated for
 about five minutes with four parts boiling alcohol and filtered.            The acids
 remaining undissolved were treated two or three times with the same
 quantity of boiling alcohol, and the dissolved evernic acid precipitated by
 the addition of an equal bulk of water.              By this means the evernic acid,
 being readily   soluble in  boiling   alcohol,   was   in a great measure separated
  from the usnic acid, which dissolves with difficulty in that menstruum
  unless digested with it for a considerable time. The crude evernic acid
  thus obtained amounted to about one-third of the mixed acids, and was
  purified by repeated crystallization from strong spirit, taking care not to
  digest it for any length of time.           The process is much facilitated by
  completely removing     the  mother     liquors by Bunseu-s vacuum filter.
     Pure evernic acid, as has been already described by myself* and Hessef,
  consists of aggregations of minute needles, melting at 164° C. It is a
  feeble acid, and does not decompose solutions of bicarbonate of sodium in
  the cold  ; as, however, the adhering colouring-matter           is somewhat soluble
  in that menstruum, it may       be employed to free        the crude acid to a great

posed by a long-continued current of carbonic anhydride, which precipi
tates calcic carbonate and unaltered evernic acid.
   On theoretical grounds it has been stated* that, by the action of potassic
or baric hydrate, evernic acid should be resolved into orsellinic and ever-
uinic acids. This prediction, however, is incorrect, as               I   find, as formerly

with a slight excess of dry bromine, large quantities of hydrobromic acid
were given off, and a brominated compound produced.                    In order to prevent
any portion of the acid escaping bromination, the product was finely pow
dered and again treated with bromine.           After standing some time to allow
the excess of bromine to volatilize, the finely powdered compound was well

equivalents of hydrogen in evernic acid being replaced by bromine.
   Tetrabrom-evernic acid is rather soluble in hot alcohol, from which it
crystallizes on standing some time in small colourless prisms.                  It is inso
luble in water and bisulphide of carbon, slightly soluble in hot benzol, and
readily in ether, which when quickly evaporated leaves it as a transparent
colourless resin ; it melts at 161° C. The acid is very soluble in alkaline
solutions, which on evaporation dry up to a gummy mass.                       When heated
with concentrated sulphuric acid it decomposes.

   The usnic acid left undissolved in the preparation of evernic acid usually
retained traces of that acid even after repeated treatment with alcohol ; but
this  was  entirely removed by boiling with lime, as described in the first
part of this paper.      This decomposed and removed the evernic acid and
other impurities, leaving the usnic acid in the form of an insoluble calcium

     From the above analyses it will be seen that the usnic acid from Evernia
 pruHastri is identical in composition with that from Usnea barbata.             It has
 the same melting-point, and agrees with it in all its other properties.
                                  Cladonia rangiferina.
     In 1848*     I extracted    the lichen acid from Cladonia rangiferina,         and
 by analysis found it to      have the same composition as usnic acid, with which
 it agrees very closely in its properties.            Hesse, however, observedt that
 this acid had    a different melting-point (175° C.) from ordinary usnic acid
  (203° C), and proposed, therefore, as it so closely resembled ordinary
 usnic acid in its general character, to call it /3-usnic acid.
                                 Cladonic Acid, (3-orcin.
     I formerly obtainedt /3-orcin by subjecting to destructive distillation           a
 mixture of the acids from Cladonia rangiferina and various species of Usnea ;
 but   I  have lately found that ordinary usnic acid, melting at 203° C, ob
 tained from Evernia prunastri, Ramalina calicaris, and the various Usneas,
 does not yield a trace of /3-orcin when distilled, whilst, on the contrary,
 the acid extracted from Cladonia (Hesse's /3-usnic acid melting at 175° C),
 on being subjected to the same treatment, yields /3-orcin, thus showing a
 marked difference in the products of its decomposition from ordinary usnic
 acid, as well as in its melting-point.          Under these circumstances, therefore,
 I  think that it would be better to name the acid from Cladonia rangiferina
 "Cladonic Acid," instead of /3-usnic acid,           as proposed by Hesse.
     I expected to have been able to subject cladonic acid to a more careful
 examination, and procured for that purpose a quantity of Cladonia rangi
ferina from the neighbourhood of Moffat.                Unfortunately, however, it was
 not gathered until the beginning of December, and I was surprised to find
 that it contained scarcely a trace of cladonic or any similar acid.          I intend
 to obtain a new quantity next summer, when I hope to be more successful.
    I cannot conclude this paper without acknowledging the efficient assis
tance    I have received from Mr. Charles          E. Groves.

       Duppa, Esq., F.R.S.              Received January 13, 1870.
    In a paper by    Mr.   J. Alfred Wanklyn, bearing the above title, and pub
 lished in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. xviii. p. 91, the
 author refers to our memoir on the same subject printed in the Philo
 sophical Transactions for 18G6, vol. clvi. p. 37, and expresses his opinion
 that our interpretation of the nature of the reaction must be erroneous
 because it involves the disengagement of hydrogen. This opinion          is founded
upon certain experiments which Mr. Wanklyn has himself made,              and which
 are described in the number of Liebig's ' Annalen' for January           1869, and
in the Chemical Society's Journal, vol. ii. p. 371.
    In reference to this opinion we have to remark, first, that it is founded
upon experiments which differ essentially from our own ; and, second, that
even the results obtained in those experiments by the author do not           warrant
the conclusion, at variance with ours, which he has drawn from them,
viz. that the evolution of hydrogen in this reaction is inadmissible.
    The reaction, the theoretical explanation of which Mr. Wanklyn seeks to
controvert, is described in the Philosophical Transactions, vol. clvi. p.          38,
as follows   :— " When acetic ether is placed in contact with sodium it            be
comes hot, and a considerable quantity         of gas is evolved, which, after  being
passed   first through alcohol and then through water, burns with a non-
luminous flame, and the products of combustion do not produce the slightest
turbidity on agitation with baryta- water. In fact the gas is pure hydrogen.
When the action is complete, the liquid solidifies on cooling to a mail
resembling yellow beeswax.            By putting the sodium into the acetic ether
as just   described,   it is  difficult  to conduct the operation to completion,
owing to the liquid gradually assuming such a thick and pasty condition ai
to prevent the further action of the sodium."            Owing to the difficulty of
carrying    the reaction far enough in this way we frequently employed a
modification of this process, which is minutely described in the same
memoir.      The modification consisted in placing the sodium in a separate
vessel  and    causing the acetic ether to distil continuously over it; thus
the portions of acetic ether still unacted upon were brought, again and
again, into contact with the sodium, whilst the non-volatile product of the
operation was retained in a lower vessel.         As we acted upon several pound!
of acetic ether at once, the operation frequently lasted several dap, and
during the whole time torrents of hydrogen were evolved.              The   tempera
ture of the liquid in the distillation vessel was allowed to rise to         130*  C,
and the amount of sodium consumed was not much less than one                atom for
each molecule     of acetic ether employed.
    We  have made     several   attempts to determine quantitatively the volume
of hydrogen given off from a known weight of sodium, and also from a
known weight of acetic ether, but in neither operation could we obtain a

1870.]           of Sodium and Ethyl-iodide      on Acetic Ether.           229
trustworthy result.      In the first case because the sodium, which fuses
during the reaction, breaks up into a vast number of very minute globules,
the final disappearance of which in the highly coloured and pasty product
it is impossible to verify. In the second case because the thickening of
the liquid prevents the reaction being pushed far enough to -decompose the
whole of the acetic ether employed. In a quantitative experiment, in which
4-857 grammes of acetic ether were acted upon by sodium in slight excess,
344-79 cub. centims. of hydrogen at 0° C. and 760 millims. pressure were
obtained.     If one molecule of acetic ether had lost one atom of hydrogen,
615-9 cub. centims. of gas ought to have been collected.         It was evident,
however, that a large proportion of acetic ether still remained unattacked
at the close of the experiment.
    Such,   then, was our mode of operating; the hydrogen evolved was
allowed freely to escape, the whole process was conducted at the ordinary
 atmospheric pressure, and the temperature varied from the boiling-point
 of acetic ether to 130° C. Moreover the acetic ether used was prepared
 with the greatest care so as to ensure the absence of alcohol and water.
 By our method of preparation, described in the memoir already cited, no
 traces of the former could be detected even in the crude ether ; nevertheless
 it was first placed for several days over fragments of fused calcic chloride,
 which apparently remained perfectly dry and unaffected ; it was then in
 some cases boiled for ten days or a fortnight upon many pounds of sodium-
 amalgam, which we find to be entirely without action upon pure acetic
 ether, whilst it rapidly attacks and removes alcohol, if the latter be added
 even in very small proportion      to the acetic ether. When acetic ether, so
 treated and then distilled     from the sodium-amalgam, was brought into
 contact with the sodium, an abundant evolution of hydrogen immediately
 commenced, and continued during the entire treatment, which, as already
 remarked, frequently lasted     several  days.   The general  impression, how
 ever, produced upon us by the whole        of our operations was, that the evo
 lution of hydrogen was not quite so great as that theoretically required by
 the reactions which we believe to take place ; nevertheless it was obvious
 that no* equations, from which free hydrogen was excluded, could possibly
 correctly express the chemical changes effected in this action.         Certain
 experiments were undertaken to trace the missing hydrogen, but as they
 have not hitherto been completed we will not further allude to them here.
    We now turn to Mr. Wanklyn-s mode of experimenting. This is not
 stated in his communication to the Royal Society, but is given in the
 Journal of the Chemical Society, vol. xvii. p. 371, and in the Ann. Chem.
 u. Pharm. for January 1869, as follows: — '
    Exp. 1.   "I  sealed up a quantity of sodium with acetate of ethyl, which
  had been very carefully deprived of alcohol and water, and weighed the
 tube containing these materials.        I then heated the tube to 130° C. for
  some time, until the contents had changed from liquid to solid.          After
 opening the tube and allowing any gas that might have formed to escape, I
 weighed it again. The loss amounted to 0-5 in 100 parts of acetic ether."

230 On       the  Action of Sodium and Ethyl-iodide on Ace tic Ether. [Feb. 24,
    Exp.   2.   " 5 cub. centims. of good acetate of ethyl and 0-3 grm. of sodium
 were Eealed up      in a small glass tube and heated in a water-bath to 100° C.
 until all the sodium        had disappeared.       The tube    was then opened   under
 water  ;  the evolved yas measured 25 cub. centims. at ordinary temperature,
 but at 0° C. and 760 millims. pressure and dry it measured 23 cub. centims.
 If  the volume of hydrogen be calculated, which is equivalent to 0-3 grm.
 sodium, it will be found to be 140 cub. centims."
    Exp.   3.   " Another     specimen   of  acetic  ether, which was prepared with
 greater care, evolved no gas by the action of potassium or sodium."
    It is thus evident that whilst we allowed all evolved gas freely to escape,
 Mr. Wanklyn operated in sealed tubes under great pressure, — an alteration
 in the conditions of the experiment which might well lead to a modification
 of the result. Mons. L. Cailletet has recently shown that the evolution of
 hydrogen from zinc and hydrochloric acid is gradually diminished and
 finally stopped under increasing pressure ; and the same chemist also finds
 that the evolution of hydrogen from sodium-amalgam and water is dimi
nished and finally stopped in a sealed tube.             It follows from  these experi
 ments that pressure retards or even interrupts a reaction in             which a per
 manent gas is evolved, whilst it is. known to exercise little or          no influence
upon other chemical changes in which no evolution of gas                   takes place.
This influence of pressure upon certain kinds of chemical action affords an
 explanation of the difference between the results of Mr. Wanklyn-s experi
ments and our own, as regards the evolution of hydrogen during the action
of sodium upon acetic ether. We can confirm his observation that sodium
 dissolves in valeric ether, under ordinary atmospheric pressure, without the
evolution of any gas.          A reaction, whatever its nature may be, which thus
proceeds      readily with ethylic valerate can scarcely be impossible with its
homologue, acetic ether, and it is probable that this reaction goes on side
by side with those which we have described in our memoir ; but when the
pressure is moderate         those   changes   chiefly take place which involve the
disengagement         of hydrogen, whilst under        the great pressure arising in
sealed tubes these changes         are more    or less suppressed,    and the reaction
observed     by Mr. Wanklyn        comes into prominence.
    Lastly, Mr. Wanklyn-s         own experiments scarcely justify his unqualified
opinion     that   "equations     which   assume evolution of hydrogen in these
reactions are inadmissible."          In two out of three of his experiments, hy
drogen in considerable quantity was evolved ; and although in experiment
No. 2, given above, he attributes the hydrogen to the presence of alcohol,
yet in experiment No. I its origin cannot be so explained, as he states
expressly that the acetic ether employed
                                                   " had been very carefully deprived
of alcohol and water      ;"   yet the proportion of hydrogen evolved in this case
was much larger than in experiment No. 2.
    We reserve our observations upon Mr. W anklyn-s views regarding the
changes which take place when sodium acts upon acetic, butyric, and
vnleric ethers, until the publication        of  the  experimental data upon which
those views are founded.

    The mode of observation has already been so fully described by Sir E.

in October 1863 Mr. Chambers left the Observatory for India, and that
Mr. George Whipple took his            place as Magnctical Assistant.              Mr. Whipple
has    since continued to observe          every     month      with the utmost           care   and
assiduity, employing the same instruments that were used by his prede
cessor, and the same methods of observation and reduction.                              A smaller
number of observations by other instruments and other observers have
likewise been made, but it has been thought desirable to limit this discus
sion to the series made by the regular observer.                   I ought likewise to state
that both the dip-circle and unifilar stood in need of slight repairs, and
 that they were put into the hands of opticians for this purpose ; the first
 observation with the repaired dip-circle being that of January 1869, and

of a  semiannual inequality, in virtue of which the dip    on an average                                                                      is

234                  Dr. B. Stewart        on Observations     of Dip        [Mar.  3,
nearly all made by Mr. Chambers,              and those for the last six years nearly
all by Mr. Whipple.
    From the first six years we deduce a mean dip equal to 68° 20--07, cor
responding to middle epochApril 1, 1860, and from the latter six, a mean dip
equal to 68° 6--62, corresponding to middle epoch April 1, 1866, while the
secular change deduced from the first series is 2--00, and that deduced
from the last series l-,92, the mean of these two values being 1-96.
    If  we apply this mean value of the secular change to the mean result
corresponding to the epoch         April   1, 1860, in order to bring it to the epoch
April 1, 1866, we obtain
                           68°   20--07-ir-76=68°          8--31,
whereas    that deduced from the second series corresponding to this epoch
is 68°   6 -62.
    The former of these is l--69 higher than the latter, and it may be de
sirable to investigate the cause of this difference.
    7. In the first place, it cannot I think be due to any personal equation
in the observer. Of late I have made occasional observations with the
circles and needles used by Mr. Whipple, with the view of determining
whether there is any personal peculiarity in the dip observations of either
of  us.
    The   mean    of 12 such dips taken by me is                             68° 3--95
while the mean of 12 comparable dips taken by Mr. Whipple is 68° 3--85
showing a difference of not more than 0--1, which small difference may pro
bably be occasioned by accidental disturbance rather than by personal
peculiarity.
     During the time when Mr. Chambers                 was at Kew no comparative
observations were made with this particular object in view, and               I cannot
find a sufficient      number     of  strictly comparabb dips to determine with
certainty what was the mean difference, if any, between his readings and
mine.      The result would, however,          seem to indicate that his reading is
rather lower than mine, certainly not more than half a minute, but pro
bably much less.
     There is therefore no reason for supposing that Mr. Whipple reads
the dip to an appreciable amount lower than Mr. Chambers, so that the
 difference of V-69 cannot be accounted for by this supposition.
    8. Sir E. Sabine has remarked as follows (rPoceedings of the Royal Societv,
 Nov. 30,     1865, p.  491)   : — '- The general   effect  of the disturbances of the
 inclination    at Toronto is to increase what would          otherwise be the amount
 of that    element   ; therefore    if the disturbances have a decennial period,
 the absolute values of the inclination (if observed with sufficient delicacy)
 ought to show in their annual means a corresponding decennial variation,
 of which the minimum should coincide with the year of minimum dis
 turbance, and the maximum with the year of maximum disturbance."
  At Toronto, where the true secular change is very small, the effect of this

 1870.]            and Horizontal Force at Kew Observatory.                 235
 superimposed variation is very visible, so that the yearly values of the
 inclination appear to increase up to the period of maximum disturbance
 and to decrease after it. At Kew, the general effect of disturbances
 is probably the same as at Toronto, that is to say, tending to increase
 the inclination  ; but the secular change being considerable, and tending
 to decrease   the inclination, the joint effect of the secular change and the
 superimposed variation might be expected to appear iu a diminution of the
 yearly secular change for those years during which the disturbances are
 increasing from their minimum to their maximum value, and in an increase
 of the yearly secular change for   those years during which the disturbances
 are decreasing from their maximum to their minimum.
     The law of diminution of the dip at Kew      due to the conjoint action  of
 these  two causes,    may thus be graphically    represented in the following
 exaggerated   curve —
      A                  5.
                                                          C               B
where    B  represents   the epoch of maximum,      and C that of minimum
 disturbance.
    Also, we may regard A B E as denoting the first six years- results, and
 ECD those of the second six years, the epoch of maximum approximately
 falling about the middle of the first six years- observations, and the epoch
 of minimum about the middle of the second.
    Now the   slope  of the line A E D represents the average secular change,
also (1) represents the mean of dips deduced from the first series of
six years, and (2) the mean of those deduced from the second series,
(1) being above the line of average dip, and (2) being below it. From
this it is evident that, in order to bring (1) to the same epoch as (2), we
should have to apply to (1) a greater than the average secular change.
But before this reasoning can be used to account for the difference of
 l'-69, we must examine whether, as a matter of fact, in the Kew observa
tions the secular change is less than the mean during periods of increasing
disturbance, and greater than the mean when the disturbances are
decreasing.
    9. Taking the two series of six years as comprising the most regular and
reliable observations made at Kew, and deducting the mean dip for 1857,
in the Table prepared by Sir E. Sabine, from that for 1868 in Table I. of
this paper, we find a mean secular change of 2'-07-
    On the other hand, the actual yearly changes and their differences    from
the mean are as follows : —

    If we take the first three and the last two          of the   above differences as
belonging to the years when the disturbances were increasing, we find a
secular change less than the average by a mean of 0--29 ; and if we take
the remaining six differences as belonging to the years when the disturb
ances were    decreasing, we find a secular         change greater than the average
by a mean    of 0--24.
    It would therefore appear that the Kew observations present a pecu
liarity similar to those at Toronto, so that the difference of l--69 between
the two sets of observations may probably be accounted for by this cause.
    10. We may, in fact, exhibit the peculiarities of the graphical represen
tation given above by means of the actual results.              Thus, if we take the
first year-s dip (1857), or 68° 24--87, and deduct from it every year 2--07
 (which is the average secular change), we shall obtain a series of yearly
values representing the yearly positions of the line A E D ; and if the
diagram truly represents the facts, the observed yearly values ought to range
above the line for the first six years, and under it for the second six.
    We may    see  by the following Table that this is actually the case        : —

 On the whole, therefore,     we hare good evidence of a behaviour at Kew
 analogous   to that at Toronto.
    1 1 . The probable error of a single monthly determination of the dip, de
 rived from the seventy-two monthly determinations given in Table I., and
 after the application of the correction for secular change and annual varia
 tion, as derived from the results of these observations, has been made, is
  + 0'-96.  There              is,
                       however, reason to believe that this probable error                                   is
 increased to some extent by periods of disturbance, some of them of cons
 derable duration, which exhibit themselves when the residual errors have
 been deduced after the method indicated above.                                   In order to   test this,
                                                                                                         I
have formed         aof seventy-two yearly values of the dip corresponding
                         series
in epoch to the various monthly values of Table                              I.
   These yearly values will, of course, average the semiannual inequality,
while each yearly value may possibly be supposed to be affected to some
extent with the same sort of disturbance which affects the monthly value
to which    corresponds.
               it          Were both affected in precisely the same way
by these disturbances, the differences        the monthly and yearly
                                                              between
values would only be occasioned by the semiannual inequality and by
errors of observation. It                 is,
                            however, too much to expect that all effects
of    disturbance will be eliminated from the differences                               by   this method     ;
nevertheless we may naturally expect that they will be reduced in amount.

    If we  take the first three arid the last two of the above differences as
 belonging to years, when the disturbances are increasing, we find a secular
 change only less than the average by a mean of '00008 ; and if we take the
 remaining six differences as belonging to years when disturbances are de
 creasing, we find a secular change greater than the average by a mean of
 •00007; both being differences which form such an extremely small pro
 portion of the whole change that they may be neglected.

    From this Table we fail to   perceive a trace   of the behaviour exhibited      by
the dip in Table IV.
   Apart, therefore, from all theoretical considerations, we have reason to
believe that, as a matter of fact, the behaviour exhibited in the diagram
holds for the dip, but does not appreciably manifest itself in the case of
the horizontal force.

      We may reduce     these to a common epoch by applying to the former dip
  the correction   — 0'-96, this being the proportional secular change (as shown
  by these six years) necessary to reduce the former epoch to the latter.
  The former dip will therefore become 68° 6'-83— 0'-9G = 68° 5'-87.
      Reducing in the same way the horizontal force, we have
                            3-8346 + 0-002/5 = 3-83735.

     The total force derived from the first series will therefore be 10-28717,
 and that derived from the second series 10-29080, showing thus a difference
 of 0-00363 in British units     as the measure of the greater intensity of the
 terrestrial magnetic force in the October to March period, than in the
 April to September period. This is in the same direction, and very nearly
 of the same amount, as that determined by Sir E. Sabine from the first
 six years, which exhibited a similar difference of 0-00317 in British units.
     Thus   we find that the two series agree in showing nearly the same semi
 annual variation for the total force, while       the first period exhibits the
 greatest   semiannual variation of the dip.     It ought, however, to be borne
 in mind that the two series bear a different relation to the disturbance
 period, the maximum of disturbances occurring about the middle of the
 first series, and the minimum near the middle of the second.
 II. " Spectroscopic       Observations   of the Nebula of Orion, and of
        Jupiter, made with the Great Melbourne Telescope.8" By A. Le
        Sueur.      Communicated by the Rev. T. R. Robinson, D.D.
        Received January 27, 1870.
     In one particular the spectroscopic observations    of the nebula of Orion
are not void of interest ; they show distinctly that considerable nebulosity
exists within and about the trapezium.        The image at the slit is sufficiently
large to well separate the stars of the trapezium, so that when two of these
are, as it were, threaded on the slit, a clear space lies between     them   ; this
in the spectroscope gives the well-known lines with little, if at all, less
brilliancy than the general bright nebula.
    The small comparison-mirror being removed, the available slit is -4 inch
high, equivalent in the case of the Cassegrain image to about 43" arc ;
with an image condensed about three times (which is the usual arrangement
and still allows sufficient separation), the slit may, therefore, be made to
considerably overlap the trapezium contour, and thereby, at the same time
as the trapezium,    light from the brightest part of the nebula is under in
spection ; it is curious to see that the spectral lines run with almost con
tinuous brightness throughout the height of the slit.

 1870.]               of the   Nebula   of Orion,   and   of Jupiter.                 243
     Inaccuracy of focus of the image on the slit might perhaps somewhat
mislead, but      this has not been allowed to come into play ; for the focus is
readily adjusted with considerable delicacy, by examination of the breadth
of star spectrum, which is reduced to a minimum.
     In Sir John Herschel's Cape drawing, a slight nebulosity is seen within
and immediately about the trapezium ; and in the description is found the
                                              "
following extract from note-book : — In the interior of the trapezium there
exists positively no nebulosity, at least none comparable in intensity to that
immediately      without it."
    There being (as far as I can now see or remember) no other special refer
ence to this matter in the description, it is not quite clear whether or not
the nebulosity in the drawing rests on this evidence or on that of other
nights when      it may    have been more conspicuous.
    In Lord Rosse's drawing         the trapezium is enclosed in, and     itself encloses,
a space    totally free from nebulosity.        My own telescopic observations        here
(on not good nights unfortunately) indicate a positive though comparatively
faint nebulosity within and about the trapezium, somewhat as in the Cape
drawing ;     the spectroscope, however, shows with much force that this
nebulosity not only exists, but is comparable in brightness to that surroun
ding the trapezium at some distance, — the brightest part of the nebula
in fact ; and therefore that, in ordinary observation, the faintness or appa
rent complete absence         of nebula is mainly due to the disturbing brightness
 of the four stars, and not to any intrinsic           extreme    faintness or absolute
 vacuity.
      Jupiter has   been examined      with results,  if  not, as far as may be judged
 at present,    important, at least interesting.         Here, again, the large size of
 image is brought into prominent play ; with the original Cassegrain image
 the light is barely sufficient, but with the image condensed (at pleasure
 within certain limits) fair work becomes possible, the spectrum being con
 siderably    bright.
      The lines G, F,   b,  C, D, are seen without the slightest difficulty, C (being
 near to visible limit) not so readily, but unmistakably, and many other

  C, D   ; from measures this turns out to be one of the bands examined by
  Mr. Huggins, 882 of his scale* (C0 of Brewster ?).
       The observations were made generally with Jupiter not far from the
  meridian.      On one night only of those employed was the atmosphere at
  all free from perceptible haze ; as far, however, as memory could be trusted,
  there did not appear to be any perceptible difference           in the intensity of  the
  line on the different nights.       This line is always so conspicuous that, were      it
  not for   Mr. Huggins's more critical observation, I would be inclined to think
   that in Jupiter it is much stronger than in nn equnlly bright daylight spec

(on the foregoing assumption) be accounted for by supposing that the
cloud-bands are very near the surface, so near that the light reflected
therefrom has to pass through a thickness and density of atmosphere com
parable in its effects to that above the more uninterrupted parts of the
surface.
   Further observations may obviate the necessity for this or any other
more feasible explanation, by proving that the band is mainly due to the
earth ; but, as before shown, the weight of evidence, Mr. Huggins's obser
vation taken into account, is in favour of the assumption that the line, as
seen on   Jupiter   at considerable altitude, is mainly due to the planet itself.
    The general appearance of the spectroscopic image is one of nearly uni
form brightness, -with the marked exception of the brighter band P Q,
and the much darker" band Q R : in this band the principal absorption
takes place at the more refrangible end of the spectrum, where it is very
considerable, gradually diminishing, but yet conspicuous, up to E; at mo
ments it may be traced very faintly up to D, with no certainty beyond.
    In this band Q, R are not separable ; considering the size of the image
this can hardly be due entirely to closeness, but would seem to show that
 (at the more refrangible end at least) the absorption of the yellow and
 somewhat dark space enclosed between Q, R is little inferior to that of Q, R
 themselves.      P is not conspicuous, but is unmistakably       seen  in good
 moments as a narrow streak at the blue end.
    The experiment was made of placing the slit parallel to the planet's
 equator ; when in this position and moved slowly over the surface, or
 arrested at particular points/no peculiarity was distinguishable ; so little do
 the parts differ in brightness, that by this method it could not, from the
 mere evidence of the spectrum, be told what part was being admitted
 through the slit ; in this method, however, greater delicacy of adjustment
 is required, for slight want of parallelism of the slit to the bands brings
 in disturbing effects.
    The edges of the disk were examined, but without result.

 III. " On      the Nebulse    of Argo and Orion, and on the Spectrum
       of Jupiter." By A. Le Sueur. Communicated by Prof. G. G.
        Stokes, Sec. R.S. Received February 21, 1870.
     Among the following       observations    made with the great Melbourne
 telescope, the most important are those of »j      Argo ; the spectrum of this
 star is crossed by bright lines.
     The mere fact of a bright-line spectrum is not very difficult to ascertain
 on a good night ; for although from faintness of the light the phenomenon
 is necessarily delicate, yet the bright lines occasionally flash out so sharply
 that the character of    the spectrum cannot be mistaken.     The most marked

lines I make out to he, if not coincident with, very near to C, D, b, F, and
the principal green nitrogen line.   There are possibly other lines, but those
mentioned are the only ones manageable.
   Direct spark comparison has hitherto been found impossible ; though
plainly marked at moments the lines require concentrated attention, and
    not permit the disturbing effect of other light in the field ; attempts
Awill
were made to diminish the brilliancy of the spark spectrum but with no
good result, a different method was therefore adopted.
   By watching for good momeuts the pointer                       was placed on a particular
star line, the spark spectrum was then turned on, and the position                               of the
pointer noted.
   By this means it was seen in repeated trials that star lines within the
limits of the dispersion used (about 7°) were coincident with C, F, the
principal green nitrogen line, and 6, or rather (the spark employed was
platinum in air) the air-band involved in b group.    It cannot be deter
mined whether the coincidence is with the magnesium group or the air-
band ; nothing more definite can be said than that the star line lies within
the limits of the group.
  The comparison spectrum employed does not show F, but the position
of the previously adjusted pointer, with reference to air lines in the
neighbourhood, leaves little doubt as to the identity of the blue star line
with F, due regard being had to the collateral evidence (when such close
limits are reached) that C coincides with a red star line. The yellow (or
orange ?) line in the star has not yet received sufficient attention ; it                              is,
however, very near D.
   With the dispersion employed,                the bright air line on less re

     In the present           state   of the inquiry there   is little   doubt left as to the
presence of hydrogen in the star ; the other lines may perhaps be accounted
for by nitrogen alone, or by nitrogen, magnesium, and sodium.
   On the whole the weight of collateral evidence will probably be consi
dered to be in favour of the latter combination, with the possibility that
for sodium may have to be substituted the substance which produces the
line in sun-protuberance spectrum.
   For although there is no direct evidence as to identity of the line near
D, if the coincidence were with the orange nitrogen line it would be rea
sonable to expect a line in the star corresponding to the yellow line                    1    180+,
yet none has been made out in that position ; again, the second green line
has probably less claims for visibility than the orange or yellow lines, yet
in the star spectrum this Hue is not less well seen than that coinciding
with the chief nitrogen line. These considerations, though perhaps not en
titled to great weight, at least lead in the direction of the above inference.
    Owing to faintness of the general spectrum no dark lines are made out ;
one in the red is strongly suspected, and occasionally there is an appearance
as   if of multitude over the spectrum generally, but they refuse to be seen
               a
separately and certainly.
  It is fortunate that these observations have been possible in the present
magnitude of the star ; may not the bright-line character of the spectrum be
due to a commencement of increase ? The star has not perceptibly changed
since I knew it.

does exist) is of a similar faint character.
    With this evidence that the eye-view with the 4-feet approaches the
actual facts, and a due consideration of those facts, it seems difficult to
imagine any conditions of aperture, definition, or other disturbing causes
which could produce a view at all approaching to that seen by Sir John
Herschel.
   We have therefore evidence of much weight that enormous changes have
taken place in this wonderful region. Is not the presence of nitrogen and
hydrogen in the star 77 a significant fact in connexion with these changes,
which appear to be nothing less than a destruction of nebula specially in
its neighbourhood     ?
   Orion    has been examined     with a new and interesting result ; the spectro
scope proves     that   in  and  about   the trapezium nebula exists comparable
with the bright surrounding nebula.
   This observation is rendered         easy by the large separation   of the stars
consequent on great focal length of telescope ; indeed the whole separation
of the original image is not required, the observation being made more
crucial by a condension of between two and three times; with this arrange
 ment the separation is still sufficient, and the advantage is gained of view
ing at the same time the bright surrounding nebula.
    The stars, sharply     focused   to give a linear spectrum, being threaded on
the slit singly or in pairs, or cautiously removed out of the field, it is seen
 that the bright lines cross the trapezium with little if at all diminished
brilliancy.
   The ordinary telescopic view is therefore        an erroneous one, produced by
 the disturbing effect of the bright group.
    Jupiter   has been    examined (generally on moonlight nights) ; with this
object the orginal Cassegrain image is too faint for good work, but by in
terposition of a suitable lens the image is condensed at pleasure within cer
tain limits ; with the light thus increased the Fraunhofer lines G, F, 4, E, D
are always easily seen,       C  also easily on a clear night;' the lines  to which
special attention has been directed are the telluric lines 914 and P38 (for
 convenience of reference      I use throughout the numbers in Mr. Huggins's

   1870.]                Argo and Orion, and of Jupiter.                            249
  Jupiter   and sky diagram).      These are the only lines seen with certainty
   between   C and D.
      The identity of 914 and 838        rests  partly on measures and partly on
  spark comparison, where, for the identification of 914, it is seen that this
  line is near to the air band 807 of Mr. Huggins's chemical scale.
     The line 914 is so easily seen, that having in mind Mr. Huggins's state
 ment concerning the difficulty of discerning it at all, originally very imper
  fect measures on a bad night and with the apparatus imperfectly adjusted
  misleading in the same direction, this line was at first mistaken for 882,
 from which, however, it is separated far beyond the limit of error in a
 proper    state of adjustment of apparatus.
     882 is not seen at all with Jupiter at considerable altitude. On the night
 of December 29th, however, between the hours of 12.30 and 1, Jupiter
 being low, 882 was seen almost as conspicuous as 914, which,                   I  mav
 remark, did not seem to have perceptibly increased in darkness by the ad
 ditional absorption of the earth's atmosphere.
     On the night of December 14th (both objects being near the meridian)
  the spectroscope was turned on Jupiter and the moon alternately several
 times.     On Jupiter 914 and 838 were easily visible, the former (as usual)
 the more conspicuous; on the moon no line could be certainly made out
  between C and D.       Mr. Ellery was present at the time and gave the same
 verdict.
     So far these observations are merely confirmatory of those made by Mr.
 Huggins. There is one point, however, not unworthy of consideration,
 arising from a comparison of the observations in connexion with the condi
 tions under which they are made.
     It is probable that Mr. Huggins, with his earlier apparatus, was under
 more favourable conditions as regards light than, if not the best at my
 command, at least those under which 914 is now plainly seen.                   When
 condensed as much as arrangements allow (about four times), I probably
 get a somewhat brighter image at the slit than that produced by Mr. Hug
 gins's telescope ; but with little or no condensation, and a dispersion of near
 7°   (Bto H = 6°   50'), the line in question is still conspicuous.         Yet Mr.
 Huggins speaks      of this line as barely   distinguishable,  or not   at all visible
 with his earlier apparatus. Width of slit, of course, plays a prominent
 part ; but I cannot be wrong in assuming that, for prospecting purposes,
 Mr. Huggins tried various widths. Moreover when the slit is gradually
 cat down, 914 is visible as long as the chief Fraunhofer lines, and is still
readily seen when the light is insufficient to show a trace of C or 838
near it.
    These    considerations,  if not entitled to much weight, at least point to a
possible variability of the line in question.       If this prove to be the case, it
will be interesting to note its degree of visibility in connexion with the cha
racter of the surface at the different times of observation.
    I cannot find whether 914 or 838 is involved in the lines proved by M.
                                                                       t  2

Jansen as special to aqueous vapour.          An answer one way or the other
would be equally interesting ; for Mr. Huggins's observations and my own
later ones (which are indeed merely corroborative) go far to prove that,
whatever the cause of the lines, that which produces 9 1 4 and 838 has ou
Jupiter more efficacy than that which produces 882, while the reverse
appears to be the case on the earth.
    Jupiter was taken in hand specially to note any peculiarity in the spec
trum of different parts of the surface, as regards general or specific absorp
 tion.   The best observations were made on the night of December 1 1th,
 when the phenomena were as given in the diagram (Plate I. fig. 2), to
 which the second figure of Jupiter is added merely for any additional
interest to be derived from two views on the same night (o at 9.30, 6 at
 11.30 + ).
    The space N P is slightly yellowish, and appears at good defining mo
ments to be crossed by a multitude of fine hair lines (this lias been seen
 more than once) ; P Q is white, and considerably brighter than the general
surface; QR dusky yellow, much darker than N P ; RT white; TS similar
 to  P Q, but more approaching      to white.
    P, Q, R, T dark brown with occasional suspicion of green tinge.
    The spectrum, as given in the diagram, is an inversion (to suit telescopic
image of planet) of what is seen in the spectroscope with the slit perpendi
cular to Jupiter's equator.
    The absorption of Q, R is most marked beyond F, fading gradually
away to about E ; beyond this Q, R are seen separately with an apparently
undiminished     spectrum between them ; P Q is much brighter than the
general spectrum, and is normal throughout ; T R occasionally flashes out
brightly ; P stretches equally across the spectrum ; T is most marked at
the less refrangible end (the reverse of this was the case for one of the belts
on a former oecasion).
    A special point aimed at in these observations was to note any peculiarity
in the lines 914, 838 as they cross the various parts of the surface in thk
position of the slit, but no satisfactory evidence could be elicited.          As
before mentioned, by the interposition of a suitable lens the image, still
focused on the slit, may be condensed at pleasure within certain limits; a
point is therefore chosen at which the compromise between brilliancy of
spectrum and size of image is deemed most suitable for the object in view.
The light is quite adequate    for the purpose when the bands T Q, Q R are
still of considerable width;  any difference, if not very slight, in the line 914
as it crossed the different   bands ought therefore to have been detected.
This was not the case.        The experiment       was tried of placing the slit
parallel  to the bands, but  with  no  new  result.

  to dilate the mouth of the womb, and generally to rupture the membranes.
  I  shall endeavour to show, from the principles of muscular action already
  laid down, that the uterine muscles are sufficient, and not much more than
  sufficient, to complete the first stage of labour, and that they do not pos
  sess an amount of force adequate to rupture, in any case, the uterine wall
  itself.
     In the second stage of labour, the irritation of the foetal head upon the
  wall of the vagina provokes the reflex action of the voluntary abdominal
  muscles, which aid powerfully the uterine muscles to complete the second
  stage by expelling the foetus.   The amount of available additional force
  given out by the abdominal muscles admits of calculation, and will be found
  much greater than the force produced by the involuntary contractions of
  the womb itself.
    The mechanical problem to be solved for both cases is one of much
 interest, as it is the celebrated problem of the equilibrium of a flexible
 membrane subjected to the action of given forces.   It has been solved by
 Lagrange (Mecanique Analytique, p. 147) in all its generality.     In the
 most general case of the problem, the following beautiful thereom can be
 demonstrated : — Let T denote the tensile strain acting in the tangential
 plane of the membrane, applied to rupture a band of the membrane 1 inch
 broad      ;   let   P   denote the pressure resulting      from all the forces in action,
 perpendicular to the surface  of the membrane, and acting on a surface of
 one square inch ; and let pt and p2 denote the two radii of principal curva
 ture of the membrane at the point considered.    Then we have the follow
 ing equation         :   —

                                     become spherical, the two principal
 curvatures become equal, and the equation becomes

hydrostatical pressure only, aud is therefore easily measured, and the sup
 position of spherical curvature is approximately admissible.
      It is evident from the form of the gravid uterus, that its curvature is
 greatest    near its mouth   ;  and the equation shows that for a given hydro-
 statical pressure the tensile strain is proportional to the radius of curvature ;
 hence this strain will be greatest at the fundus of the uterus, in which.
 part, accordingly, we find the muscular coat thicker than elsewhere.                    If
 we assume the shape of the uterus to be that of a prolate ellipsoid, whose
 longer diameter is 1 2 inches, and shorter diameter 8 inches, its mean cur
 vature will be that of a sphere whose diameter is 9-158 inches.
      The volume of the gravid uterus is found from the expression

 of a circle to its diameter ; substituting for a and b their numerical values,
 we find the contents of the uterus to be 402- 13 cubic inches.

 iu which     e is the excentricity of the generating ellipse.            If the numerical
 values be substituted in this expression,          it will be found that the surface
 of the uterus is 270-66 square inches *.
      Some highly interesting conclusions may be drawn from the preceding
 calculations, combined with the weight of the total muscular tissue of the
 uterus.      Heschl estimates the weight of the uterine muscles at from 1 lb.
 to 1-5 lb., Montgomery found the muscles of the gravid uterus to weigh
  1 -5 lb., and Levret estimates    them at 5 1 cubic inches, which, with a specific
 gravity of 1-052, I find to be equivalent to l-93 lb.                Taking the mean of

      If we suppose a ribbon, one iuch in width, to be formed from the wall of
 the uterus, its thickness will be 0-1519 inch ; and as each square inch of
 cross section of muscular fibre is capable of lifting 102-55 lbs., we find for
  the greatest tensile force producible            by the contraction    of the uterine
  muscles : —

      Substituting   this value   of T in the equation

 and for  p  its mean value  9- 158   inches, we obtain the maximum hydrostatical
 pressure inside the gravid uterus that can be produced by the contraction
 of its muscular fibres : —

              produced by uterine contraction        J    9-159
     This pressure, applied to      a circular surface of 4£ inches in diameter, is
 equal   to  54-106   lbs.   One   hundred    experiments were made by Duncan and
 Tait upon the hydrostatical pressure necessary to rupture the membranes
 which contain the liquor amnii, which are recorded in Dr. Duncan-s book*
 (pp. 306-311).         The greatest pressure observed was 3-10 lbs., and the
 least was 0-26 lb. ; and       I  find that the mean rupturing pressure of all
 their experiments was 1-2048 lb.
     Combining this experimental result with the calculation already given,
 of the amount of pressure producible by the muscular tissue of the womb,
we may conclude that the uterine muscles nre capable                  of rupturing the
 membranes in every cose, and possess, in general, nearly three times the
amount of force requisite for this purpose.
     In the second stage of labour, the voluntary action of the abdominal
muscles is called into play to aid the expulsive efforts of the uterine muscles.
I   have attempted to calculate the force available from the contraction of
these muscles      as follows.
     The abdominal        muscles are four in number, viz. rectus abdominis,
obliquus externus, obliquus internus and transversalis . The last three
muscles form curved sheets, acting upon the corresponding muscles of the
opposite side by means of tendinous aponeuroses which meet in the linea
alba, and form the sheath of the vertical rectus abdominis muscle.               From
the arrangement of all four, it is plain that the tensile force of muscular
contraction in the curved wall of the belly, from the xiphoid cartilage to the
symphysis pubis, is to be measured by the sum of the united forces of all
the muscular sheets.        If we knew the force of each muscle, and the prin
cipal curvatures of the belly in the middle line, we could calculate, by La
grange-s theorem, the hydrostatical pressure inside the abdominal cavity
and available to expel faeces, urine, or a foetus.

     The   average    total thickness of the muscular walls is 0 869 inch, which
 is nearly identical with the measurement obtained from the female subject.
 It has been ascertained by careful observations, that we must add 50 per
 cent, to the weights of muscles in the dead subject in order to bring them
 to the living weights ; this correction gives us 1-3035 inch for the mean
  thickness of the muscles causing tension in the central line of the belly,
 where the forces of all the muscles come into play together.                 Multiplying
  this thickness by 102-55        lbs., or   coefficient   of   muscular contraction,    we
  find
                           T=l-3035x 102-55=133-67                lbs.
  This is the tensile strain producible by the contraction of the abdominal
  muscles along the curved central line of the belly.
      It remains now to ascertain the principal curvatures             of the abdominal
  gurface, and to use the equation

      In order to ascertain the curvature of the belly, I made experiments on
   three young men placed lying on their backs upon the floor, and made
   them depress and raise the abdominal wall as much as possible.                 The result
   was as follows:    —  Taking a straight line from the upper part of the sym
   physis pubis    to  the xiphoid cartilage as the fixed line of comparison, it was
   found possible to depress the navel one inch below this fixed line and to
   raise it two inches above it. When the belly was distended to the utmost
   by the action of the abdominal muscles, I measured the longitudinal and
   transverse curvatures by measuring the sagittas corresponding to a given
   length of tangent, with the following results         : —

      Multiplying this curvature into the tension of the abdominal                    muscles  at

      This amount of expulsive force per square inch is available, although
  not usually employed, to assist the uterus in completing the second stage
  of labour.       If  we suppose it applied to the surface of a circle 4£ inches in
  diameter (the usual width of the pelvic canal), we find that it is equivalent
  to 523-65 lbs. pressure.
      Adding together the combined             forces    of the voluntary and involuntary
  muscles, we find —
                   Involuntary muscles         .                   = 54-106 lbs.

     Thus we see that, on an emergency, somewhat more than a quarter of a
 ton pressure can be brought to bear upon a refractory child that refuses to
 come into the world in the usual manner*.
     In order to determine by actual experiment the expulsive force of the
 abdominal muscles,          I placed two men, of 48 and 2 1 years of age respec
 tively, lying       on a  table  upon their backs, and put a disk measuring 1-87
 inch diameter just over the navel ; weights were placed upon this disk and
 gradually increased until the extreme limit of weight that could be lifted
 with safety was reached ; this limit was found to be in both cases 113 lbs.
As the circle whose diameter is                1-87 inch has an area         of 2-937   square

    The    paper commences        with    a  continuation   for the years 1864-06 of
Tables II. and       III.  of a previous paper by the same authors ; it then pro
ceeds to     a  discussion    of the value of the pictures of the sun made by
Hofrath Schwabe, which had              been placed at the disposal of the authors,
and   the   result   is  that  these   pictures, when compared with simultaneous
pictures taken by Carrington and by the Kew heliograph, are found to be of
great trustworthiness.          From 1832 to 1854 the pictures discussed are those
of Schwabe, who was the only observer between these dates ; then follows the
series taken by Carrington,        and lastly the Kew series, which began in 1862.
    A list is given of the values of the sun-s spotted area for every fortnight,
from the beginning of 1832 up to May 1868, and also a list of three-
monthly values of the same, each three-monthly value being the mean of
the three fortnightly values which precede and of the three which follow
it. These three-monthly values are also given for every fortnight.
    A plate is appended to the paper, in which a curve is laid down repre
 senting the progress of solar disturbance as derived from the three-monthly
 values  ;  and another curve is derived from this by a simple process of equali
 zation, representing the progress of the ten-yearly period.                 The values of
 the latter curve, corresponding         to  every fortnight,  are also   tabulated.    From
 this Table are derived the following epochs of maxima and minima of the
 longer period     : —
                     Minimum Nov. 28, 1833.
                     Maximum                             Dec. 21, 1830.
                     Minimum Sept. 21, 1843.
                     Maximum                             Nov.  14, 1847.
                                                                                    -
                     Minimum April 21, 1856.
                     Maximum                             Sept.  7, 1859.
                     Minimum Feb. 14, 1867.
    This exhibits     a variability   in the length of the whole period.
       Thus    we have between       1st and 2nd minimum                   9-8 1 years.
                                     2nd and 3rd do                     12 58      „
                                     3rd and 4th do                    10-81       „
                              Mean of all the periods                    1 1-07 years.
    Another fact previously noted by Sir             J. Herschel   is brought to light,

  namely, that the time between a minimum and the next maximum is less
  than that from the maximum to the next minimum.
       Thus the times from the minimum to the maximum are for the three
  periods 3-06, 4*14, and 3-37, while those from the maximum to                         the
  minimum are 6-75, 8-44, and 7*44 years.
       In all the three periods there are times of secondary maxima after the          first
  maximum        ;  and in order to exhibit this peculiarity, statistics are given of the
  light-curve of R Sagittse aud of /3 Lyras, two variable stars which present
  peculiarities similar to the sun.
      Finally, the results       are tested to see whether they exhibit any trace of
  planetary     influence   ;  and  for this purpose the conjunctions of Jupiter and
  Venus, of Venus and Mercury, of Jupiter and Mercury, as well as the
  varying distances of Mercury alone in its elliptical orbit, have been made
  use of, and the united effect is exhibited in the following Table, the unit of
  spotted area being one-millionth          of the sun's visible hemisphere : —

 IV. "On          the   Contact of Conies with            Surfaces."       By William
         Sfottiswoode,          M.A., F.R.S.        Received February 16, 1870.
                                          (Abstract.)
     It  is well known that at every point          of a surface two tangents, called
principal tangents, may be drawn having thrce-pointic contact with the
surface, t. e. having an intimacy exceeding by one degree that generally
enjoyed by a straight line and a surface.             The object of the present paper
is   to  establish    the  corresponding     theorem    respecting tangent conies, viz.
that    " at  every point of a surface ten conies may be drawn having six-
pointic     contact   with the surface ;" these may be called Principal Tangent
Conies.       In this investigation I have adopted a method analogous to that
employed in my paper " On the Sextactic Points of a Plane Curve" (Phil.

 1870.]               On the Areas     of   the    four orifices of           the   Heart.                265
 Trans. vol. civ. p. 653) ; and as I there, in the case of three variables, in
 troduced a set of three arbitrary constants in order to comprise a group of
 expressions in a single formula, so here, in the case of four variables,   in                           I
 troduce with the same view two sets of four arbitrary constants.        these                    If
 constants be represented by at,    y,   a-, /3,

                                             0,
 pointic.  The formulae thence arising turn out to be strictly analogous to
 those belonging to the case of three variables, except that the arbitrary
 quantities cannot         in
                      general be divided out from the final expression. In
 fact,      the presence of these quantities which enables us to determine
          it
          is
 the position of the plane of section, and the equation whereby this                                         is
 effected proves to be         of the degree 10 in vt         :    vj-=k, and      besides this of the
 degree 12w— 27            in the coordinates x, y,           e,  t    (re   being the degree of the
 surface), giving rise to the theorem above stated.
    Beyond the question of the principal tangents,       has been shown by    it
 Clebsch and Salmon that on every surface           curve may be drawn, at
                                                                   U   a

          Areas of the four Orifices of the Heart." By Herbert Davies,
          M.D., F.R.C.P., Senior Physician to the London Hospital, and
          formerly Fellow of Queens- College, Cambridge. Communicated
          by W. H. Flower, Hunterian Professor of Comparative Ana
          tomy.       Received January 27, 1870.
I    propose in this communication to inquire whether any law can be
discovered which determines the relative magnitude of the areas of the

 206                   Dr. Herbert Davies on          the     Areas of the           [Mar.      17,
 tricuspid, pulmonic, mitral, and aortic orifices — the four principal                 openings
 in the heart.
   Although to ordinary observation these orifices appear to exhibit no
mutual relationship of size, there can be no doubt that an instrument so
accurate in the adaptation of its valvular apparatus, and so exact in the
working of its different parts, must reveal on close examination the exist
ence of laws which not only determine the force required to be impressed
upon the blood traversing its chambers, but also the relative                  sizes of these
apertures to one another.
  The facts and inferences which I shall adduce on this subject will tend,
 I         to throw some light upou the mechanism of the heart in
     believe,                                                                                      its
healthy state, and will explain also some points of practical interest the                in
pathology  of that organ:
  To M. Bizot in France, and Drs. Peacock and Reid in this country, are
we mainly indebted for the most careful and                   trustworthy    measurements          of
the    circumferences of the orifices.           Their measurements            have been         re
corded to the minuteness of the thousandth part of an inch, and yet                             will,

I believe, be readily admitted that the results in the form given                            these
distinguished            help us but little in obtaining any definite
                    observers                                                            idea      of
the mutual relationship of the areas of the oriGces, and are destitute                    of    any
practical value in our study of the mechanism of the heart itself.
     Had the observationsbeen pushed further, or, rather, had the figures
been worked  out into some distinct and definite shape, these observers
could not have failed to discover an interesting and important law pre
siding over the areas of these orifices, and they would thus have been
enabled to utilize multitude of measurements which had been obtained
                       a

tures for 1865, we find the mean circumferences of the four orifices, ex
pressed    in English inches, to      be as follows   :—

  The circumference of          a   circular opening being known, its radius              is
termined from the formula
                                    circumference = 27rr,
where    * =3* 14 15   ;  and the radius being thus determined, the area of                     the
opening    is   calculated from the formula
                                        area=7rr2.

    The mean areas of the four orifices thus                obtained are found to be
as follows : —

whence      it is obvious that the apertures differ very considerably in                area
from    each    other, the tricuspid having the largest area, its orifice being
more than double the size of the aortic opening.
    Irregular, however, as these areas may appear to be in magnitude with
 respect to each other, we shall find, on pushing our observations further,
 that there is a distinct and constant law presiding over them, and this law
 is discovered when we compare the ratios of the areas of corresponding
 orifices.     Thus,

 or, in other words, the area of the tricuspid appears from these calculations
  to bear nearly the same relation to the area of the mitral which the area of
  the pulmonic does to that of the aortic orifice, i. e. were the tricuspid, for
  example, twice the size of the mitral orifice in area, the pulmonic would be
  twice   the size  of the aortic orifice in   area, the two ratios differing           from
  each other only by one-tenth.
     Again, if we adopt Dr. Reid's measurements of the circumference of the
  healthy cardiac orifices (these measurements being given in Dr. Peacock's
  work), we shall find this law to be more conclusively proved.
     According to Dr. Reid the measurements of the circumferences are as
  follows : —

    It is well known that no measurements can be taken of such orifices as
 those of the heart without liability to error ; but no one can observe
 the close identity of the respective ratios without concluding that the
 ratios are really identical, and that the small differences in the calculated
results depend entirely upon the impossibility of obtaining absolutely correct
 measurements of the boundaries of such openings. It is clear, therefore, that
in whatever proportion the tricuspid is larger than the mitral, in exactly
the same proportion is the pulmonic larger in area than the aortic orifice.
This rule applies, of course, to the human heart only in its healthy state ;
 but I shall show that its application is of practical value when we consider
the organ in its diseased state.
                                                                 I
    I shall now proceed to prove that the law which have deduced from
independent observations made in the healthy human heart is of far wider
application, for I have found by my own measurements that a comparison
of the areas of the same orifices in animals reveals the same result.
    The following   are the facts at which        I   have arrived by careful and re
peated measurements      of the cardiac apertures in different animals.
   The    measurements    are   individual,   and not mean,         and therefore less
liable to error.

   From  these facts we may    fairly conclude that in the healthy human heart,
and  most probably    in  the hearts of most animals, the areas of the four
apertures bear an exact mathematical relationship to each other, and con
sequently that if the areas of any three of the openings be known, the area
of the fourth orifice can be correctly calculated.
   I need scarcely dwell upon the importance of            a knowledge of this law in
estimating  the amount    of  contraction  or   dilatation    of orifice which a morbid
specimen may present.        I will, however, now show from my own measure*

  The calculated      and observed results differ so              little from       each other,    that
this case evidently strongly corroborates the correctness of the law                         which I
believe regulates the relative magnitude of the areas of the four                             cardiac
openings.
  If, moreover, we scrutinize             the     measurements, we shall                 observe an
equally important fact, that the ratio of the areas of any two corresponding
orifices is almost constant in the same, and,                      I
                                                     may almost add, in

  Thus the     areaof the tricuspid   nearly -3 times the area of the mitral
                                           is             1
orifice, and the area of the pulmonic of course bears the same proportion
to that of the aortic opening.     By measuring, therefore, the two orifices                         of
the right (supposed healthy), we are enabled by this law to deduce                                 ap
proximately the magnitude of the areas of those of the left heart, and
vice versd.   One healthy orifice being known, the area of the corresponding
opening   in the other side of the heart can be approximately calculated                            ;

pertrophy and dilatation of the right ventricle.              The increase in the area
of the pulmonic aperture was the direct result of this condition of the right
side of the heart.       The tricuspid was also probably somewhat dilated, as
the "valves looked insufficient to fill the widened orifice," and the jugular
veins appeared during life to be swollen and pulsatory ; but the absolute
size of the tricuspid shows that the dilatation was not excessive.                       The
area of the aortic opening appears to be below the mean amount.                         Was

  this the result of the small supply of blood which the left ventricle reeehen
 and impelled into the general system?         In any case a knowledge of the
 existence of this law enables us      to read  the measurements of the orifices
 and their respective ratios with increased interest.
    It would be interesting to pursue the application of this law in the stony
of the various forms of valvular disease.       I  purpose, however, to return to
this subject at the end of this paper, and shall seek now to trace oat the
reasons why the four orifices present such differences in the magnitude of
their areas.
    And as the foundations of our arguments we must admit the truth of the
 two following propositions : —
    1st. That the ventricles and auricles act exactly synchronously respec
tively; and 2ndly, that equal volumes of blood pass in exactly equal and
the same times respectively through any two corresponding           orifices of    the
healthy heart.
    1.  "If we  examine," says M. Marey " the lines traced by the right and
left ventricles, we find a most perfect synchronism in the respective com
mencements and terminations of their contraction."
    " The   examination also of a heart exposed during life confirms the
deduction ; for if we grasp the auricles or the ventricles, we cannot detect
the smallest interval between the contractions of parallel cavities."
    Again. Stethoscopic examination of the heart demonstrates the existence
of only, one first sound and of only one second sound, although the causa
producing each of those sounds are twofold, inasmuch as they really reside
in two (right and left hearts), placed in close and intimate apposition to
one another.      Under rare circumstances the sound which results from the
closure of the semilunar valves has been found reduplicated ; but although
such an event may occur from the non- synchronous fall of the valves, it is
clear that an unimpeded and uninterrupted circulation could not be main
tained unless the two sides of the heart, or really the two hearts, contracted
and dilated exactly synchronously.        Whether the organ acts violently or
feebly, with regularity or intermittently, the auscultator detects but two
sounds ; and even when its valves are disensed, its orifices irremediablj
altered in diameter, and its muscular walls hypertrophied or atrophied, we
find the same law of syuchronism presiding over the heart and its            sounds,
normal or abnormal.
    Lastly. An examination by dissection        of the fibres which   compose      the
walls of the ventricles, conclusively proves     that these chambers must      inevi
tably act exactly synchronously.        In Dr.   Pettigrew's masterly    account of
the arrangement of the muscular fibres in        the ventricles of vertebrate     ani
mals, we find the following remarks made upon this point           :—
                                                                      " The    fibres
of the right and left ventricles anteriorly and septally are to a certain extent
independent of each other ; whereas posteriorly many of them are common
to both ventricles ; i. e. the fibres pass from the one ventricle to the other."
The drawings     49 and 50 in the memoir clearly prove how         " the   common

fibres pass from the left to the right ventricle and dip in or hend at the
track of the anterior coronary artery to become continuous with fibres
having a similar direction in the septum "*.
  2.     In the next place, it must              be admitted that equal volumes                          of blood
pass  in exactly equal and the same times through any two corresponding
orifices of the heart ; for               if,
                              for example, we could suppose the quantity
thrown out through the pulmonic orifice into the lungs to be persistently
greater than the amount thrown out in the same time through the aortic
opening into the general circulation,    would inevitably follow that over
                                                           it
whelming pulmonary engorgement, cessation of flow from the right heart,
and death would rapidly ensue.    The alternative supposition of the right
ventricle persistently discharging into the lung-capillaries an amount of

hearts much diseased                in their orifices and valvular apparatus                             are often
 enabled to carry on      tolerably unembarrassed circulation, and with but

         Equal or almost equal volumes of blood expelled in systole,
   (3) Equal or almost equal capacities of ventricles,
are the main characteristics of a heart which is normal in structure                  and
perfect in function.
  (1) In employing the words equal times with reference                  to the   periods
respectively occupied by the contraction and dilatation of the ventricles, I
would wish to refer for a moment to the statements made by our leading
authorities as to the average duration of the systole and diastole of the
healthy heart.
  Dr. Carpenter     states that the ventricular      contraction
                                                           occupies § and the
ventricular dilatation  | of the time which elapses between two consecutive
beats of the pulse. Dr. Walshe informs us that the time from the commence
ment of the first to the beginning of the second sound is, on an average, one
half of the time from pulse to pulse. Dr. Burdon Sanderson, in bis Hand
book of the Sphygmograph, says, " There are several facts not difficult of ob
servation which show that the time occupied by the heart in contracting
is very much shorter than is commonly supposed. The first sound being
synchronous with the commencement of the contraction of the ventricles
and the closure of the mitral valve, and the second with the closure of the
aortic valves, it is clear that the interval between these two events expresses
the duration of the contraction of the heart.      Now the most unpractised
auscultator can readily satisfy himself, while listening to the sounds of a
heart contracting sixty times in a minute, that the time between the first
and second sounds is not equal to that which separates the second from
the first ; and that it cannot be admitted for a moment (as stated in our
leading physiological text books) that a heart occupies half of a second in
contracting."
  This statement is borne out in the last edition of Kirkes's ' Physiology,
edited by Morraut Baker, in which the periods of ventricular contraction
and dilatation are considered to be in the ratio of 4 to 7.  Chanveau's ex
periments on the living horse and the sphygmographic tracings of the
radial pulse in man, clearly indicate that the times of ventricular contraction
and dilatation are very different in duration ; and the inferences which a«
deducible from the study of the comparative areas of the four orifices will
fully substantiate the statement that the systole of the ventricles "is a
much shorter proceeding than is usually supposed."
                                          "
   (2) And again, with regard to the words equal volumes of                blood"    used
above,    I
          need scarcely remark that the same volume (quantity,                    ounces,
cubic inches) of blood is not persistently and at all times received by and
thrown out of the heart at every complete revolution of the organ. Tut
Teverse    in fact, nearer the truth for the ventricles (though
              is,                      ;                              course   of

 the recumbent posture, the flow of blood through the heart ia entirely and
 solely under the control of the heart itself (some allowance being made for
the effects of the respiratory movements which " act on the whole advan
tageously to the circulation "), the right being filled by the contractile
energy of the left side of the organ. In our waking moments, however,
during exertion, every movement of the body tends to force the blood in
the veins in an onward course towards the right chambers of the heart,
which would become gorged from over-distension did not the healthy right
ventricle assume corresponding energy and force and expel the blood with
increased rapidity into the capillaries of the lungs. An increase in the
number   and depth of   the respiratory movements ensues, accelerating the
passage     of the blood through the lungs to the left    side   of the heart, which,
by an instinctively increased reaction upon its contents, propels the blood
forcibly into the systemic circulation.  The so-called vital capillary force
or interaction between blood and tissue may assist in forwarding the current,
but its amount is evidently excessively small in comparison with the enor
mous contractile energy of the two ventricles. Violent and sudden exertion
may for a short time disturb the balance between the two hearts (the cavae
and right auricle in one side, and the pulmonary vessels and left auricle in
the other side being, for a time, the safety reservoirs or receptacula of the
blood waiting to be forwarded) ; but with bodily rest equilibrium becomes
rapidly reestablished, and equal volumes of blood are again poured forth
in equal and the same times from the two ventricles of the heart.
   Returning from this digression to the immediate subject of this pnper,
we have to consider the cause of the differences in the areas of the four
principal orifices of the heart.
   The right and left sides of that organ are, to all intents and purposes,
two distinct and perfect hearts, discharging individually their own proper
functions, but associated in one common interest by certain bands of mus
cular fibres and intercommunicating nerve-ganglia.       Now if these two
hearts had exactly equal tasks to perform and were simply designed to pro
pel the contents of their ventricles to equal distances and with equal velo
cities,   if,   in
              word, they had been intended to overcome equal obstacles
                     a
in the pulmonic and systemic circulations respectively, their walls would
have been undoubtedly constructed of equal thickness, and the corresponding
orifices of the two sides would have been of equal areas, the tricuspid being
equal to the mitral and the pulmonic to the aortic aperture.      But as the
left ventricle has to propel the blood to far greater distances, and to over
come obstacles much greater than those found in the pulmonic circulation,
the velocity and force of the stream sent from the left must be evidently
greater than the velocity and force of the blood thrown out by the right
ventricle.  To secure this result,  Ineed scarcely say that the left ren      is
dered considerably thicker and stronger than the right ventricle by the
greater development of its walls  but here we must bear in mind the car
                                   ;

and force of the streams issuing from the two ventricles, the quantities of
blood expelled by the synchronous contraction of the two chambers must
be exactly the same, or else accumulation         in the pulmonic or systemic sys
tems would ensue, and the machine be brought to a standstill.
     As, therefore, the two ventricles contracting with unequal force* have to
expel equal quantities of blood in equal and the same time to unequal dis
tances and to overcome unequal resistances, the perfect synchronism of
the ventricular contractions can be only obtained by an exact graduation of
the areas of the orifices of the aortic and pulmonary artery to the muscular
 forces respectively impressed upon the contents of the two ventricles in
 systole, and consequently to the velocities of the streams issuing from those
 chambers. The area of the aortic must be therefore smaller than the area
 of the pulmonic, and in such proportion that the normal average contents
 (say, three ounces) of the left ventricle shall occupy exactly the same time
 in passing through the aortic as is required by the three ounces of the
 right ventricle in passing through the pulmonic opening. The greater
 muscular power of the left, as compared with that of the right ventricle,
 causes a corresponding greater velocity and force of the column of blood
 issuing from its outlet, while the smaller area of the aortic, as compared
 with that of the pulmonic opening, exactly equalizes the times occupied by
  the contractions of the two chambers.         Without such an arrangement in
  the comparative areas of the two outlets, it is clear that the stronger left
  would completely empty itself before the right ventricle had accomplished
  the same function, and the synchronous action of the two hearts would
  be thus rendered impossible.         Equal quantities of blood are, however, in
  the way described, made to pass exactly synchronously through the aortic
  and pulmonic openings, but with, of course, unequal velocities, the blood-
  particles which traverse the narrow aortic travelling with greater speed than
  those which     pass  through the larger pulmonic orifice.          Mathematically
  expressed, the velocities of the streams through the orifices are inversely as

mitral current, will necessitate the area of the tricuspid being proportion

i. e. the velocities     of the currents of blood in diastole through the tri
cuspid and mitral orifices are in the ratio of 5 to 7.
   It may be fairly asked what proofs can be given that the velocities of
the currents of blood which traverse the tricuspid and mitral orifices are
unequal, and that the mitral incoming stream possesses a stronger ventri
cular dilating power than the current which enters the tricuspid to expand
and fill the right ventricle.      I shall refer to this point shortly ; but what
ever may be the value of the reasons which will be adduced in support of
the above view, there can be no doubt, infact, that the two orifices in
healthy hearts always differ in size, and the synchronous expansion of ven
tricles with unequal inlets must inevitably lead to this result — that the
larger must admit a current of correspondingly smaller velocity than that
which traverses the smaller opening ; or, mathematically expressed, the,
velocities of the incoming tricuspid and mitral streams must be inversely as
the areas of the orifices.
    From the       data  at which   we have arrived, and estimating the mean
amount of the ventricular        contents at three ounces (or five cubic inches,
nearly),    although     it must be confessed that this is an uncertain esti
mate,    we may       readily calculate the average velocities of the currents
which traverse the four orifices.         We shall consider the pulse to beat at
the rate of 70 per minute, and the periods of ventricular contraction and
dilatation to be in the ratio of     1  to 2, t. e. the ventricular    contraction oc
cupying one-third of the time between two pulses             ; i. e.

  The mean velocities of the currents of blood traversing a healthy                                  heart,
with the dimensions of the areas as given above, are as follows : —

   In such       a heart we see, therefore, that the blood enters                             the tricuspid
orifice at the rate of nearly | mile per hour, and leaves it through the
aortic orifice at the rate of nearly 1| mile per hour; and that the ve
locity, therefore, of the tricuspid incoming current is only one-fifth of
the velocity of the stream which passes through the aortic orifice.
   Without entering into arithmetical details, such a result as the above
is easily arrived at when we bear in mind the facts that the same quan
tity of blood passes through the two openings, but that while the tri
cuspid     is,
             according to Dr. Peacock, 2\, and according to Dr. Reid
 nearly three    times larger than the aortic orifice, the flow of the three
 ounces    through the former occupies nearly twice the time required                                     by

  the passage      of the same quantity of blood through the latter opening. The
  tricuspid     is  nearly three times larger than the aortic aperture, and is
  open for the transmission of the same volume of blood more than double
 the length      of time occupied by the latter opening.            Hence the comparative
 slowness     of the incoming tricuspid current.
     These     speculations upon the absolute and relative velocities of the
 currents of blood through the heart are not without practical value, in
 asmuch as       they have a direct bearing upon the question of the amount
 of pressure exerted by that fluid in each chamber of the organ, and are
 links in the chain of reasoning respecting the comparative areas of the
 four orifices.        The first-recorded       experiments to determine this pressure
 were made by Dr.           Stephen     Hales,   F.R.S., and were published by him in
       '                     ' in
 his Statical Essays               1 732.    Thus, when tubes were fixed into the cru
 ral artery and jugular vein of different animals, the heights to which the
 blood rose were found to be as follows : —
                                                      Artery.        Vein.

    These experiments           were,   of  course,  rather roughly made and without
modern appliances ; but they serve to show that the pressure of the blood
in the jugular vein is only one-ninth to one-fourteenth of the pressure observed
in the arterial side       of the circulation.       Valentin, by means of the hsemady-
namometer, estimated the pressure in the jugular vein to be one-tenth to one-
twelfth of the pressure in the carotid artery, and "in the upper part of the
inferior      vena     cava could scarcely detect the existence of any pressure,
nearly the      whole force from the heart having been apparently consumed
during the passage of the blood through the capillaries" (Kirkes and
Paget).
     It  is thus sufficiently       clear,  experimentally, that the velocity and mo
mentum        of the blood which        enters  the right auricle and finds its way into
 the right ventricle must be very small in comparison with the rapidity and
momentum of the current issuing from the left ventricle ; and we can
 therefore,      from this fact, understand that the tricuspid is constructed of
much greater area than the aortic opening,                 in order that its much larger
 orifice may compensate           for the comparatively sluggish stream which it has
to transmit.          It is evident enough why the blood which has returned to
 the right heart possesses so small an amount of velocity and momentum.
 In its passage through the systemic circulation it has encountered and
 overcome an amount             of obstruction which, by the time it has arrived in
 the    right auricle, has deprived it of the greater portion of the velocity and
 momentum which it had derived from the contractile energy of the left
 ventricle,      assisted,   as that    power has been, by the muscular pressure on
 the veins     of the body.        The columns of blood from the superior and infe

rior     venee    cavee     enter the auricle, therefore, slowly, and with small force,
but with an amount               of velocity and momentum exactly adapted to and suf
ficient for the expansion of the right ventricle. It cannot be for one mo
ment maintained that the right is weaker than the left heart in proportion
to the work to be done by the respective sides, for each organ is exactly
adapted to the task which it has to perform, and the perfection of the me
chanism is as manifest in one as in the other side of the heart. The right
side is undoubtedly exposed to sudden and great variations in the amount
of blood-pressure             to which        it is from time to time subjected             ;   but      there
can be no reason   for believing that provision has not been made                                   for such
variations within due limits.    In fact daily experience shows us                                  how the
right side will maintain its vigour unimpaired, although severely and often
tried by the alterations in the blood-pressure resulting from rapid walking,
running, pulling at the oar, and the usual athletic exercises. The slowness
of   the current which returns to the right side, the large area of the                                       tri
cuspid orifice, and the comparatively long period of time during which the
ventricle    open to receive its contents, evidently confirm the view that

the right ventricle offers but little resistance to the incoming current, and

completing  the closure of the tricuspid  valve in  the manner   described                                     by
Baumgartner, Valentin, and Halford.      It must be also borne in mind that
the particles of the blood-stream which have entered the tricuspid orifice
in   direction nearly at right angles to the axis of the pulmonary artery
     a
must, when the ventricle has become filled, change their direction of motion
to find their way in systole out of the ventricle.   At the end, therefore,
of  the diastole imagine that the
                        I          whole  of the   contents of the ventricle
is at rest (momentarily, but not less really so), and ready to take npi
new movement in      course nearly at right angles to its line of entrance
                               a
from the auricle.  If this view, which has escaped the attention phy                                  of
siologists, be correct, we observe an additional reason for the blood which
enters the ventricle possessing an amount of velocity and energy just
sufficient, and no more, to complete the dilatation of the chamber,                                        and
having performed its task, to assume for      moment an attitude a                                       of   re

interesting to observe that this interlacement is most dense near the apex,
-where the incoming current impinges with greatest force, and where the
excess of momentum of the blood can be easier annihilated before it
changes   its direction of motion to escape in systole from the chamber. The
remarks which belong to the right are equally applicable to the left ven
tricle, and lead to the conclusion that the current entering through the
mitral orifice, as soon as the chamber is filled, loses its motion for a mo
ment before the contractile force of the ventricle launches it forth in a
totally different direction through the aortic opening into the systemic cir
culation.
   I will now return to the statement which I had left unproved, that the
velocities of the synchronous tricuspid and mitral currents are unequal, and
that the latter possesses a stronger ventricle-dilating power than the former.
   The argument to establish this point is very brief.
   The two ventricles being of unequal thickness and containing conse
quently unequal quantities and weights of muscular fibre, will necessarily
require currents of blood of unequal momenta to overcome their respec
tive inertia, fill their chambers, and complete their dilatation in exactly
equal and the same times.         That       is,
   the momentum of the mitral           is   greater than the momentum of the tri
        cuspid current    ;
or, in other words,
   the volume of the mitral column multiplied                by
                                                 its velocity t« greater than

but the volume of each current w the same                   ;   hence,   eliminating   volume
from each side of the above,  evident that
                                  it   is
   the velocity of the mitral     greater than the velocity of the tricuspid
                                       is
       current, the conclusion which was to be demonstrated*.

 would have been more correct, inasmuch as the latter expression represents the mass of
 a body in motion multiplied by the square of its velocity.  In this case, therefore, whilo
 the velocities of the tricuspid and mitral moving   masses of blood are in the ratio of         5

 above, but shows the greatness of the disparity between the ventricle-dilating powers       of
 the two incoming currents.

   The tricuspid is evidently abnormally large in relation to                           the mitral
orifice.
   If            the other three orifices to he nearly normal (and it is
        we suppose
evident that the pulmonic and aortic bear their normal relation to one
another), we can calculate the excess of dilatation exhibited by the                              tri

        Received February 19, 1870.
   In the attempts that have been hitherto made to estimate the ammonia
present in atmospheric air, the results arrived at by the various experi
menters have differed so widely that     still matter of uncertainty *hat
                                                      it   is         a
the quantity really is. That         very small amount all agree, but the
                                           it   is   a
extreme results on record vary as much as from 13*5 to "01 part       car                    of
bonate of ammonium per 100,000 of air. It may therefore not be without
interest to give an account of       simple method affording very concordant
                                           a
and,I   believe, accurate results, at the same time being easy of performance
and requiring but little time for an experiment.
   The apparatus used consists of two glass tubes, each of about         metre               1

  1870.]             Estimation      of Ammonia in      Atmospheric    Air.               287
  in length and 12 millims. bore.           These are connected air-tight by means of
  a   smaller glass tube, and inclined          at an angle of 5° or 6° with the hori
  zon.      Into each of the larger tubes are introduced 100 cub. centims. of
 a  mixture of perfectly pure water and two drops of dilute sulphuric acid
 (sp. gr. 1*18).        Through this acidulated water a measured quantity of the
 air under      examination is slowly drawn, in small bubbles, by means of an
 aspirator.
     No porous       substance must be used to filter the air, for reasons to be
 stated hereafter.          The air is conducted into the absorption liquid through
 a  small piece     of quill tubing drawn out to a small aperture at the end im
 mersed.       This tube must be kept quite dry throughout the experiment.
 Great care must be taken to cleanse perfectly every part of the apparatus
 with water free from ammonia, and the caoutchouc plugs, or corks, used
 must be boiled for a short time in a dilute solution of caustic soda.
     The stream of air is so regulated as to allow about 1 litre to pass through
 the apparatus in an hour.
     By directing the point of the delivery-tube laterally, each bubble has im
 parted to it on rising an oscillatory movement which facilitates complete
 absorption of the ammonia.
     When from 10 to 20 litres of air have passed, the liquid is emptied from
 the tubes into upright glass cylinders, an excess of a perfectly pure solution of
 potash added, and then 3 cub. centims. of a Nessler solution.                  The standard
 of comparison is made in the ordinary way, only using acidulated in place of
 pure water,     and neutralizing with potash after adding the standard solution
 of ammonium          salt.    Beyond somewhat retarding the point of maximum
 coloration, a little potassium sulphate does not interfere with the delicacy
of Nessler" s reaction.
     If the   experiment has been conducted with proper care, at least £ of the
total ammonia         ought to be found in the first tube. Four or five litres of air
are    generally quite sufficient to give a decided reaction, bnt it is better to
use not less       than   10  litres, as before mentioned*.
     Very     many experiments have been made by this method, both on air
from the town of Burton-on-Trent, and that of the adjoining country.
The air from the town, as might be expected, varies somewhat in composi
tion    ;  much more so than that taken from the open country, as may be
seen      from the following Tables, in which are given some of the numerous
results obtained.
    The ammonia is calculated in every case as carbonate
                                                                           ((NH4)2 C03) ;
for although nitric acid is sometimes found in air, yet its presence must
be looked upon as accidental.
    * When the air to be examined       is highly charged with ammonia, as that from stables
Ac,    a perfectly  dry bottle of 3 or 4 litres capacity should be carefully filled with a pair
of bellowB, 100 cub. centims. of acidulated water introduced, and, after closing securely,
the whole well agitated at intervals for three or four hours.      The liquid is then poured
out, and the NH3 estimated by the Nessler solution as usual.

    The direction of     the wind does     not seem to have any influence on the
ammonia found ; immediately after heavy rain, however, the quantity fills
somewhat below the average, but the air is again restored to its normal
condition after a lapse of two or three hours.
    Attempts were made to make the method more delicate still by absorbing
the ammonia in pure water and then distilling, but the nitrogenous organic
matter suspended in the air was found to interfere with the results.
   When the air is passed through cotton-wool before entering the absorp
tion-tubes, it is found to be entirely deprived of its ammonia by the filter.
This is also the case with air artificially charged with ammonia to a Itrgt
extent.     This absorption is not due to the presence of hygroscopic mois
ture, since cottou-wool, when absolutely dry, is capable of taking up ll-1
times   its own bulk of dry ammonia (confined over mercury) at 103-5C.
and 755-7 millims. barom., the gas being again slowly evolved when the
wool is left in contact with the air at 100° C.
   All other porous substances that were tried for filtering agents were
found to possess this property more or less ; even freshly ignited pumice-
stone is not entirely without absorptive effect upon the gas.

     The greatest depth from which Madreporaria were dredged was                     706

     II.    Caryophyllia borealis, Fleming. — Having collected a veryconsiderable
series of the Caryophyllia from the seas around Great Britain, and having
been supplied with several specimens of the Mediterranean species, I had
some time ago compared the whole with the fossil forms from the Sicilian
                                                                          z  2

  292                       Dr. P. Martia Duncan       on the            [Mar. 24,
 tertiary deposits    and with each other.     The numerous    specimens of Caryo
 phyllia dredged up in Dingle Bay           were especially interesting after I had
  arrived at satisfactory conclusions respecting the affinities of the abore-
  mentioned British and Southern-European            forms.    The Dingle-Bay col
  lection presented all the varieties of shapes (some of which had been
  deemed of specific value) which       I had observed in the separate assemblages
  of specimens from the Mediterranean, the Sicilian tertiaries, and the British
  and Scottish seas.
     A   perfect series of specimens from all these localities can be so arranged
  as to show a gradual structural transition from form to form ; so that the
  most diversely shaped Caryophyllia can be linked together by inter
  mediate shapes.       The Caryophyllia clavus and Caryophyllia cyathut can
  be united by intermediate forms, and all of these to Caryophyllia Smtkii
 and Caryophyllia borealis.
     It is impossible to determine which is the oldest form ; but they all appear
 to be reproduced by variation on some part of the area tenanted by the sec
 tion of the genus. The variability of the Caryophyllia of the Sicilian tertiary
 deposits is very marked ; and it is equally so in the groups which live on
 disconnected spots in our waters.           The Dingle-Bay series presents the
  greatest   amount   of variability, and indeed is most instructive; for by apply
 ing the range of it to the classification of such genera as Trochocyathv* and
 Montlivaltia a great absorption of species must ensue.
     The Dingle-Bay Caryophyllia are evidently the descendants of those
 which lived in the Western and Southern-European seas before those great
 terrestrial elevations took place which were connected with the correspond
 ing subsidence of the circumpolar land and the subsequent emigration of
 Arctic mollusca. They are not closely allied to the recent West-Indian
 species ; but they occupy a position in the Coral-fauna representative of
 them.      The same remark holds good with reference to the affinities of the
 recent and the cretaceous Caryophyllia.           They are not closely allied, and
 they belong to different sections of the genus ; but they hold the same
 positions in the economy of the old and new distribution of animal life, and
 the recent forms are representative of the older.        The examination of the
Dingle-Bay Caryophyllia tends to prove that a species is really the snm of
the variations of a series of forms.
    A   specimen   was   dredged up in 705 fathoms, temp. 42°-65 F., and it
 exactly resembles forms which are frequently found in 90 fathoms, and at »
temperature slightly below that of the surface. M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards
obtained some Caryophyllia from the cable between Corsica and Algiers
in 1 1 10-1550 fathoms. The bathymetrical range of these forms is there
fore very great.       I have placed the species borealis in the first place, and
regard the old species C. clavus, C. Smithii, and C. cyathus as varieties
of it.
    Ceratocyathus ornatus, Seguenza. — A beautiful specimen of this rare
form was dredged up from a depth of 705 fathoms with some CaryophyVie

  and a small Isis.        The    species    is hitherto unknown       except in the Sicilian
  miocene*.
      Flabellum laciniatum, Ed. &           II. —This   is the Ulocyaihus arcticus of the
 late Prof. Sars.       Many specimens were dredged up ; but most of them were
  broken, in consequence of the extreme fragility and delicacy of the thecn.
 There     are no pali j   therefore Sars-s terminology is not in accordance with the
  received system. The form was familiar to me from Seguenza-s drawing
  of a dilapidated Flabellum (which is always found broken*) ; and it is now
 evident that Ulocyathus must give place to Flabellum.                     The species links
  Flabellum to Desmophyllum            :   it  is not known   in the  recent Mediterranean
 fauna.
      Lophohelia prolifera, Pallas, sp., is apparently a common coral in the
 north-western British seas.

 and also at      a depth of from 350 to 600 fathoms in the cold area to the
 north-west.
     All the specimens show great density of the calcareous skeleton ; and
 active nutrition may be inferred on account of the repeated gemmation, the
 large size of the calices, and the numerical development of the septa.                 Great
 variability    occurs   in  the   coralliles    forming  a stem   ; and   the shape   of the
 calices is very diverse.
     It is very interesting to find some specimens bearing elongate and
 more or less claviform corallites with the peculiar gemmation of Lophohelia
 anthophyllites, Ellis and Solander, on some portions of their stem, and the
 usual-shaped corallites of Lophohelia prolifera on others.
    A separate corallum, which must be referred to Lophohelia                          antho
phyllites, Ellis and Solander, was dredged up at No. 54.
    The variation of the gemmules of several specimens is sufficiently great
to absorb Lophohelia subcostata, Ed. & Haime ; for fragments of the
corallum of Lophohelia prolifera exist which possess all its so-callce'
specific peculiarities.
    A careful examination of Lophohelia Defrancei, Defrance, sp., from the
Messinese Pliocene and Miocene deposits, and a comparison of its struc
ture with the numerous specimens dredged up in the ' Porcupine Expedi

    The   sameidentity must be asserted for Lopkohelia offinii, Fourtaks,
which, was dredged up in 195 fathoms off Coffin's Patches, Florida.
  Lopkohelia prolifera exists in the Mediterranean Sea and the sea between
Scotland and Norway.
  Lophohelia anthophyllites is an East-Indian form ; but its absorption into
Lopkohelia prolifera suggests explanations concerning the Cainozoic pro
genitor, and how it migrated eastwards.
  The relation of the recent Easl-Iudian Coral-faunas to                        those of    the
European and West-Indian Cainozoic deposits lias been                            noticed    and
admitted for some years past.
  The Cainozoic Lophohelia of Sicily is the earliest form of the genus ; and
those which are found in such remote parts of the world as the East Indie-,
the Florida coast, the Norwegian coast, and the Mediterranean, and which
have been determined to belong to different species, are, from the study                         of
the curious assemblage of variable forms now under consideration,                     evidently
varieties of the old type, Lophohelia prolifera.            I
                                                  have therefore                      absorbed
the old species    L.   anthophyllites,   L.   subcostata,      L.   ajftnis,   L.   Defrmcti,
and L, gracilis.
   Two genera of the Oculinidce in the classification of MM. Milne-Edwards
and Jules Haime have always been most difficult to distinguish ; and no*
the results of the dredging off the north of Scotland and off Florida and
the Havana necessitate the absorption of one of them.
   Amphihelia and Diplohelia. — The first containing recent species onlj at
the time of the enunciation of the classification just referred to, and the
last having fossil species only, were very likely to be considered separate
genera.    Diplohelia had species in the Eocene and in the Caiuozoic
seas.  Amphihelia was known to have species in the Mediterranean fauna,
and in that of Australia also. Seguenza, however, described some Jmpki-
helim and Diplohelia from the Sicilian tertiary deposits which were                        iden
tical so far as generic attributes are considered, the only distinction                    being
a doubtful raggedness of the septal edges. The habit and the method of
growth and gemmation of the forms were the same.       M. de Pourtalis
dredged up a branching form from off the Havana in 350 fathoms, and
from off Bahia Honde, near Florida, in 324 fathoms, and also in kt.2)>:
24' N.,long. 79° 13' W., in 1050 fathoms (came up with the lead). This
he named Diplohelia profunda.         On referring to Seguenxa's plates and
descriptions* of the fossil corals from the Sicilian Tertiary deposits, there
is no difficulty in deciding upon the very close affinity of the species de
scribed by Pourtales and Diplohelia Meneghiniana, Seg., and Diploheiie
Doderleiniana, Seg., fossil forms from the mid-tertiary deposits.
    But   on comparing these forms     with    one exquisitely figured by Seguenu,
and which he calls Amphihelia miocenica, Seg., the generic affinities of                      all
become startlingly evident (tab. xii. figs. 16, 1c, 3b 3c, op. cit.).
                                                                  &

 west of that spot in the cold area), at a depth of from 363 to 600 fathoms,
 present singular variations of structure in the buds and calices upon the same
 stems. A comparison between them and the well-known recent and fossil
 Amphihelice, the fossil and recent Diplohelice, and the smaller specimens of
 Lophohelice,     leads    to the belief that  Amphihelia    is identical genetically
 with Diplohelia, and very closely allied         to  Lophohelia.    Indeed the di
 stinction between the Lophohelice and Amphihelice is of the slightest kind.
    The species of the genus Amphihelia dredged up in the ' Porcupine -
 Expedition     are five   : —
        1.  Amphihelia (Diplohelia)      profunda, Pourlales, sp.
        2. —  —    oculata, Linnceus, sp.
        3.         miocenica, Seguenza.
        4.         atlantica, nobis.
        5.         ornata, nobis.
    The species came from No. 54 dredging, and from the cold area to the
north-west in from 500 to 600 fathoms.
    The    specimens     are exceedingly beautiful, strong, and perfect   ; and there
was much difficulty experienced in removing the polypes from the calices.
     1. Amphihelia profunda, Pourtales, sp., has been noticed.          It is a West-
Indian form closely allied to a Sicilian miocene species.
    2. Amphihelia oculata, Linnceus, sp., is well known in the Mediterranean,
and has not hitherto been found in the Atlantic.
    3. Amphihelia miocenica, Seguenza, is a very common species in the
 deep sea, but is rare in the miocene deposits of Sicily, Its fully developed
costal structures distinguish it from the other forms.
    4. Amphihelia        atlantica, nobis, is a new species, large, bushy, and
with almost plain        coenenchyma, which is very abundant.
    5. Amphihelia        ornata, nobis, is a new species closely allied to the mio
cene form, but its ornamentation          is most peculiar, and not continuously
 costulate.
    Allopora oculina, Ehrenberg. — Several specimens of this very rare coral
were dredged up in No. 54, and one in the ' Lightning Expedition, not
                                                                   -
far from the same spot.
    The type is in the Berlin Museum            ;   the locality whence it came is
unknown.
    The distinction between         these massive and densely hard corals (whose
calices are principally       on one side of the coenenchyma of the stem) and the
Stylastershs very evident.
    M. de Pourtales has described a pretty red-coloured Allopora miniata
dredged in 100 to 324 fathoms off the Florida reef; but it is very distinct
from the species discovered in the late deep-sea dredging expeditions.
    Allopora has no fossil representatives.

    Pliobothrus symmetricvs, Pourtales. — A      specimen   of this doubtful coral
(which had been described by M. de Pourtales from the results of dredging
in from 100 to 200 fathoms) was sent to me by Dr. Carpenter.               It came
from the cold area, in from 500 to 600 fathoms.
    There is no doubt that this very polyzoic-looking        mass belongs to the
American type.        The tabuloe are hardly worthy to be called such ; and I
place the form amongst the Zoantharia provisionally.
    III.   The species of Madreporaria belong to genera which do not contri
bute and have not contributed to form coral-reef faunas.             None of them
are reef-builders ; but all are essentially formed to live where rapid growth
and delicately cellular structures are not required.        The forms are strong,
solid, and large ; and their rapid and repeated gemmation proves that their
 nutritive processes went on actively and continuously.
    All the species are very much disposed to produce variations ; and this is
 especially true as regards those which have outlived the long age of the
Crag, the glacial period, and the subsequent time of elevations and subsi
dences.      The least-variable species are those which are not known on
other areas.
    Two of the three species which are common to the West-Indian deep-sea
fauna and that of our north-western coasts are also very variable.
    The persistence of Madreporaria from the earlier Cainozoic period to
the present time has been an established fact for several years. Some of
the forms which are common to the deep sea of the British area and to the
 so-called miocene of Sicily are still existing in the Mediterranean.        None,
however, of the species of Corals found in the British Crag are represented
 in the deep-sea fauna.
    The existence of Mediterranean forms in the North-west British area is
in keeping with the discoveries of Forbes.            It has, however, a double
 significance, and bears upon the presence of West-Indian forms on the
 North-west British marine area.       There was a community of species be
 tween the Mediterranean and the West Indies in the Cainozoic period,
 especially of Echinodermata, Mollusca, Madreporaria, and Foraminifera.
 After the great alterations of the mutual relations of land and sea which
 took place before the cold affected the fauna of the Franco-Italian seas,
 this community of species diminished ; but it lasted through all the period
 of Northern glacialization, and is proved still to exist slightly by com
 paring the   Alga, the Corals, the Echinodermata, and the Mollusca.
    The   presence   of two very characteristic Floridau  species, and one less so,
 off the north of Scotland, is particularly interesting, because they all live
 in the cold area and flourish there, whilst they appear to be less vigorous
 in the warmer Gulf-stream near Florida.
    It is impossible to fail to recognize the operation of this stream in
 producing the emigration of these three species, which are essentially
 American.

appear to be greater than elsewhere.     Depth has not much effect upon
the nutrition of the Madreporaria ; for those dredged up at 600 fathoms
are quite as hard and solid as those found at 300 fathoms.
     All the    calices were stuffed with small Foramiuifcra,        and there was evi
dently a great abundance        of food.
  There were numerous Polyzoa, Sponges, Foraminifera, Diatomacese, and
delicate bivalves associated with or fixed upon the corals at all depths.
Moreover, at from 300 to 400 fathoms, some Amphihelia had incrusted
an   Annelid.
   Serpula, moreover, abound upon the corals j and a pretty Isti was asso
ciated with them at a depth of 705 fathoms.      This is a fauna which, if
covered up and presented to the paleeontologist, would be, and would have
been for some years past, considered           a deep-sea one.
    It is a fnuna which indicates the existence of the same processes of nu
trition and of destructive assimilation and reproduction which are recognized
in association with corresponding forms at less depths and in higher tem
peratures.
   The great lesson which it reads    that vital processes can go on in cer
                                         is,
tain animals at prodigious depths, and in much cold, quite as well as in less
depths and in considerable heat. It suggests that       great number of the
                                                                 a
Invertebrata are not much affected by temperature, and that the supplj of
food   is   the most important matter in their economy.
     The    researches of Hooker, who obtained Polyzoa and Foraminifera
in soundings at    depth of nearly 400 fathoms off the icy barrier of the
                      a
South Pacific, of Wallich in the Atlantic, and of Alphonse Milne- Edwards in
the Mediterranean have had much influence upon geological thought                    in
this age, which, so fur as geologists are concerned, remarkably averse to
                                                                is
theory.   For many years before any very deep soundings had been taken
with the view of searching the sea-bottom for life, geologists had more or
less definite opinions concerning the deposition of organisms in sediments
at great depths.    Certainly more than thirty years ago deep-sea deposits
were    separated by geologists from those which they considered to hare
been formed in shallower seas.     The finely divided sediment of strata con
taining Crinoids,  Brachiopods, Foraminifera,  and simple Madreporaria was
supposed to have been deposited in deeper water than formations containing
large pebbles, stones, and the mollusca whose representatives now live              io
shallows.    The relations of such strata to each other during subsidence,
the first being found occasionally to overlap the last, proved that there
was    adeeper sea-fauna in the offing of the old shores which were
tenanted by littoral and shallow-water species. The deposition of straU
containing Foraminifera, Madreporaria, and Echinodermata, whose lime
stone     remarkably free from any foreign substances, has been consi

deposits in the Laurentian, Silurian, or in any other formation.                   The
" flysch," a great sediment of the Eocene formation, has heen considered
to have been formed at    a great depth and under great pressure. Its singularly
unfossiliferous character was supposed to be due to the absence of life at
the depths of the ocean where the sediment collected.                  But this was a
theory of the early days of geology, when the destructive influence of che
mical processes in strata upon the remains of organisms in them was hardly
admitted.
   The great value of such         researches  as those so ably carried out by
Thomson, Carpenter, and Jeffreys is the definite knowledge they impart to
the geologist, who is theorizing in the right direction, but whose notions
of the depth at which the sediments containing Invertebrata can be depo
sited are indefinite.    These researches contribute to more exact knowledge,
and they will materially assist the development of those hypotheses which
are current amongst advanced geologists into fixed theories.                 I do not
think that any geological theory worthy of the term, and which has origi
nated from geological induction, will bo upset by these careful investiga
tions into the bathymetrical distribution of life and temperature.                 The
theories involving pressure and the intensity of the hardness of deep-sea
deposits will suffer from the researches ; but many difficulties in the way
of the palaeontologist will be removed. The researches tend to explain
the occurrence of a magnificent deep-sea coral-fauna in the Palaeozoic
times in high latitudes, and of Jurassic and Cainozoic faunas on the
same area, and they favour the doctrines of uniformity.                      They ex
plain the cosmopolitan nature of many organisms, past and present, which
were credited with a deep-sea habitat, and they afford the foundations for
a theory upon the world-wide distribution of many forms during every
geological formation.
   It is not advisable,     however, to make too much               of the interesting
identities and resemblances       of some of the deep-sea and abyssal forms
with those of such periods as the Cretaceous, for instance.               In the early
days of geological science there was a favourite theory that at the expira
tion of a period the whole of the life of the globe was destroyed, and
that at the commencement of the succeeding age a new creation took
place.    There were as many destructions and creations as periods ; or, to
use the words of an American geologist, there was a succession of plat
forms.     This theory held back the science, just as the theory that the sun
revolved round the earth retarded the progress of astronomy.                 Moreover
it had that armour of sanctity to protect it which is             so hard to pierce by
the most reasonable opposition.            Nevertheless every now and then a
geologist recognized the same fossils in rocks which belonged to different
periods.    A magnificent essay by Edward Forbes on the Cretaceous Fossils
of Southern India, a wonderful production and far before its age *, gave
hope and confidence to the few palaeontologists who began to assert               that

    periods were perfectly artificial notions — that it did not follow, because
   one set of deposits was forming in one part of the world, others exactly
   corresponding to it elsewhere, so far as the organic remains are concerned,
   were contemporaneous — and that life had progressed on the globe continu
   ously and without a break from the dawn of it to the present time.
      The persistence of some          species  through great vertical ranges of
   strata, and the relation between the world-wide distribution of forms and
   this persistence were noticed by D'Archiac, De Vemeuil, Forbes, and
   others.    The identity of some species in the remote natural-history pro
  vinces   of the existing state of things was established in spite of the dog
  matic opposition of authorities ; and then geologists accepted the theories
  that there were several natural-history provinces during every artificial
  period, that some species lived longer and wandered more than others, and
  that some have lasted even from the Palaeozoic age to the present.
      Persistence of type was the title of a lecture delivered by Professor
  Huxley* many      years ago    ; and this persistence has been admitted by every
 palaeontologist who has had the opportunity of examining large series of
  fossils from every formation from all parts of the world.
      Geological ages are characterized by a number of organisms which are
  not found in others, and by the grouping of numerous species which are
  allied to those of preceding and succeeding times, but which are not iden
  tical.   Certain portions of the world's surface were tenanted by particular
 groups of forms during every geological age ; and there was a similarity of
 arrangement in this grouping under the same external physical conditions.
 To use Huxley's term, the "homotaxis" of certain natural-history pro
 vinces during the successive geological ages has been very exact.                The
 species differed ; but there was a philosophy in the consecutive arrange
 ments of high-land and low-land faunas and floras, and of those of shallow
 seas, deep seas, oceans, and reef-areas.         The oceanic   \ conditions, for in
 stance, can be traced by organic remains from the Laurentian to the present
 time, and the deep-sea corals now under consideration are representative of
 those of older deep seas.
     It is not a matter for surprise, then, that, there being such a thing as
 persistence of type and of species, some very old forms should have lived
 on through the ages whilst their surroundings were changed over and over
 ngain. But this persistence does not indicate that there have not been
sufficient physical and biological changes during its lasting to alter the face
of all things enough to give geologists the right of asserting the succession
of several periods. The occurrence of early Cainozoic Madreporaria in
the deep sea to the north-west of Great Britain only proves that certain
forms of life have persisted during the vast changes in the physical geo
graphy of the world which were initiated by the upheaval of the Alps, the
Himalayas, and large masses of the Andes.             To say that we are therefore

still in the Cainozoic or Cretaceous age would hardly be consistent with the
necessary   terminology of geological science.
   During the end of the Miocene age and the whole of the Pliocene the
Sicilian area was occupied by a deep sea. The distinction between the
faunas of those times and the present becomes less, year after year, as
science progresses     ;   and    it   is evident that a great number    of existing   species
of nearly every class flourished before the occurrence of the great changes
in physical geology which have become the artificial breaks of tertiary
geologists.  That the Cainozoic deep-sea corals should resemble, and in
some instances should be identical in species with, the forms now inhabiting
vast depths, is therefore quite in accordance with the philosophy of modern
geology. Before the deposition of the Cainozoic strata, and whilst the
deep-sea deposits of the Eocene age were collecting in the Franco-British
area, there was a Madreporarian              fauna there which was singularly like unto
that which followed          both as regards the shape of the forms and their
                            it,
genera.     Still earlier, during the slow subsidence of the great Upper Cre
taceous deep-sea area, there was         coral-fauna in the north and west of
                                                a

faunas might be carried still further back in the world's history        but      ;        it
must be enough for my purpose to assert the representative character and the
homotaxis of the Upper Cretaceous, the Tertiary, and the existing deep-
sea coral-faunas.      This character    enhanced by the persistence of types

chemical intensity.       The method of measurement adopted was that de
scribed in n previous communication to the Society*, founded upon the
exact estimation of the tint which standard sensitive paper assumes when
exposed for a given time to the action of daylight.       The experiments wtre
mode as follows    : —
    1.  The chemical action of total daylight    was observed     in the    ordinary
manner.
    2. The chemical action of the diffused daylight was then observed by
throwing on to the exposed paper the shadow of a small blackened brass ball,
placed at such a distance that its apparent diameter, seen from the position
of the paper, was slightly larger than that of the sun's disk.
    3. Observation    No.  1 was repeated.
    4. Observation No. 2 was repeated.
    The means of observations 1 and 3 and of 2 and 4 were then taken. The
sun's altitude was determined by a sextant and artificial hori«jn, im
mediately before and immediately after the observations of chemical                 in
tensity, the altitude at the time of observation being ascertained                   by
interpolation.
    It was first shown that an accidental variation in the position of the brill
ball within limits of distance from the paper, varying from 1 -10 millims. to
 230 millims., was without ony appreciable effect on the results. One of
the 134 sets of observations was made as nearly as possible every hour,            ind
they thus naturally fall into seven groups, viis. ! —
    (1) Six hours from noon, (2) five hours from noon, (3) four honrs            from
 noon, (4) three hours from noon, (5) two hours from noon, (6) one               hour
from noon, (7) noon.
     Each of the first six of these groups contains two separate sets of observa
 tions, — (1) those made before noon, (2) those made after noon. It his
 already been pointed outf, from experiments made at Kew, that the mem
 chemical intensity of total daylight for hours equidistant from noon is the
 same.     The results of the present series of experiments prove that this con
 clusion holds good generally ; and a Table is given showing the close np-
 proximation of the numbers obtained at hours equidistant from noon.
     Curves are given showing the daily march of chemical intensity at
 Lisbon in August, compared with that at Kew for the preceding August,
 and at Paru for the preceding April. The value of the mean chemical
 intensity at Kew is represented by the number 94-5, that at Lisbon by
  110, and that at Para by 313 3, light of the intensity 1 acting for 24 hows
 being taken as 1 000.
     The following Table gives the results of the observations arranged
  according to the sun's altitude.

Curves are given showing the relation between the direct sunlight (column
3) and diffuse daylight (column 4) in terms of the altitude. The curve of
direct sunlight cuts the hase line at 10°, showing that the conclusion formerly
arrived at by one of the authors is correct, and that at altitudes below 10°
the direct sunlight is robbed of almost all its chemically active rays.           The
relation between the total chemical intensity and the solar altitude is shown
to be represented graphically by a straight line for altitudes above 10°, the
position of the experimentally determined points lying closely on to the
straight line.
    A similar relation has already* been shown to exist (by a far less complete
series of experiments than the present) for Kew, Heidelberg, and Para ;
bo that although the chemical intensity for the same altitude at different
places and at different times of the year varies according to the varying
transparency of the atmosphere, yet the relation at the same place between
altitude and intensity is always represented by a straight line.            This varia
tion in the direction of the straight line is due to the opalescence of the
atmosphere ; and the authors show that, for equal altitudes, the higher inten
sity is always found where the mean temperature of the air is greater, as in
summer, when observations at the same place at different seasons are com
pared, or as the equator is approached, when the actions at different places
are examined.         The differences in the observed actions for equal altitudes,
which may amount to more than 100 per cent, at different places, and to
nearly as much at the same place at different times of the year, serve as
exact measurements of the transparency of the atmosphere.
    The authors conclude by calling attention to the close agreement between
the curve of daily intensity obtained by the above-mentioned method at
 Lisbon, and that calculated for Naples by a totally different method.

 II. "On     the Acids contained in     Crab-oil." By William J. Wonfor,
        Student in the Laboratory of the Government School of Science,
        Dublin.       Communicated by Dr. Maxwell Simpson.                      Received
        March 7, 1870.
    Crab-oil is obtained from the nuts of a tree named by botanists Hylo-
 carpus carapa, and also Carapa Gvinnensis.              The tree grows abundantly
 in the forests of British Guiana ; the oil is prepared by the Indians, who
 bring it to George Town for sale.        The oil is obtained from the kernels by
 boiling them for some time, and then placing them in heaps and leaving
 them for some days ; they are then skinned, and afterwards triturated in
 wooden mortars until reduced to a paste, which is spread on inclined boards
 and exposed to the sun ; the oil is thus melted out, and trickles into
 receiving-vessels.
    As no investigation, so far as I have been able to ascertain, has ever been
 made of the acids contained in this oil, Professor Galloway, to whom               I  am
 indebted for the samples of the oil, recommended me to examine them ; and
 the examination was conducted under his direction.
    The oil  was in the state in which      it is sold by the Indians    ;  it possessed
 the appearance of a semifluid butyraceous mass, evolving a peculiar pene
 trating odour ; its melting-point was 55° C. To obtain the acids, the oil was
 saponified with a solution of potassic hydrate, and the soap thus obtained
 dissolved in   a  large quantity of distilled water ; to the solution sodic chlo
ride was added in considerable excess ; the soap which separated was
washed and afterwards dissolved, and the solution treated with hydro
chloric acid j the liberated fatty acids were collected and pressed, then
melted in boiling water, and frequently washed to remove all traces of sodic
chloride ; the acids were again saponified, and again treated with sodic
chloride, but the soda-soap was on this occasion decomposed with tartaric
acid.    The mixed      acids had a melting-point     of 40° C.
    The  acids were dissolved in boiling alcohol       of 89 per cent. ;   the solution,
on cooling, deposited white radiated crystalline mass, which was repeatedly
                           a
recrystallized from alcohol until it acquired a constant melting-point ; it was
 then saponified with a solution of potassic carbonate, and the solution of the
mixed potash salts was evaporated to dryness on the water-bath ; the fat
 salt was then dissolved in absolute alcohol.         The alcoholic solution, unless
extremely dilute, does not crystallize on cooling, but merely forms a strong
jelly, which was, after pressing, dissolved in water, and the fat acid sepa
rated by a strong solution of tartaric acid ; the separated acid was washed
with boiling water until all potassic tartrate and tartaric acid were removed :
it was subsequently twice crystallized from absolute alcohol : its melting-
point was then found to be 5 7° C. The acid, when pure, presents the ap
pearance of a white glistening radiated crystalline mass : two combustions
were   made   ;   the acid employed in the two analyses          was obtained       from
two different saponifications : —

 tion  of the baryta in the baric salt,          I considered sufficiently indicated that
 the acid      under examination        was palmitic       acid, although    I  could never
 obtain,   even after fractional        precipitation,   a higher melting-point      for the
 acid than 57°      C.
    The difference       in the melting-points of the acid mass before it wa3
 treated   with alcohol, and the melting-point of the palmitic acid, indicated
 that at least one other acid was present, but in very minute quantity.
    I attempted to determine the nature of the acid of lower melting-point
by exposing        the residues obtained from the first three crystallizations of
the hard acid to       cold in a bath of sodic sulphate and hydrochloric acid, all
the hard acid       which crystallized out being rejected; the portion which re
mained     fluid was saponified with potassic carbonate, and the solution of the
jiotnsh   soap was subjected to fractional precipitation by means of plumbic
acetate   ; the second and smaller precipitate was collected and washed, and
treated    for some     time at a moderate temperature with dilute sulphuric
acid; this      caused    the separation of a reddish oily-looking liquid which
was   collected    and dissolved in boiling alcohol ; it was afterwards saponified
with    potassic carbonate,       and the silver-salt       prepared from that salt.       I
oaly obtained sufficient of the silver-salt from about 2 lbs. of oil to make
one determination        of the silver and one of the carbon aud hydrogen, and
from these      determinations     I  did not obtain concordant results, and want of
material    compelled     me   to relinquish the further examination of the acid.

                                           Xvii
    In the list of Fellows lost to the Royal Society this year, the name
Thomas Graham stands out with great prominence.                     Much as he was
known, and widely, he was little seen in what may he called the social
circles of scientific life ; and although we shall miss him and his work in a
field which he alone seemed to cultivate and understand, and although his
work must greatly influence science, and through it civilization, the public
will not observe that any name of importance is absent on great occasions or
in large meetings.
    He was born in Glasgow, in 1805, Dec. 21st. His father was a mer
 chant of thnt city, and gave him every opportunity of learning.              Having
 attended the primary school, he went at nine years of age to the Grammar
 School for Latin and Greek under Dymock, for the usual term of four years,
 and under the rector, Dr. Chrystal, for the finishing year. Then he went to
 the University, at an early age certainly, but such is the custom of the place.
 We hear of no great feats of scholarship in the Grammar School.             Graham
 was too quiet to be brilliant. We hear of diligence, and that he occupied
 a seat in the first form, and got prizes for lessons as well as a prize every
 year for not having been absent for one day. The education at this school
 was sound, and it was not easy for a boy to leave it without some useful
 knowledge of the languages taught, as well as a very clear idea of the his
 tory and progress of the world.          In college he remained for seven years
 before taking his degree of M.A. in 1826.           At that time the university was
 too much of a high school, but it was of course obliged to suit itself to the
 young who attended.        It is clear that Graham had his whole time occupied
 at the best schools of learning around him, and many must still remember
 his teacher in chemistry, Dr. Thomas Thomson, and in physics, Professor
 Meikleham.
     His attention    seems to have at this time been devoted for the most
 part to physics and mathematics.            When he had taken his degree, he
 was expected to enter on distinct professional studies.          His father had de
 signed him for the church, but his mind was bent on the study of science.
 A   struggle took place between two strong wills, and caused him much
 misery for many years.           Neither was accustomed to speak his mind,
 otherwise the great respect which each had for the other would have been
 discovered sooner for the good of both.
     This sorrow was softened to Graham             by the great tenderness of his
 mother, to whom he was most devoted, and to whom he told, in a long
 series of confiding letters from Edinburgh, where he now went to study,
 all his doings and feelings.       In these letters we are led to hope for a very
 full picture of the early manhood of Graham.             It was at this time that he
 learnt isolation, and satisfied his love of sympathy by writing, so that he
 acquired a habit which never left him.          It is in these notes, reaching up to
 his last illness, that we must look for all that he thought on scientific and
 other subjects ; and they, with his published papers, will constitute his true
 autobiography.      Few stirring events happened to him ; his life, externally

at least, was calm ; and equally calm was his mode of thinking, as evinced
in 1lis numerous scientific memoirs.    He stayed in Edinburgh, studying
with Dr. Hope, the well-known Professor of Chemistry, for two years, and
there made the acquaintance and enjoyed the friendship of Leslie. Retain
ing to Glasgow, he began to teach mathematics ; he then took a room fori
chemical laboratory in Portland Street, and in this he gave lectures, for a
very short time only, as he was Lecturer in the Mechanics' Institute for
the winter 1829-30, having succeeded Dr. Thomas Clark, afterwards Pro
fessor in Aberdeen. In the latter year he was transferred to the Ander-
sonian Institution,        succeeding Dr. Ure, who went to London.
  Graham      began       in Glasgow with the good wishes of all               who knew
how laboriously he had studied.     He was then 24 years old, hut he
had been known to scientific men for three years previously ; his earliest
memoir bearing date 1826, and one on diffusion of gases 1829. He
appeared extremely young, and like a boy beginning to teach.                  He     was not
fluent in speech      ;   there was a hesitation as     if it   were difficult to    find the
proper word, and      a quietness   of   demeanour which (except for the little          per
ceptible nervousness) completely covered the great enthusiasm which kept
him at constant work for forty years after that period.    He remained in
Glasgow lecturing and teaching in the laboratory till 1 837, and sending
out diligent workers who have since shown themselves vigorous in the
regions of science and its application to the Arts. In that year he went to
London as Professor at the London University, now University College.
He had his  residence near it in Torrington Square, which he afterwards left
for a house a few doors distant, at 4 Gordon Square, where he ended his
days on the 16th of September, 1869. In the College he was held in high
regard by his pupils and colleagues.   It is true that, as a lecturer, he had to
contend with a want of natural fluency and with a feeble utterance ;                   bnt is
he had always the clearest conception of the matter he was treating                     of,   hii
manner of exposition, even of intricate subjects, was singularly                    clear and
perspicuous, and the instruction imparted was well grounded and                 thorough,
and was pervaded by the same philosophical                spirit which guided         him      in
his original investigations.
   In 1855 he ceased to be connected with the College, having succeeded
Sir John Herschel as Master of the Mint.

                          a

His   chest, as indeed his whole constitution, was tender, and the              accidental
exposure to an open window ]in             a   warm August day brought         on his final
attack.

short notice will be given of his principal papers only.
   His earliest memoir indicated in the Royal Society's Catalogue'

Thomson's 1 Annals of Philosophy,' 182C, " On the Absorption of
Gases by Liquids."        He there reasons out the idea that gases are con
verted into liquids by mixing with or being absorbed by liquids, and
that the phenomenon becomes simply that of two liquids mixed together.
He concludes that gases may owe their absorption by liquids to their capa
bility of being liquefied, and to the affinities of liquids to which they
become in this way exposed. These two properties are considered to bo
the immediate or proximate causes of the absorbability of gases. It follows
"   that solutions of gases in liquids are mixtures of a more volatile with a
less volatile liquid."    He says also that it is a coincidence more than ac
cidental that the gases which yielded to condensation in Mr. Faraday's
hands are, generally speaking, of easy absorbability.      He objects therefore
to Henry's law, that the quantity of gas which water absorbs is directly
proportionate to the pressure, because it is not likely that this law would
have been spoken of had such gases as muriatic acid been employed, that
being very readily absorbed, although there might be an approximation
to such a law when the quantity of gas absorbed was inconsiderable.
     Graham illustrated the condensation and solution of a vapour in a liquid
by supposing steam of the heat of 000° F. to be passed through sulphuric
acid of 600° F., when he doubted not immediate absorption and actual
solution would take place, as if water and sulphuric acid were mixed at
lower temperatures ; and yet the steam would be brought into the condition
of a liquid which by ordinary cooling would have taken place only after
nearly 400° diminution of temperature.
     So late as 1866, speaking of the dialytic separation of gases through
colloid septa, he is desirous of showing that the flow is not that of diffusion
 or of effusion, or of transpiration, but that of a liquid absorbed by one siile
 and passed to the other ; and in 1868 he illustrates the passage of hydrogen
through palladium by saying that it is analogous to liquid diffusion through
 a colloid. There are forty years between the beginning and end of this
 train of thought.
     This is a fair specimen of Graham's habit of mind and of his perseve
 rance. He seems to have begun life with an intense desire to know the inner
 structure of matter, stimulated to understand more than the atomic theory
 could give him, but nevertheless a true student of Dalton.      Born in 1805,
 when Dalton was preparing for the press the ideas he had already given in
 lectures, he seems to have been destined to begin a new line of work closely
 allied to that which Dalton had done.
     It is almost painful to think of the attempts of mankind to understand
 why    bodies should have a definite composition, and Dalton's simple idea
 of adding atom to atom not only made it appear possible, but showed why
 the contrary should be most improbable.          Now it seems so simple that
 some men believe it was scarcely a discovery, whilst every chemist is slavishly
 bound to it in some form or other, unable either in practice or theory to
 escape ; and this point seems now to be true for all time.     Still the simple
                                                                  b 2

axiom, so to speak, was not a science ; and as one proposition after another
arises out of   tbe first idea itself appears grander and grander.
                        it,                                          Dalton,
like Newton, used the term atom as meaning'a particle which could not be
divided by any force.   But there seems no need to say that   could not be               it
divided      by
           the imagination or even by new forces, in which case   becomes                      it
the practical as opposed to the theoretical atom.      Under the present
chemistry there probably exists another which shall deal with the broken
atom of our present science   we do not know how many layers there may
                                            ;
be under it.   It    strange that Dalton's idea was so purely mechanical,
                               is
although illustrating purely        a               chemical act   :   there    is   no talk   of   obscure
forces   ;   itmovement like
                   isa          carpenter's,  fitting of pieces in the manner

ofa   workman.   Graham took up the subject in the same spirit, and seems
to have during his whole life sought for nothing beyond the knowledge of
the constitution of matter, and the mode ia which the atoms or molecules
move. His favourite word        molecule, not atom indeed he seems too
                                            is                              ;
guarded to use the latter in any case of measurable movement. His destiny
was to follow the progress of the molecule, and to show that there wee
movements in bodies which depended on that aggregration of atoms, whether
ultimate atoms or not.                  Whilst Dalton showed the relative weights of                     the
combining quantities, Graham showed the relative magnitude of groups
into which they resolved themselves.
   Having discovered that solid bodies could be divided into two classes,
colloid and crystalloid, and that the first consist of substances existing in
great varieties of conditions, and apt to undergo long and remarkable pro
gressive changes, he seems to have taught us the way to obtain many sub
stances practically new, although nominally such as we have seen.  Whilst
one, the colloid, has power  of motion in itself to considerable extent, tbe
                                                                        a
other, the crystalloid, has power of motion in solutions, so that we are
introduced to   series of new forces, the end of which
                        a                                   not in the faintest  is
way  foreseen. The    door by  which we  enter  these strange regions    found                      is
by   series of the most uninviting trials
     a                                    seems to have been bidden
                                                              ;   it
under the most homely brushwood, and few would think of toiling so long
in such field.
             a
     It may        be well to go over some              of his principal papers, and to observe
how constantly he kept to these                       ideas whilst penetrating further into tbe
subjects.
   In 1827 he observed that phosphate of magnesia effloresced very readily                               ;
this, he argued, proved     weak affinity for water
                                        a               weak, heat ought to
                                                                          ;   if
destroy      it,
           and so he found that    was thrown down anhydrous on boiling.
                                                    it
He argues that       only the
                          it  hydrate that
                               is             soluble, properly speaking,
                                                                  is                                     hi
other cases also.
   This led him, in 1835, to examine the hydrate, when he found that
the tendency of phosphate of soda to combine with an additional dose of soda
was connected with the existence of closely combined water.      This induced
him  to separate the water of salts into two parts, crystalline and basic, the

                                                 xxi
first being easily removed, the second requiring more than the boiling-point
of water to remove it. This atom of water may be replaced by a salt, form
ing a class of double salts.    Amongst the salts with basic water he puts
sulphuric  acid as  sulphate of water,  and an additional atom as equal to the
atom of crystallization.
    In the same year he speaks of ammonia performing the function of
water in compounds of copper.          Iu 1836 he says that his "researches
make it probable that the correspondence between water and the magnesian
class of oxides extends beyond their character as bases, and that in certnin
subsalts of the magnesian class of oxides the metallic oxide replaces the
water of crystallization of the neutral salt and discharges a function which
was thought peculiar to water."       The inquiry was extended to the con
stitution of the phosphoric acids, and the amount of base taken up by
them shown to be equivalent to the amount of water in the acid ; from this
he passed to the arseniates.   It is quite evident that he treated water as he
t reated metallic oxides   indeed he speaks of metallic oxides performing
                                 ;
the functions or taking the place of water.      It was a distinct recognition of
hydrogen   as a metal  in its place  in  salts, whilst his latest paper in 1869
endeavours to establish its specific gravity when combined with palladium
as an alloy.
   This          of the chains of discovery which, at an earlier period, led
             was one
to the doctrine of substitution.  It is still sound ; and although the water
does    not now hold the same place of honour in the phosphorus acids,
the place is held firmly by the hydrogen, which takes its position as a
metal.   This idea cannot bt regarded as originating with Graham ; Davy
seems to have hinted            it,
                         and Dulong made     distinct but    was Graham

whose careful experiments and cautious reasoning gave    consistency and          it
force, although he himself did not actually adopt    in general teaching.
                                                                       it
Probably nothing tended so much to give hydrogen its present place as the
inquiry into the constitution of the phosphates, and his explanation of the
monobasic, bibasic, and tribasic acids.
   We       have the first results        of his experiments on diffusion              in   the Philoso
phical Magazine for 1829.
   After giving various details of experiments he says, " It    evident that           is
the diffusiveness of gases      inversely as
                                          is some function of their density,
apparently the square root of their density."                    This        is   the conclusion ho
arrived at finally.
   The separation of        gases by simple diffusion            is   shown to be practicable,
and    is   there illustrated   ;     he mentions   it   as conceivable   " that imperceptible
pores and orifices of excessive minuteness may be altogether impassable (by
                 by
               gases of low diffusive power, that                      is,
                                                          dense gases, and    by
diffusion)
passableonly by gases of certain diffusive energy."
                                      a             Here we observe his
wonderful caution   he will not say that the atoms or molecules may be
                        :
too large, he will not say that the gas will not pass, but he says                            "   impass
able (by diffusion)."

                                       xxii
    In his paper read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Dec. 19th, 1831,
he goes more fully into his favourite subject, beginning with firmness. " It
is the object of this paper to establish with numerical exactness the follow
ing law of the diffusion of gases."      "The diffusion or spontaneous inter
mixture of two gases in contact is effected by an interchange in the position
of independent minute volumes of the gases, which volumes are not neces
sarily of equal magnitude, being in the case of each gas inversely propor
tioned to the square root of the density of that gas."
    In this paper (1831) he also tried the speed with which gas passed
through stucco under pressure.
    In 1846 Graham read to this Society a memoir "On the Motion of
 Gases."     There he showed what he called the effusion of gases into i
vacuum through a thin plate (j^s °^ an *nc^ thick), " leaving no doubt of
the truth of the general law, that different gases pass through minute
apertures into a vacuum in times which are as the square roots of their re
spective specific gravities, or with velocities which are inversely as the squat
roots of their specific gravities," and that " the effusion-time of air of
different temperatures is proportional to the square root of its density at
each temperature."      The remarkable results of transpiration are fully deve
loped in his second paper (June 2 1st, 1849)
                                                  " On the Motion of Gases."
    If a tube of a certain length be used to allow the escape of the gas, the
velocities of the gases attain a particular ratio which remains constant with
greater lengths and resistances. This ratio depends on a new and pecu
liar property of gases, which he called Transpiration.       He considered thai
solids have many modes of showing their character, the varieties of struc
ture being endless ; but gases could only show theirs in a few direction!,
nnd he believed that the ratios of transpirability     would have a simplicity
comparable to that of the specific gravities, or even the still more simple
 relations of the combining volumes.        As gases, compared with solids, «re
capable of small variation in physical properties, those characters which
 do bIiow themselves may well be supposed to be the most deep-seated ani
fundamental with which matter is endowed.          He adds, " It was under this
 impression that I devoted an amount of time and attention to the deter
mination of this class of numerical constants which might otherwise appeir
 disproportionate to their value and the importance of the subject.        As  the
results, too, were entirely novel, and wholly unprovided for in the      recerred
 view of the gaseous constitution, of which, indeed, they prove the incom
 pleteness, it wns the more necessary to verify each fact with the greatest
 care." As examples, the density of nitrogen is 14 when hydrogen is taken
 as 1 ; but the transpiration velocity of hydrogen is exactly double that of
nitrogen.      The transpiration time of carbonic acid is inversely propor
 tional to its density, when compared with oxygen.         These results he be
lieved to show    " the important chemical bearing of gaseous transpirabilirj,
 and that    it emulates n place in science with the doctrines of gaseous
 densities and combining volumes."

                                       xxiii
   This remarkable property of       gases was viewed    by Graham as    a result
of   one  of the initial endowments of matter, and in this search he
showed his usual desire of approaching nearer than we had ever done to
the actual constitution of the primitive molecule and practical atom.
These inquiries on the motion of gaseous molecules led Graham to look at
the motion of bodies in solution or "liquid diffusion." The first paper was
read in 1849. He naturally connected this with his earlier experiments on
the phosphates, and the amount of water held by them and phosphoric
acid ; and he termed solubilities of substances weak and strong, as well as
great or small.     He supposed that this varying strength of solubility
might arise from a greater or less diffusive power.
    Graham believed liquid diffusion to have an analogy to evaporation ;
and as the squares of the times of equal diffusion of gases are in the ratio
of their densities, so by analogy it might be inferred that the molecules
of  the several salts, as they exist in solution,   possess densities which   are
to   one another as the squares    of the times of equal diffusion.    He attri
buted the diffusion of substances in solution, like the transpiration of
gases, to a fundamental property of bodies.          The pith of the inquiry is
thus stated :  — "  The fact that the relations in diffusion of different sub
stances refer to equal weights of these substances, and not to their atomic
weights or equivalents, is one which reaches to the very basis of molecular
chemistry.     In liquid diffusion we deal no longer with chemical equiva
 lents or the Daltonian atoms, but with masses even more simply related to
 each other in weight.      Founding still upon the chemical atoms, we may
suppose that they can group together in such numbers as to form new and
larger molecules of equal weights for different substances ; or, if not of
equal weight, of weights which appear to have a simple relation to each
other.    It is this new class of molecules which appears to play a part in
solution and liquid diffusion, and not the atoms of chemical combination."
He seems glad to obtain the densities of a new kind of molecules, although
knowing no more respecting them.          One result is the formation of classes
 of equidiffusive substances ; these, again, led to a new mode of analysis in
 1861, and a new division of soluble bodies. It was observed that the
 power of diffusion of a solution of albumen was very small, 1000 times less
than that of common salt     ; and this fact led to an examination of numerous
 substances, when it was found that they divide themselves inte two classes
without respect to organic nature ; one is colloid, and includes gelatine and
 gelatinous silica, alumina, albumen, gums, sugar, starch, and extractive
 matter.    The plastic elements of the animal body are found in this class ;
and here Graham uses the word (as, indeed, he uses all words) in a very
exact sense, that which has the power of forming.
    Continually seeking the origin of chemical action, he ascribes to bodies
possessing this colloidal condition a dynamical character.         They are slow
in changing, but    seem  in a continual change.     They   possess energia, and
may be the primary source of the force         appearing in the phenomena of

                                      xxiv
vitality ; and to these gradual colloidal changes may he referred the cha
racteristic protraction of chemico-organic changes.      These colloid bodies
are very easily penetrated by the soluble crystalloid bodies to which they
are opposed, and they form a medium also of separation or dialysis.
    This process of dialysis has a high value in the explanations it affords,
and promises to afford, of many physiological phenomena. But thw
hitherto unknown and still obscure properties of molecules seem destined
to lead us still further on ; and by presenting to us a nearer view of the
fundamental phenomena, they give us an idea of the enormous magnitude
of the structure under which they seem to lie. Graham believed that the
 rate of diffusion held a place in vital science not unlike the time of the
falling of heavy bodies in the physics of gravitation.
    In a paper " On the Molecular Mobility of Gases," June 18th, 1863,
he further    compares several substances as to their facilities for diffusion,
 and defines clearly the effusion-rate and the transpiration-rate as distinct.
A substance suiting the purpose of diffusion is graphite.
    He obtained by the graphite diffusiometer a separation of oxygen from
the air, making a mixture with 2 per cent, additional of that gas. This led
him to try another mode ; and by lengthening the surface and tube, be
obtained 3| per cent, more oxygen than in the atmosphere.         This process
he calls atmolysis.     Trying diffusion without an intervening septum, he
found that carbonic acid had proceeded half a metre length in seven minute;.
    The separation of gases was carried out much further, and described in
a paper read June 21st, 1866.        Here he begins the use of caoutchouc,
having been led to it by the experiments of Dr. Mitchell, of Philadelphii.
He found that air drawn through sheet rubber contained as much as 41*3
oxygen, the theoretical speed being 40-46, deduced from the passage of
the separate gas.     He is desirous of showing that in this case the flow i;
different from diffusion ; it is caused by an absorption of the gases, whieh
are taken into the caoutchouc in a liquid state, and are then given out on
the opposite side.
    This inquiry naturally    led to an examination of the absorption by
metals.    Deville and Troost had discovered that platinum and iron absorbed
gases when hot. Graham found hydrogen to pass through heated platinum
 1-1 millim. thick at the rate of 489"2 cub. centimetres per minute on >
square metre.      Oxygen scarcely passed, and other gases tried did not
pass.    Wrought platinum       took up 5'53 vols, of hydrogen,      which,  on
cooling, were shut up or occluded in the mass.     Fused platinum     took only
0-171 vol.; hammered platinum 2,28-3,79.            Palladium, however, was
 most remarkable, as it took up 643 vols, of hydrogen ; in a later papw
 the quantity is stated to be 935 vols.    These gases were pumped out from
the reheated, but could not be removed from the cold metal. Palladium
cold, however, was found to take up hydrogen when it was used as            the
negative pole of a galvanic battery, and spongy palladium, which had        «b-
sorbed hydrogen when heated, deoxidized some salts in the cold.

                                          XXV
  Iron manufactured, or from telluric           sources,   was found to contain car
bonic oxide.
  Silver, gold, copper, osmium-iridium took up little gas, and antimony no
hydrogen.    He divides the metals into crystalline and colloid.
  His paper of May 16th, 1867, enters more fully into the subject, and
shows that meteoric iron contains hydrogen, with the probability, if
not certainty, that it was cooled in an atmosphere of that gas.     Messrs.
Huggins and Miller, as well as Father Secchi, had concluded that hydrogen
is one of the gases shown on the spectrum of the fixed stars, and especially
mentioned it as found with the unusual increased light of T Coronae in
November       1866.    The actual handling of the          gas brought from distant
space was a strange experimental proof, and was remarkably characteristic
of Graham-s peculiar inclination to place his work before his thought.
He seemed to feel his way by his work.     He was not able to impregnate
iron with above one volume of hydrogen, whereas the meteoric iron contains
at least three. He thinks this shows that it may have been absorbed under
pressure.
  On May 22nd, 1868, he showed that palladium took up 0-723 per cent,
by weight of hydrogen ; and he inclines to believe that the passage of the
gas through palladium is analogous to           liquid diffusion through    a   colloid.
   As   a private man, Graham led an uneventful life          ;but no man has passed
through the world more uniformly respected.                 Too retired, too quiet, his
life appears to have a deep tinge of melancholy in                it,
                                                     notwithstanding its
eminent success.  Very intimate friends he had few out of the circle of
the family of brothers and sisters, who were strongly attached to him,
and to whom he was much devoted, being himself unmarried.
  As scientific man, his claims were never disputed
        a                                            he was not called  ;

to assert his position, and he remained the undisputed
ment.   He received in early life (1834) the Keith Medal of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, and the Royal Medal of this Society in 1838, and
in 1862 the Copley Medal.    He was made     Doctor of Civil Law of Ox
                                                       a
ford, Honorary Member of  the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Corresponding
Member of the French Institute and of the Academies of Berlin and
Munich, and of the National Institute of Washington.    His election into
 the Royal Society was in 1836.
    On his appointment to the Mint,        Mr. Graham laboured assiduously and
 successfully in acquiring     thorough knowledge of the technical work and
                               a
 financial relations of his office, and discharged his duties with much energy
 and judgment.    It   known that he brought about various reforms and econo
                       is
 mies in the working        of the establishment   ;   but the service for which he will
 be chiefly remembered was the introduction    of the new bronze coinage,
 which, besides substituting   more convenient medium of circulation than
                                   a
 that in previous use, was attended with   pecuniary profit to the state of
                                                   a
 very large amount.

                                               XXVI
     An old    and   valued friend of Graham,          Dr. A. W. Hofmann,            then inti
mately associated      with him, thus speaks of his administration of the Mint*:
— " It would be difficult, within these narrow limits, to convey an adequate
notion of the great and manifold activity exercised by Graham in the
high office entrusted to him. The new chief of the Mint soon shoved a
vigilance, a knowledge of the work, an amount of industry and energy,
and, when called for, an unsparing severity which astonished all, and
especially some of the officials of the establishment. Such requirements
had not heretofore been exacted, nor such control exercised.     The new
Master's      love of innovation, and his disturbance of settled                   arrangements
(for in such light was his action viewed), had to be resisted with every
effort.  The author of this sketch at that time held an office in connexion
with the English Mint, and was therefore witness, though from without,
of the struggle which Graham had to go through in his new position. It
was years before he finally overcame these difficulties, and was enabled to
return to his favourite study."
     Graham,      besides    the memoirs mentioned             and omitted     here, wrote           a
system   of chemistry.            The second edition is still valuable    ;   it   explained        at
a very early stage           theories which     are now general, although             it    did not
actually adopt novel arrangements. The book is a masterpiece of clear
ness in arrangement and style, but it was written so slowly that the
publisher said that to press him was like drawing his blood. The
anxiety to be correct was painful.  It gives a calmness to all his writing,
but really goes too far, as it rather represses the enthusiasm of the
reader, and diminishes the force of the words.     He may be said never to
speculate  till he  has made experiments ;   he seems to feel the forms with
his fingers before he ventures to describe them ; but he reaches to utmost
space in this manner more surely than others have done by the boldest
imagination.     He         is,
                        however, capable of the widest generalizations, and
these he makes at times with surprising               speed.
   When speaking of liquids, Graham has been quoted as saying that the
rate of diffusion held   place in vital science not unlike the time of falling
                                a
bodies in the physics of gravitation.    We judge of the value of discoveries
by  the  fruit  they produce     when   we
                                         ;  do so,    requires some time
                                                                it                                  to
judge fairly.    Although there seems to us boundless region opened up,
                                                       a                                           it

extent.  By his experimental examinations of the motion of molecules,                              he
has made      a       before was left to reason only
                  step which                         and unless       ;                       he   eu

                                  men
with his most direct predecessor, Dalton.   With such distinguished names,
therefore,     seems just that we should, until the world shall teach us
               it
better, leave that of Thomas Graham. — R. A. S.

   The author presents and discusses the completely reduced observations,
from 1837 to 18G9 inclusive, of the four great earth-thermometers sunk
into the rock of the Calton Hill, at the Koyal Observatory, Edinburgh,
by the late Principal Forbes, pursuant to a vote by the British Association
for the Advancement of Science.

 both by Principal Forbes and Sir William Thomson, the author applies
 himself solely to trace the existence of other cycles than the ordinary
 annual one, in the rise and fall of the different thermometers.
   Of such cycles, and of more than                 one year's duration, he considers           that
 he has discovered three        ;   and of these the most marked has                  a period of
 11-1 years, or practically         the same as Schwabe's numbers for                 new groups
 of solar spots.    Several numerical circumstances, however, which                                 the
 author details, show that the sun-spots cannot be the actual cause of                              the
 observed waves of terrestrial temperature, and he suggests what may                                  he,
 concluding with two examples of the practical use to which knowledge           a                     of
 the temperature cycles as observed may at once be turned, no matter                                  to
what cosmical origin their existence               may be owing.

   The Granites of central and western Scotland are metamorphic rocks,
like those of Donegal and Norway, with which they are geologically iden
tical ; and truly eruptive Granite occurs at only a few localities, as, for
example, near Peterhead.
   The second felspar associated with Orthoclase in                     the Metamorphic
Granites is Oligoclase, as in Donegal j while the second                felspar associated
with Orthoclase in the eruptive Granites is Albite, as in               Mourne, Leinster,
and Cornwall.      The fact thus indicated by the Scotch                 Granites is com
pletely   in accordance with         the mode of occurrence of Oligoclase and
Albite in the Irish Granites.

    The specimen of Mica here analyzed came from veins in the Granite
 quarry of Rubislaw, near Aberdeen, and occurs in large plates, associated
 with red Orthoclase.      It was carefully examined for lithia, but no trace
 of this alkali could be found in it.
    The angles of the rhombic plates were 60" and 1 20° exactly, and the
 angle between its optic axes was found to be 72° 30'.
    The black Mica in large crystals    is very rare, but  it  seems abundantly
 disseminated in minute scales through most of the Scotch Granites.        The
 following analysis was made on specimens found near Aberdeen by Prof.
 Nicol, and kindly forwarded to       me by    him, for the purposes of this

                                   I. Metallic Vanadium*.
     In the   second       part of
                                     " Researches             on Vanadium," it          wa3    stated that
the metal absorbs hydrogen.  This conclusion has been fully borne ombj
subsequent experiment ; and it appears that the amount of absorbed or
combined hydrogen taken up by the metal varies according to the state of
division, first, of the chloride (VC12) from which the metal is prepared,
and secondly, and especially, of the metal itself.  The metal containing
absorbed hydrogen slowly takes up oxygen on exposure to dry air, water
being formed and the metal undergoing oxidation to the lowest oiide,
V, O. At this point the oxidation stops, but in moist air it proceeds still
further.
   The difficulty of obtaining metallic vanadium free from admixture of
oxide has been again rendered evident.      Perfectly pure tetrachloride was
prepared  in quantity, and  from this pure dichloride was made. On heating
this to whiteness in dry hydrogen for 48 hours a substance was obtained
which gained on oxidation 70'7 per cent, (vanadium requiring 77'79 per
centage increase), and therefore still contained a slight admixture of oxide
     The reducing action of sodium on the solid chlorides was next                              examined;
in this     case the reduction takes place quietly in an atmosphere of                           hydrogen
at a red heat, and is best conducted in strong iron tubes.                             Explosions occur
when sodium acts on the liquid tetrachloride.        The substance thus ob
tained was found, after lixiviation, to be free from chlorine, and on washing
it   separated      into portions — (1) a light and finely divided black
                             two
powder (trioxide), which remains in suspension, and is soluble in hydro-
chloric acid, and (2) a heavier grey powder, insoluble in hydrochloric acid,
which soon deposits, and can, by repeated washing, be completely freed
from the lighter trioxide. This bright grey powder consists of metallic
vanadium, mixed with more or less oxide.  If this metallic powder, after
drying in vacuo, be reduced at a low red heat in a current of pure bydrogw,
it takes fire spontaneously, even when cold, on exposure to air or oxygen,
water being formed, whilst the vanadium undergoes oxidation, forming the
blue oxide, Va 0.. A portion of metal exposed for some weeks to the                                        air

     1.   Vanadium         Tribromide, VBr3, molec. wt.= 291"3. — When excess                              of
bromine      is   passed    over vanadium mononitride heated to redness,   rind                    a
action occurs, and dense dark-brown vapours are formed, condensing    the                            in
cooler portions of the tube to  greyish-black, opaque, amorphous mass
                                            a                                                              of
the tribromide.            The tribromide       is   a   very unstable compound,               losing bro-

mine even when kept sealed up in glass tubes ; it is very deliquescent, and
on heating in the air rapidly loses all its bromine and takes up oxygen,
with formation of vanadic acid. On being thrown into water, the tribro-
mide readily dissolves, forming a brown liquid (in this respect resembling
the trichloride), which, on addition of a few drops of hydrochloric acid,
turns of a bright green colour, showing the presence of a solution of an
hypovanadic salt. No free bromine or hydrobromic acid is given off on
dissolving the tribromide in water. That a more volatile higher bromide
was not formed in this reaction was shown, inasmuch as, on distilling the
excess   of liquid which had collected in the receiver, it was found to consist
of free bromine, containing mere traces of the tribromide mechanically
carried over.     The tribromide is likewise formed when bromine is passed
over a red-hot mixture of vanadium trioxide and pure charcoal, as in the
preparation of the tetrachloride j but this method is not one to be recom
mended, as the tube becomes constantly stopped up by the formation of
the solid tribromide.
    The analysis of the tribromide was made by dissolving the compound in
water, and precipitating the bromine with excess of nitrate of silver, the
vanadium being estimated as V, 0B, either in the filtrate from the bromide
of silver or in a separate portion.      The bromine in the above determina
tions, obtained by precipitation as silver-salt, was invariably found to be
too high, whilst the vanadium nearly agreed with the theoretical per
centage.      This is due to the fact pointed out_by Stas, in his ' Recherches,-
p. 156, that bromide of silver, when boiled, encloses mechanically a por
tion of the precipitant, which then cannot be washed out.            The loss of
weight obtained by reducing the bromide to metallic silver in a current of
hydrogen, taken as bromine, gave more nearly agreeing numbers : —

    2. Vanadium Oxytribromide, or Vanadyl Tribromide, VOBra, molec. wt.
= 307-3. — The oxytribromide is a dark-red transparent liquid, evolving
white fumes on contact with the air, obtained by passing pure and dry
bromine over vanadium trioxide (Va 0,) heated to redness.          Moisture pre
vents the formation of the oxytribromide ; and it not only undergoes sudden
decomposition when heated to 1 80°, but also slowly decomposes at the or
dinary atmospheric temperatures.          The boiling-point of the tribromide
can, however, bo brought below its temperature of decomposition by dis
tillation in vacuo, and the liquid can then be freed completely from bro
mine by passing a current of dry air through the liquid.        Under   a pressure
of 100 millims. the oxytribromide boils from 130° to          135D,  and may be

                         IV. The Metallic Vanadates.
   In   the first part   of these Researches (Phil. Trans. 1868) it was pointed
out   (1 ) that  the salts  analyzed by Berzelius must be considered as meta- or
monobasic vanadates, (2) that the so-called bivanadates analyzed by Von
Hauer are anhydro-salts, and (3) that the ortho- or tribasic vanadates con
tain 3 atoms of monad metal, the sodium salt being formed artificially               by
fusing 1 molecule of vanadium pentoxide with 3 molecules of carbonate                  of
soda, when 3 molecules          of carbon dioxide are expelled, whilst the       ortho-
salts occur native in many minerals.           The present communication contains
a description of these       classes of salts, as well as of a new class of salts, the
tetrabasic or pyro-vanadates.

further evolution of CO,        is observed,   a  tribasic vanadate remains    ns a white
crystalline mass.      This     mass dissolves easily in water, and on addition of
absolute alcohol to the solution two layers of liquid are formed ; the lower
one solidifies after a time, forming an aggregation of needle-shaped crystals,
which possess a strongly alkaline reaction. These having been washed with
alcohol, and dried on         a porous plate over sulphuric        acid in vacuo, were
analyzed   with   the following results : —

    The sodium in this and in the following compounds               was separated   from
 the vanadium by precipitating the vanadic acid as the perfectly insoluble
basic lead salt hereafter described. This was dried at 100° and weighed,
then dissolved in nitric acid and decomposed by sulphuric acid, and the
solution of V, 05 in excess of this acid gave on evaporation a finely crys
talline mass.     The filtrate from the lead precipitate freed from lead yielded
on evaporation sodium sulphate.             Full analytical details of this method, as
 well as of the other by precipitation as the insoluble ammonium meta-
vanadate,    are given in the memoir.            By frequent crystallizations the tri-
sodium vanadate is slowly decomposed into the tetrasodium salt, caustic
 soda  being formed.        This singular reaction was most carefully examined
and the amount of sodium hydroxide liberated determined volumetrically.
   2. Tetrasodium Vanadate, Na4 V2 O, + 18Ha O. — This salt crystallizes in
beautiful six-sided tables       ; it is easily soluble in water, insoluble in alcohol,
and is precipitated by the latter liquid from aqueous solution in white
scales of a silky lustre.       As long as the salt contains free alkali or tribasic
salt, it forms, on precipitation with alcohol, oily drops which solidify after
some time.      The tetrasodium vanadate is always formed by the first fusion
of vanadic   acid with excess      of carbonate of    soda, and can be easily prepared
in the pure state by recrystallization.

3Pb3V04+Pb Cla, can be artificially prepared by fusing for a few hours a

portions, together with an excess of sodium chloride.         After cooling, a
greyish crystalline mass is left, containing cavities filled with long crystals
having the same colour as the mass, which under the microscope could be
distinguished as six-sided prisms.   The crystalline powder is then boiled
with water until no further traces of soluble chlorides are extracted.

Silver Vanadate*.
   1. The Ortho-Silver Vanadate, Ag, V04, is obtained as an orange-coloured
precipitate by mixing a freshly prepared solution of the trisodium salt with
a solution of silver nitrate, in which every trace of free acid has been
neutralized ; unless these precautions are attended to, the precipitate con
sists of a mixture of the ortho- and pyro-salt.            The trisilvcr vanadate is
insoluble in water, but readily dissolves in ammonia and nitric acid.

322                             Mr. R.       J.    Lee on   the                         [Apr.       28,
I. "      On the Organs of Vision in the Common Mole." By Bobeet
          James Lee.    Communicated by Samuel Solly, F.R.S. Re
          ceived March 30, 1870.
     The   eye   of the Common Mole      and the structures connected with it un
dergo some remarkable changes during                  the growth of the animal. The
gentleman who does me the honour                  to present the results of an investiga
tion into that subject to the Royal Society was desirous that it should                                 be
undertaken in order to ascertain the cause of the anomalous condition                                     in
which the organ of vision is found in the adult Mole.
  It was the suggestion of Mr. Solly that an examination                        of the      eye of the
young or fostal Mole might assist in the explanation ; for Mr. Solly had re
flected much on the subject, and entertained reasons for believing that such
an   inquiry would      be attended   withsatisfactory result.
                                             a
     It   is known that there is distinct evidence of the existence of                           an eye
and other parts concerned in the endowment of sight in many of the                               various
species of the Mole genus.  To what extent, however, the defective                               state of
the orgnus permit of sight, or whether the animal is totally blind,                                     are
questions still undecided.
     That the organs of vision in the young Mole would                    be found          in   a more
perfect state than in mature age was what Mr. Solly anticipated,                             while      he
conjectured, for physiological reasons, that the cause of the                               difference
between  them would be found to be a process of atrophy or degeneration                                    in
the various structures essential for the enjoyment of sight.
     The    specimens   sent me for the purpose           of examination             consisted of          a
female Mole, which appeared from its dimensions to have attained the full
period of development, if it had not somewhat exceeded    and of six unborn
                                                                          it,
young about an inch and        quarter long, and, as far as
                                a                             couid judge,      I
beyond the middle of the period of gestation.
     Before entering into anatomical details, venture to review briefly

Gottfried Treviranus, in his work published in 1820, Vermischte
                                                                     *

Anatomischen und Physiologischen Inhalts,' in the chapter on the Nerves
of Sense in Mammalian Animals.   From this account    appears that bis   it                       it
Zinn who first described an optic nerve in the Mole, and declared                            it    to   be
a branch of that division of the fifth pair of nerves which distributed         is                      to
the nose.
   The description        by
                         Zinn was published       the fourth volume
                                                            in            the                    of
Commentaries of the Royal Society of Gottingen.         "The optic nerve,"
he says,
          " long and of considerable tenuity. Its origin
                 is                                             the same as      is
that of the very large nerve which passes to the proboscis.       It takes                              a
long oblique course, lying  above the muscles of the nose, and passing     an                     in
outward and backward direction, surrounded                  by   dense structures,       is      finally

of vision."
   In    1813 Tiedemann    published a description of the optic nerve and
the fifth pair, which differed in a very important respect from the account
given by Zinn ; for he says that although the optic nerves are small and
difficult to distinguish, yet they exist as separate nerves, and present the
same general character as in most of the mammalia.          Tiedemann carried
his investigations still further, and declared the absence of the third, fourth,
and sixth pairs of nerves.     He described certain filaments, which he stated
to be unconnected with the optic nerve, and to be similar to those branches
which are found in the tissues around the eye in other animals. The ab
sence of the third, fourth, and sixth pairs of nerves was subsequently
asserted also by Caru3 ; but his account of the origin and termination of the
optic nerves is not quite intelligible to me. It appears, however, that the
conclusions of Treviranus and Carus agreed that there was some connexion
between the optic nerve and the fifth, which sufficed to supply the Mole
to a certain degree with the sense of sight. Indeed the chief physiolo
gical fact which Treviranus endeavoured to establish in the chapter of the
work alluded to, was that the nerves of one particular and special sense
were capable, under certain circumstances, of becoming endowed with the
properties of nerves of another and different seuse.
                                                           " The fifth pair of
nerves in some mammalia supply the place of the most important nerve of
       " is the
sense           introductory sense in the chapter ; or, in other words, that a
nerve of touch and feeling may become a nerve of sight, that           is,
                                                                      sensitive
to the rays of light and he concludes the chapter thus — " cannot but
                     ;                                         :   I
agree with Carus that the optic nerve and the fifth branch enter into con
nexion in the eye to produce the retina."      This opinion met with opposi
tion from Prof. Miiller, who controverted         by the statement that true
                                                  it
optic  nerves  had  been exhibited   to him by Dr. Henle (Baly's translation,
p. 842).
   From    aremark of M. P. G. Pelletnn,     inhis    Memoire sur
                                                       '           la Spccialite
des Nerves des Sens,' quoted       by  Mr. Solly in his work on the Brain,         it
would appear that that anatomist had made          very careful examination of
                                                   a
the organs of vision, both in the adult and foetal Mole, for he " recom
mends the dissection of either fcetal Moles, or very young ones, in whom
the optic foramen   is still distinct." The importance of this remark con
sists in  the   proof that   Pelletan had observed that the optic foramina
undergo some change subsequent to the birth of the animal.
    Von Siebold has published the results of investigations into the difference
between the eyes of certain species of Talpa. " The eyes are rudimentary,"
he says, "in the Mole and Spalax typhlus, which live underground            and
                                                                             ;
above all in Talpa cmca and the Chrysochlores are the eyes rudimentary.
They are      little more developed in the Musaraignes and the Common
               a
Mole.    According to Ollivier (Bulletin de   la Societe Philomathique, vol.       ii.

 324                           Mr. R.    J.   Lee on    the                       [Apr. 28,
 No. 3S, p. 105) all the ordinary       elements   of   the    eye are found in Spalia
 typhlus."
                   '
   Leydig, in his    Handbuch der Histologic,' has some important remub
 on the eyes of blind animals, and has described, in Mailer's 'Archives,'
 1854, p. 346, the cellular structure of the lens of the Mole's eye, as pre
 senting the character of embryonic structure, from which he                  concludes that
 the lens remains in its primitive embryonic condition.
   Mr. Solly's investigations were directed to the state of the optic com
                                    " In the Mole," he
 missures at the base of the brain.                     says, "in which the
 optic nerves are so extremely minute that they have often escaped detec
 tion, and are by many authors described as entirely wanting, these com
 missural fibres are found distinctly crossing the base of the skull opposite
 the usual situation of the optic commissure ; while the small black speck,
 evidently the rudiment of the eye, is supplied by a minute branch                  from the
 fifth pair" (p. 289, op. cit.).
   In Prof. Owen's work on the ' Comparative Anatomy and                      Physiology      of
 Vertebrates'  (vol. iv. p. 246), the organ of sight, like that of smell,
 is stated to he " wanting in a few mammals, the eyeball being reduced to
 the size and condition of the ocellus in Amblyopsis, and to its simple
primitive office of taking cognizance of light, a filament of the fifth aiding
a remnant of the proper optic nerve.      The Moles, especially the Italian
kind, Talpa cceca, and   Mole-rats, exemplify this condition, in which, as in
Spalax typhlus,    the skin    passes   over the ocellus without any               palpebral
opening or loss of hair."
  Mr. Herbert Mayo has given a similar description in his ' Physiology,'
and has supplemented it by a drawing, in which the fifth nerve is repre
sented as sending a filament directly to the globe            of the   eye.
  From the above enumeration of the views entertained bv anatomists re
garding the eye and optic nerve of the Mole, it is apparent that attention
has been directed by some to the eye in particular, and to the structures
intimately connected with     it,
                            while others have arrived at their conclusions
from examination of the interior of the skull and the optic region      the            of
brain.
  It  remained therefore to ascertain the condition of the optic nerve                 in   the
posterior part of the orbit, especially that portion of the nerve which                     lies
in the optic foramen, and thus endeavour to connect the appearances                         de
scribed in the eye with those observed at the base of the brain.
   It  isproposed to give an account of the dissection of the full-grown
Mole, in order to contrast the state of the eye, the optic nerve, and the
cranium with that which those parts present in the foetal Mole,                    following
such an arrangement of the facts that the important points of                     difference
shall be apparent without separate comparison.
  The eye of the Common Mole presents the appearance of minute black     a
and shining bead, closely attached to the skin of the head, and concealed

1870.]                   Organs     of Vision in   the Common          Mole.             325
by the hair so completely that it is difficult sometimes to discover it. In
removing the skin the small globe is easily detached at the same time, and
no indication remains of the exact position in which it was situated. This
shows that in the Mole the cavity of the orbit is wanting, and that the
structures usually found in the vicinity of the eye are in a different condition
from that which they present in other mammalia.          It is necessary, there
fore, to divide the skin around  the  base of the eye in order to preserve the
connexion between the globe and the subjacent tissues.
  Beneath the eye, and forming a basis on which it rests, is                   "a   firm mass
of cellular fibrous       tissue which assumes on dissection a fusiform shape, with
an attenuated portion passing towards the base of the    skull." The filament
becomes      so exceedingly delicate          in the     of the orbit that the
                                                         deeper part
difficulty of ascertaining its precise condition is probably the reason of the
difference of opinion on the subject.
     In Mr. Solly-s specimen there             was found to be no attachment whatever
of the filament to the            base    of the skull   ;   but in a former dissection of   a
smaller, and probably younger specimen, the continuity between the bone
and the tissue was evident.
   The filament of tissue above described, and the connexion which it
formed between the eye and the skull, induced me to examine it microsco
pically,  in order to ascertain whether it contained nervous fibres, or
possessed any of the characters of the optic nerve.
   It exhibited a tendency to divide in a longitudinal direction when needles
were applied to       and presented the appearance of cellular tissue, without,
                        it,
however, any trace of nerve-fibre.          will be seen nevertheless, from the
                                                 It
description  of the   optic nerve in the  foetal Mole, that this delicate thread
is the only vestige which remains of that important part of the organs of
vision in the full-grown Mole.
   With regard to some minute branches of nerves and blood-vessels which
pass into the tissue forming the base of the eye, both on its outer and
inner side,   it  not in my power to say definitely from whence they come,
                   is
as their minute size prevented me from tracing them in the deeper part of
the orbit to their points of exit from the skull.
   The eye of the full-grown Mole presents          surface uniformly black and
                                                             a
glistening, in which there      no indication of cornea and sclerotic distinct
                                    is                       a
from one another, nor any evidence of an iris or pupillary aperture.
Within the globe, when ruptured with the points of needles,              layer ofa
black pigmentary particles was found to line the internal surface                      of the
dense structure which corresponds to the sclerotic.

contents of the globe of the eye, though, as will be seen, those structures
exist in foetal life.

  Ou raising the anterior lobes gently from the                      base   of the skull, it   was
ascertained     that no nerves        connected the brain with the bone anterior to
the fifth pair.     The     base    of the brain also exhibited an entire absence of the
optic nerves      beyond a        vestige in a very minute chiasms, as described by
Mr. Solly.
  Ou examining the internal surface of the                    base    of the skull, the usual
foramina for the optic nerves are found to be wanting, a condition which
is observed with facility in the dried specimens in the Museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons.              Among        these there is one in which there is a
vestige of an optic foramen           on the left side     of the   head, while on the oppo
site side the surface is smooth and perfect.
  In the arrangement of the details which                  have     been given above      of the
appearances     observed      in the course of the examination, attention has been
directed to three points in particular, namely to the condition of that part
of the optic nerve which is situated externally to the skull, and which
exists as a mere thread of connective tissue ; secondly, to the eye itself,
and  the structures within, so far as it was necessary to consider them in
their efficiency for optical purposes ; thirdly, to the internal surface of the
skull in its relation to the part of the brain from which the optic nerves
take their origin.
   The following description of the various structures in the foetal Mole
will be more general than the above account of them in the full-grown
Mole, as five specimens instead of one were examined.
   On the removal of the skin and a layer of muscular tissue subjacent, a
part of the globe of the eye is exposed.  When the whole side of the face
and the temporal region are dissected, the eye is found to be in close
proximity to the large branch of the facial nerve, as is represented in the
drawing accompanying this account.
  The eye has the usunl appearance presented by the organ in most foetal
mammalia ; in form globular, and in size proportionate to the head of the
animal   ;   the cornea translucent         ;   the sclerotic perfectly distinct, and of
dense    white tissue   ;    the iris apparent through         the cornea, with a clear
pupillary aperture.
  Between the eye and the facial nerve        small portion of the optic nerve
                                                       a
is seen in the superficial dissection, and appears to form an upright peduncle
for the globe.
  It is necessary to divide the seventh pair in order to examine the deeper
parts of the orbit.  When the dissection is completed, and the optic nerve
exposed in its whole extent, from the eye to the base of the cranium, the
branches of the fifth pair of nerves are brought into view.         The main
branch of the second division of the fifth nerve lies a little below the optic
nerve, parallel with        it,
                       and supplies large and numerous branches to the
anterior part of the face.   There    no necessity to describe minutely the
                                                is
appearance presented    in the deep dissection of the orbit, as    observed        I
nothing unusual to require particular notice.      There are some minute

 muscles attached to the globe which do not admit of separation into
 distinct parts, but completely surround the posterior half of the globe.
    To   trace the optic nervethrough its foramen to the brain was success
 fully accomplished in only one dissection. After exposing the optic nerve
 and the eye completely, all the surrounding parts were removed, and a sec
tion made through the skull so as to exhibit a lateral view of the interior of
the cranium.
   The brain itself was disorganized in all the young specimens ; but in the
dissection just alluded to the optic nerve was seen to pass through the base
of the skull, and to enter the membranes to a short distance, so that it
would have     been possible,   if   the brain had remained perfect, to trace it to
its origin.
   With   regard to the eye itself, no difficulty was experienced in separating
the iris, choroid, and lens. The other structures usually existing in the
eye had been so long subjected to the influence of the alcohol that            I   could
not determine their condition.
   It must necessarily happen that many interesting observations are made
in the course of an investigation like that which has been briefly described,
and many minute details might have been added to this account ; but it
appeared to me to be desirable to limit the details, as far as possible, to those
which were sufficient to establish the remarkable physiological fact that the
Mole, at the time of birth, is endowed with organs of vision of considerable
perfection, while in mature age it is deprived of the means of sight in con
sequence of certain changes which take place in the base of the skull, ter
minating in the destruction of the most important structures on which the
enjoyment of the sense of sight depends.

  The   Aplanatic Searcher is intended to improve the penetration, amplify
magnifying-power, intensify definition, and raise the objective somewhat
further from its dangerous proximity to the delicate covering-glass indis
pensable   to the observationof objects uuder very high powers.
   The inquiry into the practicability of improving the performance of
microscopic object-glasses of the very finest known quality was suggested
by an accidental resolution in 1862 of the Podura markings into black
beads.   This led to a search for the cause of defective definition, if any
existed.  A variety of first-class objectives, from the   to the   failed to

 idea   of searching the axis of the instrument for aplanatic foci, and that
 many such foci would probably be found to exist in proportion to the
 number of terms in the equations (involving curvatures and positions).
    E. The law was then ascertained that power could be raised, and defi
 nition intensified, by positively correcting the searching lenses in proportion
as    they approached the objective, at the same time               applying  a similar
correction to the observing objective.
    The chief results hitherto obtained may be thus summarized.
    The writer measured the distance gained by the aplanatic                   searcher,
¦whilst observing with a half-inch         objective with a power of seven hundred
diameters, and found it two-tenths of an inch increase; so that optical
penetration was attainable with this high power through plate-glass nearly
one quarter of an inch thick, whilst visual focal depth was proportionably
increased.
    The aplanatic searcher       increases   the power of the microscope from two
and    a  half to   five times the usual power obtained with a          third or C eye
piece of one inch focal length.           The eighth thus acquires the power of a
twenty-fifth, the penetration of a one-fourth.             And at the same time the
lowest possible eyepiece (3-inch focus) is substituted for the deep eye
piece formed of minute lenses, and guarded with a minutely perforated
cap.      The writer lately exhibited to Messrs. Powell and Lealand a bril
liant definition, under a power of four thousand diameters, with their new
" eighth immersion " lens, by means of the searcher and low eyepiece.
    The    traverse    of the aplanatic  searcher   introduces remarkable chromatic
 corrections displayed in the unexpected colouring developed in microscopic
test-objects*.
    The singular properties or, rather, phenomena shown by eidola, enable
the practised observer in many cases to distinguish between true and
delusive appearances, especially when aided by the aberrameter applied to
the objective to display excentrical aberration             by cutting   off excentrical
rays.
     Eidola   are symmetrically     placed on each side of the best focal point, as
ascertained by the aberrameter when the compensations have attained a
delicate balance of opposite corrections.
     If  the beading, for instance, of a test-object exists in two contiguous
parallel planes, the eidola of one set is commingled with the true image of
the other.       But the upper or lower set may be separately displayed, either
by depressing the false eidola of the lower stratum, or elevating the
eidola of the upper ; for when the eidola of two contiguous strata are in
 termingled, correct definition is impossible so long as the aperture of the
objective remains considerable.

        III. " On      a  Cause of   Error in Elcctroscopic Experiments."
   By Sir   Charles Wheatstone, F.R.S.                 Received   April    26,  1870.
     To arrive at accurate conclusions from the indications of an electroscope
or electrometer, it is necessary to be aware of all the sources of error which
 may occasion these indications to be misinterpreted.
     In the course of    some experiments on electrical conduction      and induction
which    I have recently resumed,       I was frequently   delayed by what at first
appeared     to  be  very puzzling    results.  Occasionally   I found that I could
not discharge the electrometer with my finger, or only to a certain degree,
and that it was necessary, before commencing another experiment, to place
myself in communication with a gas-pipe which entered the room. How
I   became charged       I could not  at that time explaiu  ; the following chain of
observations and experiments, however, soon led me to the true solution.
     I was sitting at a table not far from the fireplace with the electrometer
(one of Peltier's construction) before me, and was engaged in experimenting
with disks of various, substances. To ensure that the one I had in hand,
which was of tortoiseshell, should be perfectly dry, I rose and held it for a
minute before the fire; returning and placing it on the plate of the elec
trometer,   I   was surprised to find that it had apparently acquired a strong
charge, deflecting the index of the electrometer beyond 90°.              I found that
the same thing took place with every disk I thus presented to the fire,
whether of metal or any other substance.            My first impression was that
the disk had been rendered electrical by heat, though it would have been
extraordinary     that,   if so, such a result had not been observed before;       but

on   placing it in contact with
                             a vessel of boiling water, or beating it by a
gas-lamp, no such effect was produced.   I next conjectured that the phe
nomenon might arise from a difference in the electrical state of the air in
the room and that at the top of the chimney ; and to put this to the proof,
I   adjourned to the adjacent room where there was no fire, and bringing my
disk to the fireplace  1 obtained precisely the same result.  That this con
jecture, however, was not tenable was soon evident, because I was able to pro
duce the same deviation of the needle of the electrometer by bringing my disk
near any part of the wall of the room. This seemed to indicate that different
parts    of the room      were in different electrical states   ;   but this again was dis
proved by finding that when the position of the electrometer and the place
where the disk was supposed to be charged were interchanged, the charge of
the electrometer was still always negative. The last resource was to assume
that my body had become charged by walking across the carpeted room,
though the effect was produced even by the most careful treading. This
ultimately proved to be the case ; for resuming my seat at the table and
scraping my foot on the rug, I was able at will to move the index to its
greatest extent.
   Before     I
            proceed further          I   may state that a gold-leaf electrometer shows
the phenomena           as readily.
     "When   I    first observed these effects  the weather was frosty ; but they
present      themselves, as    I   have subsequently found, almost equally well in
all states of      the weather, provided the room be perfectly dry.
     I
    will now proceed to state the conditions which are necessary for the
complete success of the experiments, and the absence of which has pre
vented them from being hitherto observed in the striking manner in which
they have appeared to me.
   The most essential condition appears to be that the boot or shoe of the
experimenter must have a thin sole and be perfectly dry ; a surface polished
by wear seems to augment the effect. By rubbing the sole of the boot
against the carpet or rug, the electricities are separated, the carpet as
sumes the positive state and the sole the negative state ; the former being
a tolerable insulator, prevents the positive electricity from running away to
the earth, while the sole of the foot, being a much better conductor, readily
allows the charge of negative electricity to pass into the body.
   So effective is the excitation, that if three persons hold each other by
the hands, and the first rubs the carpet with his foot while the third touches
the plate of the electrometer with his finger, a strong charge is communi
cated to the instrument.
   Even approaching the electrometer by the hand or body, it becomes
charged by induction at some distance.
   A stronger effect is produced on the index of the instrument          after     if,
robbing the foot against the carpet,         be immediately raised from it.
                                                  it
When the   two  are  in contact, the electricities are in some degree coerced
or dissimulated       ;   but when they are separated,      the whole of the negative

electricity becomes free and expands itself in the body.    A single stamp on
the carpet  followed by an immediate removal   of the foot canses  the indes of
the electrometer to advance several degrees, and by a reiteration of such
stamps the index advances 30° or 40°.
   The opposite electrical states of the carpet and the sole of the boot were
thus shown : after rubbing, I removed the boot from the carpet, and placed
on the latter  a proof-plate     e.    small disk of metal with an insulating
                                       (t.        a
handle),  and  then  transferred    to  the plate of the electrometer

the sole of the boot     very small charge was carried, by reason of its ready

  The negative charge assumed by sole-leather when rubbed with animal
hair was thus rendered evident.    placed on the plate of the electrometer

              negative

to advance several degrees.
   At the Meeting of the British Association at Dublin in 1857, Professor
Loomis, of New York, attracted great attention by his account of some re
markable electrical phenomena observed in certain houses in that city.                            It
appears that in unusually cold and dry winters, in rooms provided with
thick carpets and heated by stoves or hot-air apparatus to "0°, electrical
phenomena of great intensity are sometimes produced.     A lady walking
along   carpeted floor drew
           a                spark one quarter of an inch in length
                                       a                                                         be
tween two metal balls, one attached to                    a   gas-pipe, the other touched   by   her
hand      ;    she also fired ether, ignited          a gaslight, charged a Leyden jar, and
repelled and attracted pith-balls                 similarly or dissimilarly electrified. Some
of    these statements were
                         received with great incredulity at the time both
here  and abroad, but they have since been abundantly confirmed       the                   by
Professor himself and by others.    (See Silliman's American Journal

The Baeerian Lecture was delivered by John W. Dawson, LL.D.,
       F.R.S., &c, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of M'GM College,
       Montreal, " On the Pre-Carboniferous Floras of North-Eastern
       America, with especial reference to that of the Erian (Devonian)
       Period." The following is an Abstract.
   The attention of the author   was first directed to the Devonian as distin
guished from the Carboniferous flora by the discovery, on the part of Sir
W. E. Logan, in 1843, of some remarkable remains of plants in the Sand
stones   of Gaspe, Canada.    In 1859, after visiting Gaspe to study these
plants in situ, the author published descriptions of them, and more parti
cularly of the two characteristic Lower-Devonian genera Prototaxites and
Psilophyton, in the Journal of    the Geological   Society.
   Subsequently additional material was obtained by personal investigation
of the Devonian of Maine and New Brunswick, and, through the kindness
of Prof. James Hall, from that of New York.            These additional plants
were also published in the  Journal of the Geological Society.
   Still more recently, a thorough re-examination of the Gaspe beds, the
systematic exploration of the plant-bearing beds near St. John by Prof.
Hartt, and fresh collections made by Prof. Hall have enabled the author
to prepare a catalogue of 121 species, and to attempt a thorough revision

334      Pre-Curboniferous Floras of North-Eastern           America.       [May 5,
of   the Erinn flora, aud an investigation of its conditions       of   growth     and
relations to the Carboniferous flora.
    The term " Erian" is applied to the formations included between the
top of the Upper Silurian and the base of the Carboniferous, on account of
the uncertainties which have attended the subdivision and limitation             of the
Devonian of Europe, and also on account of the immense area occupied bj
these beds on the south and west of Lake Erie, and their admirable deve-
lopment with regard to subdivisions and fossils.          The name "Erie Divi
sion" was also that originally applied to this typical series by the geologists
of the Survey of New York.
    A large part of the paper       was occupied with the revision of the Erian
flora, including      the description of twenty-three new species, and more
ample descriptions of others previously known only in fragments.                  Large
trunks of Prototaxites, from the base of the Lower Devonian, were de
scribed, and full details given of the form, structures, and fructification            of
two species      of Psilophyton.     The new genus Ormoxyton was             described.
The    genus   Cyclostigma was noticed, as represented by two species in Ame
rica, and its foliage and fruit described for the first time.         The genera of
the Erian Ferns were examined and corrected, and several interesting trunki
and stipes belonging to Tree-ferns were described.         The fruits of the genu
 Cardiocarpum were illustrated with reference to their structure.                    The
occurrence of Lepidophloios, Calamodendron, and other forms in the               Middle
Devonian was noticed for the first time.
    The third part of the memoir was occupied with comparisons and general
conclusions.       At the close of the Upper- Silurian period there was a great
subsidence     of the land iu Eastern America, proved by the wide extent of
the marine beds of the Lower Helderberg (Ludlow) group.                It was on the
small areas of Lower-Silurian and Laurentian land remaining after thu
subsidence      that the oldest land plants known in the region nourished.
Re-elevation occurred early in the Devonian period, and the known flora
receives    considerable extension in the shallow-water       beds    of   the Lower
Erian.     The    subsidence  indicated by the great Corniferous limestone inter
rupted these conditions        on the west side of the Appalachians, but not on
their eastern side.       At the close of this we find the rich Middle- Devonian
flora, which diminishes toward the close of the period ; and, after the phy
sical disturbances which on the east side of the Appalachians terminated
the Erian age, it is followed by the meagre and quite dissimilar flora of the
 Lower Carboniferous ; and this, after the subsidence indicated by the Car
boniferous limestone, is followed by the Coal-formation flora.
    If  we   compare the Erian and Carboniferous floras, we find that the
leading genera of the latter are represented in the former, but, for the
most part, under distinct specific forms, that the Erian possesses some
genera    of its own, and that many Carboniferous genera have not yet been
 recognized in the Erian.       There is also great local diversity in the Brian
 flora, conveying the impression that the conditions affecting the          growth of

 plants were more    varied,  and the facilities for migration    of  species less ex
 tensive, than in the Carboniferous.
    In comparing the Erian flora of America with the Devonian of Europe,
 we meet with the difficulty that little is known of the plants of the Lower
and Middle Devonian in Europe. There are, however, specimens in the
 Museum of the Geological Survey which show, in connexion with facts
which can be gleaned from the works of continental writers, that Psilo-
phyton occupied the same important place in Europe which it did in Ame
rica ; and in the Upper Devonian the generic forms         are very similar, though
the species are, for the most part, different.
    In  Eastern America no land flora is known below the Upper Silurian ;
and even in that    series the plants found are confined to the genus Psilo-
phyton. Independently, however, of the somewhat doubtful Lower- Silu
rian plants stated to have been found in Europe, there are indications, in
the Lower-Erian flora, that it must have been the successor of a Silurian
flora as yet almost unknown to us ; and the line of separation between this
old flora and that of the Devonian proper seems to be at the base of the
 Middle Devonian.
    In applying these facts and considerations to the questions relating to the
introduction and extinction of species, and the actual relations of successive
floras, it was proposed to compare what might be called specific types, — that
is, forms which in any given period could not be rationally supposed to be
genetically related. Of such specific types, at least fifty may be reckoned
in the Erian flora ; of these, only three or four are represented in the Car
boniferous by identical species, while about one half are represented by
allied species.   The remainder have no representatives.
    A Table of specific types of the Erian was given, and its bearing shown
on the questions above referred to ; and the hope was expressed that by
separating such types from doubtful species and varietal forms, some pro
gress might be made towards understanding, at least, the times and con
ditions in which specific types were introduced and perished, and the range
of varietal forms through which they passed.

    Marie- Jean Pierre Flourens,            elected Foreign Member      of the Royal
Society in    1835, wag    born at Maureilhan,      near Beziers,    Department of
Herault, in April 1794.        He studied Medicine at Montpellier, where he
took his Doctor-s degree at the age of nineteen, and in the year following
went to Paris.     There he made the friendship of various eminent men,
— of whom are noted especially Chaptal and Frederick Cuvier, — and
devoted himself to the pursuit of Biological science, in which he soon
attained reputation as a writer and original inquirer.             His earliest and
most important labours were directed towards the investigation of the
functions of the nervous system, and on his experimental researches and
writings on this department of Physiology, which continued afterwards
to be his favourite pursuit, his scientific reputation may be said mainly to
rest.   The first fruits of these researches were made known in three
Memoirs presented to the Academy of Sciences of Paris in 1822 and
1823; and subsequently published in an independent work entitled " Re-
cherches Experimentales sur les proprieties et les fonctions du systeme
nerveux dans les anirnaux vertfebrés."        Paris 1824.     Of this a second and
greatly extended edition appeared in 1842, containing the substance of
Memoirs presented to the Academy since the publication of the first edi
tion, with applications of the author-s doctrines to pathology and surgery,
researches  on the reunion    of divided nerves, on the movements of the brain,
on the pulsation   of arteries, and on the effects of section of the semicircular
canals  of the ear — also an extension of his previous inquiries to reptiles
and fish.
   Following in the line of Haller, Zinn, Lorry, Saucerotte, Magendie, and
others, Flourens endeavoured, by inflicting injuries experimentally on the
cncephalon and spinal cord, but especially by studying the effect of removal
of definite portions of these organs, to assign the specific offices of the
several parts of the cerebrospinal centre ; and whatever difference of opinion
may prevail as to some of the physiological conclusions at which he arrived,
it must be admitted that his experiments, which have for the most part
been   confirmed by later inquirers, have served in large measure as a basis
of subsequent reasoning on the subject.
   On his first coming to Paris Flourens became a writer in the ' Revue
Encyclopédique,'     and contributed articles to the ' Dictionnaire classique
d-Histoire Naturelle,- and in the course of his life published numerous
papers on different anatomical and physiological subjects, besides that with
which he was more enduringly occupied.            The titles of these papers (up to
1863) form a goodly array in the Royal Society-s Catalogue, to which we
refer for details.   The more notable of them are on the nutrition and
growth of bone, on the structure of the skin and mucous membranes and
on the epidermis and its appendages      in man and animals, on the mechanism
of Rumination, on vomiting in ruminants and its non-occurrence in the
Horse, on the vascular connexion of mother and foetus, &c., while some are
on questions  of anthropology, comparative psychology, and natural history         ;

but although these writings are for the most part founded                 on actual
observation and real work, it can scarcely be said that they              rue above
mediocrity.
    Flourens's  first and most important         memoir    on the nervous     system
became     the subject of a commendatory and most instructive report by
Baron Cuvier in 1822, whose friendship and favour he thenceforth enjoyed.
Cuvier    a few years after (in 1828) intrusted Flourens (as his deputy) witb.
the delivery of the lectures on Natural History at the College of France,
and two years later appointed him in like manner to give the lectures on
Human Anatomy at the ' Jardin du Roi,' in which appointment lie wascon-
firmed as Professor in 1832.         In   1835 he became    Professor in  the College
of France.
    Though rising in fame, it         was   probably through CuvieTS influence,
more immediately, that Flourens was in 1828 elected a Member of the
Institute, in succession to Bosc. In 1833 he was appointed one of the
perpetual Secretaries, on the retirement of Dulong.           In this latter canity
he furnished from time to time eloges of various distinguished members ot
the Academy deceased during his tenure of office.              These productions of
his pen, as well as his official reports and his writings generally, were
highly    esteemed   for their literary merit, and no doubt led to the          much-
coveted distinction he received of being elected into the Academie               Fran-
yaise in 1840.
    While recognizing M. Flourens's undoubted merits, we             are nevertheless
 constrained to remark that, measured          by them, his career   as regards bolt
 social and scientific distinction,    was singularly   prosperous.     Besides hold
ing a highly influential position in affairs of science, he was elected »
Member of the Chamber of Deputies for the Arrondissement of Beziersin
 1837, and in 1840' he was created a Peer of France.               He still, however,
retained his professorship, and suffered neither honours nor revolutions to
interrupt his scientific work.         In his latter years he was affected with
softening of the brain, ending in general paralysis, to which he succumbed,
at his country seat Mont Geron, in the Department of Seine at Oise, on the
 Gth   of December    1807.    He   has left three sons.
    Peter Mark Roget, M.D.,             died on the 12th of September, 1869, in
his 91st year.      For the last 54 years he had been a Fellow of the Society,
and during 21 of these had filled the office of Secretary.                The earlier
 events of his life belong to a former page of the world's history, and to a
generation that has passed away. He was bom in London, in Broad Street,
 Soho, on the 18th of January, 1779.
     His father, the Rev. John Roget, was        a native of Geneva. When about
 25 years old he came to reside in London,        as Minister of the French Church
 in Threadneedle Street, founded by Edward VI., and             was, two years   after
 wards, united in marriage with Catherine,         only surviving sister of the illus
 trious Sir Samuel Romilly, then        a  young man of about 20, between whom

                                         xxix
and Mr. Roget a warm friendship had arisen, together with sentiments of
the highest mutual esteem.         The subject of the present memoir was the
only son of this marriage.
    He had the misfortune to lose his excellent father very early in life.
Not five months alter his birth his parents were compelled to leave him in
England and hasten to Geneva, on account of Mr. Roget- s declining health.
Two years afterwards the child was brought to them by bis uncle, Mr.
Bomilly, who was then studying the law ; and in two years more, under
the same escort, the widowed mother returned to England with her son,
and a daughter that had been        born a few weeks only before the father-s
death, which event happened in May 1783.
    In the following year the Itogets resided in Kensington Square, in the
family of Mr. Chauvet, of Geneva, who kept a private school, where much
of the character of parental intimacy      was infused into the ordinary relations
of teacher and pupil.     Here the boy     received   the rudiments   of education   ;
but he was no doubt mainly indebted for his early training to the devoted
care   of his mother, who was admirably       qualified for the task, not only by
her mental acquirements, but by a systematic habit of mind, which was in
herited by her son iu a marked degree.          At a very early age, moreover, he
began the practice    of self-instruction  ; and having conceived     a  strong taste
for mathematical studies, which he pursued without aid or even encourage
ment from others, he soon made considerable progress in the elements of
science.
    Although from time to time returning to Kensington, Mrs. Roget and
her two children spent the greater part of the ten years next after her
husband-s death in short sojourns in the provinces.           This was an eventful
period of history ; and, late in life, Dr. Roget remembered how, during a
summer spent at Malvern, the news arrived of the taking of the Bastille,
and    how while at Dover they used to see the emigrants landing from
France and thanking God for their deliverance.              In the year 1 793, the
mother with her two children took up their residence in Edinburgh, where
 Roget, then 1-1 years old, was entered at the University, which was then
 at the height of its fame.      During the first two years of his residence there
 he attended the classes of Humanity (Dr. Hill), Greek (Mr. Dalzell),
 Chemistry    (Dr. Black), Natural Philosophy (Greenfield), and Botany (Dr.
 Rutherford).
    In the summer of 1 795 his studies were agreeably varied by a tour in
 the  Highlands, in company with his uncle Bomilly and their attached
frietid Mr. Dumont, well known in connexion with the writings of Bcntham,
and as author    of the 'Souvenirs sur Mirabeau.-         To the early guidance of
 the last-mentioned companion, who took a warm interest in his welfare,
 and was at especial pains to aid the cultivation of his intellect, Dr. Roget
 was wont to attribute the enlightened       principles which governed bis con
duct throughout life.      He entered the medical school in the ensuing win
 ter, and attended during      that and the two following      years,   the lectures
                                                                      d   2

 Allen on the Animal Economy, Drs. Wilson and Gregory on the Practice of
 Medicine, Dr. Hamilton on Midwifery, Dr. Home on Materia Media, Dr.
 Duncan and Mr. James Russell's Clinical Lectures, and, to his es^iecial
 interest and delight, those on Moral Philosophy, by Professor Dugild
 Stewart, from whom he received        much kindness, and for whom        he always
 expressed    a peculiar regard.   While thus diligently   engaged, he was in    the
 summer of 1/97 prostrated for a time by a severe attack of typhus few,
 which he caught in the wards of the Infirmary, and which nearly proved
 fatal.    On the 25th of June, 1798, he took his degree of M.D., being then
 only 19 years of age.      The subject of his thesis, which he dedicated to his
 uncle Romilly, was " De Chemicse Affiuitatis Legibus."            In the same year
 he wrote a letter to     Dr. Beddoes on the non-prevalence of consumption
 among Butchers,      Fishermen,  &c, which is published in that writer's ' Essay
 on the Causes &c. of Pulmonary Consumption,' Loudon, 1799.
     After  a summer and autumn spent in a trip to the       Falls of the Clyde  and
 the English Lakes, and     a succession of visits to  Dr. Darwin at Derby,      Mr.
 Keir (the Chemist) near Birmingham, Dr. Beddoes at Clifton, and the
 Marquis of Lansdowne at Bowood, Dr. Roget came to London and con
 tinued his professional studies, first at Dr. Willan's Dispensary in Carey
 Street, and shortly after as a pupil of St. George's Hospital, where he at
 tended Dr. Baillie's lectures in the early part of 1799.           In that year he
 wrote a letter to Davy on the effects of the respiration of the then new sis
 (oxide of azote, or nitrous oxide), which communication appears ia Sir
 Humphry Davy's 'Researches,' published in 1800.
    In October 1 800, Dr. Roget spent six weeks with Mr. Jeremy           Bentham,
who it is understood consulted him at that time upon a scheme which he
was concocting for the utilization of the sewage of the metropolis. It may
easily be imagined with how great an interest that most remarkable man
was regarded by the young physician.          In November he        began to attend
Abemethy's      lectures at St. Bartholomew's   Hospital.
    At the end of the following year he went to Manchester on an engage
ment to travel with the two sons of Mr. John Philips of that town; and
it was while thus employed that he met with an adventure which he ever
after regarded as forming the great crisis of his life. The peace of Amiens
having thrown open the continent to English tourists, Dr. Roget and his
two pupils spent about three months in Paris in the early part of ISfc',
and thence proceeded in the summer to Geneva, having for their travelling
companion thither Mr. Lovell Edgeworth, brother of the authoress Maria
Edgeworth.       There Dr. Roget found his old friend and preceptor Chauvet,
and stayed for some time at his house.        The succeeding winter was spent
amidst the congenial society of Geneva, and in forming plans for a summer
tour in Switzerland.       These prospects were, however, suddenly dispelled
by the news of the rupture of peaceful relations between England and
France, of which country Geneva then formed          a part.

                                               xxxi
     This was soon followed by Bonaparte's celebrated order to arrest all the
  English then in France, and above eighteen years of age. On the first
  rumour which reached Geneva of this measure on the part of the First
  Consul,   Dr. Roget determined to retire at once with his pupils into Swit
  zerland ;  but on attempting to do so discovered, to his dismay, that the
  most active measures had been taken to prevent their escape.                  Their only
  course was to submit.          The two Plulipses       were  passed    as under 18, but
  Roget was detained prisoner on parole.
     This state of things lasted for about six weeks            ;  and in the mean time
 fresh rumours reached Geneva of             a  contemplated deportation of the Eng
 lish prisoners into the interior.
     While Dr. Roget was considering what             steps he should take under these
 circumstances, he suddenly received the startling intelligence that in about a
  week's time all the English in Geneva were to be sent to Verdun, and that
 those in Switzerland were already arrested.
     Dr. Roget then, as a last resource, applied to the authorities for exemp
 tion from arrest, on the ground that he was entitled to the rights of a
 citizen of Geneva by virtue of his descent from Genevesc ancestors.                  This
 claim   was fortunately admitted        ;  and two days afterwards        he saw the rest
 of the English, with poor Edgeworth among them,                  set out for Verdun.
    Dr. Roget and his young companions now lost                    no time in leaving the
 country, but a long detour had still to be made ere they could reach Eng
land. The French were rapidly extending their boundaries westward, and
 the travellers found it necessary to proceed by way of Stuttgart, Frankfort,
Leipsick, Potsdam, Berlin, Lubeck, and Husum, whence they sailed for
England, reaching Harwich on the 22nd of November.                        On the way the
elder Philips    fell ill of   a  fever,   which    detained  them    for   two months at
 Frankfort.      Dr. Roget thereby made acquaintance with the celebrated
anatomist     Soemmering, whom he called to his aid in attending the patient.
    In the spring of 1804 he repaired to Edinburgh with the intention of
pursuing his studies, but was called from thence to Bath to attend upon
 the Marquis of Lansdowne, whom lie accompanied to Harrogate, and after
wards to Bowood, as his private physician, remaining with him till the 1 1th
of   October.
    Being then in his 26th year, and desirous of establishing himself in
practice, he took up his residence in Manchester, where, on the death of
Dr. Percival, there appeared to be an opening in his profession. He                    was
in the same month appointed one of the physicians to the Infirmary,                     an
institution comprising       a   large Hospital and Dispensary,           a  Fever House,
and a Lunatic Asylum. Dr. Roget is regarded as having, in conjunction
with his colleagues, Mr. Gibson and Mr. Hutchinson, laid the foundation
of the Medical School in Manchester. In the winter of 1805-6 he gave
with them, a joint course of lectures to the pupils of the hospital on Ana
tomy and Physiology, himself taking the latter subject and delivering
eighteen lectures from 29th January to 31st March, 1806.

                                               xxxii
    In the midst of this apparent devotion to pursuits                 for which    he  hid
 shown so much natural              taste,   and which    seemed   to promise     him   suc
 cess in life, he, strange as         it may appear, accepted in November ISOothe
 appointment of private secretary to Lord Howick, then Secretary of Slate
 to the Foreign Department, and afterwards Earl Grey.                       He verv soon,
 however, became conscious of a dislike for the service, and quitted it in a
 mouth, returning to Manchester, where he busied himself                        again   in in
 occupation in which he was destined to rise to eminence.                   In  the lectures
 he had already delivered he had introduced, in addition to the subject of
 Human Physiology, as already taught in the school, a comparative survey
 of  the functions      of animals, with       a view to its forming a useful branch         of
 general     knowledge.       Encouraged       by this first attempt, he commenced,          in
 January      1 807, a mofe   popular    course  on  the Physiology   of the  Animil     King
 dom, at the rooms of the Philosophical and Literary Society. This Society
 numbered among its then members men of high distinction in                       science and
 general attainments.           In its proceedings Dr. Roget took an             active   part,
 and   he was one       of its Vice-presidents.        His lectures,   fifteen in     number,
 were    delivered in the evenings twice           a  week, and were well      attended     and
 highly    esteemed.
    Dr. Roget resigned his post at the Infirmary in                   October       1SOS, and
 transferred the scene of his labours to London, where                he established       him
 self in the following January in a house in Bernard Street, Russell Square,
 and on the 3rd of March was admitted Licentiate of the Royal College of
 Physicians.        He lost no time in commencing on a wider field, the career
 which had       been  indicated to him by his success in Lancashire.               An oppor
 tunity soon offered itself.           The Russell Literary and Scientific Institution
 had been opened        in  the  preceding year under the management of a number
 of distinguished residents in the neighbourhood, including his uncle, then
 Sir Samuel Romilly, Mr. James Scarlett (afterwards Lord Abinger), Mr.
 Francis Horner, &c; and Dr. Roget and Mr. Pond (the Astronomer Royal i
were chosen to inaugurate the first lecture season, in the spring of                  1809, by
 the delivery     of two   courses   of twelve afternoon lectures, the one on Animal
Physiology,       the other on    Astronomy.         Dr. Roget's course, repeated in Ibe
following year, proved to          be the first of a long series on his favourite <nb-
ject, which established for him            a high reputation, in a career of more than
thirty    years'   duration as    a  public lecturer.      It will be convenient here to
give   a  list of these courses.
    Besides     his lectures at Manchester in 1806 and 1807, and at the Russell
Institution in 1809 and 1810, he lectured on the same subject at theBoya1
Institution in the spring of 1812, 1813, 1814, 1822, and 1823; at the
London Institution in the spring of 1 824 ; at the two last-named p!i«>
concurrently in the spring of 1825 ; in 1826, at the London Institution in
the spring, and at the new Medical School in Aldersgate Street in the:
autumn ; aud finally at the Royal Institution in the spring of 1835, IW,
and 1837, as the first Fullerian Professor, to which chair he was norm

                                          xxxiii
nated by the founder, Mr. John Fuller. In these courses, which num
bered from ten to eighteen lectures each, his favourite arrangement of the
subject was that which he had adopted in 1807. After a general survey of
 Cuvier's classification, he would treat, first, of the mechanical functions ;
secondly, the chemical functions, circulation, respiration, and nutrition ;
and thirdly those of the nervous system, and the intellectual faculties.
 At     Aldersgate     Street he also   dealt with   the function     of reproduction
 and     evolution.     Sometimes, however, he divided his subject zoologically,
 and dealt separately with each class of animals. In his earlier lectures
 he made Human Physiology the basis of his comparison, which plan
 he appears to have gradually exchanged for that in which the interest rises
 as the      scheme   of nature is reviewed in  successive   stages from the lower to
 the higher orders of         the animal  kingdom.     At   the Royal   Institution in
  1825 and       1830, and at the   London Institution in 1826, he confined him
 self to      one department, namely, that    of the External Senses.      The intro
 ductory lecture at the Aldersgate School was published by Longman and Co.
 in 1826, and of many of his lectures he furnished the abstracts published
  in the Literary Gazette. In all these discourses Dr. Roget kept in view
  what he had announced at Manchester as his leading object, namely, "to
  point out, on the plan pursued by Dr. Paley, those proofs of infinite wis
  dom and benevolence which are displayed in every part of the universe,
  but which are nowhere so eminently conspicuous as in the structure and
   economy of the animal creation."
       In October 1809 he projected the foundation of the Northern Dispen
   sary, which, with the cooperation of many influential neighbours, was opened
   in the following June, with Dr. Roget as its physician.           The active duties
   of this office he performed gratuitously for the next eighteen years. In
    1825 he was presented with a handsome piece of plate by the patron and
    governors.      In 1810 he began to lecture on the Theory and Practice of
    Physic at the Theatre of Anatomy, Great Windmill Street, in conjunction
    with Dr. John Cooke, who two years afterwards resigned him his share of
    the undertaking.       Dr. Roget then delivered two courses a year until 1815.
    Among his colleagues there, were Sir Benjamin Brodie, Sir Charles Bell,
    Mr. Brande, and other leading men of science.
        In 1811 he was chosen one of the secretaries of the Medical and Chi-
     rurgical Society of London, of which he had been one of the earliest pro-
     motors in conjunction with his friends Drs. Marcet and Yelloly.             In the
     same year he published a paper in the Medico-Chirurgical Transactions,
     vol. ii. p. 136, on
                           " A Case of Recovery from the effects of Arsenic, with
     remarks on a new mode of detecting the presence of this Metal," to which
     he afterwards added a note in vol. iii. p. 342.      In 1812 he wrote an article
     in the Edinburgh Review, vol. xx. p. 416, on P. Huber's ' Recherches sur
     les Mccurs des Fourmis Indigenes.'       He was also the writer of the Review
     in vol. xxv. p. 363, of the same author's 'Nouvelles Observations sur les
     Abeilles.'

     While  engaged    in these avocations, as well as in    professional   practice,
 which about the year 1813 began to be considerable, Dr. Rogetwasnot
 unmindful of his early passion for the exact sciences.           Of Mathematics
 and Natural Philosophy he made a practical study ; and in the year 1814
 he contrived a sliding-rule     so graduated as to be a measure of the        powers
 of numbers, in the      same manner as the scale    of Gunter,   then in    common
 use, was a measure        of their ratios.   It is a logo-logarithmic rule,        the
 slide of which is the common logarithmic scale, while the fhed                 line is
 graduated upon the logarithms of logarithms.            The consequence        is that
 powers are read as easily as products are on the common rule, anil the
 arrangement is such that high powers of quantities little exceeding unity,
 so much wanted in compound interest, statistics, &c, are read off on
 a  single setting.   His paper thereon, which also describes other ingenious
 forms of the instrument, was communicated by Dr. Wollaston to the
 Royal Society, and read on the l/tli of November, 1814.               It  appears    id
the Philosophical Transactions for 1815, p. 9.              It was      through     this
 communication      that he gained admission to the Society.         He was elected
 Fellow on the 16th of        March,   and admitted on the Cth of April, lt>lo.
The date of this epoch in his life is noteworthy in relation to the im
portance which he attached to his deliverance in 1 803 from the clutches
of Bonaparte. The year in which his paper was read was that of his young
friend Edgeworth's release.         The manner in which the interval had been
employed affords a measure of the loss which he and others                would    have
incurred had he been destined to the like exile.
    The next   decade in   Dr. Roget's life was a period of active industry, passed
in the   society of many of the most distinguished men of his time. Besides
his occupations above specified, he employed his pen in the production of
various published writings.        In 1815 he contributed a paper to the Medico-
Chirurgical Transactions, vol. vii. p. 290,
                                                 " Ou a
                                                         Change in the Colour of
the Skin produced by the internal use of Nitrate of Silver." At various
periods between 1815 and 1822 he wrote the following treatises and articles
in the Supplement to the sixth edition of the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica;'
viz. Ant, Apiary, Barthez, Beddoes, Bee, Bichat, Brocklisby,
Broussonet, Camper, Cranioscopy, Currie, Deaf and Dumb, Ki-
i.eidoscope, and Physiology. In 1818 he wrote a letter "On the Kalei
                                     '
doscope" to the Editors of the Annals of Philosophy,' which was published
in vol. xi. p. 375. That year was saddened by the melancholy death otlus
uncle, Sir Samuel Romilly. In July 1820 he was appointed Phvsieian to the
Spanish Embassy, which office he retained for many years. In the same year
he wrote a letter to Mr. Travers on a voluntary action of the Iris, which was
published by Mr. Travers in his work On the Diseases of the Eye;' and
                                            '
an Appendix to Larkin's ' Introduction to Solid Geometry and to the Study
of Crystallography,' in which Dr. Roget demonstrates the ratios subsisting
between the volumes of solids composing the artificial series, together with
the various inclinations of their faces.     In 1821 he wrote " Observations on

                                        XXXV
  Mr. Perkins-s Account of the Compressibility of Water," in the 'Annals of
 Philosophy,- N. S. vol. i. p. 135 ; and in 1822, a Biographical Memoir of
 his valued friend and frequent fellow-worker Dr. Alexander Marcet, in the
 'Annals of Biography and Obituary- for 1823. In 1823 he is quoted by
 Dr. Cooke in his work on Epilepsy, pp. 147, 151, & 215. On the 1st
 of May in the same year he was appointed Physician to the General Peni
 tentiary, Milbank, in conjunction with Dr. P. M. Latham, on the occasion
 of an epidemic dysentery which prevailed among the prisoners.                His
 labours there occupied him for fifteen months ; and in 1824 appeared the
joint report of himself and his colleague to the House of Commons.             In
 the autumn of that year was another great epoch of his life, namely that of
 his marriage.
    Dr. Roget married Miss Hobson, only daughter of Mr. Jonathan Hob-
 son, a merchant of Liverpool.      The union was one of unclouded happiness,
but of short duration.      Mrs. Roget, after giving birth to a daughter and
a son, died in the spring of 1833, of a lingering disease.
    On the 9th of December, 1824, another mathematical paper of Dr. Ro-
get-s wns read at the Royal Society; this is entitled "An Explanation of
an Optical Deception in the appearance          of the Spokes of a Wheel seen
through vertical apertures" (Phil. Trans. for 1825, p. 131) ; and in 1825
he wrote another in the 'Scientific Gazette,- Nov. 5 and 12, "On nn ap
parent violation of the Law of Continuity."         In 1820, besides his " Intro
ductory Lecture," there appeared an article by him on Electro-Magnetism
in the ' Quarterly Review,- being a review of Ampere-s ' Recueil d-Obser-
vations Electro-Dynamiques,-        and Barlow-s ' Essay on Magnetic Attrac
tions;- and an article "On the Quarantine Laws," in the Parliamentary
Review, p. 785.
    In 1827 he received    a   commission, with   Mr. Telford and Mr. Brande,
under the Great Seal, to inquire into the supply of water to the Metropolis,
which resulted in the publication of their report in 1828.
    He began at this time the composition of the series of treatises in the
 '
   Library of Useful   Knowledge-      on "Electricity, Galvanism, Magnetism
 and Electro- Magnetism."        They  were issued  in parts in the years 1827
 1829, and 1831,    and were afterwards published together in one volume.
These treatises were held in considerable repute at the time they were pub
lished, and that on Electricity reached a second edition.          He also wrote
                                     '
the article Galvanism in the Encyclopedia Metropolitana.-                His con

the above treatises  were written, is thus referred to by   Mr. Charles Knight,

Society,  Dr.  Roget  was,   from  his accepted  high  reputation, the most emi
nent of its men of science.      He was a vigilant attendant on its committees ;
a vigilant corrector of its proofs.      Of most winning manners, he was as
beloved as he was respected             Upon all questions of Physiology, Peter

    On the 30th of November, 1 827, Dr. Roget was elected Secretary ot the
Royal Society, on the retirement of Mr. (afterwards Sir John) Herschel.
    In company with his friend Dr. Bostock in 1828, and again with Mrs.
Roget in 1830, shortly after the "three days" revolution of that year, he
revisited Paris, with what recollections it is easy to imagine.     In the former
year a distinguished friend of Dr. Roget's died, for whom he had a        peculiar
veneration, namely Dr. Wollaston, and in 1829 he lost his early           adviser,
 Dumont.      In 1829 and 1830 he occupied the        chair as President of the
 Medical and Chirurgical Society, of which he had ceased to be secretary
                                                                  '
 three years before. In 1828 he wrote an article in the Parliamentary
 Review' on "Pauper Lunatics;"            and in 1831 he contributed to the
 '
   Journal of the Royal Institution of Great Britain,' vol. i. p. 311, a paper
 "On the Geometric Properties of the Magnetic Curve, with an account of
 an Instrument for its mechanical description."       In June in the same year
 he was elected, sjteciali gratia, Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians,
 and in the following May he read the ' Gulstonian Lectures,' for which
 he selected as his suhject
                              " The Laws of Sensation and Perception." Ai
 abstract of them, written by him, appeared in the * London Medical Ga
 zette'   for that month.      In 1832 he furnished the articles         Age.    aid
 Asphyxia to the 'Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine,' published          undertk
 superintendence of his friend Dr. Tweedie.       Before this time, but     at whit
 precise date has not been ascertained, he had written the following articles
 in * Rees's Cyclopaedia ; viz. Sweating Sickness, Symptom, Svnocha,
 Synochus, Tabes, and Tetanus.
     The year 1833 was one of great trial.      The absorbing grief which he
 suffered on the death of his wife made other sorrows seem light ; bat
 several family afflictions occurred at the same time.      Dr. Roget    sought to
 divert his mind in the society of his scientific friends, and in the interest he
 could still take in scientific pursuits.    He attended the Meeting at Cam
 bridge of the British Association, which had been founded two years he-
 fore at York. These gatherings were always a source of great delight and
 interest to him, and he was a frequent attendant at them for the next        thirty
 years. At one or more of the earlier Meetings he filled the chair            of the
 Physiological   Section.
     Fortunately also he was at this time engaged in an undertaking            with
 which his memory will ever be associated, namely, the production of          one of
      '
 the    Bridgewater Treatises.' The most important department of that cele
 brated series, executed under the will of the Earl of Bridgewater, to illus
 trate " the Power, Wisdom, and Goodness of God, as manifested in the
 Creation," had been assigned to Dr. Roget by the late President of the
 Royal Society, Mr. Davies Gilbert, to whom the selection was ei         ojficio in
 trusted.    His treatise, which forms the fifth of the series and       is in two

                                          xxxvii
volumes, has for its title "Animal and Vegetable Physiology considered
with reference to Natural Theology."       As the testator had specified " the
effect of digestion, and thereby of conversion," and " the construction of the
hand of man," as instances of the " reasonable arguments
                                                               "
                                                                  whereby the
collective work was to be illustrated, were departments assigned to other
writers, to be dealt with in separate treatises ; but with these exceptions,
Dr. Roget- s province was to embrace nearly the whole of the physio
logy of the two kingdoms of nature.       Of the manner in which he performed
the task it is needless to speak at length here. As the prescribed purpose of
the work was the very object which he had set before him and retained in view
ever since his early efforts at Manchester,        he naturally adopted the arrange
ment which he had found best in his lectures, and he endeavoured to em
body in the form of a compendium so much of the argument and such of
the illustrations as were adapted to every class of readers, and might
form a useful introduction to the study of Natural History. Since the time
of Roget  the science of Comparative Anatomy has entered upon new phases,
then but dimly foreshadowed ; but still his Bridgewater Treatise may be
read with profit and delight by all, on account of the deeply interesting
nature of the subject, the lucidity of the argument, the variety of illustra
tion, the pure religious tone which pervades            it,
                                                 and the admirable style in
which   it   is
           composed.    Of the work in its original form three editions were
published — the first and second in 1834, and the third      1840; and two
                                                                  in
years before his death, the author   superintended the passing through the
press of fourth edition, published
            a                              by
                                       Messrs. Bell and Daldy.    Dr. Roget
was the last survivor of the authors of the Bridgewater Treatises.
                                                                                 '
   In the    years   and 1835 he held the office of Censor to the Royal
                     18.34
College of Physicians.  In 1837 and subsequent years he took an active
part in the establishment of the University of London, of the Senate of
which he remained     member until his death
                         a                     and in June 1839 he was

appointed Examiner in Physiology and Comparative Anatomy, which office
he held for some years. In 1838 his pen was again employed      the editors by
of the Encyclopaedia Britannica,- to the seventh edition of which he con
        '
tributed the articles        Banes (Sir Joseph ),Phrenology, and Physiology.
The last two were published separately in two volumes. That on Phreno

longing to the former edition.    In the original article he had expressed his
strong dissent from the conclusions of the phrenologists, and this had given
rise to answers on their part, particularly    Mr. George Combe, in " Essays
                                                   by
on Phrenology,"    Edinb. 1819, and by Dr. Andrew Combe           the 'Phreno
                                                                       in

ability with which he had argued his case, Dr. Roget took this opportunity
to reply.    The article "Physiology" was an entirely new and comprehen
sive treatise, describing the various functions of the animal economy.    That
which he had before written under the same title was confined to the phi
losophical department of the subject, containing an analytical investigation

                                       xxxviii
of the several classes of vital powers and their mutual relations, and point
ing out the necessity of distinguishing, more carefully than had been done
oy early inquirers, hetween physical and final causes.    In 1844 Wr.Baget
again travelled abroad, revisited Geneva, and took the opportunity of
attending the Meeting of the Italian Scientific Association held that year
at Milan.
     In other   respects his public life during his long term      of   office as Secretary
was intimately associated with the annals of the Royal Society. In the
course of that time changes had been introduced which rendered thedntks
of the Senior Secretary exceedingly laborious.    Not only did the task of
editing the Proceedings both of the Society and of the Council fall to hii
share, but also that of making and preparing for publication the Abstracti
of Papers read. This labour was performed by Dr. Roget from November
 1827 until his retirement from office in 1848.   Ever devoted to the inte
rests of the Society and to his own important duties, he at times found his
position one of great delicacy, and his name had occasionally to appear in
the front rank of polemical warfare.    On these occasions he maintained his
position by firmness and forbearance, while sometimes smarting under an-
deserved attacks.    On the 7th of November, 1836, a vote of thanks wi
accorded to him by the Society.
     On retiring from     although in his seventieth year, he at once em
                        office,
barked in a laborious undertaking which he had projected many yean be
fore. As long ago as the year 1805 he had formed, for his own use in
literary composition, a small classed catalogue of words, which vocabulary
had often proved of great service to him in his writings.    This he deter
mined to expand into a work of general utility, and after three or four
years of labour he published, as its result, the now well-known 'Thesaurus
of English Words and Phrases, classified and arranged so as to facilitate
the expression of ideas, and assist in Literary Composition.' The appre
ciation which the work has received may be inferred from the fact that it
has reached a twenty-eighth edition.    It first appeared in 1852, and after
running   through two editions, was reduced to a more portable form, and
Stereotyped.    Not the least remarkable part of the work is the arrange
ment, at once philosophical and practical, of the Ideas, which forms the
basis of the classification. The book may be shortly described as the coo-
verse of an ordinary dictionary.  A dictionary sets forth the idea belonging

adopted in all its details Dr. Roget's arrangement, was published in Pans
in 1859, with the title " Dictionnaire Ideologique.   Rccueil des Mots, des
Phrases, des Idiotismes, et des Proverbes de la Langue Fron^aise classes
                                                                                              all
selon l'ordre des Idces."     An imitation of       the original work, but omitting
the phrases from the classification, was also produced in America.
   With the publication of the 'Thesaurus,' Dr. Roget's public career                   may
be said to have closed.  He had for many years retired from practice,                    and

                                        xxxix
now ao increasing deafness excluded him to a great extent from the plea
sures of social intercourse.       This infirmity, which was almost the only
sign of his great age, be bore with patience and resignation.       He had sur
vived all the friends of his youth and most of those of his manhood ; but
he was happy in the possession of mental resources, which enabled him to
indulge, even to his last day, the habits of constant industry which he had
acquired when a boy.         As with advancing age he became less inclined for,
and at last less capable of, deep study or long-sustained thought, his em
ployments partook more of the nature of pastimes ; but both in his selec
tion and pursuit of these there might still be traced the scientific turn of
thought and philosophical love of method which had characterized the
main achievements of his life. The engines he had forged to store his
 mind were uow employed to entertain his leisure. One example of this
 was very remarkable.        At an early period (May 1811) he had attended a
 course of lectures by the celebrated Feinaigle, of whose system of Mnemo
 nics he made constant use throughout life.          This system comprises two
 main devices for a memoria technica.        The one is designed to record chro
 nological facts, or indeed any facts connected with the ordinary succession
 of numbers, the other to impress separate figures upon the memory. The
 first object is accomplished by a methodical arrangement in well-known
 portions of space, such as the sides of a room ; the second by means of
 words    which can be easily remembered, and of which the letters are made
 to represent figures under a conventional rule of interpretation.       Of both
 these sources Dr. Roget had availed himself largely.         He had applied the
 former to a great variety of subjects.       For him familiar places had thus
 an additional   interest.   The houses he   had  lived in, and those of friends
 whom he had visited, the old rooms of the Royal Society at Somerset
 House, and of various Institutions which he frequented, were pictured to
 his mind's eye as peopled with an infinitude of facts, and teeming with
 varied information.       The chronicle of universal history, the measurement
 of earth and sky, the epochs of his life and of those of his contemporaries,
                                                        '
 the sources of his income, the categories of his Thesaurus,' the general
 arrangement of human knowledge, were all recorded in this manner on the
 tablets of his memory.       Of the second device, he had also made extensive
 application.     Logarithms, approximations to surds, and various ratios in
 common use in computation were set by him to doggrel phrases, which it
 was an amusement to repeat to himself as he walked ; and he would some
 times astonish his acquaintance by accurately stating the value of n to forty
 or fifty places of decimals.
     He was always fond of mechanical contrivances, and at one period spent
 much time and labour in attempts to construct a calculating machine. This
 design he abandoned on seeing the beautiful engine of Professor Scheutz,
  of which he at once admitted the superiority.       He also made some progress
  towards the invention of a delicate balance, in which, to lessen the effect
  of friction, the fulcrum was to be within a small barrel floating on water.

  Scientific toys were a source of great delight to him, as has been         already
  seen in his study       of the kaleidoscope. Late in life he amused        himself
  much with conversions of plane rectilinear figures of equal        areas — cutting
  out pieces of card so that they could be differently put together to prove
  the equality, and thereby forming a series of geometrical recreations. He
 was also fond of exercising his ingenuity in the construction as well as the
 solution of chess problems, of which he formed a large collection.              Some
 of those figured in the * Illustrated London News ' were of his               inven
 tion.     To assist persons interested in the same pursuit, he contrived
 and published (in 1845) a pocket chess-board, in which small men of card,
 lying flat on the board, were kept in place by the insertion of their bases
 into folds or pockets in the chequered paper which composed it. In the
 'London       and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine' for          April   1840, there
 is a  "  Description of a Method," which he invented,
                                                                   " of  moving    the
 Knight over      every square   of the chess-board without going     twice over   any
 one ; commencing at a given square         and ending at any other given       square
 of a  different colour."      The complete solution of this problem, which had
 engaged     the  attention   of some of the most eminent mathematicians,           in
 cluding Euler and De Moivre, had never been effected before.
    During his latest years, which were passed in complete retirement, he
 derived great amusement from light epigrammatic literature, still collecting
and classifying according to his wont ; but his chief resource was in the
                   '
pages of his          Thesaurus,' to which he continued to make additions until
the last day of his life.       His constant spirit of cheerfulness as his end drew
nigh, and the kindness and benevolence which endeared him to all around,
befitted   a  life spent in accordance with his belief that the purpose of our
existence     here on earth is that of doing good to our fellow creatures in
furtherance of God's everlasting glory.            After spending last summer at
Malvern in the enjoyment of his usual health, his strength failed him during
the great heat of August, and on the 12th of September he expired, peace
fully and without suffering, from the natural decay of that vital power the
mysterious working of which he had so laboured to illustrate.
    Dr. Roget was also Consulting Physician to Queen Charlotte's Lying-in
Hospital ; Hon. Member of the College of Physicians in Ireland ; Fellow
of the Astronomical, Entomological, Geographical, Geological, and Zoo
logical Societies, and the Society of Arts ; Member of the Royal Institu
tion ; Hon. Member of the Institute of Civil Engineers, of the College of
Physicians in Ireland, and of the Literary and Philosophical                Societies
of Liverpool, Bristol, Quebec, New York, Haarlem, Turin, Stockholm,
and Athens.          He was also a member of a variety of social scientific clubs,
among others, an Honorary Member of the Smeatonian Society of Civil
Engineers ; and he was at the time of his death the
                                                           " father " of the Royal
Society Club, of which he had been a member since 1827.

  The Croonian              Lecture, by Augustus Waller, M.D., F.R.S., of
          Geneva,      "On    Results of the Method introduced by the
                                the
         Author of investigating the Nervous System, more especially as
         applied to the elucidation of the Functions of the Pneumogastric
         and Sympathetic Nerves."     Received May 12, 1870.
                                             (Abstract.)
    Dr. Waller commenced by stating that he had been long engaged in the
 investigation of the nervous system by means of the method which he in
 troduced many years ago.    After drawing attention to the importance of
 the functionsof the nervous system as the seat of all the higher faculties
 which distinguish animals from plants and man from the lower animals, he
 referred briefly to the general constitution and intimate structure               of the ner
 vous system.        It is known       that after   a nerve has been    disconnected from the
 central organs,      its medullary part undergoes        a series of changes. The tu
 bular medulla,       or white        substance, is disintegrated and finally converted
 into dark    granular matter.              On this alteration the author founded his
 method     of investigation, as it    the inquirer to distinguish the altered
                                          enables
from the sound fibres at any point of their course.     Dr. Waller soon ap
plied his method to the study of the sympathetic nerve, and was enabled
thereby to clear up a great part of the mystery which hung over the origin
and     functions    of this   nerve   —a   nerve which supplies and presides         over some
of the most important            organs in the body, the liver, the intestines, the
womb, and especially the blood-vessels.
   In this manner, while associated with Dr. Budge, the author determined
the  part of the spinal cord termed by them the cilio-spinal region, which,
through the part of the sympathetic connected with                     it,
                                                        governs the dilating
fibres of the iris.   In the hands of Prof. C. Bernard, Brown-Sequard,
Dr. Waller, and others the results obtained in this inquiry have shown the
relationof the spinal cord to the important functions which the sympathetic
nerve exercises in regulating the supply of blood in the vessels and, as                     a
consequence, in controlling the general nutrition and temperature of the
body.
   Dr. Waller next applied his method to the elucidation of the functions
of the ganglions or swellings found on the origin of many nerves.
   On dividing the roots of the spinal nerves,    was found, after
                                                             it    csrtain            a

340                   Dr. A. Waller on          the   Investigation of   the        rMay 12,
glion the nervous elements retained all their normal structure, evidently
showing that continuity with the spinal cord does not prevent it from
becoming disorganized, whereas its connexion with the                    intervertebral     gan
glion suffices to preserve its integrity of structure.
      In the divided anterior root the phenomenon takes                  place in an      exactly
inverse manner from the former.                  For in this instance    the central      portion
connected with the spinal cord retains its normal structure, while the distal
part becomes disorganized and reduced to a granular state. We therefore
nrrive at this conclusion, viz. that the spinal cord confers on the anterior
root that unknown vital power whereby its elements resist granular disor
ganization ; whereas for the posterior root, on the contrary, this preserva
tive power is no longer an attribute of the spinal cord, but resides in the
ganglion.
   The author pointed out the important bearings these results had on pa
thology — that henceforth in diseases of the spinal cord and of the brain, «t
had to endeavour in our pathological examinations of these parts to ascer
tain in each case how far the alterations could be referred to the separates
of a part from its trophic centre.
   Dr. Waller then referred to his researches on the Pneumogastric and
Spinal Accessory Nerves.
   If, from among the various nerves of the human body, we were called upon
to point out that which has most exercised the patience and ingenuity of
anatomists and physiologists, we should at once indicate the vagus.                                 lis
distribution to the larynx, the lungs, the heart, and the stomach sho*s ui
ata  glance the important nature of its functions.  At its origin     formed        it is
by roots springing from the medulla oblongata, to which          added after   is
wards    considerable branch from the accessorius, which joins and tninglet
            a
with the pure vagus with which its fibres become intimately blended.                             The
problem to be solved, therefore,  the precise functions of each or
                                           is                                             of   either
(t.   e.   the accessorius    or pure vagus) before their anastomosis.
  In ordinary circumstances nothing would            be more simple than             to uncoref
the nerves and to galvanize each separately, as in the case of an ordinary
spinal pair. But here the case    different.
                                           is In their origin these nerra
are so close to the medulla   oblongata and the blood-vessels that any suck
operation    quickly fatal, and the irritation of the minute roots
                is                                                      each                of
nerve in close proximity renders    impossible to obtain any precise results.

vagus which were distributed to the larynx.      So far the previsions
Charles Bell were confirmed, who compared the internal branch to the an
terior or motor part of spinal pair, and the true vagus with its gangliou
                                a
to the posterior root.  Professor C. Bernard had, however, succeeded n
entirely destroying the power of the accessorius by evulsion of its roots,
and had arrived at the conclusion that all the fibres of this nerve are distri
buted to the laryngeal muscles whose functions are connected with the pro*

                                        Nervous System.                             3H
      daction  of vocal sounds,     while other fibres from the pure vagus        govern
      certain nutritive or organic functions connected with respiration.
        In order   to separate    the functions of the one from the other, we require
     to destroy   all the fibres of the accessorius and leave the others intact, which
     has been   done most effectually by      Dr. Waller's process ; first disconnecting
     the accessorius   from the medulla, on Bernard's plan, mid afterwards allowing
     the  animal to live sufficiently long for the fatty degeneration to take place,
    or about seven     or eight days. The vagus then being galvanized at every
    part of its length, it is found impossible to affect either the action of the
    heart or the stomach, and the only result is to cause slight movements of
    the larynx.
       It is therefore    evident that Sir Charles Bell's ideas respecting this nerve
    are in a great     measure demonstrated by this experiment ; the only excep
   tion being with regard to certain fibres of a motor nature distributed to the
   larynx, which it may be surmised are derived from some anastomotic source,
   and therefore      not contained in the vagus at its origin.      Dr. Waller referred
   to the recent     researches on this subject by Professor Vulpian, MM. Jolliet,
   SchifF, and    Heidenhain,      who have confirmed the results above stated.
       The Lecturer then proceeded to his observations on the pneumogastric
   and   sympathetic nerves        on man in health and in certain affections of the
   nervous system.
       He was first induced to undertake this subject on account of the unsa
  tisfactory results obtained by galvanizing this nerve and the cervical sym
  pathetic on man.           In man this operation is frequently resorted to by me
  dical men,       but in no      case has   any one asserted that any of the known
  symptoms       of irritation of those      nerves, such as stoppage of the heart's
  action, dilatation of the pupil or contraction of the vessels, have been pro
  duced.       The inference is that it is erroneous to suppose that they were in
  any degree      affected by galvanism.        By means of mechanical irritation ap
  plied over these nerves         in the neck, Dr. Waller, in 1862, found that most of
 the known effects of their irritation, such as dilatation of the pupil &c, can
  be induced.         The principal effects thus induced are nausea, tenderness, or
 oppression over the praecordia, and stoppage of the heart's action more
 or less complete;          dilatation of the pupil of the same side, and fall of tem
 perature of the cheek and ear, amounting to 2° or 3° Centigrade, as ascer
 tained by one of Geissler's delicate thermometers.              All these effects corre
 spond to those produced by galvanism on the denuded nerves.                    By means
 of the mechanical irritation of the pneumogastric in cases of vomiting, the
vomiting has been instantly stopped, sometimes returning again imme
diately the irritation was removed ; at other times a permanent relief was
procured.
      He lastly referred to the effects of collapse and syncope produced by the
irritation of these nerves.            This effect was well known to Aristotle, who
attributes it to the compression of the veins, and describes the effects very
accurately in the following passage : —
                                                                          2 d 2

        Dr. Waller has frequently observed the same symptoms, viz. the sudden
   collapse and temporary insensibility ; but in general the effects are confined
   to a state    of depression more or less strong, which may be moderated by gra
   duating the degree of irritation applied.           He believes that this fact may be
   taken advantage of and applied as a means of inducing asthenia or debility
   for the purpose of facilitating certain operations in surgery, such as the
   reducing of fractures or even hernia, in lieu of the administration of other
   anaesthetics,     such as chloroform or tobacco, which present       a certain degree
   of danger not attending the compression of the vagus. In confirmation
  of this idea, he cites a case of reduction of the shoulder-joint in this
  manner : —
       C,    a journeyman baker of powerful athletic frame, dislocated the head
  of the humerus beneath the clavicle by a fall down stairs. While the man
  was     lying   on the bed some unavailing       attempts were made to reduce the
  luxation by Dr. Waller himself, Dr. Prevost, and Dr. Julliard. Dr. Jnl-
  liard, whose patient he was, sent for some chloroform to facilitate the
  operation by inducing anaesthesia.            In the meantime Dr. Waller proposed
  to make another attempt with the assistance of the compression of the
  vagus. After removing the pillows at the head and arranging                  the patient
  more comfortably, Dr. Waller stood at the head of the bed to                 apply com
  pression on both sides, while Dr. Julliard and Dr. Prevost performed ei-
  tension and counter extension.           At the end of about two or three minutes,
j ust when the carotids had ceased to be felt beating beneath the fingers, a
  sudden click indicated the return of the bone into its cavity.
       The Lecturer concluded with the following words : — " In terminating
   his lecture,     I cannot refrain from urging on your attention that, if much
 has been already accomplished by means              of this method, there still remains
 a vast field      of inquiry unexplored before       us. The nervous system, central
 and peripheral, is an immense and intricate series of nerve-tubes                   and of
 ganglion-cells, and by the method I have laid before you we have                  already
necognized        in these elements   a great degree of mutual dependence.         Within
 these limits are       contained the organic substratum of all that is most noble
 in our being, of all that elevates the animal above the plant, and that grres
 man preeminence over the animal.                 No one can doubt the importance
 of    a  thorough knowledge of this system for the efficient treatment of the
 diseases that affect it.          And it may be reasonably hoped that the full
 development         of the method   here especially referred to, combined with other
 modes of investigation, will materially contribute to gain for us a greater
 insight into the nature of this so highly endowed part of our organism.
       " Much     that is at present required is a combined and methodical applica
 tion of the powers and knowledge which we possess ; something, in fact,
 resembling that which has been done by mapping out the surface of our
satellite in separate small compartments, each of which is assigned to a

     I. " A Ninth            Memoir on Quantics."                  By Prof. Cayley, F.It.S.

                                                 (Abstract.)
     It was shown not long         Prof. Gordan that the number of the
                                         ago by
irreducible covariants of a binary quantic of any order is finite (see his
memoir " Beweis das jede Covariante und Invariante einer biniiren Form
eine ganze Function mit numerischen Coefficienten einer endlichen Anzahl
solcher Formen ist," Crelle, t. 69 (18G<1), Memoir dated 8 June 1868),
and in particular that for a binary quantic the number of irreducible co-
variants (including the quantic and the invariants) is = 23, and that for a
binary sextic the number is = 26.                  From the theory given in my " Second
Memoir         on Quantics,"        Phil.   Trans. 1856, I derived the conclusion, which
as   itnow appears was erroneous, that for a binary quintic the number of
irreducible covariants was infinite.  The theory requires, in fact, a modifi
cation, by reason that certain linear relations, which I had assumed to be
 independent, are really not independent, but, on the contrary, linearly
connected together : the interconnexion in question does not occur in
regard to the quadric, cubic, or quartic ; and for these cases respectively
the theory is true as it stands ; for the quintic the interconnexion first
presents itself in regard to the degree 8 in the coefficients, and order 14 in
the variables ; viz. the theory gives correctly the number of covariants of
any degree not exceeding 7, and also those of the degree 8, and order
less than 14 ; but for the order 14 the theory as it stands gives a non
existent irreducible covariant (a, . .)'(*jy)"i viz. we have, according to
the theory, 5= (10— 6) + l, that        of the form in question there are 10

and equivalent to    independent syzygies only, the composite covariants
                             5
are equivalent to 10— =5, the full number of the asyzygetic covariants.

  The author refers to his previous papers, read in 1855 and 1857, wherein
he described experiments showing the existence of an element of strength
in beams,  which varied with the degree of flexure, and acts in addition
to the resistance of tension and compression of the longitudinal   fibres.
It was pointed out that the ratio of the actual strength of solid rectan
gular beams to the strength as computed by the theory of Liebnitz                                       is,

                        And in steel, as          li and    If        to   1.
     The theoryof Liebnitz assumes   beam to be composed of longitudinal
                                                   a
fibres only, contiguous, but unconnected, and exercising no mutual lateral
action.   But     itremarked that
                       is           beam so constituted would possess no
                                                 a
power to resist        transverse stress,          and would only have the properties of
a   rope.
     Cast iron and steel contain no actual fibre, and wrought                              iron (although
some      qualities are fibrous)          is   able to resist strain nearly equally in any
direction.
     The idea    of fibre   is  convenient as facilitating investigation   but the word    ;
fibre, as applied to        a   homogenous   elastic  solid, must  not be understood as
meaning filaments     of the material.                 In   effect     it   represents lines of direc
tion, in    which the action of forces             can be ascertained and measured                 for

former writers as being at the angle of 46°, because       has been shown             it
that the diagonal resistances  have their greatest manifestation at that
angle.
     Elastic    solids being admitted             to   possess    powers of resistance in the
direction      of the diagonals, attention             is   called to omission of the effect of
resistancein the theory of beams.
   The author then states, as the result of his investigation, that compres
sion and extension of the diagonal fibres constitute an element of strength
equal  to that of the longitudinal fibres, and that flexure      the conse                     is
quence of the relative extensions and compressions in the direct and dia
gonal fibres, arising out of the amount, position, and direction of applied
forces.

distributed strain being that in which the strain in the direct fibres                            is
accompanied by half the amount of strain in the relative diagonal fibres.
  Any disturbance of this relation indicates the presence of another force.
  Thus tensile forces applied at right angles to compressive forces                                    of

    The strength so computed is in general accordance with the results of
experiments in cast iron, wrought iron, steel, and other materials, the
maximum       strength being found in cast iron, which is one-eighth above,
and the minimum in glass, which is one-fourth below the calculated
strength.
     The author considers this treatment of the subject as arising necessarily
out of Dr. Hook-s law " ut tensio sic vis," and that it is in effect com
pleting the application of those principles which were only partially                 ap

     The results of thermometric observations at great depths in the ocean
 not being of a satisfactory nature, the attention of the Hydrographer
 of the Navy was directed to the defects in the construction of the Six-s
 self-registering thermometers then in use, and also to the want of know
 ledge of the effects of compression on the bulb ; and as it was known that
 a delicate thermometer was affected in vacuo, it was natural to suppose
 that an opposite effect would be had by placing them under pressure, and
 particularly such as they would be subjected to at great dep'hs.
     Several thermometers, of a superior construction, were made by different
 makers, and permission was granted to make experiments by pressure in an
 hydraulic press ; but much delay was caused by not being able to obtain a
 press suitable to the requirements, until Mr. Casella, the optician, had a
 testing-apparatus constructed at his own expense, and the experiments
 were commenced.
     Previous to the experiments being made, Dr. W. A Miller, V.P.R.S.,
 proposed, or rather revived, a mode of protecting the bulb from compres
 sion by encasing the full bulb in glass, the space between the case and
 the bulb being nearly filled with alcohol*.
     A wrought-iron bottle had been made to contain             a thermometer, for the
 purpose of comparison with those subjected to compression ; but it failed,
 and finally burst under great compression ; it proved, however, of but
 little consequence, as those designed by Dr. Miller showed so little dif
  ference under pressure that they were at ouce accepted             as standards.

 through an adequate            succession of combinations.           One of the first steps
 in this direction is the preparation of nitrylic chloride, which can be most
                                                                       '

    Among other modes of verifying                   this   equation, the examination of
 the residue left behind when excess                 of the oxychloride is heated with
 plumbic     nitrate, and then distilled off in         a  current of dry air, appeared the
 most simple and obvious.              The results were found not to agree with the
 equation ; and after three nitrates had been tried, a law of chemical
 activity   became evident, rendering the reaction worthy of pursuit for its
 own sake, although,           as an available source of nitrylic chloride, it had
failed entirely.         The nature and mode of establishment of this law con
 stitute  the subjects of the author's memoir.
    When a nitrate is treated with phosphoric oxychloride, as has just been
 mentioned, the residue contains phosphoric oxide and a metallic chloride.
 Within the limits of experimental error, or subject to other satisfactory
 explanation,      the ratio between          these   two products is constant for each
nitrate   ;  and from that ratio        a   quotient a can be found as follows : —

on time, rate of heating, the state of division^of the nitrate, and other con
ditions.      But, assuming the results to have been brought about under a
law of chemical action, the values of a must be independent of those cir
cumstances,       by which the primitive         numerator and denominator could have
been only     pari    passu affected     ;  they are related only to the actual occur
rence    of the reaction.          This property, in       a chemical    ratio, has not, it is
believed, been previously observed.

        Sphygmograph Trace in Health."                      By A. II. Garrod, of
        St. John's College, Cambridge.               Communicated by Dr. Gar
        rod. Received April 23, 1870.
    The graphic method of representing the various phenomena occurring in
the body during life, which has been so much developed by MM. Marey
and Chauveau of Paris,           has   placed  within our    reach   great facilities for
obtaining an accurate knowledge of the relations,                in point of time, of
mutually dependent physiological events, and the sphygmograph has be
come, among others, an instrument familiar to most interested in science.
    By means of this instrument, a detailed and truthful record can be
easily obtained of the modifications in the diameter of any superficial
artery, and, as usually constructed, it is intended to be applied to the
radial at the wrist.
    The traces to be referred to were taken with one of Marey's instru
ments, as made by Breguet.             The recording paper ran its whole length,
4~ inches, in seven seconds, and thus, by counting the number of pulse-
beats in each trace, and multiplying the number thus obtained by 8*57143,
the rate of the pulse at the time the trace was taken was easily found.
    The lever-p'en was of thin steel, sharply pointed, and it recorded by
scratching    on  highly-polished paper previously smoked.
    It is now generally agreed that in each pulsation of the radial sphygmo
graph trace, the main rise is the effect of the contracting ventricle send
ing blood into, and thus filling, the arterial system.
    This rise  is followed by a continuous        fall when the pulse is quick, but
when     slow, its continuity is interrupted by a slight undulation, convex
upwards.
   The major fall      is followed by a secondary rise, not so considerable as
the main one,     but  more marked than any other, and this secondary rise is
evidently due to the closure of the aortic valves preventing further flow of
blood heartwards.
   The two points therefore,        the commencement       of the primary and of the
secondary rise, may be considered to mark            the beginning of the systole of
the heart, and the closure of the aortic valve respectively, as far as they
influence the artery at the wrist ; and the interval between these two
events may be called the        first part of the arterial sphygmograph            trace,

while the interval between the beginning of the secondary             rise and that of
the succeeding primary one constitutes the second part of             the same trace.
.    In     Prof. Donders* published the results of experiments to de
           1865,
termine the relative duration of the first and second part of the cardiac
revolution with different rapidities of movements of the heart, taking as
his data the commencement          of the first and second        sounds    respectively,
and he came to the conclusion    that, though the second part                varied with
the rapidity, the first part was almost constant in all cases.
   On commencing work with the sphygmograph, the author                      came to the
same conclusion with regard to the trace at the wrist, but, on                 improving
his methods of observation, he has arrived at a different result.
   The best means of insuring an accurate measurement of any                   sphygmo
graph trace is to project all the points desired to be compared on                   to one
straight line, and this is done by fixing the trace on to a piece of                 board,
which has another pointed lever attached to        with relations similar
                                                          it,                               to
those of the lever and recording apparatus in the original instrument.                      By
this means lines can be scratched on the trace similar to those which
would be produced by the instrument itself       the watch-work
                                                        if                        were not

     The       reason why this means   has to be employed is, because the           lever   in
the sphygmograph moves in part of circle, not directly up and down.

   To save the trouble of extracting the cube root for any rapidity, these
facts have been thrown into     coordinate form in the accompanying Table,

  tions have been made,         several  of which   are recorded on the Table, and     in
  health no cases have been found which              depart from the curve more than
  those indicated on      it.
      The observations      made    on the author are represented by simple black
  dots,   those made      on others are encircled by a ring       ;  great size of  a dot
  indicates that more than one independent observation has produced exactly
  similar results.
      In none    of the  cases have measurements been          made after violent exer
  cise.    Differences in the height and age of the subjects experimented on
  have not been found to produce any appreciable effect.
     The    trace from infants has not been examined.
     From the equation xy=             y/x.h    the length of the second part of the
                                                             Jc-   fya*

  the nature of y it cannot be less than unity (no pulse having been seen with
 two contractions or more between two successive closures of the aortic
 valve), the limit of cardiac rapidity may be deduced to be 322 in a minute
  (k=47); but it       is scarcely probable that pulses     of such  a rate could remain
 so sufficiently long to be counted.
     In many     cases  of   disease  implicating the circulatory system, the equa
 tion given above indicates that the duration of the first part of the heart-s
 action is not normal ; thus, in a boy suffering from typhoid fever, on the
 second day after the pyrexia           had ceased, and when the temperature was
 below the normal,          xy   was   found =225-25, where       x= 60, which differs
 from the equation
                                     \/tiTxA7=\      90-62,
 which shows that the length of the first part is considerably too short in
 the former.       In the same case, three days later, the patient rapidly im
 proving,     with  x = 56-5,
                    *y-    183,
 which     is much nearer the calculated normal result,             180-5, than on the
 former occasion,      the trace keeping pace with the other physical changes.
     It is probable that many other imperfections in the circulatory system
 can be similarly indicated, and it has been shown above with what facility
 a  diagnosis may be urrived at.

     The weather lately         has  been   fine enough and the sun high enough
during my available observation-time to enable me to resume work.
    The crop of new facts is not very large, not so large as it would have
been had       I been working with a strip of the sun, say fifty miles or a hun
dred    miles  wide, instead of one considerably over a thousand — indeed, nearer
two thousand in width ; but in addition to the new facts obtained, I have

very largely strengthened my former observations, so that the many hours
I have spent in watching phenomena, now perfectly familiar to me, have
not been absolutely lost.
  The negative results which Dr. Frankland    and myself have obtained in
our laboratory-work in the matter of the yellow bright line, near D, in the
spectrum of the chromosphere being a hydrogen line, led me to make a
special series of observations on that line, with a view of differentiating                                           it,

yellow line was often less high in prominence than the    line, this, how

centre of its path over the disk. At this time, the spot, as judged by                             I
the almost entire absence of indications of general absorption in the pen-
umbral regions, was shallow, and this has happened to many of the spots
seen lately.    few hours- observation showed that

the observations were interrupted.
   By the next day (April 11) the spot had certainly developed, and now
there was   magnificently bright prominence, completely over the darkest
                      a
mass of umbra, the prominence being fed from the penumbra or very close
to   it,     a   fact indicated by greater brilliancy than in the bright                           C   and   F   lines.

the many umbrae was close to the limb, and the most violent action was

never saw such rapid changes of wave-length before.    The motion was
chiefly horizontal, or nearly so, and this was probably the reason why,                               ia
spite of the great action, the prominences, three or four of which were
shut out, never rose very high.

bright lines so arranged, indicating that the prominence itself was built up
of single discharges, shot out from the region near the limb with a velo
city sometimes amounting to 100 miles a second.  After this had gone on
for a time, the prominence  mounted,   and the cyclonic motion became
evident ; for away from the sun, as shown in my sketch, the separate
masses were travelling            away from the eye        ;   then gradually a background
of   less luminous hydrogen was formed, moving                   with various velocities, and

on this background             the separate       bombs        appeared       (I   was working with
a vertical spectrum)           like exquisitely jewelled ear-rings.
     It   soon became        evident that the region of the chromosphere just behind
that in which the prominence arose, was being driven back with a velocity
something like 20 miles a second, the back-rush being so local that with
the small image          1   am unfortunately compelled to use, both the moving and
rigid portions were included            in the thickness         of the slit.         I   saw the two
absorption-lines overlap .
  These observations were of great importance to me                      for the rapid action
                                                                          ;

with separately,  and see their connected meaning.
   They may be summarized as follows, and it will be seen that they teach
us much concerning the nature of prominences.       When the air is per
fectly tranquil in the neighbourhood of a large spot, or, indeed, generally
in any part of the disk, we see absorption-lines running along the whole
length of the spectrum, crossing the Fraunhofer lines, and they vary in
depth of shade and breadth according as we have pore, corrugation, or
spot under the corresponding part of the slit, — a pore, in fact, is a spot.
Here and there, where the spectrum is brightest (where a bright point of
facula is under the slit), we suddenly see an interesting bright lozenge of
light. This I take to be due to bright hydrogen at a greater pressure
than ordinary, and this then is the reason of the intensely bright points
seen in ranges of faculae observed near the limb.
   The appearance of this lozenge in the spectroscope, which indicates a
diminution of pressure round its central portion, is the signal for some,
and often all of the following phenomena : —
   1. A thinning and strange variations in the visibility and thickness of
the hydrogen absorption-line under observation.
   2. The appearance of other lozenges in the same locality.
  3. The more or less decided formation of a bright prominence on the
disk.
     4.   If   near   the limb,    this prominence may extend beyond       and its            it,
motion-form           will then   become   more easy of observation. In such cases

  These lozenge-shaped appearances,                          which       were    observed      close      to tbe
spot on the 16th, were accompanied                       by   the   " throbs"       of     the eruption,           to

visible, though the spot was no longer visible.

     The fore                feet   of vertebrate animals          are often used             merely as organs of
locomotion, like the hind feet                          ;    and in the higher mammals they are more
or less       " cephalized,"
                       or appropriated as hands to the use of the brain.
     The proper                          of

the intervention of the ground.
   In the case of the hand, the flexor muscles of the fore arm act upon the
finger tendons, in direction from the muscles towards the tendons, which
                                         a
latter undergo friction at the wrist and other joints of the hand, the force
being applied      the muscles to the tendon above the wrist, and the re
                                    by
sistance being applied at the extremities                               of   the tendons below the wrist          by
the object grasped   the hand.               by
   From the principle of " Least Action                                     in   Nature "      we are entitled to
assume the strength                           of   each portion   of  tendon to be proportional to the
                                                                       a
force    it       is    required to transmit             ;   and since,     proper hand, these forces
                                                                             in   a

the fingers, we should expect the strength of the tendon above the wrist
to be greater than the united strengths of all the finger-tendons.
    Conversely, in a proper foot, the force is applied by the ground to the
extremities of the tendons of the toes, and transmitted to the flexor
muscles of the leg, by means of the tendons of the inner ankle, which
undergo friction in passing round that and the other joints of the foot.
In this case, therefore, we should expect the united strengths of the flexor
tendons of the toes to exceed the strength of the flexor tendons above the
heel.
    In the case of the hand, friction acts against the muscles ; in the case
of the foot, friction aids the muscles.
     I have measured   the relative strengths of the deep flexor tendons of the
hand above and below the wrist in several animals, and also the relative
strengths of the long flexor tendons of the foot above and below the ankle
in the following manner : —
     I weighed certain lengths of the tendons above the wrist and ankle, and
compared these weights with the weights of equal lengths of the flexor
tendons of the fingers or toes, assuming that the weights of equal lengths
 are proportional    to their cross sections, and these again proportional to
 the strengths of the tendons at the place of section.         The difference be
 tween the weights above and below the joint represents the sum of all the
 frictions experienced by the tendons between the two points of section.

      The foregoing animals all realize the typical idea of a true foot, with a
  variable amount of friction at the ankle-joint ; this friction disappearing
  altogether in the Boomer Kangaroo, whose method of progression realizes
 absolute mechanical perfection, as no force whatever is consumed by the
  friction of the flexor tendons at the heel.
      The only animals whose feet deviated from the typical foot were three,
 viz. Alligator, Common Porcupine, and Phalanger.                    In these animals the
  foot has the mechanical action of a hand, or grasping organ ; and the
 flexor tendons above        the   ankle exceeded        those below    the ankle by the
 following amounts       :—

     It will be observed that the fore foot of the Goat, regarded simply as an
orrgan     of locomotion, attains a perfection comparable with that of the
 hind foot of the Kangaroo, no force being lost by friction at the wrist-
joint.
     The only animal in which I found a departure from the typical hand
was the Llama, in which the flexor tendons of the fingers exceed the flexor
 tendon above the wrist by 14-4 percent.
     The bearing of the foregoing results on the habits of locomotion of the
several animals will suggest themselves                at once to naturalists who have
carefully    studied   those  habits.      I  shall  merely  add that the subject admits
of being carried into the details of the separate or combined actions of the
several fingers and toes, and that the habits              of various kinds of monkeys
in the    use  of certain combinations of fingers or toes may be explained
satisfactorily by the minute study of the arrangement and several strengths
of the various flexor tendons distributed to the fingers or toes.

VIII.     "Experiments on the effect of Alcohol (Ethyl Alcohol) on the
       Human       Body."      By E. A. Parkes, M.D., F.R.S., Professor
       of Hygiene in the Array Medical School, and Count Ctpeus
       Wollowicz, M.D., Assistant Surgeon, Army Medical Staff.
       Received     April  4, 1870.
    As  a   knowledge of the physiological effects of alcohol on the human
body is a matter of great importance, and as previous observations leave
some points in doubt, we took the opportunity which the willingness and
zeal   of  a very intelligent   healthy soldier afforded us of investigating      this
subject.
    In order not to lengthen the paper, we have given              only our  own ob
servations, without referring to those of others.
    The plan of observation was        as follows : — For twenty-six    days the  man
remained on      a diet precisely similar as to food and times of      meals in  every
respect, except that for the first eight days he took only water (in the shape
of coffee, tea, and simple water) ; for the next six days he added to this diet
rectified spirit, in such proportion that he took, in divided quantities,           on
the first day one fluid ounce ( = 28-4 cub. centims.) of absolute alcohol;          on
the second day two fluid ounces ; on the third day four ounces, and on the
fifth and sixth days eight ounces on each day. He then returned to
 water for six days, and then for three days took on each day half a bottle
 (=12     ounces,  or 341 c. c.) of fine brandy, containing 48 per cent, of
alcohol.      Then for three days more he returned to water.
    There were thus five periods, viz. of water-drinking, alcohol, water,
brandy, water.
    Before commencing the experiments, the man, who had been accustomed
 to take one or two pints of beer daily, abstained altogether from any alco
holic liquid for ten days.
    This man, P. B., is twenty-eight        years of age, 5 feet 6 inches in height,
atid his usual weight is 134 or 136 lbs.            He is finely formed, with little
fat, and with largely developed powerful muscles ; he has a clean smooth
skin, a clear bright eye, good teeth, and is in all respects in perfect health.
He is very intelligent, and       assisted   us so much that we are quite      certain
that there has not been      a mistake even for      a minute in the time of    taking
the   temperatures and passing the urine.             As he had always been accus
tomed to smoke, we thought it proper to allow him half an ounce of
tobacco daily, for fear the deprivation of it might disturb his health.
    In addition    to the experiments      recorded in this paper, we tested       the
accuracy of his vision, and the muscular power before and during the               use
 of alcohol ; but as we could not detect any difference, we do not give            the
experiment?.
    Our object being to      test the dietetic effects    of alcohol,  we gave it in
small and large quantities, but avoided producing           any extreme    symptoms
of narcotism.

    It  was not intended that the quantity of water should be altered ; but
through a misconception, the man thought the spirit and brandy were to
take the     place  of the water,     and    took therefore less water in proportion.
In  one respect the mistake was fortunate. The total amount of water taken
in   the so-called solid food, and as drink, was about 72| fluid ounces, or
2059 c. c. daily during the water days,              and a little less during the days on
which he took alcohol and brandy.
   * The nitrogen in   the beefsteak was determined once ; the result was almost identical
with  the results given in experiments in exercise recorded in No. 94 (1867) of the Pro
ceedings of the Royal Society.     As the bread was analyzed on a former occasion, it was
not so now; its composition is very constant, the same amount of flour, water, and
yeast being always used in the hospital bakery at Netley.

    During the first few days there        was a gradual increase in weight, owing
 probably    to the food     being   rather   greater and the exereise less than
before ; equilibrium was reached on the eighth day, and the weight re
mained almost unchanged during the alcoholic period.                 There was slight
decrease after alcohol    ;  and on the last brandy day a slight increase, which
was maintained in the after period.          The general result appears to be that
(other conditions remaining constant) the effect of alcohol in modifying
weight is quite unimportant.

The temperature of the rectum was taken at 10 a.m., 2 p.m., and 10 p.m.

   These experiments show that alcohol and brandy produce little change
in the temperature of the axilla in healthy men       but what effect there   ;                                         is
appears  to be rather in the direction of increase than of diminution. But
that the effect of     ounces (=227 c.c.) of absolute alcohol, taken in 24
                           8
hours,    really trifling
           is                seen by the Table
                                  is           on the 13th day, when this;
large quantity was taken, the temperature rose higher than on any other
day  ; the thermometer was over 100° at 10 and 12 o'clock, and the mean
of the observations was 99°
           8                      might have been thought that alcohol
                                                 ;   it
really increased the temperature, but on the next day, with the
amount of alcohol, the temperature was lower throughout, and the                                              l
of the day was only 98°'         On the 12th and 13th days in fact the man

had   aslight febrile catarrh, as will be noticed further on, and the tempe
rature rose during this attack.
  We draw the conclusion that the changes in temperature                                               in the   axilla
were insignificant.

   The rectal observations show that alcohol and brandy in the above
quantities cause no lessening of temperature in the rectum ; on the con
trary, there is slight increase in both the second and fourth periods as
compared with the first and third (which were precisely the same), though,
as in the case of the axilla, the difference is not great, being in each case
very nearly half a degree Fahr.
    In this man the rectum temperature               is slightly   greater than the axil
lary.     As no great number of observations have             been made on this point,

     The  mean difference on this day in favour      of the rectum is 0o-53 ; bat,
  as appears from the former Tables, the rectum sometimes has a tempera
 ture of 1°, or even 2°, more than the axilla : but such difference as the last
 number seldom occurred.
     The  general  result from all these observations surprised us, considering
 the numerous experiments on men and animals in which the temperature
 has been found to be lowered by alcohol.           An explanation may, however,
 be possible.     Our experiments being       to ascertain the dietetic   properties
 of alcohol,  we never aimed at producing very decided narcotism          or marked
 symptoms of poisoning ; and as we had to deal with a perfectly healthv
 resisting organism, which received always the same quantify of food, the
 effect of alcohol in lowering temperature might not be so well marked as
 in an ill-fed or unhealthy body.       We do not dispute the accuracy of the
 observations which show that large and narcotic doses of alcohol lower
 the temperature of the body in men and animals ; but our r xperiments
 prove that alcohol, in the limits we have       stated and with an equal supply
 of food, did not have this effect in a perfectly healthy man.
    The rising of mean temperature which seemed to occur was not con
 siderable enough to make it probable that it was due to heat derived from
combustion of alcohol ; it was more probably owing to quickened circu
lation, and in addition the slight febrile attack which occurred on the
twelfth and thirteenth days, augmented the mean temperature of the
alcoholic period ; but this would not account for the similar slight increase
in the brandy period.

                        The Effect on the Circulation.
    The pulse (taken usually every two hours) was decidedly more frequent
when alcohol and brandy were used.             The mean of all the observations in
the recumbent position was 73-57 beats per minute in the first period
when water was taken ; during the alcoholic days the mean number of
beats was 88-5      ;  after alcohol 78"6    ; during the brandy days         91 -4,  and
 after brandy 8T1     .
     If particular  hours are taken the same results come out, as shown in the
following Table : —
                                 Mean pulse             Mean pulse       Mean pulse
                                 at 10 a.m.              at 2 p.m.        at 10 p.m.

        During     „                99                     94                 80 8
        After      „                89-66                  87"5               71-6
        During brandy               96 6                    93                92
        After      „                88-6                   84                 73
There is therefore no doubt that the frequency of the pulse was increased,
 and the effect was also persistent ; for, though it fell after the alcohol was
 left off, it had not reached in six days the point which was proper to it
 before the alcohol.
     The pulse    was not only increased in rapidity, but it was fuller ; it ap
 peared   to  have  more volume.
     The highest mean pulse on any day before alcohol was 77"5 beats ; the
 mean pulse of the first alcoholic day (one fluid ounce of absolute alcohol)
 was 80    ; with two ounces of alcohol 78'3 ; with four ounces 86 ; with six
 ounces 98*3 (but there was exceptional fever) ; with eight ounces 93*6 ;
 and on the last day, with eight ounces, 94 ¦7.                On the first day after
 alcohol it sank to 80.
     The effect on the circulation in the small vessels of the skin was very
 marked.       The  face, ears, and neck were      flushed, and on the days of the
 large doses the face was slightly swollen. The skin of the trunk, as well
 as of the face, appeared hot to the man himself, and this was no doubt de
 pendent on the same cause.          It was some time before the turgescence of
 the small- cutaneous vessels lessened.          Accompanying it was a sense of
 fulness and heaviness in the head, as if the intracranial vessels were also
 enlarged, and there was a feeling of warmth at the epigastrium.
     Sphygmographic observations were made on the right radial artery. They
 were always taken with the same instrument, with an equal pressure, and
 when the man was in a recumbent position.                 Altogether more than 150
  tracings   were  taken,   but some   were    spoilt  in  photographing*.       All the
 remainder are subjoined.

tracings, as will be seen on comparing the 10 p.m. curves of the first period
with that of the ninth day. The larger quantities of alcohol produced,
however, greater effects, and the tracings of the twelfth, thirteenth, and
fourteenth days are very striking. They show, of course, a greatly in
creased rapidity of beat.     The first event (to use Dr. Burdon-Sanderson-s
terms), or systolic wave, is better marked ; the ascent of the lever is more
vertical, and is greater in amount ; the summit is sometimes sharp, but in
most cases rounded.      The second event, or arterial pressure, is not appa
rently so much altered, and in most cases probably is not changed.          The
third event, or disastolic collapse, is more rapid than before alcohol ; there
is very little evidence of the fourth event, or diastolic expansion.
   The interpretation is that there is increased frequency of the ventricular
contractions,   and increased   rapidity  of  each  contraction ;  the ventricle
therefore is doing more work in a given time, the period of rest for the
heart is much shortened, the blood moves more freely than usual through
the capillaries, so that the increased quantity of blood which it is to be
presumed is thrown into the arteries, is very quickly got rid of.

                      (15 minutes after taking a glass of beer.)
   After the alcohol        was left off the tracings show indications        of its influ
ence,    even    to the sixth     day.    The tracing on the eighteenth day (the
fourth after the cessation of alcohol) shows a weak and quickly acting
heart ; but allowance must be made for the fact that that was a day of com
plete rest in bed.        On the sixth day after alcohol the mean pulse was 76-2
per minute, and the tracing shows still rapidity and feebleness of the heart-s
action.      This seems to confirm the usual doctrine that increased rapidity
of contraction from the action of alcohol is followed by exhaustion ; but
it also shows that this effect does not ensue so immediately as is supposed,
but that the effect of the alcohol is more persistent.
   When brandy was then given, the effect on the exhausted heart was very
obvious    ;  the ventricle commenced         to contract again more rapidly, and, in
fact, the effect of the brandy is more marked than that of alcohol.
   It is difficult perhaps to explain all the indications of the brandy tra
cings, but there seems no doubt that the ventricular contraction was very
sudden ; the aortic valves opened with violence ; a rapid wave traversed
the blood, sending the lever up very high ; the summit of the curve is
sharp, and the equilibrium of tension between ventricle and artery must
have been soon reached ; the arteries emptied themselves very rapidly.
   After the brandy was left off the tracings are seen gradually returning
to the curve of health, though they had not reached it on the morning of
the twenty-seventh day (the fourth after brandy), when the experiments
were obliged to be discontinued.
    Seven days later the pulse was nearly healthy again.
    It  is noticeable that twelve ounces          of brandy (containing 48 per cent,
of alcohol) had        more   effect  than eight ounces of absolute alcohol, but it
must be remembered that when the brandy was given the heart had not
recovered from the influence of the alcohol ; in other words, it was not
perfectly healthy *.
   * Dr. Burdon-Sanderson was kind enough to look at three tracings, No. 1 of the
water period, No. 2    of the alcoholic period, and No. 3 of the brandy period.  He writes
as follows : —
   " I think
               (1) that No. 1 is a normal pulse.
   "
     (2) That the changes exhibited in Nos. 2 and 3 are of the same nature, but different
in degree ; i. e. that the degree of modification is greater in 3 than in 2. Hence the
explanation of both must be the same.

   Putting together the evidence derived from the pulse as felt by the
finger, from the state of the cutaueous vessels, and from the sphygmo-
graphic tracings, it seems fair to conclude that the chief effects of alcohol
on the circulationin health are on the ventricles (the rapidity with which
contractions are accomplished being greatly increased), and on the capil
laries (which are dilated and allow blood to pass more freely through
them).    The valuable observations of Dr. Anstie have shown that in many
febrile cases, when alcohol is acting usefully, the arterial tension is in
creased ; while in other cases, when there is narcotism, the tension is
lowered.           In this healthy    man the effect    of either small or large         doses on
the arterial tension is not perhaps well marked.

    As the amount of urine       increased   in the alcoholic      period 142 cub.
centims., while the water taken was less by 124 cubic centims., and the
same result in a less degree occurred in the brandy period, there is no doubt
that the alcohol increased the urinary water. Whether this was the con
sequence, as seems possible, of the greater frequency of the heart's action,
or whether it arose from any purely diuretic influence of the alcohol, is un
certain.    Was the body left poorer in water, or was the exit through the
skin or lungs hindered ?
    As 4-3 ounces less of water    passed -in, and 5-3 ounces more passed out,
in the alcoholic period, and   as the mean amount          of alcohol passing in   was
under 5 fluid ounces,    the  body ought to have lost weight, and perhaps
would have done so but for one circumstance.
    The possible amount of change of weight in this way would be of course
slight, viz. about 4 ounces, and it happened         that there was a less excretion
of alvine matter (viz. 1 ounce less daily than       during the first period), which
would tend to cover the possible loss of water      by the increased flow of urine.
Also the error of the machine may be one             ounce.    We draw the conclu
sion that there was no decided evidence of lessening of elimination of water
by other channels sufficient to account for the increased urinary flow.
                          The Nitrogen     of  the Urine.
   The urea of 24 hours was determined by Liebig's mercuric nitrate solu
tion, the chlorine being got rid of ; and, in addition, the total nitrogen was
determined by burning with soda-lime after the method of Voit, and lead
ing the ammonia into a standard solution of sulphuric acid.               In this way
any error in the determination by either process was sure to be detected.

   As 1/-27 grammes of nitrogen (or probably          a  little more) entered with
the food, and as, in the two stools which were    examined, l-6and 2 grammes
of nitrogen passed off respectively, it is certain that in this, as in other
cases recorded, the whole of the nitrogen passed off by the kidneys and
bowels, and none emerged by the skin or lungs.       Of the 1 7^ or 1    -\  grammes
which entered as food, 16 or 16| passed off with the urine and \\ or 1 J, or
from -jiy to -j^, by the bowels.
   The effect of alcohol and brandy on the elimination of nitrogen was not
great.    In the alcoholic period there was a slight increase over the previous
period, but this was dependent (partly, at any rate) on an accidental cir
cumstance.     Ou the twelfth day (during alcohol) the weather        was very cold,

and the man had     chill ; there was slight shivering, pain in the hips, and
                      a
frequent sneezing.    The temperature of the axilla reached 100° at 6 p.m.,
and «J9°-2 at 8 p.m. ; the temperature of the rectum at 10 p.m. was 100-2.
The urine            greatly in amount (from 1440 cub. centims. to 1060
             decreased
cub. centims.), and                                  The urea increased to

38-65 grammes, giving 18'05 grammes of nitrogen, and the nitrogen by
soda-lime was no less than 20-32 grammes.    As this large excess surprised
us, both processes were repeated three times with the same results ; and it
is therefore to be concluded that, in consequence of this ephemeral fever,
there was a larger amount of urea      e. of substances precipitated
                                                 (i.                  mer       by
curic nitrate), and also  great excess of nitrogenous substances not preci

   On the following day the ephemeral fever was better, though the tem
perature was high in the early part of the day the amount of urine then

became excessive       (1800 cub. centims.), but the urea and the nitrogen
determined     by    soda-lime both fell to the average.                  If
                                                             this fever-day
be deducted,        the average of the five remaining alcoholic-days gives
16-067 grammes of nitrogen,                or practically    the same as in the water-
period.
   We draw the conclusion that some, probably all, the excess of nitro
genous elimination during the alcoholic period was due to this transient
fever, which,   may be noted, was neither hindered in coming on nor appa
                it
rently prevented in passing off,  the    andby  ounces of absolute alcohol

which were taken on those days.
     In the period after the alcohol the amount, both of ureal and total nitro
gen, increased.  The excess was chiefly due to great elimination on the

sixteenth day.   On this day again  slight febrile attack recurred, and the
                                              a
temperature ran high. At      p.m.   reached 100o-7, and then fell rapidly,

temperature of the day was 980-8, which was considerably higher than on
any other day in this period.
   On the following three days the nitrogen continued high, and fell on the
next day far below the average.   In the brandy period continued to fall,
                                                                     it
and in the last period (three days of water-drinking) was almost precisely
the same as in the first.
   The disturbing influences from these febrile attacks being allowed for,
and the small amount of the changes in the quantity of nitrogen, even                 if
these attacks are included, being taken into account,   may be concluded
                                                                     it

is on the side of increase  and this might possibly be accounted for by the
                              ;
increased rapidity of the heart's action, and the augmented flow of urine,

.-584              Messrs. Parkes and Wollowicz                         on the     Effect     of [May 19,
    Our conclusion is quite contrary to the observations formerly                                     made    on
this subject, which indicated that nitrogen is largely retained in                                   the body
when alcohol is used, and that in this way alcohol both increases                                     assimila
tion or, when food is deficient, saves the tissues from destruction                                   and hus
bands strength.            Whatever may be the case in febrile diseases (and on this
point    the   evidence      is defective), we are quite certain that this is not true
for health, and that as long as the ingress of nitrogen is the same, 8 ounces
of absolute alcohol and              12 ounces         of brandy, containing nearly                6 ounces of
alcohol, have no effect, or                a trifling effect, on the processes                  which end in
the elimination of nitrogen by the urine, and most decidedly do not lessen
 the elimination *.
        The Phosphoric Acid, Chlorine, and Free Acidity                                  of  the Urine.
    The phosphoric acid was determined by nitrate of uranium, the chloriue
by nitrate of silver, the acidity by the graduated alkaline solution t —
   •  It  may be noted        with regard to the two processes for determining nitrogen, via.
precipitation by      Liebig-s   mercuric nitrate and burning by soda-lime, that the mercuric
nitrate throws down other nitrogenous matters besides the urea.                         Indeed, Voit considers
(Zeitschr.   fur  Biologic,    Band    ii.  p.  470)  that   the  total  nitrogen    in  the urine of men may
be safely concluded         from this test But this appears not to be so in all men.                          In
the man now experimented             upon, the nitrogen by soda-lime is actually very nearly the
same as that calculated from the mercuric-nitrate                     precipitate. But in other men, and
even in this man now and then, the former process gave a much larger result than the
latter.
   It will be observed that occasionally the process by soda-lime gives a smaller result
than that by mercuric nitrate. The same fact is observable in the table given by Voit
in the paper above referred to (p. 469).                 The explanation is probably this : — Possibly
some of the     nou-ureal     substances       thrown    down     by mercuric nitrate may contain less
nitrogen    than  urea,   and   the  calculation      is  therefore    incorrect ; but the chief cause ap
pears   to  bo  the  following    : — Both     processes     are   liable to error.      The mercuric nitrate
being   a  colour  test, is  often  difficult    to  estimate    exactly  ;  its failure   is on the side of ex
cess, and the amount of failure may be 2 or perhaps 3 per cent.                             On the other hand,
the process by soda-lime has an error in the other direction : there is sometimes a diffi
culty in getting off the last traces of ammonia, and there. may be therefore a slight
error on the side of defect.          If   in any urine in which the amount of nitrogen by soda-
lime ought really to coincide with that by mercuric nitrate, but in which each error of
manipulation reaches its maximum limit (viz. that the mercuric-nitrate solution shows
more nitrogen than exists, and the soda-lime process less), the amount of nitrogen by
the latter plan may appear considerably less than by the former.

    The changes in the phosphoric acid are so slight, that it is certain the
alcohol exerted little effect.      Thus, the mean of the first period being
2-056 grammes, on the two last days of the alcohol period, when 8 ounces
of absolute alcohol     were taken each day, the amount    of phosphoric acid was
 187 and 1 -99 grammes respectively, which is      the same as the mean of the
first period.    Now, if alcohol exerted any effect, we should expect these two
days to show it.         The mean of the next, or water period, when the
body   was    in reality still impregnated with alcohol, was a little more
(2-405 grammes).         On the third day of brandy, when a bottle and a half
had been taken in three days, the excretion was l-89 gramme, or prac
tically the same as in the first period.
    Looking to the amounts of phosphoric         acid excreted on the two last
alcoholic days and the last brandy day, when the effect of the spirit, if any,
would be most marked, it seems clear, if the phosphoric acid in the urine
be in any way a measure of the metamorphosis of the nervous tissue (which

380                Messrs. Parkes and Wollowicz on           the   Effect of [May 19,
we do not affirm), that these experiments do not warrant any assertion that
the alcohol interferes with such metamorphosis.               The phosphoric acid was
in fact unaffected even by such large quantities as 454 cub. centims., or not
much less than        | litre of absolute alcohol in 48 hours.
    The chlorine      was in larger quantities in the latter period of the experi
ments     ;  but whether this was owing to the alcohol is doubtful.               As the
chlorine also passes off by the skin and bowels, variations in the amount
eliminated by these channels affect the urine.               On the 10th of February
cold weather set in, and continued until the 18th ; and it seems probable
that some lessened action of the skin caused              more chloride    of sodium    to
pass in the urine.
    The     free acidity appeared    to be increased in the alcoholic, and still more
in the brandy period ; but whether the increase is large enough to take it
out of the limits of usual variation is not certain.                It seems singular, if
alcohol increases the free acidity, that on the two days when 8 fluid ounces
were taken each day, the acidity was less than two days in the first period,
and less than on the second alcoholic days, when only 2 ounces of alcohol
were taken.
    The acidity during the three brandy days was, however, high throughout,
and it fell afterwards considerably, so that probably brandy does somewhat
increase the acidity.
    It is noticeable that the febrile attack on the twelfth day, which so in
fluenced the nitrogen, and caused a large deposit of urates, was without
influence on the free acidity.
     On the whole, it may be concluded that the influence of alcohol on these
three urinary constituents is inconsiderable.
                               The Alvine Discharges.
    The discharges from the bowels             were weighed every day ; they were
always      natural  except   on the  two  first days, when there was some looseness.
On those days the stools were rather liquid, and weighed 13^ and
 1 1 1 ounces.    Excluding these discharges, themean numbersareas follows: —

    The nitrogen      was determined twice, viz. on the       fifth day (water),   and on
the     12th day (6 ounces        of alcohol); it amounted to 1639 and              2 087
grammes        respectively.
    The alcohol, therefore, did not lessen the elimination of nitrogen by the
bowels ; and, considering the usual great variations in the weights of the
stools from day to day, it is probable that it did not lessen their amount.

                          The Pulmonary Excretion.
      On this point we made no experiments.        The method of Professor von
   Pettenkofer has accustomed physiologists to such accuracy in the deter
   mination of the elimination of carbon, and there is so general a feeling that.
   this method, as dealing with long periods, is the best that can be employed,
   that, as we had not Pettenkofer-s appliances, we preferred doing nothing to
  falling short of  a perfectly satisfactory and unquestionable result.
                         The Elimination of AlcohoL.
      The question   as to the destruction or otherwise of alcohol in the body is
  very difficult  to answer, owing to the impossibility of collecting all the
  excreta.    The experiments of Schulinus, and especially of Anstie and
  Dupr6,   seem  to show clearly that only a small part can be recovered from
  the body of animals or from the excreta.       The latter authors, by using the
  bichromate of potassium and sulphuric-acid solution as a colour-test, and
  also by converting the alcohol into acetic acid and estimating it by an al
  kaline solution, could only prove the elimination of very small quantities
  by the urine ; and the elimination was soon accomplished.
      Owing to the number of experiments we had to make, we found we could
  not attempt to solve this very difficult question of elimination ; and we will
  here merely briefly give the qualitative observations which alone we were
  able to make, and which, as far as they go, confirm the results arrived at
  by Perrin and Lallemand, Edward Smith, and others.
     We   used for this purpose the chromate test     proposed by Masing, and
  used by most observers since.
                             Elimination  by the Lungs.
     During the first or water period, the man breathed several times daily,
 for 15 minutes at a time, through the solution of bichromate of potassium
 in sulphuric acid, without any change of colour being produced.         On the
 fifth day (water) he breathed through a glass tube surrounded by a freez
 ing mixture.     About 1-7 cub. centim. of fluid were obtained, which gave no
 green reaction with the test.     On the first day of alcohol (1 fluid ounce)
 no alcohol was indicated in the breath by the test ; on the second day
 (2 fluid ounces) the test was slightly affected ; on the four following days
 (4, 6, 8, and 8 ounces of alcohol) markedly so, but with variable intensity at
 different times of the day.
     On the last day of alcohol the water in the breath was condensed during
 15 minutes, in a glass tube surrounded by ice ; -7 cub. centim. of fluid
were obtained, which gave a strong green reaction with the bichromate test.
     On the following day breathing had no effect on the fluid.
     During the brandy days the breath always produced a green tint, and
usually it was very marked.
     We did not attempt any determination of quantity by this colour test ;
and Anstie has pointed out that the bichromate test is so delicate that the

 quantity passing off may easily be overrated ; but it can hardly be doubted
 that in twenty-four hours there must be a good deal of elimination by this
 channel.
                                   Elimination     by the    Shin.
    On the seventh day, when only water was taken, the whole arm was
 placed in a glass jar, which was closed by india-rubber.                        A little fluid was
 collected, which gave no evidence of alcohol with the bichromate test.
    In the afternoon of the eleventh day (the third of alcohol), when he
 had taken seven fluid ounces in three days, the arm was enclosed for six
 hours in the glass jar.          About 12 c. c. of an acid fluid were collected; a
 small quantity of which gave an immediate and strong green reaction with
 the bichromate test.
    On the fourteenth day (the sixth of alcohol), the arm was again enclosed
 in the jar, and 8 c. c. of an opalescent fluid collected, which gave a very
 decided reaction with the bichromate.
    On the twenty-third day (the third of brandy) the arm was again placed
 in the jar for six hours; 10 c. c. of an acid fluid collected, which gave a
 strong green reaction with the bichromate test.
    The general result of these experiments indicated that the skin is a con
 siderable emunctory of alcohol, perhaps more so than the lungs,                              if the
 bichromate test is a safe one, which we are inclined to doubt.

    The examination          was    conducted as follows           : — 250     c. c.  of the urine
without any addition were placed in a large retort and distilled at a low
heat,   till about 150 c. c. had passed over. It was tested with bichromate ;
then 50 c. c. were redistilled, and about 15 c. c. were allowed to pass over.

    This table shows distinctly that with one ounce of alcohol in twenty-
four hours, none was detected in the urine of that day ; it was detected
when two fluid ounces were taken ; and then, as the amount of alcohol was
increased, more and more passed into the urine, until at last the reaction

  became very strong.         As     to the exact   amount of alcohol passing off, wc
  can say nothing       ; but, looking to the delicacy of the test, it was probably
  not great.
     In the case of the brandy, we attempted on the first day to determine
  the quantity by the method of Dupre, viz. converting the alcohol into
  acetic acid by heating with chrome-alum.
     The results indicated rather a larger quantity than he found ; but still
  the amount was small.           In the whole day-s urine only          -1 763  gramme, or

     We think it     can scarcely be doubted that the elimination            of alcohol does
 not take place so rapidly as is supposed.             Looking to the evidence of the
 pulse, of the sphygmographic tracings, and of the urine on the twentieth
 day, we must conclude that, twenty-nine fluid ounces of absolute alcohol
 having been taken in six days, the body had still traces of it on the sixth
 day after the alcohol was left off.
    The     evidence  of Anstie and Dupre is certainly strong against the urine
 being    a great channel of elimination ; but possibly, though not excessive at
 any one time, the exit is longer continued than they supposed ; and when
 the constant passage from the skin and from the lungs and bowels is re
membered, we can easily suppose that the totality of elimination may be
 really considerable.
    But whether all the alcohol             thus passes off, or whether some is de
stroyed, our experiments do not enable us to state.
                                General Conclusions.
    1.   One and two fluid ounces (28-4 c. c. and 56-8 c. c.) of absolute alcohol
given in divided quantities in 24 hours to a perfectly healthy man seemed
to increase the appetite.           Four fluid ounces lessened it considerably ; and
larger quantities almost entirely destroyed it.              On the last day of alcohol
the man was three quarters of an hour eating 8 ounces of bread, and could
hardly do so.         Had he been left to his own wishes the amount of food
taken would have been much diminished.
    It appears, therefore, that in this individual              some    point near 2 fluid
ounces of absolute alcohol is the limit of the useful action on appetite ; but
                                                                           2  6 2

it is possible that     if the  alcohol had beeu continued a smaller quantity would
have lessened       appetite.
    In other healthy persons it             may be different from    the above   ;   in most
cases   of disease, when digestion is weakened,           it seems probable that a much
smaller amount of alcohol would destroy appetite.
    2. The average number of beats of the heart in 24 hours (as calculated
from 8 observations made in 14 hours), during the first or water period,
was   1 06,000 ;     in the alcoholic period it was 1 27,000, or about 2 1 ,000 more ;
and in the brandy period it was 131,000, or 25,000 more.                               ,
    The highest of the daily means of the pulse observed during the first or
water petiod was            77-5  ;   but on this day two observations are deficient.
The    next highest daily mean was 77 beats.
    If instead     of the   mean of the 8 days or 73-57 we compare the mean of
 this one day,      viz.  77 beats per minute, with the alcoholic days, so as to be
 sure not to overestimate the action of the alcohol, we find : —
 On the 9th day, with 1 fluid ounce of alcohol, the heart beat 4,300 times
    more.
 On the 10th day, with           2    fluid ounces, 1872 times more.
 On the 1 1th day, with          4   fluid ounces, 12,960 times more.
 On the 12th day, with 6 fluid ounces, 30,672 times more.
 On the 13th day, with 8 fluid ounces, 23,904 times more.
 On the 14th day, with 8 fluid              ounces, 25,488 times more.
    But as there was ephemeral              fever on the 12th day,   it is right  to make a
 deduction, and to estimate             the number of beats in that day as midway be
 tween the      1 1th and 13th days, or 18,432.           Adopting this, the mean daily
 excess   of  beats during the alcoholic days was 14,492, or an increase           of rather
 more than       13 per   cent.
    The first     day  of alcohol      gave an excess  of 4 per cent., and the last of 23
 per cent.   ;  and the mean of these          two gives almost the same percentage of
 excess as the mean         of the 6 days.
    Admitting       that   each  beat of the heart was as strong during the alcoholic
 period as in the water period (and it was really more powerful), the heart
 on the last two days of alcohol was doing one-fifth more work.
    Adopting the lowest             estimate which has been given of the daily work
 done    by    the   heart,   viz.    as equal to 122 tons lifted one foot, the heart
 during the alcoholic period did daily work in excess equal to lifting 15-tS
 tons one foot, and in the last two days did extra work to the amount of
 24 tons lifted as far.
    The period of        rest for the heart was shortened, though perhaps not to
 such an extent as would be inferred from the number of beats                    ;  for each
 contraction was sooner over.
    The heart on the fifth and sixth days after alcohol was left off, and ap
 parently at the time when the last traces of alcohol were eliminated, showed
 in the sphygmographic tracings signs of unusual feebleness ; and, perhaps
 in consequence of this, when the brandy quickened the heart again, the

1870.]                    Alcohol on  the Human Body.                      391
tracings show a more rapid contraction of the ventricles, but less power
than in the alcoholic period.      The brandy acted, in fact, on a heart whose
nutrition had not been perfectly restored.
    The peripheral circulation was accelerated and the vessels were enlarged ;
and the effect was so marked as to show that this is an important influence
for good or for evil when alcohol is used.
    Referring only to this healthy man, it is clear that the amount of alcohol
the heart will bear without losing its healthy sphygmographic tracing is
small, and it must be supposed that some disease of heart or vessels would
eventually follow the overaction produced by large doses of alcohol.
    3. Although large doses of alcohol lessened appetite, they did not ap
pear to impede primary digestion, as far as this could be judged of by the
sensations  of the   man   ; nor did they seem to check the normal chemical
changes in the body which end in the elimination of nitrogenous excreta,
of phosphoric acid, and of free acidity.      In other words, we were unable
to trace either the good or the evil ascribed to alcohol in this direction  : it
neither depressed     these  chemical changes nor obviously increased them ;
it neither saved the tissues nor exhausted them ; and even in the period of
ephemeral fever its effects were negative.
    But, of  course,  in these experiments we were not dealing with    diseased
tissues, nor with structures altered in composition by long-continued excess
of alcohol. The results in such cases might be different ; and it may be
desirable to repeat that though appetite was lessened, the amount of food
taken was the same each day.
    4. Neither pure alcohol nor brandy, in the quantities given, lessened the
temperature ; in other words, they did not arrest the chemical changes
which produce animal heat, or lessen the processes which regulate its
amount, any more than they influenced nitrogenous tissue-change. Alcohol
in no way influenced the rise of temperature during the attack of ephemeral
fever ; it neither lowered nor increased it.    This appears to us conclusive
agaiust the proposal to use alcohol as a reducer of febrile heat.
    On the other hand it is not clear that alcohol increased the temperature :
it produced subjective feelings of warmth in the stomach, in the face, round
the loins, and over the shoulders     ; but at the time when these were felt
(for about one hour after tolerably large doses) the thermometer in the
axilla and rectum showed no rise.         This is best seen by comparing the
two o-clock observations, which were taken about half an hour after dinner.
The feelings result from the enlargement of the vessels and the greater
flow of blood through them ; so, also, the ephemeral fever was decidedly
.iot made worse by it.
    5. An effect on the nervous system was not proved by any evidence of in
crease or decline in the amount of phosphoric acid ; but there were marked
subjective feelings ; and possibly also the increased action of the heart was
a nervous condition, as the short contractions of the ventricle were like
those ascribed to alterations in the nervous currents.      The feelings which

were  produced by four fluid ounces daily, and in -a still higher degree
by the  larger quantities of alcohol, proved that narcotism was produced.
There was no exhilaration, but a degree of heaviness, indisposition to
exertion, and loss of cheerfulness and alacrity ; there was slight headache,
and even some torpor and sleepiness. All these effects were more marked
with brandy.  The commencement of narcotism was therefore produced
in this man by some quantity much less than 4 fluid ounces, and probably
nearer 2. It was nearly this amount which also commenced to destroy the
appetite ; and it may also be observed that a considerable rise in the fre
quency of the pulse occurred on the third day of alcohol, when 4 ounces
were taken, whereas on the days with one or two ounces the pulse, though
quickened, was so in a much less degree.
   Putting therefore these points together, viz. that the obvious effect on
the nervous system      e. narcotism), the loss of appetite, and
                              (t.                                 great rise                    a
in the quickness and frequency of the heart-s beats occurred at the same
time,  itseems fair to conclude that there must be     relation between the      a
phenomena, or,     other words, that all were owing to nervous implication.

  It will be seen that the general result of our experiments                                   is   to confirm
the opinions held        by
                     physicians as to what must be the indications of alcohol
both in health and disease.   The effects on appetite and- on circulation are
the practical points to seize  and     we are correct in our inferences, the
                                          ;        if
commencement of narcotism marks the point when both appetite and circula
tion will begin to be damaged. As to the metamorphosis of nitrogenous
tissues or to animal heat, seems improbable that alcohol in quantities that
                                     it
can be properly used          in diet     has any effect      ;  appears to us unlikely (in the

work on less food, though       quickening    by

spur in the side of horse, eliciting force, though not supplying it.

  The employment of alcohol in health and disease          so great   subject        is                  a
that we should have felt tempted to extend these remarks to some points
of medical practice, had   been desirable to do so in this place.

 use of alcohol in rousing       a failing  appetite, exciting a feeble heart, and
accelerating a languid capillary circulation, we have been strongly im
pressed with the necessity for great moderation and caution.              In spite of
our previous experience in the use of alcohol and brandy, we were hardly
prepared for the ease with which appetite may be destroyed, the heart
unduly excited, and the capillary circulation improperly increased. Con
sidering its daily and almost universal use, there is no agent which
seems to us to require more caution and more skill to obtain the good and
to avoid the evil which its use entails.
   We wish to guard ourselves against the supposition that in speaking of
alcohol and brandy we refer at all to wine and beer, which contain sub
stances, in addition to alcohol, which may make their action in nutrition
somewhat different.

   the President and Council consider it most desirable, with a view to the

Resolved, — That       a Committee be appointed to report to the Council on
   the measures it will be advisable to take in order to carry the foregoing
   resolution most advantageously into effect.       The Committee to consist
   of the President and Officers, with Dr. Carpenter, Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys,
   and Captain Richards.
                                February  18, 1869.
   Read the following Report of the Committee on Marine Researches           : —
   "The     Committee appointed by the Council on the 21st of January, to
consider the measures advisable for the further prosecution of Researches
into the Physical and Biological Conditions of the Deep Sea in the neigh
bourhood of the British Coast, beg leave to Report as follows : —
   " The results obtained by the Dredgings and Temperature-Soundings
carried on during the brief Cruise of II. M.S. ' Lightning- in August and
September 1868, taken in connexion with those of the Dredgings recently
prosecuted under the direction of the Governments of Sweden and of the
United    States, and with the remarkable Temperature-Soundings      of Captain
Shortland in the Arabian Gulf, have conclusively       shown —
    " 1 . That the Ocean-bottom, at depths of 500 fathoms or more, pre
sents a vast field for research, of which the systematic exploration can
scarcely fail to yield results of the highest interest and importance, in re
gard alike to Physical, Biological, and Geological Science.
   " 2. That the prosecution of such a systematic exploration is altogether
beyond the reach of private enterprise, requiring means and appliances
which can only be furnished by Government.
   " It may be hoped that Her Majesty-s Government may be induced at
some future time to consider this work as one       of the special duties of the
British Navy ; which possesses, in the world-wide distribution of its Ships,
far greater opportunities for such researches than the Navy of any other
country.
    " At   present,   however, the Committee    consider it desirable that the
Royal Society should represent to Her Majesty-s Government the import
ance of at once following up the suggestions appended to Dr. Carpenter-s
'
  Preliminary Report- of the Cruise of the 'Lightning,- by instituting,
during the coming season, a detailed survey of the deeper part of the
Ocean-bottom between the North of Scotland and the Faroe Islands, and
by extending that survey in both a N.E. and a S.W. direction, so as
thoroughly to investigate the Physical and the Biological conditions of the
two Submarine Provinces         included in that area, which are characterized
by a strongly marked contrast in Climate, with a corresponding dissimi
larity in Animal Life, and to trace this climatic dissimilarity to its source ;
as well as to carry down the like survey to depths much greater than have
 been yet explored by the Dredge.
    " This,  it is believed, can be accomplished without difficulty (unless the
weather     should prove extraordinarily unpropitious) by the employment

 1869.]         ora the  Scientific Exploration   of the   Deep Sea.          399
of  a suitable vessel, provided with the requisite appliances, between the
middle of May and the middle of September.                The Ship should be of
sufficient size to furnish a Crew of which each 'watch- could carry on the
work continuously without undue fatigue, so as to take the fullest advan
tage of calm weather and long summer days ; and should also provide
adequate   accommodation for the study of the specimens when freshly ob
tained, which should be one of the primary objects of the Expedition.           As
there would be no occasion to extend the Survey to a greater distance than
 (at the most) 400 miles from land, no difficulty would be experienced in
obtaining the supplies necessary for such a four months- cruise, by run
ning from time to time to the port that might be nearest.        Thus, supposing
that the Ship took its departure from Cork or Q-alway, and proceeded
first to the channel between the British Isles and Rockall Bank, where
depths of from 1000 to 1300 fathoms are known to exist, the Dredgings
and Temperature-Soundings          could be proceeded with in a northerly di
rection, until it would be convenient to make Stornoway.          Taking a fresh
departure from that port, the exploration might then be carried on over
the area to the N.W. of the Hebrides, in which the more moderate depths
(from 500 to 600 fathoms) would afford greater facility for the detailed
survey of that part of the Ocean-bottom on which a Cretaceous deposit is
in progress — the Fauna of this area having been shown by the ' Lightning-
researches   to present features of most especial interest, while the careful
study of the deposit may be expected to elucidate many phenomena as yet
unexplained which are presented by the ancient Chalk Formation.                 A
month or six weeks would probably be required for this part of the         Survey,
at the end of which time the vessel might again run to Stornoway          for sup
plies. The area to the North and N.E. of Lewis should then be              worked
in the like careful manner; and as the 'cold area- would here be          encoun
tered, special attention should      be given to the determination of its boun
daries, and   of the    sources of  its climatic peculiarity.  These would pro
bably require the extension of the survey for some distance in a N.E.
direction, which would carry the vessel into the neighbourhood of the
Shetland Isles ; and Lerwick would then be a suitable port for supplies.
Whatever time might then remain would be advantageously employed in
dredging at such a distance round the Shetlands as would give depths of
from 250 to 400 fathoms, Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys-s dredgings in that locality
having been limited to 200 fathoms.
    "The Natural- History work of such an Expedition should              be prose
cuted under the direction of a Chief (who need not, however, be the same
throughout), aided by two competent Assistants (to be provided by the
Royal Society), who should be engaged for the whole Cruise.            Mr. Gywn
Jeffreys is ready to take charge of it during the first five or six weeks, say,
to the end of June, when Professor -Wyville Thomson would be prepared to
take his place ; and Dr. Carpenter would be able to join the Expedition
early in August, remaining with it to the end.           It would be a great ad
                                                                  2  i 2

 vantage   if the Surgeon appointed to the Ship should have sufficient know
 ledge of Natural History, and sufficient interest in the inquiry, to partici
 pate in the work.
     " The experience of the previous Expedition will furnish              adequate
 guidance    as to the appliances    which it would     be necessary to ask     the
 Government to provide, in case they accede to the present application.
     " With reference to the Scientific instruments and apparatus to be pro
 vided by the Royal Society, the Committee recommend that the detailed
 consideration of them be referred to a Special Committee, consisting of
 Gentlemen practically conversant with the construction and working of
 such instruments."
 Resolved, —That the Report now read be received and adopted, and that
     application be made to Her Majesty-s Government accordingly.
     The following Draft of a Letter to be transmitted       by the Secretary to

 which has already been transmitted for the consideration of the Lords
 Commissioners of the Admiralty — I am directed by the President and
 Council of the Royal Society to state that, looking to the valuable infor
 mation obtained from these Marine Researches, although comparatively
 restricted in duration and extent, they deem it most desirable, in the in
 terests  of Biological and Physical Science, and in no small degree also for
 the advancement of Hydrogrnphical knowledge, that a fresh exploration
 should be entered upon in the ensuing summer, and extended over a wider
 area ; and they now desire earnestly to recommend the matter to the
 favourable consideration of My Lords, in the hope that the aid of Her
.Majesty-s Government, which was so readily and liberally bestowed last
 year, may be afforded to the undertaking now contemplated, for which
 such support would be indispensable.
       In favour of the practicability and probable success of the proposed
  fresh exploration, I am directed to explain that the objects to be aimed at,
  ns well as the course to be followed and the measures to be employed for
  their attainment, have mainly been suggested by the observations made
  and the experience   gained in the last Expedition.
     " Further information   as to the proposed exploration      will be found in
  the Report, herewith transmitted, of a Committee to whose consideration
  the subject was referred by the Council.

  required for the proposed service could be provided by the temporary em
  ployment of one of Her Majesty's Surveying Vessels now in commission,

    Read the following Report : — >
    "The    Committee       appointed   Feb, 18, 1869, to consider the Scientific

 402                 Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson         [Nov. 18,
 Apparatus it will be desirable to provide for the proposed Expedition for
Marine llesearches, beg leave to lay before the Council the following
 Report   : —
    " The    chief subjects of Physical Enquiry which presented themselves aa
 interesting on their own account, or in relation to the existence of Life at
 great depths, were as follows : —
    "
       (1) The Temperature both at the bottom and at various depths be
 tween that and the surface.
    " (2)   The nature and amount of the dissolved Gases.
    " (3)   The amount of Organic matter contained in the water, and the
nature and amount of the Inorganic salts.
    "
      (4) The amount of Light to be found at great depths.
    " Among these subjects the Committee thought it desirable to confine
 themselves in the first instance to such as had previously to some extent
been taken in band, or could pretty certainly be carried out.
    " The    determination of Temperatures has hitherto rested chiefly upon
 the registration of minimum Thermometers.           It is obvious that the tem
 perature registered by minimum thermometers sunk to the bottom of the
 sea, even   if  their registration were unaffected by the pressure, would only
give the lowest temperature reached somewhere between top and bottom,
 not necessarily at the bottom itself.      The temperatures at various depths
might indeed, provided they nowhere increased on going deeper, be deter
mined by a series of minimum thermometers placed at different distances
along the line, though this would involve considerable difficulties.        Still,
the liability of the index to slip, and the probability that the indication of
the thermometers would be affected by the great pressure to which they
were exposed, rendered it very desirable to control their indications by an
independent method.
    " Two   plans were proposed for this purpose, one by Sir Charles Wheat-
stone, and one by Mr. Siemens.          Both plans involved the employment of
a voltaic current, excited by a battery on deck ; and required a cable for the
conveyance      of insulated wires. The former plan depended upon the action
of an immersed Brcguet-s thermometer, which by an electro-mechanical
arrangement was read by an indicating instrument placed on deck.            The
latter plan made the indication of temperature depend on the existence of
a thermal variation in the electric resistance of a conducting wire.           It
rested on the equalization of the derived currents in two perfectly similar
partial circuits, containing each a copper wire running the whole length of
the cable, the sea, and a resistance-coil of fine platinum wire ; the coil in
the one circuit being immersed in the sea at the end of the cable, and that
in the other being immersed in a vessel on deck, containing water the tem
perature of which could be regulated by the addition of hot or cold water,
and determined by an ordinary thermometer.
    "The instruments required in Sir Charles Wheatstone-s plan were more
expensive,     and would take longer to construct; and besides, the Com

1869.]           on the Scientific Exploration     of  the Deep Sea.             403
mittee were unwilling to risk the loss of a somewhat costly instrument in
case the cable were to break.       On these accounts they thought it best to
adopt the simpler plan proposed by Mr. Siemens ; and the apparatus re
quired for carrying the plan into execution is now completed, and in use in
the expedition.
    " Meanwhile     a  plan had been devised by Dr. Miller for obviating the
effect of pressure on a minimum thermometer, without preventing access
to the stem for the purpose of setting the index.          It consists in enclosing
the bulb in an outer bulb rivetted-on      a little way up the stem, the interval
between the bulbs being partly filled with liquid, for the sake of quicker
conduction.       The Committee have had a few minimum thermometers con
structed on this principle, which have been found to answer perfectly. The
method is described in a short paper which will be read to the Society
to-morrow.
    " For obtaining specimens of water from any depth to which the dred
ging extends, the Committee have procured an instrument constructed as
to its leading features on the plan of that described by Dr. Marcet in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1819, and used successfully in the earlier
northern expeditions.
    " Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys is now out on the first cruise of the ' Porcupine,'
the vessel which the Admiralty have sent out for the purpose, and is
accompanied by Mr. W. L. Carpenter, B.Sc. (son of Dr. Carpenter), who
undertakes the general execution of the physical and chemical part of the
inquiry.     A  letter has been received   by the President    from   Mr. Jeffreys,
¦who speaks    highly of the zeal and efficiency of Mr. Carpenter.        The ther
mometers protected according to Dr. Miller's plan, and the instrument for
obtaining specimens of water from great depths, have been found to work
satisfactorily in actual practice.     Mr. Siemens's instrument was not quite
ready when the vessel started on her first cruise, and was not on board
when the    above letter was written.    The gas-analyses have been success
fully carried on, notwithstanding the motion of the vessel. From a letter
subsequently received from Mr. Carpenter, it appears that Mr. Siemens's
apparatus, so far as it has as yet been tried, works in perfect harmony
with the thermometers protected according to Dr. Miller's plan."

    *  The . Accumulator is composed of a number of strong vulcanized India-rubber
springs combined      at their extremities E F ; and its use is twofold,—/™/, to indicate by
its elongation any excessive strain upon the sounding or dredging line I II, which passes
through the block G ; and tecond to ease off the suddenness of such strain, and give time
for the action by which it may be relieved.          This is especially valuable in Deep-sea
Sounding and Dredging when the vessel is pitching; for the friction of two or three
miles of immersed line is so great as to prevent its yielding to any sudden jerk, such as
that given to its attached extremity by a vertical motion of a few feet when the vessel
rises to a sea.     And it is absolutely needful when Dredging is carried ou from a vessel as
               '

      2.  An ample supply of Sounding-line               was   provided,    specially manu
 factured for the purpose ; this line, made of the best Italian hemp, although
  no more than 0-8 inch in circumference, bears a strain of 12 cwt.                       For
  Soundings within 1000 fathoms- depth, it was found most convenient to
   employ an ordinary cylindrical Deep-sea Lead weighing 1 cwt., having at its
  base a conical cup for bringing up mud or sand from the bottom, which
  is furnished with a circular         lid that falls down and    closes it in when the lead
  strikes. — Above       the Lead a Water-bottle       (§ 1 9) was attached to the line, by
  which   a sample     of sea-water could be broughtup from the bottom or from any
 intermediate depth. And above this again there were attached two or more
 Thermometers, enclosed in cylindrical copper cases having holes at the top
 and bottom through which the sea-water streams upwards as the lead de
 scends.
      3. The Sounding-lead with its appurtenances is allowed to descend as
 rapidly as it can carry out the line ; but instead of descending at a con
 stantly accelerating rate, it requires more time for every additional 100
 fathoms      ; this retardation       being due, not, as is popularly supposed, to an
 increase in the density of the water*, but to the friction of the soundirig-
 line in its descent, which of course increases with every additional fathom
 that runs out.          It is this friction that produces the chief strain upon the
  line when the Lead is being drawn up, and renders great caution requisite
 in regulating the rate of the reeling-in which is effected by the donkey-
 engine.
     4.  For the deeper Soundings, the 'Hydra- Apparatus was employed.
 The essential principle of this is the same with that of all the other forms
 of Deep-sea Sounding apparatus now in use ; the weights or sinkers being
 so attached as to be let go by a mechanical contrivance when it touches the
 bottom, so that the line is relieved from the duty of raising them to the
 surface,   — the    rod or tube alone, with the water-bottle and thermometers,
 being brought up by it.                 For Soundings at depths of from             1000  to
 1500 fathoms, two sinkers, each of 112 lbs., were employed;                         and for
yet deeper soundings three were used. The peculiarity of the                        'Hydra-
 apparatus consists partly in the mechanical contrivauce for the detach
 ment of the sinkers ; and partly in the construction of the rod which
carries them, this being a strong tube furnished with valves that open
upwards, so as to allow the water to stream through it freely in its de
scent, whilst they enclose the mud or sand into which the tube is forced
on striking the bottom before the sinker is detached f.
a vessel,   however slowly it might be moving through the water, would cause the dredge-
line to part, if the strain were sudden instead of gradual.
    * This is so trifling, even at 2J milts depth, as not to equal the difference in density
bctwean fresh and salt water; being estimated by Dr. Miller at certainly not more than
1-4 7th of its volume, whilst sea-water of sp. gr. T027 is l-37th heavier than fresh water.
    t  A detailed account of this Apparatus will be found in the " Sounding Voyage of
H.M.S.    '          "

     5. Every one of the numerous deep Soundings obtained in this Expedi
tion was taken, not only under the superintendence, but actually by the
hands, of Capt. Calver himself; of whose skill in the conduct of this ope
ration (which often requires great nicety in the management of the
vessel, so as to secure a good up-and-down direction of the line) it ia
enough to say that it is worthy of the distinguished Service to which he
belongs, and to his high position in it.            Not a single fathom of line has
been     lost, and not  a single instrument has suffered damage, throughout the
 whole Expedition.

     6. The Dredges supplied to the         Porcupine     by the Admiralty were con
structed upon the model of those which were               found   to work best in the
                 -
'
   Lightning Expedition.          The experience of the First Cruise, however, in
which the dredging was carried down to more than twice the depth attained
last year, led Capt. Calver to have a still heavier dredge constructed at
 Belfast, upon a somewhat different pattern ; and it was with this that the
 very deep Dredgings of the Second cruise were executed, by which the con
 dition of the sea-bottom was successfully investigated at a depth of 2435
 fathoms      (§§45-50)*.      An ample supply of strong Dredge-rope          was pro
 vided    ; and a very simple and convenient arrangement was devised by          Capt.
 Calver for hanging this in coils upon pins attached to the inner side of the
 quarter-deck bulwarks (§ 4G), so that the three nautical miles of line
 required for the deepest Dredging could be thus disposed without at all
 encumbering the deck, and in a manner which enabled it to be most con
 veniently handled both in paying-out and reeling-in, with the additional
 advantage of keeping it remarkably free from
                                                         " kinks."
      7. An important addition to the Dredging-apparatus, which was devised
 by Capt. Calver before the commencement of the Third cruise, will be
 described in its proper place (§ 63).            The result of its employment was
 so extraordinary, that no deep dredging can hereafter be accounted of any
 value in which it has not been used         ;  and it is only now to be regretted
 that the idea had not presented itself earlier, so as to have been carried out
  in the First and Second Cruises.
      8.  The whole of this equipment would        have been ineffective if a suitable
 Donkey-engine had not been supplied            for working it. The experience of
  the ' Lightning had shown that a single-cylinder engine is not adapted for
                      -
  this purpose, being liable to stop at either end of its stroke when a heavy
  strain is put on the drum, and then moving onwards with a jerk, so as to
 throw on the line a tension which may very probably cause it to part.               It
  was therefore urged upon the Authorities at Woolwich that a double-
 cylinder engine should be supplied to the 'Porcupine-; and a 'donkey- on
 this plan was accordingly fixed, which proved most efficient.                 Nothing
 could exceed the steadiness of its working, or the facility with which its
  speed     and power could be regulated in accordance with the purposes to

which it was applied.      With the drum ordinarily used it brought up on one
occasion, from a depth of 767 fathoms, just half a ton of Atlantic mud, in a
Dredge which, with its appurtenances, weighed 8 cwt., — making 18cwt.
in the whole. This was not the limit of its capability ; forby the substitu
tion of a smaller drum a still greater power could be obtained, — of course
at the sacrifice of speed ; and it was by this means that the heaviest
Dredge, containing     l|  cwt. of Atlantic mud, was drawn up, by a rope of
more than three nautical miles in length, from a depth of 2435 fathoms
(§§ 45-50).
   9.   The working of the Dredge     was superintended throughout      by Capt.
Calver, whose trained ability very early gave him so complete a mastery
over the operation, that he found no difficulty in carrying it down to depths
at which this kind of exploration would have been previously deemed out
of the question. It is impossible for us to speak too highly of the skill he
displayed, or too warmly of the sympathy he showed iu our work.              The
placing    the Dredge   on a bottom nearly  three  miles  from  the surface,  the
working it while there, and the subsequent hauling of it in, with its pre
cious sample of the Life of the Ocean-bed at that vast depth (all executed
without the smallest failure, or even such a " hitch
                                                        " as
                                                             might have caused
the loss of an entire day-s work), is an achievement of which our Com
mander might well be proud, if pride were in his nature.          That only one
Dredge was lost during the whole Expedition affords ample proof alike of
the excellence of his arrangements and of the unwearying assiduity with
which they were carried into effective operation.      We would here add that
                             '
the other Officers of the Porcupine,- viz. Staff-Commander Inskipp, Mr.
Davidson, and Lieut. Browning, most heartily and zealously seconded their
Commander, in promoting alike the scientific objects of the Expedition
and the welfare and comfort of all who were engaged           in carrying them
out.
   10.   With regard  to the equipment of the Ship, it only remains to be added
that the Chart Room was assigned for the Scientific work of the Expedition ;
and that the accommodation it afforded (though not all that could be de
sired) enabled Chemical Analyses         and Microscopic     observations to be
carried on at the same time.
   1 1.  The provision of the Apparatus   needed for the Physical and Chemical
enquiries, which formed a special object of this Expedition, having been
placed by the Council of the Royal Society (Minutes for Feb. 18) under
the direction of a Committee " consisting of gentlemen practically con
versant with the construction and working of such instruments," every
arrangement was made which was considered expedient by the very emi
nent Authorities of which that Committee was composed. The general
conclusions at which they arrived are embodied in the Report (p. 401)
which they presented to the Council (Minutes of June 17th) ; but it
seems desirable here to record in somewhat greater detail the nature

 408               Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson               [Nov. 18,
 of   the    preliminary    enquiries    made,    and  the  arrangements     actually
 adopted.
     12. It had been   remarked in the Report of the " Lightning Expedition
                                                                                     "
 (Proceedings of the Royal Society, Dec. 17, 1868, p. 185) that while the
 existence of a minimum Temperature (probably that of the bottom) at least
 as low as 32° (0° Cent.), over a considerable area of which the depth was
 between 500 and G00 fathoms, had been conclusively established, the
 actual minimum might probably have been from 2° to 4° below that
 recorded by the Thermometers employed, the pressure of 100 atmo
 spheres, to which their bulbs were subjected at a depth of about 535
 fathoms*, being very likely to alter the capacity of the bulbs to that
 extent.     " In any renewal of the enquiry," it was added, "it will be of
 course desirable that the Thermometric          apparatus used should be specially
 protected from this source of error."
     13. So soon, therefore, as there was reason to believe that the application
 of the Council of the Royal Society for such renewal would           be acceded   to
 by II. M. Government, steps were taken to determine the precise amount of
 this error, and to devise the best means of preventing it.         After consulta
 tion between the Hydrographer,             Dr. Carpenter, and Mr. Casella (the
 maker of Meteorological       Instruments    to the Admiralty), it was determined
 that an apparatus should be constructed on the principle of the Bramali
 Press ; in which Thermometers immersed in water should be submitted to
 hydraulic pressure, which could be gradually raised till it reached three
 tons on the square inch, its amount being indicated by a pressure-gauge
 as the experiment proceeded.         Mr. Casella further undertook to construct
 Thermometers with bulbs of extra thickness, in order that it might be
 ascertained whether the error arising from external pressure (if such should
 be proved to exist) could be kept in check by this simple expedient.           The
 question was at the same time made the subject of consideration by a Com
 mittee appointed by the Council of the Royal Society, as set forth in the
 Minutes already cited (p. 402, 403); and it was determined that trial should
be given to a plan proposed by Dr. W. A. Miller, which consists in the
enclosure of the bulb of the Six-s Thermometer (the form of Self-register
ing Thermometer that had been found by experience                 best adapted to
Deep-sea Soundings) in a second or outer bulb, sealed around the neck of
the stem,    — the   space   between    the inner and outer bulbs being nearly
filled with alcohol, and the greater part of the air being displaced from
the small unfilled space, by boiling the spirit before the outer bulb is
sealed.     In this manner the inner bulb is protected from the influence
of variations in external pressure upon the outer, the only effect of which is
to alter the capacity of the unfilled space ; whilst changes of temperature
in the medium surrounding the outer bulb are speedily transmitted to the
fluid contained within the inner, by convection through the thin stratum

 were tested in the pressure-apparatus, together
 with various instruments of the ordinary construc
 tion, as well as with instruments constructed by
 Mr. Casella with bulbs of extra thickness. A pre
 liminary    trial having indicated (1) that the effect
 of hydraulic pressure upon ordinary Thermometers
 (as shown by the rise of the maximum index) is
 always very considerable, though                  varying in
 amount according to the construction of the in
 strument, (2) that this effect cannot be pre
 vented by an increase in the thickness of the bulb,
 and (3) that the rise of the maximumo index in
 thermometers protected according to Dr. Miller-s
 plan was comparatively trifling, — a series of com
 parisons between the "protected" and the "un
 protected" instruments           was very      carefully con
 ducted under the direction of Staff-Commander
 Davis of the Hydrographic Office ; who, having
 had experience in Thermometric Soundings in Sir
 James C. Ross-s Antarctic Expedition, felt spe
 cially interested in the determination of this ques
 tion.    In these   experiments the difference between
 the    ordinary     unprotected Thermometers              con
 structed by Mr. Casella for the Admiralty (by
which the Temperature-Soundings had been taken
in the 'Lightning-           Expedition),      and protected
Thermometers constructed on the same pattern in
 every other respect, was carefully noted at gradually
increasing pressures, so as to determine the amount
 of such difference        at depths      respectively corre
 sponding to these pressures. The question whether
the small elevation of the maximum index observed in the protected Ther
mometers is fairly attributable to an actual increment in the temperature
of the water in which they are immersed, consequent upon the com
pression to which it is subjected during the experiment, was carefully
 considered by Dr. Miller (Proceedings, toe. cit.), who satisfied himself,

principle  had  been  previously applied   in Thermometers   constructed under the direction
of Admiral Fitzroy, the space between the two bulbs, however, being occupied by
mercury instead of spirit.    But owing to some imperfection in the construction of these
instruments, their performance was not satisfactory, and they were found very liable to
fracture.

Thomson tested the condition of these Thermometers by immersing them in ice and                        ;
they both recorded exactly 32°.

several others at a depth       of above two miles), they have been found to be
in   as  good  order   as when  they were first sent out by Mr. Casella.           While
this most satisfactory result is partly due to the careful handling of the
apparatus by Capt. Calver, it is mainly attributable on the one hand to
the excellence of the principle on which the Thermometers are constructed,
and on the other to the admirable workmanship of Mr. Casella ; for the
records of previous Temperature-Soundings                 show that the fracture of
the bulbs        of unprotected Thermometers at great depths was a very
common occurrence,           whilst the record     of observations       made     in the
'
   Lightning- Expedition* shows that the indications of Thermometers                   of
less perfect construction often show a considerable discrepancy.
     1G.  In concluding this account of the behaviour of the protected Miller-
Casella Thermometers under the most trying conditions, it may be added
that wherever the localities of the Temperature-Soundings taken with these
                                                        '
instruments      during the Third cruise of the Porcupine- were the same
(or nearly so) with those of the Temperature-Soundings                    taken in the
'
   Lightning- Expedition, their correspondence proved to be very close,
when the proper correction for the depths at which they were taken was
applied to the latter (§ 95).         Thus the differences of temperature between
the Warm and the Cold Areas indicated by those observations                   f remained
the same, although the Temperatures recorded by the unprotected "                " Ther
 mometers     required to be reduced by from 2° to 3° to show the actual tempe
ratures, — a    recorded temperature of 46° at 650 fathoms in the Warm Area
indicating a real temperature of 43°, while a recorded temperature of 32° at
550 fathoms in the Cold Area indicated a real temperature of about 29-8°.
     1 7. As it was considered expedient by the Committee (p. 402) that a trial
should be given to Mr. Siemens-s apparatus for the determination of deep-sea
temperatures, this apparatus (which he terms a Differential Thermometer)
                              '              and provided with 1000 fathoms of a

small cable about the size of        the  ordinary Sounding-line, which contained
 the two insulated wires necessary for the establishment of the two circuits
 to be brought into comparison. The indications of this instrument depend
 upon the equalization of two currents transmitted through resistance-coils
 of fine platinum wire ; one of these coils being sent down at the end of the
 sounding-cable, whilst the other is immersed in a vessel on deck, the water
 in which can be gradually lowered in temperature by the addition of ice
 or the use of a freezing-mixture.         When the equalization of the currents
 is shown by the galvanometer,         the temperature of the water in the vessel
 on deck (indicated by an ordinary thermometer) will represent that of the
 stratum of the sea beneath, in which the resistance-coil is immersed at the
 time. — Nothing can be more perfect than the working of this apparatus
 when the Galvanometer rests on a fixed plane surface ; and its accuracy
 and delicacy were satisfactorily proved by experiments carried on not

 to make the zero observations requisite to indicate equilibrium, though
 Mr. W. L. Carpenter (who had charge of the apparatus,         403) tried                          p.
 every expedient that circumstances admitted.         obvious, therefore,      It   is
 that this instrument              can only be made use of on board ship when the
 Galvanometer           is   so suspended as not to participate in the rolling or pitching
 of the    vessel   ;     to be hoped that Mr. Siemens, with his well-
                         and    it    is
 known ingenuity, may be able to devise the means of accomplishing this.
   18. It may be well here to mention that as  was found impracticable it                                                to
employ Mr. Siemens's Differential Thermometer for the determination                                                      of

                                          taking series of Temperature
Soundings with Thermometers sent down to successively increasing depths
in the same locality. Such series were obtained in each of the Cruises with                                    ;
the result, as will be shown hereafter(§94 etseq.), of not merely confirming the
conclusion advanced in the 'Lightning' Report (p. 189) that the minimum
temperature       that of the bottom, but of affording a set of most important

                                    the Scientific Committee was the feasi
bility of constructing            a   vessel which should           fill itself with           Water, either             at
the bottom or at any intermediate depth, as might be required                                        ;    and which
should bring such water to the surface without the loss of                                              any
                                                                                                                of      the
Gases     dissolved in it.             This might        be easily accomplished,                        were    it      not
for (1) the expansion which water taken under great pressure undergoes
when that pressure      removed, the force of which would be sufficient
                                  is
to burst the strongest vessel that could be made  and (2) the expansile        ;
force of the gases dissolved in   under great pressure, which would eiert
                                               it

this difficulty but ;  was considered that as time would not permit
                               it                                     the                                          of
preparation of any but very easily constructed apparatus,       would                                it                  bt
better on the present occasion to adopt form of Water-Bottle suggested

by the Hydrographer on the basis of the cylindrical copper cases used for
the protection of deep sea thermometers, these having been found to                                                bring
up specimens of water whose turbid condition left no doubt that had                                     it         come
from     the stratum immediately covering, the soft ocean-bottom.         The
Water-Bottle constructed on the Hydrographer's plan             simple strong             is   a
cylinder of brass, 26 inches long, and 2-3 inch in interior diameter, holding
about 60 oz. of water.                     In the disk which          closes    it   in at each              end there
is   circular aperture,
     a                                 into    which     a   conical       valve     is   accurately            fitted.
While this bottle              is
                                descending through                    the water with the                       SounJ-
jng-Apparatus,           the valves readily yield to the upward pressure,                                          and

a   continuous    current   streams      through it ; but so soon as the descent
is checked, either by the arrival of the apparatus at the bottom, or by
a stop put on the line from above, the valves                 fall into their places, and
thus enclose the water that may fill the bottle at the moment.                     The ex-

 pansion of this water and of its dissolved gases, as the bottle is brought
 to the surface, causes a pressure from within, which lifts the upper valve so
 as to permit the escape of whatever part of the contents of the bottle may be
 in excess of its capacity. The interior of the bottle was coated with var
  nish, to prevent the chemical action of the sea-water upon it. — The work
  ing of this very simple apparatus was found to be entirely satisfactory.
  Abundant evidence was obtained that, when it descended to the bottom,
  it brought up bottom-water : thus, in the area of the " Globigerina-mud,"
  the water was slightly turbid, and deposited after a time a fine sediment
  (which might be removed by filtration), that proved to consist almost
  entirely of extremely minute Globigerina.              And hence it may be fairly in
 ferred that when its descent was checked at any intermediate point, the

water brought up in it would be derived from that stratum.          Although it
can scarcely be supposed that the whole amount of the gases dissolved in
the very deep water is retained when the superincumbent pressure is
removed, yet it may be inferred, from the slight excess which still usually
presented     itself, that the very deep water must include a greater propor
tion of gases than that taken at or near the surface.
    20. A number of large glass bottles were provided, for bringing home
samples of Sea-water taken in various localities and at different depths ; and
of these Dr. Frankland kindly undertook to make careful analyses, which
should show not merely the proportions of its Saline constituents, but —
what has recently come to be a point of most unexpected interest (§ 23)
— the     amount of Organic matter it may contain.        The results of these
analyses    are  stated  in Appendix  II.
     2 1. But the determination of the nature and proportions of the dissolved
 Gases could only be effected by immediate analysis     ; and it was considered
 by the Committee that it would be expedient to attempt this, notwith
 standing the difficulties which might be expected to arise from the motion
 of the vessel.      A method devised by Dr. Miller, as most suitable to the
circumstances, was carried into practical operation by Mr. W. L. Carpenter,
 who succeeded in working this apparatus so efficiently during the First
 Cruise, and obtained by means of it results of such singular interest, that
 it was considered desirable that the same system should be followed
 throughout the Expedition.         This work was therefore committed in the
 Second Cruise to the charge of Mr. Hunter, Assistant to Prof. Andrews of
 Queen-s College, Belfast ; and it was carried on during the Third Cruise
 by Mr. P. Herbert Carpenter, according to the instructions he had received
 from Mr. Hunter, whom he had accompanied in the Second Cruise. — A
 general statement of the results obtained, which on the whole accorded
 well with each other, is included in the present Report (Appendix I.) ; par
 ticulars of the method employed, with details of the analytical results, and
 a fuller discussion of their rationale, will be furnished hereafter by Mr.
 W. L. Carpenter.
     22. The accurate working of a Balance on board a ship at sea being ob
 viously impracticable, the Specific Gravity of every specimen of Deep-sea-
 water brought up by the bottle was taken by Hydrometers specially con
 structed to indicate it within the required range to four places of decimals ;
 and this was compared with the Specific Gravity of Surface-water.          The
 determinations obtained by this method, however, of which the results are
  stated in Appendix I., cannot be regarded as equal in accuracy to those ob
 tained by the Balance ; and greater reliance, therefore, is to be placed on the
 Specific Gravities of the samples analyzed by Dr. Frankland (Appendix II.).
     23. Further, tests devised by Dr. Angus Smith to determine the amount
 of Organic matter (1) in a non- decomposing, and probably therefore an assi
 milable state, and (2) in a state of decomposition, were frequently applied ;
 with the remarkable result (Appendix I.), which has been since fully con

 firmed by the elaborate analyses of Dr. Frankland (Appendix II.), of indi
 cating the universal presence of a highly Nitrogenous substance, such as
 may well be supposed to afford a direct supply of nutritive material to the
 Rhizopodic Fauna {Sponges and Foraminifera, with Bathybiusl)                   of the
 Ocean-bottom, as was first suggested by Prof. Wyville Thomson                  in his
 Memoir on Holtenia*.
    24. For the management of the Dredging-operations two Assistants were
 appointed on the recommendation of Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, under whom
 both of them had previously worked : Mr. Laughrin of Polperro, an old
 Coastguard-man, and an Associate of the Linnean Society, for dredging
 and  sifting; and Mr. B. S. Dodd for picking out, cleaning, and storing the
 specimens collected.      Both did their respective shares of the work care
 fully and zealously.
    25. The Sieves were constructed under the direction of Mr. Jeffreys.
 These were five in number, and were " nested
                                                        " or fitted one within an
 other, with a strong handle of galvanized iron affixed to the bottom sieve
 on each side ; so that the dredged material might             pass  through all the
 sieves at the same time, as they were worked in a large tub of sea -water on
 the deck.     Their frames were of oak ; and their lining was of copper
 wove-wire, the mesh of the top sieve being 2 holes to an inch, that of
 the next 4 holes, and of the succeeding sieves 8, 16, and 32. Each sieve
 was furnished with a beading round the inside rim, to prevent specimens
 remaining under the edges when the sieves were washed after each dredging ;
 the risk of intermixture      of specimens    obtained from different dredgings
was thus avoided.
    26. Two other kinds of Sieve were also found useful. — One was spherical,
with a lid fastened inside by bolts ; its frame consisted of a strong net
 work of copper ribs, which was lined with very fine wire-gauze of the same
metal, and it had a ring through which a line would pass.                 Its use was
to sift and wash away in the sea the impalpable mud got in large quanti
ties at great depths ; so as to leave         only for examination all organisms
exceeding    in  size  l-36th of     an  inch, this being the diameter of the
mesh in the wire-lining.          Some of the residuum or strained mud was
likewise preserved, after sifting the material in the usual way. This con
trivance, which we called the "globe-sieve," saved a great deal of the
time and useless labour expended in washing dredged material of that
viscid kind through the ordinary sieves in a tub of sea-water, which soon
becomes    so turbid, that unless the tub is continually        emptied and refilled
it is extremely difficult (if possible) to detect any          specimens.  — Another
kind of sieve had a similar framework ; but the body           was semiglobose,   with
an open funnel-shaped neck.          It was fastened to a long pole, and served
for catching Pteropods, Salpte, and other animals on the surface of the
sea.    This went by the name of the " scoop-sieve."
    27. An ample supply of spirit, jars, and bottles was provided ; and the

most convenient storage-room was assigned for them that the small      size of
the vessel permitted.
    28. The unexpected amount of the Collections made during each Cruise,
and especially during the Third, put all these resources to a severe test;
and it is satisfactory to be able to state that nothing was found wanting
which could not be supplied at the ports at which the ' Porcupine- put in.
    29. The work of the Expedition was distributed, according to the plan
originally marked out, into Three Cruises : the first of which was under the
 Scientific charge of Mr. Jeffreys, who was accompanied by Mr. W. L. Car
penter ; the second under the Scientific charge of Prof. Wyville Thomson,
 who was accompanied by Mr. Hunter ; and the third under the Scienti6c
 charge of Dr. Carpenter, who had the advantage of the companionship of
 Prof. Wyville Thomson, as well as of his son Mr. P. Herbert Carpenter. —
 The ground assigned to the First and Second Cruises, however, was some
 what different from that originally proposed (p. 399).     For as it was con
 sidered that the exploration of the     " Porcupine Bank," which lies about
 150 miles to the west of Galway, and beyond which the water rapidly
 deepens to 1 500 fathoms, would be likely to afford results of great value,
 and would present a very suitable locality for ascertaining to what depths
 Dredging could be successfully carried down, it was arranged that this
 exploration, with that of the deep channel intervening between the British
 plateau and
               " Kockall Bank" should be the work of the First Cruise ; and
 that in the Second Cruise this exploration should be carried on in a north
 erly and north-westerly direction, so as to be connected with the work
 which had been assigned to the Third Cruise, viz. the more thorough and
 extended exploratiou of the region traversed in the ' Lightning- Expedition.
 — It will be seen hereafter (§ 40) that it was by a change subsequently
 made in the direction     of the Second Cruise that the most remarkable
 achievement in the whole Expedition was rendered possible.

                       First Cruise.      (Chart, Plate 4.)
    30. The First Cruise of H.M.S. 'Porcupine- commenced on the 18th
 of May, and ended on the 13th of July.             It comprised the Atlantic
 coasts of Ireland, from the Skelligs to Rockall (a distance of about
 or 450 miles), Loughs Swilly and Foyle on the north coast, and the
 North Channel on the way to Belfast.        The first dredging was made on
 our way round from -Woolwich to Galway, on the 24th of May, about
 forty miles off Valentia, in 1 10 fathoms ; bottom sandy, with a little mud.
 The Fauna was mostly Northern ; and the following are the more remark
 able  species   then procured: — Mollusca: Ostrea cochlear, Neasra ros-
 trata,    Verticordia abynsicola, Dentalium abyssorum, Aporrhdis Serre

    1869.]         on the Scientific Exploration      of the  Deep Sea.             417
    sianus, Buccinum Humphreysianum, Murex imbricatus, Pleurotoma cari-
   nata, and Cavolina trispinosa. — Echinodermata : Echinus elegant, Ci-
   daris papillata, and Spatangus Raschi. — Actinozoa : Caryophyllia
    Smithii, var. borealis.     Of these, Ostrea cochlear, Aporrha'is Serresianus,
   and Murex imbricatus         are Mediterranean      species  ; and Trochus granu
    lans also imparted somewhat of             a Southern    character,  although that
   species     was  afterwards found      living in the Shetland      district.   Ostrea
   cochlear is a small deep-water species of Oyster, and is one of the shells
   which M. Alphonse Milne-Edwards noticed adhering to the Telegraph-
   Cable between Sardinia and Algiers, at a depth of about 1100 fathoms
   (see    'Lightning Report,' p. 182) ; but it has been found (by Mr. Gwyn
   Jeffreys) attached to the columns of the Temple of Jupiter Serapis at
   Pozzuoli near Naples, which are reputed not to have been submerged to
  any considerable depth.          The above results of this dredging will give a fair
  idea of the Fauna inhabiting the 100-fathom line on the West coast of
  Ireland.
       3 1 . After coaling at Galway we steamed southward, and (the weather being
  very coarse and unpromising)         we dredged in Dingle Bay at a depth of from
  30 to 40 fathoms      ; bottom rocky and muddy.         As before, in comparatively
  shallow water, we had two dredges out, one at the bow and the other at the
  stern ; as had been previously the practice of Mr. Jeffreys in his own
  yacht, when dredging at from 20 to 200 fathoms' depth.                In Dingle Bay
  the dredges several times caught in rocks or large stones, hut were saved
  by the usual yarn-stops, and by the extraordinary strength of the 2-inch
  Chatham rope which was used.               On one occasion, when the dredge was
  fast, the vessel,      which    is nearly 400     tons' burden, was pulled round
  and swung by the rope, as firmly as if          she were at anchor and moored by
  a chain-cable.       Here, again, the Mollusca were mostly Northern : — Sipho-
  nodcntalium Lofotense, Chiton Hanleyi, Tectura fulva, Odostomia clavula,
  Trophon truncatus, and Cylichna nitidula fall within this category ;
 while Eulima subulata,            Trophon muricatus, Pleurotoma attenuata, and
  Philine catena may be reckoned Southern species. But the most re
  markable shell obtained in this dredging was Montacuta Bawsoni, a
 species       which   had   been   described and figured by Mr. Jeffreys, from
 specimens found by Mr. Robert                Dawson in the Moray Firth.         Of this
 species specimens were subsequently detected by Mr. Jeffreys in the Royal
 Museum at Copenhagen, in the collection of Greenland shells made by
 the late Dr. II. P. C. Moller, as well as in Professor Torell's collection of
 Spitzbergen shells at Lund. The species had been briefly described and no
ticed by Dr. Moller in the addenda to his ' Index Molluscorum Grcenlandise,'
as a " Testa bivalvis ;" but he did not give it any other name.                 The size
of     the Greenland      and  Spitzbergen specimens is considerably greater than
that of British         specimens ; thus adding another to the numerous cases
of     a   similar kind which have from time to time been adduced by Mr.
Jeffreys as justifying his statement that of those species of Mollusca

  418             Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson             [Nov.  18,
  which are common to Northern and Southern latitudes, and which in
  habit the same bathymetrical zone, the Northern are usually larger than
  the Southern    specimens.     It may perhaps be a not unfair inference that
  the origin of such species is Northern, and that they dwindle and become
  depauperated in proportion to the distance to which they have migrated
'
  or been transported from their ancestral homes.
      32. The next week was occupied in sounding and dredging off Valentia
  and on the way to Galway, at depths varying from 85 to 808 fathoms (Stations
  2 to  7). The Fauna throughout was Northern ; and several interesting acqui
  sitions were made in all departments of the Invertebrate.           Among these
  may    be mentioned  : — Mollusca     : Nucula    pumila (Norway), Leda frigida
  (Spitzbergen and Finmark), Verticordia abyssicola (Finmark), Siphonode*-
  talium quinquangulare (Norway and Mediterranean), and an undescribed
  species of Fusus, allied to F. Sabini. — Echinodermata:              the remark
  able   Brisinga endecacnemos,     hitherto only known as a Northern form.—
  Actinozoa : Flabellum laciniatum, Edw. and J. Haime= Ulocyathutart-
  ticus, Sars (Norway and Shetland, as well as a Sicilian fossil), of which we
  and delicate coral unusually perfect specimens were obtained. That fine
  Shetland Sponge Phakellia ventilabrum was also met with thus far south,
  in  90 fathoms.    Many of the most marked types of the deep-water Crus
  tacea of the Shetland       sea were here dredged ; while in company with
  these were Gonoplax rhombo'ides, Fab., a well-known Mediterranean species,
  an undescribed and very fine Ebalia, a new species of the Mediterranean
  genus Ethusa, together with numerous Mysidea, Cumacea, and Amphipoda
  new     to our Fauna.     Cyprinididte    also   were abundant    on this ground.
  The 808 fathoms' dredging        was then a novelty, being (as we believed)
  the greatest depth ever explored in that way.               The length of rope
  paid out was 1110       fathoms,   and   the   time occupied in hauling in was
  fifty-five minutes.    The same proportionate time was observed in other
  dredgings during    this  cruise, viz. five minutes for every 100 fathoms of
   rope. The dredge contained about two hundredweight of soft and sticky
   mud, in appearance resembling "China clay."             The animals brought up
   on this occasion were quite lively.        More than one specimen was exa
   mined of a small Gastropod (described and figured by Mr. Jeffreys as
   Lacuna lenella), which had very conspicuous eyes. There was also a young
   and active specimen of the large Norwegian Crab, Geryon trident, Krover,
   which is very rare in the Scandinavian seas, and was the only North
   European Brachyuran which had not as yet been found in British waters.
   —We had here, for the first time, an opportunity of comparing the tem
   peratures indicated by Dr. Miller's " protected" Thermometers, and those
   of the ordinary construction, at     a  considerable depth.     The minimum re
   corded by one of the former was       410-4, whilst that recorded by one of the
   best ordinary thermometers was 450,2.            As this difference of 3°'8 was
    almost exactly what the results of the experiments previously made had
   indicated as the effect of a pressure amounting to one ton on the square inch

1869.]        on the Scientific Exploration    of   the Deep Sea.          419
(the pressure of  column of sea-water at 800 fathoms- depth), this close
                   a
coincidence gave us a feeling of great confidence in the practical working of
               "
the " protected instrument.
   33. We next applied ourselves to the examination of the sea-bed between
Galway and the Porcupine Bank, as well as beyond the Bank, at depths ran
ging from 85 to 1230 fathoms (Stations 10 to 17). All the Mollusca were
Northern, except Aporrhdis Serresianus ; and even that we are now inclined
to consider identical with A. Macandrece, which inhabits the coasts of Nor
way and Shetland, the latter appearing to be a dwarf variety or form.  The
more remarkable species were, among Mollusca, Limopsis aurita (a well-
known tertiary fossil), Area glacialis, Verticordia abyssicola, Dentalium
abyssorum, Trochus cinereus, Fusus despectus, F. Islandicus, F. fenes
trates, and Columbella haliceeti (a tertiary fossil) ; among Echino-
dermata, Cidaris papillata          and Echinus Norvegicus;       and the fine
 branching Coral Lophohelia prolifera.        In the deepest dredging made in
 this part of the cruise (Station 17, 1230 fathoms), in which the minimum
-temperature (shown by subsequent inquiry to be that of the bottom) was
 37°-8, there occurred several new species and two new genera of the Area
family, Trochus minutissimus of Mighels (a North-American species)
 having two conspicuous eyes, a species of Ampelisca (Crustacean) with
 the usual number of four eyes, comparatively gigantic Foraminifera, and
 siliceous Polycystina. The Foraminifera obtained in these and previous
 dredgings in deep water were of great interest.        A large proportion of
 them belonged to the Arenaceous group, in which the calcareous shell is
 replaced by a
                   " test " formedjof agglutinated sand-grains ; and of this
group a large number of new types presented themselves, many of them
 very remarkable both for size and complexity of structure.          The Milio-
 lines, as in the ' Lightning
                               -
                                 dredgings in  the Warm   area, were  of exceed
 ingly large size ; and the Gristellarians were both large and varied in form,
 their axis of growth presenting every gradation from the rectilineal to the
 spiral. An enormous Fish (Mola nasus), which is not uncommon on the
 coasts of Upper Norway, was slowly swimming or floating on the sur
 face of the sea ; but we did not succeed in capturing       it, for want of a
harpoon.
   34. We then put into Killibegs, Co. Donegal, and coaled there for our
trip to Rockall, which    an isolated and conical rock, standing out of the
                           is
Atlantic in Lat. 57° 35', and Long. 13° 41', at least 200 miles from the
nearest land.    In anticipation of this trip requiring     clear fortnight,
                                                            a
coals were stacked on the deck, iu addition to the usual stowage in the
bunkers, so as to provide   sufficient supply.
                                a              Some delay was caused by
the non-arrival of    proper galvanometer to work Mr. Siemens-s electro-
                       a
thermometric apparatus, which we were anxious again to try. — We left
Donegal Bay on the 27th of June, and returned to the mainland on the
9th of July, after dredging during seven days at depths exceeding 1200
fathoms, and on four other days at less depths.     The greatest depth

420                Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson            [Nov. 18,
reached was 1476 fathoms (Station 21). In this last-mentioned dredging
we got several living MolluSca and other animals, a stalk-eyed Crtutattax
with two prominent and unusually large eyes, and a Holothurian of a like
colour.    The bottom at the greater depths consisted of a fine clayey mud,
 which varied in colour (in some cases being brownish, in others yellow,
 cream-colour, or drab, and occasionally greyish), and invariably having a
 greater or less admixture of pebbles, gravel, and sand.         The upper layer
 formed a flocculent mass, which appeared to be animal matter in a state
 of partial decomposition.       This was in all probability derived from the
 countless multitude of Salp<e, oceanic Hydrozoa, Pteropods, and other
 gelatinous animals, which literally covered the surface of the sea and filled
 our towing-net directly it was dipped overboard, and of which the remains
 must fall to the bottom after death.          Such organisms doubtless afford a
 vast store of nutriment to the inhabitants of the deep.
    35. Dredging in such deep water is not accomplished without difficulty.
 The dredge must     be unusually heavy, to overcome the resistance to its sink
 ing occasioned by the friction of the immense length of dredge-line paid out ;
and when it reaches the bottom, it sinks by its own weight into the mud,
like an anchor.        This would give only the same result as the cup-lead
or any sounding-machine, but on a larger scale ; and it would tell us very
little about the Fauna. Further, if by the drift-way of the vessel, or by a
few turns of the engine now and then, we arc enabled to scrape the surface
of the   sea-bed, the dredge gets choked up with       the flocculent mass above
described.     The fertile ingenuity of our experienced and excellent Com
mander devised a method which was a great improvement in deep-sea
dredging, and which enabled us to obtain at least a sample of the sub
stratum.     This consisted in attaching to the rope two iron weights, each
of 100 lbs., at a distance of 300 or 400 fathoms from the dredge (when
the depth exceeded 1200 fathoms), so as to dredge from the weights
instead of from the ship ; the angle thus made caused the blade of the
dredge to lie in its proper position.         This method, in fact, reduced the
working depth, by the distance of these weights from the vessel, to the
easy and manageable       limit of 300 or 400 fathoms. Another contrivance
was to fasten    the bag to the dredge in such a way that when it was hauled
in, it could be unlaced, emptied, and afterwards washed quite clean.         By
this mode we were assured that the specimens really came from the place
where each dredging was made.          We tried on this and other occasions a
contrivance devised by Mr. Easton, the eminent engineer, consisting of
gutta-percha valves closing inwards in a wedge-like form, which were fitted
to the mouth of the dredge.        The object was to retain the contents of the
dredge   while  it was  being hauled  in ; as we had found by frequent and dis
appointing experience that a large portion of the contents generally escape
through the mouth during this part of the dredging operation.              This
contrivance, though theoretically admirable, was found not to answer in
practice, because the mouth of the dredge was so closed by the valves that

1869.]           on the Scientific    Exploration of      the Deeji Sea.                421
it had no contents to      be retained.      The principle, however, seems so good,
 that we should hope it may be more successfully applied.
     36. The very deep dredgings in this trip yielded an abundance of novel
 and most interesting results in every division of Invertebrata.               Among the
 Mollusca were valves of an imperforate Brachiopod, with a septum in the
 lower valve, which we propose to name Atretia gnomon. Some shells
 were of a considerable size ; and the fry of Isocardia cor (Kelliella abyssi-
 cola, Sars) were not uncommon.                Among the Crustacea there were
 new species of Oumacea ; a beautiful Amphipod of a bright red colour,
 with feathery processes of a golden colour at the tail ; with a considerable
variety of Isopoda, Phyllopoda, and Ostracoda, among them several forms
apparently new. There was also a magnificent Annelid, of a purplish hue,
with purplish-brown spots on the line of segmentation. Two or three young
specimens were here obtained, at a depth of 1215 fathoms (Station 28), of a
most interesting Clypeastroid, of which a mature example was afterwards
dredged in the Third Cruise (§ 77).             These were at once recognized as be
longing to    an entirely new type      ;  but since our return we find that        a form,
generically if not specifically the same, had been obtained by Count
 Pourtales during his last dredgings in the Gulf of Mexico, and had
been described by Prof. Alex. Agassiz under the name Pourtalesia mi-
randa.      This type is of extraordinary interest from its being the living re
presentative of a very singular little group of the Ananchytidce (including the
genus Infulaster, D'Orb., to which it seems most closely allied), which
 are specially characteristic of the newer Chalk. In the 1443 fathoms' dredg
 ing (Station 20) a Holothurian was obtained 5 inches long and 2| inches in
circumference.       Several very fine Corals were obtained during the Rockall
trip ; among them magnificent examples of Lophohelia prolifera and
 Caryophyllia Smithii. The Foraminifera, as before, were remarkable for
their size, the same types being generally predominant.                   But specimens
were here obtained for the first time of a peculiarly interesting Orbitolite,
a type not hitherto discovered further north than the Mediterranean, and
there attaining a comparatively small size. Perfect specimens of this Orbi
tolite must     have    a diameter     of   a sixpence ; but    owing to its extreme
tenuity, and to the facility with which the rings separate from each other,
no large specimens were obtained unbroken, though it was evident that
their fracture had taken place in the process of collection. No greater
proof    can  be adduced of the extreme stillness of the bottom at great
depths,   than  is afforded by the extraordinary delicacy of these disks, which
are so fragile as to be with difficulty mounted for observation. Their plan
of growth corresponds with that of the " simple type" of this genus, all
the " chamberlets " being on the same plane ; but the form of the cham-
berlets corresponds with that of the chamberlets of the superficial layers
of the "complex type" *. It is a fact of peculiar significance that instead

                          " Researches   on the Foraminifera," Part I., in the Philosophical

of commencing with        a   "central"     and    '' circumambient " chamber, like
ordinary Orbitolites,     this type commences with a spire of several turns,
precisely like that of a young Cornuspira,             thus showing the fundamental
conformity of this cyclical type to the                spiral plan of growth. —The
animals, especially Mollusca, were by no means lively when brought on
board and examined ; perhaps this was owing to the great change of
temperature (sometimes as much as 20°) between that of the sea-bed and
that of the atmosphere.
   37. A very elaborate Series of Temperature-soundings was made in the
deepest parts of the sea traversed between theN.W.of Ireland and Rockall
Bank, so as to enable us to determine the rate of diminution of temperature
with increase of depth (see Table, p. 465).               Thus at Station 19, at which
the depth was 13G0 fathoms, the temperatures were taken at 250, 500, 750,
 1000, and 1360 fathoms, and showed a progressive though by no means
uniform descent to the minimum recorded, which was 37°-4 ; the most rapid
change was between 500 and 750 fathoms. A similar Series, taken at Station
20, where the depth was 1443 fathoms and the bottom-temperature 37°-0,
andathird taken at Station 21, where the depth was 1476 fathoms, and the
bottom-temperature 36°-9, showed a very close accordance with each other
and with the preceding.         In another Series taken at Station 22 in 1 263 fa
thoms,   a careful comparison was made between the temperatures recorded by
two "protected" thermometers and six ordinary thermometers ; and the
average error of these, which was very nearly 6° at the greatest depth, cor
responded very closely with that indicated by the previous experiments at
pressures answering to the several depths at which the observations were
made. — The curious observation was made at Station 23, very near the
Rockall Bank, that whilst the minimum indicated was 43°-4 at a depth of
630 fathoms, the maximum           index of both thermometers had risen to 74c-8,
or more than    1 7° above  the  surfaee-temperature. As in no other instance had
any temperature been indicated higher than that of the surface, it seemed
clear that a warm submarine spring must discharge itself in this locality.
Circumstances prevented us, however, from ascertaining any further par
ticulars in regard to it.
   38. While we lay-to within a quarter of a mile from Rockall on the even
ing of Saturday the 3rd of July, fishing-parties were formed, and continued
their sport until midnight.           The rock was inhabited by a multitude of
sea-fowl ; and a large gannet perched on the highest pinnacle, looking
like a sentinel or the president of the feathered republic.
   39.   At  a distance of from 130 to 140 miles from the nearest part of the
Irish coast we observed quantities of floating Seaweed (mostly Fucus ser-
ratvs), and the feathers of sea-fowl covered with Lepas fascicularis and
occasionally   L. sulcata   ;  and on the seaweed were also two kinds of sessile-

eyed Crustaceans.       The wind having    been previously easterly,       it is difficult
to say what share the wind or tide had         in the drift   ; but it could scarcely
have been caused by any circulation from the equator. The Fauna nowhere
showed the least trace of that wonderful and apparently restricted current
known as the Gulf-stream.            The beautiful     Pteropod Clio pyramidata
flitted about in considerable numbers     ;  a  delicate Cuttlefish (Leac/iia ellip-
toptera), which is supposed to prey on Salpa, was caught in the scoop-
sieve, as well as several specimens of a small and very slender Syngnathus
or pipefish.    On our homeward passage we experienced severe weather, in
which our vessel sustained some injury from the heavy cross seas which
struck her.     After putting into Killibegs we dredged in Lough Swilly,
Lough Foyle, and the North Channel on the way to Belfast, where we
arrived on the 13th of July.
                       Second Cruise.       (Chart, Plate 5.)
    40. As already stated, it was the original intention to devote the Second
Cruise to the exploration of an area to the west of the outer Hebrides,
between Rockall and the south-western limit of last year's work in the
' Lightning.'     During the First      Cruise,     however, dredging had been
carried down successfully to a depth of nearly 1500 fathoms; and the
result so far realized our anticipations, and confirmed the experience of last
year.    The conditions (to that great depth at all events) were consistent
with the life of all the types of Marine lnvertebrata ; though undoubtedly
in very deep water the number of species procured of the higher groups
was greatly reduced, and in many cases the individuals appeared to be
dwarfed.     From these observations (which thoroughly corroborated those
of Dr. Wallich and others, about which there had been some difference of
opinion on account of the imperfection of the appliances at the command
of the observers), we concluded that probably in no part of the ocean were
the conditions so altered by Depth as to preclude the existence of Animal
Life, — that Life had no Bathymetrical limit. Still we could not consider the
question thoroughly settled ; and when, upon consultation with Captain
Calver, we found him perfectly ready to attempt any depth, and from his
previous experience sanguine of success, we determined to apply to the
Hydrographer to sanction an attempt to dredge in the deepest soundings
within our reach, viz. 2500 fathoms indicated on the chart 250 miles west
of Ushant. The deepest reliable soundings do not go much beyond 3000
fathoms ; and we felt that if we could establish the existence of Life, and if
we could determine the conditions with accuracy down to 2500 fathoms,
the general question would be virtually solved for all depths of the ocean,
and any further investigation of its deeper abysses would be mere matter
of curiosity and of detail. The Hydrographer cordially acquiesced in this
                                                           '             '

 the examination and analysis of the sea-water.
    4 1 . The weather was very settled. On the Sunday, as we steamed down the
 Irish Channel, there was nearly a dead calm, a slight mist hanging oTerthe
water, and giving some very beautiful effects of coast scenery.                On the
evening of Sunday the 18th we anchored for the night off Ballycottin, i
pretty little port about fifteen miles from Queenstown, and dropped round
to Queenstown on Monday morning, where we anchored off Haulbowline
 Island at 7 a.m.        At Queenstown Mr. P. Herbert Carpenter joined Mr.
 Hunter in the laboratory, to practise under his direction the gas-analysis,
which it had been arranged that he should undertake during the Third
Cruise.       Monday the 18th was employed in coaling and procuring in Cork
some      things which were required for the chemical department ;              and  at
 7 p.m. we cast off from the wharf at Haulbowline and proceeded                on our
voyage.
    42. During Monday night we steamed in a south-westerly direction across
the mouth of the Channel.           On Tuesday we dredged in 74 and 75 fathoms
on the plateau which extends between Cape Clear and Ushant, on a bottom
of mud and gravel with            dead   shells and a few living examples of the
generally diffused species of moderate depths.            The weather was remark
ably   fine,  the barometer    30-25   in., and  the  temperature of the air 72°-5.
    43. On Wednesday, July 21st, we continued our south-westerly course,
the chart indicating during the earlier part of the day that we were still in
the shallow water of the plateau of the Channel.           At 4.30 a.m. we dredged
gravel    and  dead  shells in  95  fathoms,   but  towards mid-day the lead gave a
much greater depth ; and in the afternoon, rapidly passing over the edge of
the plateau, we dredged in 725 fathoms with a bottom of muddy sand
(Station 36).       This is about the bathymetrical horizon at which we find
the Vitreous Sponges in the northern area ; and although the bottom is here
very different, much more sandy with but a slight admixture of Globigerina
ooze,    we dredged a tolerably       perfect, though dead, specimen of Aphro-
calliste* Bocagei, a vitreous sponge lately described by Dr. E. Perceval
Wright from a specimen procured by Professor Barboza du Bocage from
the Cape- Verde       Islands, and one or two small specimens of Hoi tenia
 Carpenteri.      The muddy sand contained a considerable proportion of gravel
and dead shells.
    44 . On Thursday, July 22nd, the weather was still remarkably fine. The
sea was moderate,      with  a  slight swell from the north-west.       We sounded
in lat. 47° 38- N., long. 1 2° 08- W., in a depth of 2435 fathoms (Station 37).
The Sounding-line used on this occasion was medium No. 2, of the best
Italian hemp, the No. of threads 18, the weight per 100 fathoms 12 lbs.
8 oz., the circumference 0-8 inch, and the breaking-strain, dry, 1402 lbs.,
soaked a day, 1211 lbs. ; and the 'Hydra- sounding-instrument was weighted
with 33G lbs.       The weight attached      to the sounding-apparatus is  of course
allowed to descend        quite freely without       any check, but its velocity is

gradually     and uniformly        reduced during       its descent      by the increasing
friction of the lengthening line. The uniformity of this retardation gives
an infallible test of the success of the sounding, and a certain indication of
the moment when the weight reaches the bottom.                      The latter was, how
ever, valuable only for corroboration, as even at these enormous depths
the shock of the arrest of the weight on the bottom, nearly three miles
down, was distinctly perceptible to the skilled hand of our Commander.
As the scientific value of our results          depends upon the certainty of the de
termination     of  the  depths,   we  subjoin a Table of the absolute rate of the de
scent of the weight in this sounding, — probably the deepest hitherto made
which is thoroughly reliable, having been taken with the most perfect

     The whole time occupied in descent was 33 minutes 35 seconds ; and in
 heaving up 2 hours 2 minutes.                 The cylinder of the sounding-apparatus
 came up filled with fine grey Atlantic ooze, containing a considerable pro
 portion of fresh shells of Globigerina. The two Miller-Casella thermometers,
  Nos. 100 and 103, attached as usual to the line above the sounding-instru
  ment, registered a minimum temperature of 36°-5 F. (2°-5 C.).
     45. A Dredge was sent down at 5.45 p.m. ; and as this was the deepest
  haul, the one which tested our resources most fully, and which seemed to
  us to prove that dredging could, with sufficient care and skill, be suc
  cessfully carried out in any known depth in the ocean, we give here the
  details of the operation and the appliances used. — The dredge was of
  wrought iron, made on exactly the same plan as the
                                                                    " Naturalists- " dredge
  introduced by Ball and Forbes.              The two scrapers were pitched at a very
  low angle. The arms were moveable, and about half of each arm next
  the eye to which the rope was attached was of strong chain : we are by no
  means sure, however, that this was             an advantage.       On one side the chain
  was attached to the arm           of the dredge by a       stop of five turns of spun
   yarn,  so that in case        of the dredge becoming entangled, or             wedged by
   rocks or stones, a strain less than sufficient to break the dredge-rope would
  break the stop, alter the position of the dredge, and probably enable it

meter ; the inner of " bread-bag," a coarse open canvas.     By an ingenious
device of Captain Calver, the inner bag was divided into a set of com
partments by pieces of plank fitted vertically into it from the mouth nearly
to the bottom.    This arrangement was intended to prevent the washing out
of the contents of the dredge during its long upward journey.
   46. The length of the dredge-rope was 3000 fathoms, nearly 3i statute
miles ; of this 2000 fathoms were " hawser-laid

breaking strain of 1\ tons. The 1000 fathoms next the dredge were
" hawser-laid " 2 inches. There was an admirable arrangement for
                                                                     stowing
the rope — an arrangement which made its manipulation singularly easy,
notwithstanding its great bulk and weight (about 5500 lbs.).             A long
row of large iron pins, about 2 feet in length, projected, rising obliquely from
the top of the bulwark, along one side of the quarter-deck. Each of these
held a coil of from 200 to 300 fathoms, and the rope was coiled continu
ously along the whole row.      While the dredge was going down, the
rope was rapidly taken by the men from these pins       Aunt Sallies

and in hauling up,  relay of men carried the rope along from the surging-

which was not directly attached to the end of the derrick, but passed
through an eye, and was fixed to      " bitt " on the deck. On bight of

this rope, between the " bitt" and the block, was lashed the " accumulator"

any undue strain came upon the dredge-rope, the strain acted first upon
the "accumulator;"    and   graduated scale on the derrick, against which

                    played, gave, in cwts., an approximation, at all events,
to the strain upon the rope.   In letting go, the rope passed to the block
of the derrick directly from the " Aunt Sallies    ;"in hauling up  passedit
from the block to the surging-drum of the admirable double-cylinder
donkey-engine already mentioned, from which        was taken by the men

dredge-rope, one of  cwt., and the others of 56 lbs. each, at 500 fathoms

from the dredge.
   47. The 3000 fathoms of rope were out at 5.55 p.m., the vessel drifting
slowly before a moderate breeze (force=4) from the N.W.      The accom
panying woodeut gives an idea of the various relative positions of the
dredge and the vessel, according to the plan of dredging followed by Capt.
Calver, which answered admirably.

    A  represents the position of the vessel when the dredge is let go, and
 the   dotted line A B the line of descent of the dredge, rendered oblique
by the tension of the rope. While the dredge is going down, the vessel
 drifts gradually to leeward ; and when the whole (say) 3000 fathoms of rope
are out, C, W, and D might represent the relative positions of the vessel,
 the weight attached 500 fathoms from the dredge, and the dredge itself.
                                     Fig. 4.
The    vessel now steams slowly to windward, occupying    successively the po
sitions E, F, G, and H. The weight, to which the water offers but little
resistance, sinks from W to W, and the dredge and bag move slowly from
D to B. The vessel is now allowed to drift back before the wind, from
H    towards C.    The tension of the motion of the  vessel, instead of acting
immediately     upon the dredge, now drags forward the weight     W,   so that
the dredging is carried on from the weight, and not directly from the
vessel.     The dredge is thus quietly pulled along, with its lip scraping the
bottom in the attitude which it assumes from the position of the centre of
weight of its iron frame and arms. If, on the other hand, the weights
were hung close to the dredge, and the dredge were dragged directly from

 the vessel,   owing  to the enormous weight and spring of the rope, the
 arms would be constantly lifted up, and the lip of the dredge prevented.
 from scraping. — For very deep dredging, this operation of steaming up to
 windward till the dredge-rope was nearly perpendicular, after drifting for
 half an hour or so to leeward, was usually repeated three or four times.
    48. At 8.50 p.m. we began to haul in, and the "Aunt Sallies" to fill
 again. The engine delivered the rope steadily at a uniform rate of rather
 more than a foot per second. — It is worthy of record that, except on one
 or two occasions, when an enormous load, at one time nearly a ton, came
 up in the dredge-bag, the donkey-engine maintained the same rate of heaving
 during the whole summer-s work.     A few minutes before 1 a.m. the weights
appeared ; and at one in the morning, 7j hours after it was cast over, the
 dredge was safely hauled on deck, having in the interval accomplished a
journey of upwards of eight statute miles.      The dredge-bag contained
cwt. of the very characteristic pale grey Atlantic ooze.    The total weight
 brought up by the engine was —

tarpauling, and the watchers threw themselves down to rest till daylight.
The contents of the dredge had the ordinary character of Atlantic chalk-
mud.     Since our return it has been analyzed by Mr. Hunter, who finds
it to contain (besides an appreciable quantity of Organic matter, the exact
proportion of which has not yet been accurately ascertained) —

  There was an appreciable quantity of diffused amorphous organic matter,

  "mycelium," or germs, with the various shelled and shelless Protozoa.

                                                         — We got from this haul
n new species of Pleurotoma and one of Dentalium, Scrobicularia nitida,
Dacrydium vitreum, Ophiocantha spinulosa, and Ophiocten Kroyeri,                  with
a few Crustaceans and many Foraminifera.
    52.   In both of  these last deep dredgings the dredge      brought up     a large
number of extremely beautiful Polycystina, and some forma apparently
intermediate between Polycystina and Sponges, which will be described
shortly.      These organisms did not seem to be brought from the bottom,
but appeared to be sifted into the dredge on its way up.               They were as
 numerous adhering to the outside of the dredging-bag, as within it. During
 the soundings taken near this locality quite a shower of several beautiful
 species of the Polycystina &nAAeanthometrinaie\\ upon the chart- room sky
 light from the whole length of the sounding-line while it was being hauled in.
    53. Dredging in such deep water was very trying. Each operation occu
 pied seven or eight hours ; and during the whole of that time it demanded
 and received the most anxious attention on the part of the Commander, who
 stood with his hand on the pulse of the Accumulator, ready at any moment,
 by a turn of the paddles, to ease any undue strain.          The men, stimulated
 and encouraged by      the cordial  interest  taken by their officers  in our opera
 tions, worked willingly and well ; but the labour of taking upwards of three
 miles of rope, coming up with a heavy strain from the surging-drum of the
 engine, and coiling it upon the
                                      " Aunt Sallies," was very severe. The rope
 itself looked frayed and strained, as if it could not be trusted to stand this
 extraordinary ordeal much longer.            The question of the distribution of
 Life and the condition of the bottom had been solved ; and the animals
 brought up, though of surprising interest, were few in number.                     On
 the morning of Saturday the 24th we therefore determined to cease
 dredging for the present, and to devote the day to an investigation which
 we regarded as at least equal in importance, — the determination of a
 series  of Temperatures at intervals of 250 fathoms from the bottom to the
 surface. The following is a Table of the mean results of this series of
 observations (Station 38).         The instruments used were the two Miller-
  Casella thermometers which were employed in all the temperature-sound
 ings throughout the summer.           The depth was 2090 fathoms.

     54 .  The general result of this series of Soundings is of the highest inte
 rest ;   and although it may be premature to attempt an explanation of the
 details of the phenomena until all the temperature-observations which have
 been made      in the North Atlantic have been reduced to the Miller-Casella
 standard and carefully correlated, still certain general conclusions seem
 self-evident. —The high surface-temperature, reduced by 13£ degrees at
 250 fathoms, is undoubtedly          due to superheating by the direct heat        of the
sun.      This is shown more clearly by the Table (§ 58), where nearly                  7°
are    seen   to be     lost between the surface and 30 fathoms, and 4° more
 between     30 fathoms and         100 fathoms. — From 100 to 500 fathoms the
temperature is still high and tolerably uniform, and it falls rapidly between
500 and 1000 fathoms ; a reference to the second Table shows that the
rapid fall is between 650 and 850 fathoms, during which interval there
 is a loss   of nearly     6°.   The  second    stage  of  elevated   temperature, from
250 to 650 fathoms, seems to be caused by the north-easterly reflux of
the great equatorial current.          From 1000 fathoms the loss of heat goes on
uniformly      at the rate     of 0o,5 for every 250 fathoms. The most singular
 feature in this decrease of temperature for the last mile and three quarters
is its absolute uniformity, which appears to be inconsistent with the idea
 of a current, unless it were one of excessive slowness.             It appears that the
 presence of this vast underlying body of comparatively cold water can
 only be accounted for on the supposition of a general interchange of warm
 and cold water, according to the doctrine laid down by Dr. Carpenter in
 the ' Lightning
                      '
                          Report, which will be more fully expounded hereafter
 (§115).
     55. We were now steaming slowly back towards the coast of Ireland ; and
on Monday, July 26, we dredged in depths varying from 557 to 584 fathoms
(Stations 39-41) in ooze, with a mixture of sand and dead shells. In these
dredgings we got one or two very interesting Alcyonarian zoophytes, and
several Ophiuridans, including Ophiothrix fragilis, Amphiura Ballii, and
Ophiacantha spinulosa.           Many of the animals    were most    brilliantly phospho
rescent    ; and we were afterwards even more struck by this phenomenon in
our Northern Cruise.            In some  places nearly everything brought up seemed
to emit light, and the mud itself       was perfectly    full of luminous specks. The
Alcyonarians, the Brittle-stars, and          some   Annelids were the most brilliant.
The Pennatulce, the Virgularias, and the              Gorgoni<B    shone with   a lambent
white light, so bright that it showed quite distinctly the hour on a watch.
The light from Pavonaria quadrangularis was pale lilac, like the flame of
cyanogen ; while that from Ophiacantha spinulosa was of a brilliant green,
corruscating from the centre of the disk, now along one arm, now along
another, and sometimes vividly illuminating the whole outline of the star
  fish.
     56. The question of the amount and the kind of Light in these abysses
was constantly before us. That there is light, there can be no doubt. The
 eye3 in many species of all classes were well developed ; in some, very
                                                                           2 l2

432               Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson             [Nov. 18,
remarkably so.          A Munida, probably a variety of Munida Banffii,
 somewhat paler in colour than usual, and somewhat slighter in its propor
tions, which we met with abundantly in our northern dredgings, had re
markably large eyes, very brilliant, transparent, and bronzy, giving the im
 pression of extreme sensitiveness.      It is scarcely possible that any appre
 ciable quantity of the Sun-s light can penetrate beyond two hundred fathoms
 at most.     The data with regard to the transmission of light through sea-
 water are very scanty ; but the rapidity with which light diminishes during
 the first few fathoms seems to point to its speedy extinction. It seemed to us
 probable that the abyssal regions might depend for their light solely upon
 the Phosphorescence of their inhabitants.        The only use which the lower
 animals make of light is to enable them to procure their food ; and it is
evident that in the night, or under any circumstances in which there is no
source   of  general illumination, it would answer the same purpose of guiding
them to their prey, if that prey itself were luminous.         Among the Star
fishes the young specimens, 10 to 15 millims. from point to point of the
rays, appeared to be much more luminous than mature examples of the same
species.     This is probably part of the great general plan which provides an
enormous excess of the young of many species apparently as a supply of
food  ; their wholesale destruction being necessary for the due restriction of
the multiplication of the species, while the breeding individuals, on the
other hand, are provided with special appliances for escape or defence.        It
is well known that fishes feed principally at night ; and the path of a shoal
of herrings may often be traced for miles by the broad band of phospho
rescence caused by the glowing and scintillating of the myriads of phos
phorescent animals, especially larvae, with which the sea is crowded, and
which supply their food. We can scarcely doubt that the phosphorescence
of the inhabitants of the dark abysses of the sea performs, in regard to the
great object of the supply of food, the functions performed in the upper
world by the light of day.
    57. On the 27th we dredged in 862 fathoms (Station 42), the weather
being still very fine, and the sea quite smooth.      The bottom was ooze with
sand and dead shells.       Among the Mollusca procured were a new species of
Pleuronectia, Leda abyssicola (Arctic), Ledu Messinensis (a Sicilian Ter
tiary fossil), Dentalium gigas (sp. n.), Siphonodentalium (sp. n.), Cerithium
metula, Amaura (sp. n.), Columbella Haliceeti, Cylichna pyramidala (Nor
wegian and Mediterranean), and many dead shells of Cavolina trispinosa.
These latter were very common in all the northern dredgings, though
we never saw a      living specimen on the surface.
    58. During    the afternoon we took a series  of intermediate temperatures,
at intervals of 50 fathoms, from the bottom at 862 fathoms to the surface.

   A Water-Bottle was sent down with the sounding-lead on each occasion ;
and the specific gravity of the water was carefully taken, the air contained
in it analyzed, and the amount of organic matter estimated by Mr. Hunter.
Mr. Hunter-s results, which         are  given below, corroborate generally the
observations made on the previous cruise by Mr. William L. Carpenter. The
Specific Gravity of the water is somewhat higher at the surface than at a
depth of 50 fathoms ; this is probably due to evaporation, the observation
having been made after a course of hot weather.              From 50 fathoms down
wards it increases slightly but steadily till within 50 fathoms of the bottom,
when it again falls a little.      The proportion of Carbonic acid in the con
tained gases increases slowly and steadily till within 50 fathoms of the
bottom, when it increases suddenly to the extent of upwards of            15 per cent.,
mainly at the expense of the Nitrogen, which falls upwards of            14 percent.,
the Oxygen remaining nearly stationary.             The amount of Organic matter
seems to be very uniform, varying, apparently irregularly, within narrow
limits.

    61. As it was requisite that the boilers of the Porcupine- should be
thoroughly cleansed after her return from the Second Cruise, we did not leave
Belfast (to which port she had gone round from Cork) until Wednesday,
August 1 1th; when we made direct for Stornoway as our final point of depar
ture, arriving there on Friday the 13th.             Having taken in as much coal as
could be safely stowed on deck, as well as below, we left Stornoway on the
afternoon of Sunday the 1 5th, and proceeded in the direction of the spot on
which we had made our most successful dredging of last year ('Lightning-
Report,     § 16), and which          we had come       to call the IIoltenia-grounCL*.
Our dredging on this ground (Station 47) again proved remarkably success
ful, bringing up numerous specimens of Holtenia, of Hyalonema (one of
them constituting a new species), of Adrasta infundibulum (a type allied
to Hyalonema),           and of Tisiphonia (a remarkable genus of Siliceous
Sponges, obtained, like Holtenia, for the first time last year, of which a
 description,     by Prof. Wyville       Thomson,      will   soon   be presented to the
Royal Society),       besides    many other specimens of great interest, some of
which     appear to       be  new   types. The experience of the 650 fathoms-
dredge last year having led us to put aside and preserve the eiftinga, instead
of attempting to pick them over at the time, we have since found them to
yield an extraordinarily           rich harvest of Foraminifera, including not
merely    the   types  mentioned     in the 'Lightning- Report (§ 16), but a great
number of others, especially of the Arenaceous Order, in which the shelly
covering is replaced by a
                                    " test" composed of sand-grains more or less
firmly cemented together.            Although the Holtenia-ground lies within the
Warm area, the Sea-bed of which is ordinarily covered by Globigerina-
 mud    ('Lightning- Report, p. 190), yet this mud                  here contains a consi
derable admixture          of  sand,   obviously   derived from the Cold area with
which     it is   here in immediate proximity.           For this    sand, when separated
from the Globigerina-m\xA, corresponds precisely in its character with that
of the Cold area, being especially distinguished by the admixture of
particles of Augite and other minerals having an undoubtedly Volcanic
source.       This admixture is very perceptible to the experienced eye
in the   "  tests" of Astrorhiza and other Arenaceous Foraminifera abundant

    02.  It   is not a little curious that one     of the   new   types* discovered last
 year in the 650 fathoms- dredging ('Lightning- Report, § 19), which was
 made in a part of the Warm area far removed from the borders of
 the Cold, was now found to occur here also, but with a remarkable
 difference in the structure of its
                                            " test."     Its shape is fusiform, gene
 rally somewhat curved, not unlike a § ; and it has only one undivided
 cavity, with a tubiform aperture at each end.                   Now in the true Cre
 taceous area, where sand-grains are           scarce,    but   sponge-spicules abound,
 this   Rhizopod constructs its        "test" almost entirely of sponge-spicules,
laid with most extraordinary            regularity, a sand-grain being interposed
 here   and there to fill up a vacuity left by the oblique crossing of the
 spicules.      But in the //o/f>m-a-ground, where sand is abundant, " tests"
of precisely the same general form and proportions are built up almost
entirely of sand-grains cemented together ; sponge-spicules, however, being
invariably used to form the tubiform mouths, and the mouth thus formed
being sometimes prolonged like a proboscis. — It is difficult to conceive
how creatures which seem nothing more than particles of animated jelly,
without " organs" of any kind, can exert so remarkable a power of selec
tion and construction as is shown in the "tests" of some of these Arena
ceous Foraminifera.          There are none which are more symmetrically con
structed than the triradiate Bhabdammina ; each of its three very slender
arms, which diverge at equal angles, being a cylindrical tube, built up of
sand-grains of very uniform size, united by a firm cement which contains
a considerable proportion of Phosphate of Iron.                    This tube is beauti
fully smoothed off internally         ; and it is no rougher externally, in propor
tion to its size, than         any   wall  would be that is built of rough-hewn
stones arranged by the hands of a most dexterous mason.                           The only
structure with      which   we   are acquainted that is at all comparable to it in
workmanship is the sandy tube of the Peclinaria, one of the Tubicolar
slnnelids, a creature comparatively high in the scale of organization.
    63. It was here that we employed for the first time an addition to our
Dredging apparatus devised by Capt. Calvcr, who, having noticed that
animals frequently came up attached to the part of the dredge-rope that had
lain on the ground, or to the net of the dredge itself, justly reasoned that
if the Sea-bottom were swept with hempen brushes, they would probably
bring up many creatures that might escape the scrajring of the dredge.
These brushes were made of bundles of rope-yarn teazed out into their sepa
rate threads, and tied together at the top, so as closely to resemble the

 Capt. Calver, who rightly judged that if they were attached to the bottom
 of the dredge itself, they would only bring up what the dredge had passed
 over and crushed.        Though the use of these " tangles" added much to
 our  "hauls" on the /fo/lenta-ground, especially on           a subsequent  occasion
  (§ 86), yet it was on the hard       bottom of the Cold area that their value

    64. Our course was now directed slowly N.N.W., towards the southern
 edge   of the    Faroe     Bank, Soundings being frequently taken, that we
 might determine      the    boundary in this region between the Warm and
 the Cold areas.        The minimum temperature on the iJb/toiia-ground,
 as shown by the     "protected" Thermometers,          was  a  little under 44°, the
 depth being 540 fathoms ; and this accorded very closely with the tem
 perature of 470,3 observed in the same spot last year, when the requisite
 correction was applied for pressure.         A Sounding taken on the afternoon
 of the next day, at Station 49 (Lat. 59° 43', Long. 7° 40'), showed a
 somewhat less depth, viz. 475 fathoms, and a slightly higher minimum
 temperature, 45°-4.        In the evening of the same day another Sounding
 was taken (Station 50), and it was found that the depth had diminished
 to 355 fathoms, whilst the minimum temperature had risen to 46Q,2. A
 Sounding taken early the next morning, however, at Station 51 (Lat. G0° 6',
 Long. 8° 14-), showed a minimum of 40°, with a depth of 4 10 fathoms ;
and this depression of temperature led us to surmise that we were here
 passing from the Warm into the Cold area.                 The correctness of this
surmise was soon proved ; for a Sounding taken at about 20 miles to the
north, at Station 52 (Lat. 60° 25', Long. 8° 10'), gave a minimum tem
 perature of 30°-6, though the depth had diminished to 384 fathoms !
    65. In order to ascertain more particularly the conditions of this very
remarkable depression, we requested Capt. Calver to ascertain the tempera
 ture at depths progressively increasing by 50 fathoms ; and it was thus
shown (1) that the minimum temperature is that of the bottom, as had
been argued in the      'Lightning- Report (p. 189) to be probably the case ;
(2)  that  this  minimum      is nearly reached at a depth of 300 fathoms; (3)
that the decrease of temperature is by no means uniform, but that whilst
it takes place in the first 200 fathoms at nearly the same rate as in the most
northerly stations previously tested in the First Cruise, there is a rapid
and extraordinary diminution, amounting to more than 15°, between 200
and 300 fathoms. (See Table I. p. 456.)            This diminution can scarcely be
accounted for on any other hypothesis than that of a stream of frigid water
passing under the warmer and more superficial stratum. — It is worthy of
note that   in this spot   we found evidence,   in the rounded form of the stones

and gravel brought up by the dredge, of a more decided movement of water
than is presented in the Cold area generally, the bottom of which generally
consists of fine sand, sometimes with an admixture of clay, including
stones but little rolled.        And                                    us to
                                        as our subsequent Soundings have led
believe that we were here on the western border of the Cold area, and
that its stream of frigid water is reduced at the same time in breadth and
depth, before discharging itself into the deep Oceanic basin (§ 104), a more
rapid movement is precisely what might be expected.
   66. Altering our course now to the E.S.E., we took another Sounding on
the evening of the same day (Station 53), after a run of about 25 miles,
and found the depth increased to 490 fathoms, and the minimum (which
we shall now call the bottom) temperature reduced to 30°.   This course
having been continued during the night, we found ourselves (Station 54),
early on the morning of August 19th, in Lat. 59° 56' and Long. 6° 27-,
where the depth was 363 fathoms, and the bottom-temperature 31°-4.  It
was thus obvious that we were still in the Cold area, although we had
come  back almost exactly to the latitude of Station 50, and were more
than twelve miles to the south of the lowest parallel to which we had
traced it last year.   (We subsequently traced    at Station 86, about nine
                                                       it,
miles still further south.) The coincidence of Depths as well as of Latitudes
between Stations 50 and 54, with deeper water both north and south of
them, shows that the bed of the channel here rises into ridge, which has
                                                                      a
probably something to do with the direction of the course of the flow
along its bottom. — We then again turned northwards, and in the after
noon of the same day found that our depth (Station 55) had increased to
605 fathoms, whilst the bottom-temperature was somewhat below 30°.
Our Soundings          frequently repeated in this part of the Area, with
                     were
great uniformity in their results, both as to Depth and Temperature    and              ;
our Dredging operations were carried on with little intermission.   As the
wind and swell were   very moderate (although we were here almost con
stantly in   cold
              a   damp mist, which sometimes gave place to        mizzling          a

mined by observation in the two Expeditions is shown by the precision
with which Captain Calver twice placed us on the Holtenia-ground

from that in which we came upon it last year.
    68. Pursuing our exploration about thirty miles further eastwards in the
same parallel, we sounded on the afternoon of the 20th in 580 fathoms
(Station 59, Lat. 60° 21', Long. 5° 41'), and found the bottom-temperature
29°- 7, which was nearly the lowest anywhere met with.                 From this point,
which was on the line of Sounding-s between the Orkney and Faroe Islands
                              '
previously taken in the Bull-dog,- we again turned our course northwards
for Thorshavn, as it was our intention to make this our point of departure
for the exploration of that north-eastern portion of the channel which lies
between the Faroe and the Shetland Islands.                  The weather having now
cleared,    we had on the morning       of Saturday the 21st      a  most beautiful run
 along the series of remarkably formed islands which we had last year only
 seen dimly through their covering        of mist ; and on anchoring at Thorshavn
 in the afternoon, we received       a cordial greeting from our excellent friend
 Governor Holten, who, having been forewarned of our probable visit, and
 having had our vessel in view for some hours, at once came off in his barge
 to welcome us.
     69. The apparently settled state of the weather encouraged us to hope that
 we might be able to avail ourselves         of this opportunity of visiting Myling
 Head, the remarkable precipice which forms the North-western point of
 Stromoe, the principal island of the Faroe group, and which falls 2100*
 feet perpendicularly, its summit even slightly overhanging its base, so that a
 stone let   fall from it drops into the sea beneath. On inquiring from the
 Governor as to the best means of carrying our wish into effect, he informed
 us that the tide runs so strongly round the islands, that        if we started with the
 morning flood, and our vessel kept its speed in accordance             with the rate of
 the tidal wave, we should be able to make the whole circuit in six hours; but
 that if we should attempt the expedition in any other mode, we should be te
 diously delayed by the strength of the opposing tide. As we learned that high
 water would occur on the following Monday morning at 4 o-clockf. we made

our arrangements for an early start ; and invited our kind host and hostess to
give us the pleasure of their company. The fine weather lasted throughout
Sunday, two consecutive days of such brightness being a most unusual
occurrence in this locality ; but early the next morning the Faroese cli
mate vindicated its character by a copious downpour of rain, which put our
start at   4   o-clock out of the question, and, for the reason just mentioned,
obliged us to give up the excursion altogether.
   70.   Our good fortune in regard to weather returned to us on the following;
day ;   when     we left Thorshavn (Aug. 2 -1th) about noon, shaping our course
about East by South, so as to cross the channel separating the Faroe from
the Shetland Islands, the depth of which had been indicated by previous
Soundings to be in some parts considerable.                     Our first two Soundings
showed that we were still over a plateau at little more than 100 fathoms
from the surface ; but a third Sounding taken in the evening after a ruu
of about 80 miles, gave us a depth of 317 fathoms, and a bottom-tem
perature of 30°-l.          It became evident, therefore, that we were here again
in the course of the frigid stream ; and we looked with much interest to
the phenomena it would present in a still deeper part of the channel.
Having kept        the same course under easy steam during the night, we took a
Sounding the next morning at Station 64 (Lat. 61° 21', Long. 3° 44'); and
found that the depth had increased to 640 fathoms, and that the bottom-
temperature was somewhat below 30°. The dredge having been put down,
the '' haul
               "  was a less satisfactory one than usual, though one very valuable
specimen     (a large example of the Pourtalesia already mentioned, § 36) was
obtained here ; and in a subsequent             trial the dredge came up empty. As
this result appeared due to the circumstance that the drift of the ship was too
great, in consequence of an increase of wind and swell, to permit the dredge
to hold the ground, it was determined to devote the morning to a series of
Temperature-soundings taken at every 50 fathoms from the surface down
wards. This was very satisfactorily accomplished, with the result shown
in Table I. (p. 456), from which it appeared that, with a lower surface-
temperature than in the series previously taken (§ 65), the rate of decrease
during the first 150 fathoms was nearly the same, but that the rapid descent
of the thermometer which showed itself at Station 52 between 200 and
300 fathoms, here began somewhat earlier, and proceeded somewhat more
gradually, with the result, however, of bringing down the temperature to
32° at a little below 300 fathoms, the whole of the water beneath that
the latter was regulated,    we found  that   as there  is nut even a Sun-dial in the Islands,
the time is kept by the turn    of the tides, the periods   of w hich are precisely known for
each day of the lunation. As nearly all the intercouse     between different villages and farm
houses is carried    on by water, and as every Faroese is a boatman and fisherman as well
as a farmer,  it is not to be wondered at that he should be practically versed in the perio
dical changes of the currents by which his power of locomotion is so greatly influenced,
and that these should take the place of the meridian passage of the sun (which he has
no means of observing with precision) as his best time-regulators.

depth, down to the bottom of 640 fathoms, on which the temperature is
30°, being of icy coldness. — Thus the entire mass of water in this channel
is nearly equally divided into an upper and lower stratum, — the lower being
an Arctic stream (so to speak) of nearly 2000 feet deep, flowing in a S.W.
direction, beneath an upper stratum of comparatively warm water moving
slowly towards the N.E. ; the lower half of the latter, however, having its
temperature considerably modified by intermixture with the stratum over
which it lies.
   7 1 . Keeping still on the same course through the following night, we took
a Sounding early the next morning (Station 65), which showed that we had
crossed the deepest part    of the channel, the depth having here diminished
to 345 fathoms     ; the bottom-temperature, however, was still most charac
teristic of the Cold area, being almost exactly 30°, the lowest we had
met with at that comparatively moderate depth.          This circumstance, taken
in connexion with the earlier descent just noticed, corresponded well with
the fact that the line between Lat. 61° and Lat. 62° on which we had
now crossed this channel, is nearer the source of the frigid stream than the
lines between lat. 60° and 60|° in which we had at first traversed it.
   72. On the afternoon of the same day (Aug. 26), we again took a Sound
ing, which gave us the still further diminished depth of 267 fathoms ; and
here (Station 66), with a w/r/ace-tcmperature of 52|°, which was but slightly
above that    of the previous Sounding,     we found the io^om-temperature     to
be 450-7.      Now this was very nearly    12° above   the temperature taken at
the same depth at Station 64 ; whilst      it was nearly 16° above the tempera
ture last taken on a bottom only 78 fathoms deeper, at a Station distant
only 18 miles.       Even this slight difference of depth, however, seems fully
adequate to explain the remarkable contrast between the bottom-tempera
tures   of  these  two Stations  ; for, as already shown, the Arctic stream, in
virtue of its greater Specific Gravity, occupies only that portion of the
channel of which the bottom lies below about 320 fathoms- depth, so that
no part of it will flow over that portion of the bank of the channel which
has a depth of only 267 fathoms.           The bottom on this bank, therefore,
will be overlaid by the upper (warm) stratum alone ; and as the lower half
of this is not here subjected to the reduction of temperature which it sustains
when underlaid by the frigid stream, the bottom will have the temperature
characteristic of the Warm area, though not geographically included
in it.
   73.   By the next morning    we had come upon the shallow plateau on which
the Shetland islands are based ; and as we wished to examine some points
in the Geographical distribution of the Fauna inhabiting this locality, we
ran past the northern point of the group, and devoted the day to dredging
at about thirty miles to the east, on what is known as the Haaf, or deep-sea
fishing-ground.      Our dredging on this plateau was not very productive
as regards variety    ; but it brought up certain types in such extraordinary
number as to show how abundantly they must be diffused over the Sea-bed.

442               Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson                 [Nov. 18,
The most remarkable instance of this occurred in regard to the Echinvt
Norvegicus, a small sea-egg about the size of the top of the finger.              The
"hempen tangles" came up so laden with these, that a very moderate
estimate would place the number obtained in one         "haul"      at 20,000, whilst
some   of  our party deemed     it to be nearer 50,000.    This had formerly been
accounted a rare species,     of which it was considered a piece of good fortune
to find one or two at a time,            and was  first  met with in        abundance
in Mr. Jeffreys's Shetland Dredgings. — On the following day (Aug. 28th) we
anchored in Lerwick harbour, where it was requisite for us to replenish our
coal, as well as to obtain a further supply of jars and spirit, the abundance
of our collections having nearly exhausted what we had supposed to be out
ample provision of both.
    74. Without entering into details which will be more appropriately given
hereafter, we may say that our exploration of this Cold area, which we
had been led by the results of our last year's dredging to regard as com
paratively poor in Animal life (as, indeed, we should still have believed it
to be, had our knowledge of its Fauna been restricted to the contents of
the Dredge, instead of being chiefly obtained by the instrumentality of our
"hempen tangles"), greatly extended our ideas of the conditions of animal
existence   ; for we found the Sea-bottom, at depths of from 350 to 640
fathoms, at a temperature at or below the freezing-point of fresh water,
almost,   if not quite, as thickly covered with Animals as in the richest parts
of the Warm area. These animals were mostly, however, of a very different
character.     In the first place, the Globigerina-mxid was entirely wanting,
its presence being sharply bounded by the limit of the Warm area, and its
composition being modified even on the borders of this by an admixture of
the Sand characteristic of the Cold area (§ 61).            Now this fact appears
to be a conclusive disproof of the hypothesis that the accumulation of
the shells of Globiyerinee on the bottom of the ocean is due to their having
fallen to the bottom after death, their lives having been passed at or near
the surface.      For admitting that they have been occasionally captured
by the tow-net*, this only proves that they can float ; whilst, on the
other hand, our       examination     of specimens freshly dredged          from   great
depths enables us to state with positiveness that their sarcodic bodies present
nil the attributes of life which are exhibited by those of the Rotaline forms
whose attachment to solid bodies made it clear that they must pass their
lives at the bottom, and of the Arenaceous types which can only there
obtain the materials for their
                                     " tests." Now since, as we have repeatedly
pointed out, the sur/ace-temperature of the Cold area does not differ from
that of the Warm, and this equality extends to the first 1 50 or 200 fathoms,
there seems no reason whatever why a deposit of Globigerina-mud                 should
not take place on the bottom of the Cold area, if such deposit be                due to
the accumulation of the dead shells of individuals which had spent                 their

lives the bottom on which they are found in such extraordinary abundance,
we have at once the explanation, in the difference of temperature between
the two Areas, of their definite restriction to the Warm *.
     75. The simple Protozoic type represented by the Globigerince, how
ever, has its parallel in the Cold area, though presenting itself under a
very different aspect.         Every Zoologist now recognizes the close Physio
logical relationship between Foraminifera and Sponges, notwithstanding
their wide morphological divarication ; and we believe them to agree in
this most important particular, — that the animals of both groups are capable
of obtaining their nutriment by the imbibition of the Organic matter dif
fused through sea-water (§ 23), just as they derive from the same source
the Carbonate of Lime or the Silex which forms the Mineral basis of their
skeletons.        The Sponges of the Cold area were very diverse in type, and
some of them extremely numerous individually.                    Magnificent specimens
of most of the species hitherto known only as inhabitants of the deep water
off Shetland        were   found to be very generally diffused           ;  but the most
peculiar and novel type of this group was met with at our very entrance
upon the Cold area (Station 52), and presented itself in such abundance
at almost every other Station having the same bottom-temperature, that
we came to look upon it as one of the most characteristic inhabitants of
this area, covering (as it seems to do) hundreds of square miles of the Sea
bed.      This Sponge is distinguished by the possession of a firm branching
 axis, of a pale sea-green colour, rising from a spreading root, and
                                                                                 extending
 itself like a shrub or a large branching Gorgonia. The axis is clothed with
the soft pale-yellow sarcodic substance of the Sponge ; and both axis and
sponge-substance        are crowded with Siliceous spicules, resembling those            of
Esperia,     a well-known      Mediterranean      and Adriatic form, near which our
 Sponge must be placed, though it clearly forms the type of a new genus.
It is curious that scarcely even fragments of this Sponge came up in the
dredge, our specimens being almost entirely obtained through the instru

tained some minute fragments of the axial portions of the branches of this
 Sponge    ; but they were so imperfect that we had not been able to make
 out their true characters.
     70. The most remarkable Foraminifera obtained in this area belonged to
the Arenaceous Order ; and it is singular that whilst very abundant in the
localities in which they were met with, they seemed very restricted in Geogra

observations, as well as those of Major Owen and Lieut.
                                                           Palmer) he believes Globigerina
to be exclusively an Oceanic Foraminifer inhabiting only the superficial stratum of the
sea ; he considers also that the strength of the submarine current in the Cold area is
sufficient to sweep away and remove these very slight and delicate organisms. Accord
ing to him the protrusion of psoudopodia is tho only satisfactory proof that the Glo

feral fossil Loftusia, and which present their most symmetrical arrangement
in the yet more gigantic fossil Parkeria described in the same Memoir     Dr.                      by
Carpenter*. These arenaceous processes lie in the midst of the                       sarcodicbody,
which fills the whole of the cavity without any division into                        segments, and
which communicates with the surrounding medium, at what                              appears        to        be
the free extremity of the tube, by irregular spaces left between the agglu

the numerous specimens         that have been examined, and so generally presents
an appearance      of fracture, that there    seems strong ground for believing
that this type (to which we assign the generic designation Botellina) must
grow attached       by
                   the lower end of its tube to some fixed base.          sin                 It   is
gular that while this fabric presented itself at no neighbouring Station, the
"tangles" brought up in the comparatively shallow water near Shetland
a    number of tubes, which,though of somewhat larger size, and having
their sand-grains yet  more  regularly agglutinated, presented so close

general resemblance to our Botellina, as strongly to suggest  similarity         a
character.       This   idea, however, was soon dispelled by               further   examination;
for the tubes, when broken open, proved to be as smooth internally as
they were externally, and to be lined         by

  edly its extraordinary richness in Echinoderms, the prevalent types being
  of a decidedly Boreal and even an Arctic character. During the course of our
  exploration we met with nearly all the members of this group which have
  been described by Scandinavian naturalists as inhabiting the coast and
  fiords of Norway ; and we were particularly struck with the abundance
  of the beautiful Antedon (Comatula) Eschrichti, which has hitherto been
  obtained only from the neighbourhood of Iceland and Greenland.           On the
  other hand, such of the characteristically Southern forms as here presented
  themselves were so reduced in size that they might almost be accounted
  specifically distinct, if it were not for their exact conformity in general
  structure ; the Solaster papposa, for example, being dwarfed from six inches
 in diameter to two, and having never more than ten rays, and the Astera-
 canthion violaceus and Cribella oculata being reduced in like proportion.
 One striking feature of the group, however, showed no modification. The
 coloration of these animals, though brought up from a depth of 500 or 600
 fathoms, was      as rich and beautiful as that of their littoral representatives.
 Their    orange,   violet, and scarlet blended admirably with the pale green of
 the large Sponge-stem when grouped together in         a basin of water ; and we
 were led to wonder, on the one hand, how such vivid hues could be pro
 duced in the absence of light, and, on the other, what purpose they can serve
 in the economy of animals which live on a bottom supposed to be entirely un-
 illumined by solar rays, and which only exhibit these hues when brought
 within reach of daylight. Whilst our explorations in the Cold area have thus
 added to the British Fauna a large number of types of Echinoderms-which had
 been previously supposed to lie altogether beyond its range, they have also
 brought up several forms which altogether are new to science, some of them
of very considerable interest. Thus in the Shetland channel we procured a
full-sized    specimen    of the remarkable Clypeastroid Pourtalesia, of which
young examples had been obtained in the First cruise (§ 36), and a very
singular Asterid allied to Pteraster, which is covered with a regular brush
of long paxillse.. Since, for the reason formerly mentioned, we have found
ourselves precluded from dedicating the former of these types (as we had
intended) to our friend Capt. Calver, we propose to give the generic name
 Calveria to the latter, with the specific designation hystrix.
     78. Of the Crustacea of the Cold area, many are most distiuctly referable
to the Fauna of Spitzbergen, whilst others are characteristically Norwegian.
We were struck with finding attached to the " tangles," on nearly every
occasion, numerous specimens of very large Pycnogonids, measuring, when
their limbs were extended, as much as four or five inches across.             The
comparatively small forms of these animals that are common on our own
shores are commonly found imbedded in the gelatinous layer that enve
lopes the surfaces of Algce ; and the suctorial character of their mouths,
taken     in connexion with the feebleness of their locomotive powers, seems
to indicate that they are nourished by the ingestion of this material.
Hence it is probable that their gigantic representatives living on the Sea-

    79.   The Motlvsca, which in the preceding Cruises usually constituted the
principal results of the dredgings, were here quite subordinate, as regards
both     number and variety, to the groups already alluded to ; and the
difference between the Molluscan Fauna of the Gold and that of the -Warm
area was not by any means ns great as was shown in other groups.                One
of the most interesting types which        we  met with was   a Brachiopod   found
living, at Station 65 in the Shetland channel, at a depth of 345 fathoms,
and n bottom-tempcrnture of 30°, viz. the Terebratula seplata of Philippi,
 = T. septigera of Lovcn. A variety of this species, from the Pliocene
beds     of Messina, has been described and figured by Prof. Seguenza under
the name of Walilheimia Peloritana ; and it is clearly the same as the
 Waldheimia Ftoridana, found in the Gulf of Mexico by Pourtales, which
our own numerous specimens so considerably exceed in size as to show
that its most congenial home is in frigid water.           A single specimen was
found of another remarkable Brachiopod, the Platydia anomididet ot
Scacchi (or Morrisia of Davidson), hitherto supposed to be restricted to the
Mediterranean.       Since in this case, also, the size of our specimen greatly
exceeds     that of the Mediterranean examples of the same species, being
nearly double, the presumption is strong that its original home is in the
Boreal, perhaps even in the Arctic region.
    80. Only a small number of Fishes were procured, but their scarcity
may probably have been chiefly due to the unsuitableness of the dredges
as a means     of their capture.     The few species taken have been examined
since our return by Mr. Couch.            The list includes a new generic form

about noon on the 31st of August, and ran southwards until we had passed
Sumburgh Head, when we steered towards the west , our object now being
to examine the southern portion of the channel between the North of
Scotland and the Faroe islands with the same minute attention which we
had previously bestowed on its northern portion.          Early the next morning
we    sounded (Station 71) in Lat. 60° 17', Long. 2° 53', and found the
depth to be 103 fathoms, and the bottom-temperature 48°-6, the tem-

perature of the surface being          520-7. In the afternoon of the same day
(Station 74)       the  water  had   deepened to 203 fathoms, while its bottom-
temperature         had diminished to 470-6, the surface-temperature being
 52°"6.      Another Sounding (Station 75) taken only two and a half hours
later, and at a distance of no more than 10 miles from the preceding, gave
 a depth of 250 fathoms, and a bottom-temperature of 41°-9 — a reduction
 which clearly showed that the frigid current exerts no inconsiderable in
 fluence in this locality, the temperature at Station 66, at the slightly
 greater depthof 267 fathoms, having been 45°-7. Having run about 30 miles
 during the night, we found ourselves early the next morning in Lat. 60° 36',
 Long.    3° 58'; and here (Station 76), with a surface-temperature of 50°"3,
 we found the bottom-temperature 29°'7, at a depth of 344 fathoms, as at
 Station 65. Keeping on our westward course for 25 miles, we took another
 Sounding (Station 77) at noon of the same day, which gave us a depth of
 560 fathoms, and a bottom-temperature of 290-8.            This Station was only
 about twelve miles to the S.S.E. of the first point (Station vi.) at which we
 came upon the Cold area last year ; and it was interesting to have so com
 plete a confirmation of the accuracy of that observation, which had given
 us at the depth of 510 fathoms a temperature of 33°-7, which, when cor
 rected for pressure, would be 31°'6.
    82. Changing our course to the southward, we found on the afternoon of
 the same day (Station 78), after a run of about 20 miles, that the depth
 had diminished to 290 fathoms, and that the bottom-temperature had risen
 to  4 10-6   ; from which it appeared that the influence of the frigid stream
 was not quite so great, in proportion to the depth, as at Station 75, though
 still very decided. Keeping on to the southward during the night, we
 crossed     the 100-fathom line, and found ourselves early in the morning
 (Station 79) in Lat. 59° 49' and Long. 4° 42', where the depth was only
 92 fathoms, and the bottom-temperature 49°-4, with a surface-tempera
 ture of 520-3.         It seemed obvious, therefore, that the influence of the
 frigid  stream      did not extend over this shallower portion of the bed of the
 channel    ;   and this conclusion was confirmed by the Soundings which wc
 took   at short intervals after altering our course to the   N.W.,  so as to pass
 again from this plateau into deep water. For after steaming 7 miles we
 found the depth 92 fathoms, and the bottom-temperature 490-4 ; pro
 ceeding 7 miles further, the depth was found to have increased to 142
 fathoms, while the bottom-temperature was still 49°' 1 ; but a continuance
of the same course for only 8 miles showed that the bottom rapidly de
scends     here,    as on  other parts of the southern border of this channel,
the depth at Station 82 having increased to 312 fathoms, whilst the tem
perature fell to 41°-3, showing a very precise accordance with the condition
of Station 78. We were here only about 7 miles to the S.E. of our
last year's Station vn., where the depth        was 500 fathoms, and the bottom-
temperature 320,2, which when corrected for pressure, would be 30o-l ; and
it was   thus very interesting to see how considerably the bottom-temperature
                                                                  2 m 2

448                Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson            [Not. 18,
varied with the depth, on the border of that deeper portion of the channel
which gives passage to the Arctic stream.          In order to test this yet more
completely, we proceeded about 7 miles to the northward (Station 83),
so as to be almost exactly in the parallel of our last year's Station vn.,
but about       7 miles to the eastward of it  ; and here we found the depth      to
have increased to 362 fathoms, while the bottom-temperature           had fallen to
37°'5.       Comparing this, however, with the bottom-temperature of 29c,7,
found at Station 76, at which the depth was rather less, it became obvious
that the influence of the warm surface-current here extends to a greater
depth.
    83. Again changing our course to the S.W., in a direction nearly parallel
to the 100-fathom line, so as to bring us to a part of the area not previously
surveyed, we took a Sounding (Station 84) early in the morning of Saturday,
Sept.4th, in Lat. 59° 34', and Long.          6° 34'; and found the depth to be
 155 fathoms, nnd the bottom-temperature 490-l, showing that we were
again on a portion of the southern bank too near the surface to be affected
by the frigid stream.       And as, on sounding again (Station 85), after baving
run 6 miles in a northerly direction, we found the bottom-temperature to
have     only fallen to 48°-7, while the depth had increased to 190 fathoms,
it  was obvious that the same condition still existed.           A further run of
only 8 miles northwards, however, brought us suddenly into the Arctic
stream     ;  the depth (Station 86) being here 445 fathoms, and the bottom-
temperature 30°- 1 . — These very rapid changes of Submarine Climate are
of extreme interest in a variety of ways, but especially in their Zoological
and Palseozoological relations, as     will be shown hereafter.
    8 4.  As   we were now again approaching        a part of the Area   which    had
been previously explored      with sufficient minuteness for our   present  purpose,
and as we desired to extend our survey into a part of the Warm area re
moved from the immediate influence of the Arctic stream, our ship's head
was kept to the westward        without any stoppage until the morning of Mon
day, Sept. 6th; when we reached Long. 9° 11' in Lat. 59° 35', thii
point being about 24 miles to the south of Station xiv. in our last year's
 Cruise.       Here a Sounding gave us (Station 87) a depth of 767 fathoms,
and a bottom-temperature of 4 1°-5 ; and as it thus became obvious that
we were in the Warm area, we thought it desirable to obtain a set of Jens'
 Soundings, for comparison, on the one hand, with those obtained on the
 Cold area, and, on the other, with those taken in the former Cruises at
similar depths on the border of the North Atlantic basin. —The results of
 these Soundings, given in Table I., p. 456, will be discussed hereafter;
and at present it will be sufficient to state that while they show that the
influence of the Warm stream here extends through the entire depth, they
also indicate that this is modified below 500 fathoms by the frigid          stream ;
the depression of temperature between 500 and 600 fathoms being almost
exactly equal to that which presented itself between 100 and 500 fathoms.
— Our dredge here came up with the
                                             extraordinary load mentioned in the

     1869.]             on the  Scientific Exploration     of the   Deep Sea.            449
     Introduction (§ 8) as haying severely tested the efficiency of our donkey-
     engine ; which, however, proved equal to its work, and landed on our deck
    half a     ton  of Globigerina-ooze, here showing very little intermixture with
    sand.       Like our similar haul at Station xvi. last year, however, this mass
    contained but a small amount of the higher forms of Annimal life ; and as
    a continuance of our course still further west did not seem likely to furnish
    any additional results of importance, and as there would have been a risk
    of exhausting our coal in steaming against a head-wind, we thought it
    better to change our course towards            Stornoway, taking a direction that
    should      bring   us  again on    the ground which we had previously (bund
    most productive.          In the afternoon of the same day we took another
   Sounding in Lat. 59° 26' and Long. 8° 23', on the line of our outward track
                                    '            '
   in the second part        of the   Lightning      cruise last year, so as to establish
   the depth and temperature at an intermediate point between two distant
   stations ; and we here (Station 88) found the depth to be 705 fathoms,
   and the      bottom -temperature 42°6, thus showing            a close  accordance with
   the   nearest Soundings previously taken.
       85. Continuing our easterly course during the night, but making              slightly
   to the     northward, so as once more to come upon the Holtenia-ground, we
   sounded early the next morning (Sept. 7) in Lat. 59° 38', Long. 7° 46' j
   and    found (Station 89) that the depth had diminished to 445 fathoms,
  whilst the temperature had risen to 45°-6, — thus confirming by bottom-
   soundings the inference we had been led to draw from the serial soundings
  taken at Station 87, that the influence            of the frigid  stream is exerted   even
  in the     Warm      area at depths greater than 500 fathomsr in depressing the
  temperature        of the body of water which it there meets, and with which it
  mixes.        Another Sounding taken after a further run of 7 miles in the
 same      direction, which brought us very near to Station 49, gave a similar
  depth and temperature ; but the character of the bottom now indicated
  the proximity         of the Cold   area, the Globigerina-ooze        being here mingled
 with Sand.
      86.     We now changed our course              to the S.E., and after steaming
                                                                                   "
 about       ten   miles, put down our dredge with its " hempen tangles                upon
 what we were assured by Capt. Calver was the spot (as nearly as it could
 be determined) upon which we had made the first deep-sea dredging in
 this Cruise (§61) ; and the result of this last visit to our favourite ground
was such as to surpass our most sanguine expectations.                      For the dredge
and the tangles alike came             up laden with such       a collection of the " trea
sures      of the deep,"     as we feel quite safe in asserting had never before been
brought to the surface on any one occasion, — almost every specimen being
such as would be accounted an important acquisition to Museums already
most        complete.      Holtenias there were by the bucketful ; Hyalonemata

room-shaped         Sponge, in abundance ; Adrasta infundibulum, another
Vitreous Sponge allied to Hyalonema ; and other types of the same group
not yet described.         The Eckinodermata also were very numerous, and
many of them very large          ; and they presented a great variety of. most
interesting types, nearly all of them being new to the British Fauna,
though many had been previously described.            It was especially interesting
to note the very marked difference between the Echinoderm-Fauna of
this region and that of the Cold area.       With the exception of a few species
which seem able to maintain their existence through almost any range of
depth and temperature, they were all diverse ; and whilst the mixture of
decidedly Arctic forms, and the dwarfing of Southern types, gave a deci
dedly Boreal character to the Fauna of the Cold area, there was here a
mixture of fully developed Southern types, among them a Stichasler either
identical with or closely allied to a species described from Madeira. Bat
the specimen of this group most interesting to us (perhaps the most re
markable capture made in the whole of our Cruise) was a large Echinid
 allied to Astropyya (belonging to the Family Diademidce), having a per
 fectly soft and flexible test ; the plates of the corona, though retaining their
 normal number and arrangement, being very thin and slightly separated
 from one another by the interposition of a flexible perisome, so that the
 test resembled an armour of chain-mail, instead of the cuirass with which
 the ordinary Echinida are enveloped.          Two specimens of this remarkable
 type were obtained, — a perfect one at Station 89, and another, considerably
 injured,   but still serving for anatomical investigation, on our Holtma-
 ground.      The perfect specimen is about 5 inches in diameter, and of a
 brilliant   shade   of crimson, altogether  a  most striking object. This form
 at once recalled the very singular fossil from the White Chalk, two speci
 mens of which are in the British Museum, described by the late Dr. S. P.
 Woodward under the name of Echinothuria            fioris ; and though we would
 not affirm the actual identity of the existing form with the old, there can
 be no doubt of their very close affinity, and of the persistence of this re
 markable      type of structure from the Cretaceous to the present epoch.—
 Ilere also     we obtained a specimen of almost the only one of the Scandi
 navian Starfish that we had not met with on British ground, the Asteronw
 Lovini,   a  very interesting modification of the Astrophyton type, having the
 same general plan of structure, but having the arms simple, instead of
 being subdivided in the manner which has given occasion to the designation
 Gorgonocephalus.          It is not a little curious that a dredging we subse
 quently took      in  the Minch, near the eastern shore of Skye, brought up
 six specimens of this rare Echinoderm, thus confirming a surmise                 pre
 viously formed, that the careful exploration of that channel would             show
 that many types would be there found which have been hitherto             supposed
 to be peculiar to     Norway.
    87.  The Foraminifera obtained on this and the neighbouring parts          of  the
Warm area presented many features of great interest. As already               stated

1869.]                 on the Scientific Exploration       of the   Deep Sea.            451
(§61),         several Arenaceous forms (some        of them
                                                new) were extremely abun
dant   ;   but in additiou to these we found
                                           great abundance of Miliolines
                                                       a
of various types, many of them attaining a very unusual and some even an
unprecedented size.    As last year, we found Cornuspiree resembling in
 general aspect the large Operculinee of tropical seas, and Biloculince and
 Tri/oculince far exceeding in dimensions the littoral forms of British shores ;
 and with        these    were   associated   Cristellariae    of no   less remarkable   size,
 presenting every gradation from an almost rectilineal to the Nautiloid form,
 and having the animal body in so perfect a state as to enable it to be com
 pletely isolated by the solution of the shell in dilute acid. — It is very in
 teresting to remark that certain forms of this Cristellarian type are among
 the most characteristic Foraminifera of the Cretaceous as well as of various
Tertiary deposits ; and the similarity of some of these to existing forms
is so close, that the continuity of the type from the Cretaceous epoch cannot
be reasonably questioned.       It is further interesting to note that it has a
great bathymetrical range,     no  difference showing itself between the Cris-
tellariaru of our Warm area and those found in the preceding Cruises
at nearly three times the depth. — The continuity of Foraminiferal life is
further indicated by the occurrence in the Globigerina-ooze of a number
of Rotation forms which are peculiarly characteristic of the Fauna of
the Cretaceous period.
   88. The cumulative evidence which we have thus obtained in support of
the hypothesis advanced last year ('Lightning' Report, p. 193) as to the
uninterrupted continuity of the Cretaceous deposit on the North- Atlantic
Sea-bed from the epoch of the Chalk-formation to the present time, will be
more fully discussed hereafter. But as, with the exception of the subse
quent dredging in the shallow waters of the Minch- already referred to
(§ 86), our Zoological exploration of the sea-bottom came to a conclusion
with the extraordinary climax just described,                 we may here mention an idea
which formed the subject of much discourse between us at this period.
  89. It    we believe, the general creed of modern Geologists, that all
                 is,
Calcareous rocks have had, either directly or indirectly,               an Organic origin   ;
and that the most perfectly mineralized condition of such rocks affords no
evidence to the contrary, there being abundant evidence that all traces of
organic structure may be completely obliterated                   by
                                                     subsequent metamor-
phic action. Thus upheaved masses of recent Coral are frequently converted
into subcrystalline Limestone, the organic origin of which would not be
recognized        by
                any feature in its molecular arrangement or composition                     ;
whilst    change often presents itself (as on the Antrim Coast) of
           a                                                             true       a
Chalk into subcrystalline Marble, under the combined influence of the
                 a
heat and pressure occasioned             by
                                    the intrusion of Volcanic rocks.    Now
since there can be no question that the Chalk-formation in its entirety owes
its origin chiefly to the accumulation on the deep-sea bottom of the shells,
or their debris, of successive generations of Foraminifera which lived and
moved and had their being there, — and since there can be as little question

 452               Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson                  [Nov. 18,
 that there must have been deep seas at all Geological periods, and             that the
 changes which modified the climate and depth of the sea-bottom                 were for
 the most part very gradual, — the question naturally arises whether we
 may not carry back the continuity of the accumulation of the Foraminiferal
 ooze on some part or other        of the Ocean-bed into Geological epochs much
 more remote, and whether it has not had the same large share in the pro
 duction of the earlier Calcareous deposits that it has undoubtedlj had
 in that of the later.         Though it is altogether beyond doubt that some
 beds of Carboniferous Limestone (for example) were simply Coral reefs,
 covered with waving Crinoids and swarming with Brachiopod and other
 Mollusks, there are other parts of this formation which seem to have been
 deposited in much deeper waters ; and to these we should be inclined to
 ascribe a Foraminiferal origin.          This hypothesis seems not only probable
 on general grounds, but is supported by several remarkable facts. It has
 long been known thnt certain beds of Limestone               of Carboniferous age, in
 Russia and elsewhere, are almost entirely made up of an aggregation of
 Foraminiferal shells belonging to the genus Fusulina* ; and Prof. Phillips
 has described under the name Endothyra Bowmanni^ a Foraminiferal type
 which seems nearly allied to Fusulina, and which he states to occur in great
 abundance with Texlularia in the Mountain-limestone beds of the North of
 England.      Again, Mr. II. B. Brady has lately shown us, in a thin layer of
 Clay occurring in the midst of Carboniferous-limestone beds near Newcastle,
 an accumulation of Arenaceous Foraminifera closely corresponding in type
 with the Saccammina of Sars, which we found to be abundant, in                   many of
 the deeper     dredgings of the earlier Cruises, on the eastern border of the
 North-Atlantic Sea-bed.— To this question, however, we shall recur in
 the discussion of the General Results of our Deep-Sea explorations.
    90. Thoroughly well satisfied with the success of our third Cruise, both
in the confirmation and extension it afforded of the conclusions as to the
climate we had ventured to draw from the comparatively few and scanty
data we had obtained last year, and in the large mass of Zoological
novelties we had collected, we now made for Stornoway, and arrived there
on the evening      of Wednesday, September 8th.              If  we had been      free to
dispose   of  the ' Porcupine,'    we might have taken the opportunity             of con
necting the Third with the First Cruise, by exploring the deep bottom to
be found about 200 miles to the west of the Hebrides, as far south as the
Rockall bank, which had been the northern limit of the First Cruise.
But as our vessel was under orders to make a Hydrographic Survey in the
neighbourhood of Valentin, as soon as the scientific work of our Expedi-

    91.Among the most important results of the 'Lightning' Expedition was
the discovery  of the fact that two very different Submarine Climates exist
in the deep channel (from 500 to 600 fathoms) lying E.N.E. and W.S.W.
between the North of Scotland and the Faroe banks ; a minimum tempe
rature of 32° being registered in some parts of this channel, whilst in
other parts of     at the same depths, and with the same surface-tempera
                            it,
ture (never varying much from 52°) the minimum temperature registered
was  never lower than 46°, thus showing     difference of at least 14°.
                                                           a
Though     could not be positively asserted that these minima were the
             it
iotYoHj-temperatures of the Areas in which they respectively occurred,    was             it
argued that they must almost necessarily be so first, because  :       highly   it   is
improbable  that Sea-water at 32° should overlie water at any higher tem
perature, which      specifically lighter than itself, unless the two strata
                             is
have    motion in different directions sufficiently rapid to be recognizable
        a                                                                                       ;
and second, because the nature    of the Animal life found on the bottom of
the Cold area exhibited      marked correspondence with its presumed de-
                                     a
preiw'"". of *-\rnperalure, whilst the drift of which its Sea-bed composed      is
includes particles of distinctly Volcanic minerals, probably derived from
a  northern source, — the Sea-bed of the Warm area, on the other
hand, being essentially composed      of Globigerina- mud, and supporting                       a
Fauna     of warmer temperate character. — This conclusion,
              a                                                       obvious,
                                                                           it   is
would     not be invalidated   any  errorbyarising from the effect of Pressure
on the    bulbs of the Thermometers   since, although the actual temperatures
                                              ;
might be (as was then surmised) from 2° to 4° below the recorded tempera
tures, the difference between them would remain unaffected, the pressure
exerting exactly the same influence at the same depth, whether the Sound
ings were taken in the              Cold or in the Warm area.
    92.     The        existence   in the Cold area of aminimum temperature of 32°,

    454             Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson          [Nov.  18,
    with  a Fauna essentially Boreal, could not, it was argued, be accounted for
    in any other way than by the supposition of an under-current of Polar
    water coming down from the North or North-east ; whilst, conversely,
    the existence in the Warm area of a minimum temperature of 46°,           ex
    tending to 500 or 600 fathoms- depth in the Latitude of 60° (of which     the
    normal deep-water temperature would be at least 8° less), together with
    the warmer temperate character of its Fauna, seemed equally indicative of
    a flow of Equatorial water from the South or South-west.         How far this
    flow is part of the "Gulf-stream"      proper, — that is, of the current of
    heated water which issues through the "Narrows" from the Gulf of
    Mexico, — or is attributable to some more general cause, was reserved as &
   matter still open to discussion ; but it was urged that the existence of two
   such different Submarine Climates in such close proximity may be taken
   as an example   of that continual interchange between the Ocean-icatert of
   Equatorial   and  Polar regions, which is as much a Physical necessity as
   that interchange of Air which has so large a share in the production of
   winds.    For the water that is cooled by the Polar atmosphere must sink
   and displace the water that is warmer than itself, pushing    it away towards
   the Equator, so that in the deepest parts of the Ocean there will be a pro
  gressive movement in the Equatorial direction ; whilst, conversely, the water
   heated by the   Tropical sun, being the lighter, will spread itself north and
  south over the surface of the ocean, and will thus move towards the Polar
  regions, losing its heat as it approaches them, until it is there so much
  reduced in temperature as to sink to the bottom, and thence return      towards
  its source.
       93. The doctrine of the Warm and Cold Areas, and of the probable
  source of their difference, has been fully and carefully tested by the Tempe
                                                               '
  rature-soundings taken during the Third Cruise of the Porcupine;- and
  the result has been a complete confirmation of it in every particular;
  whilst an entirely new and important set of data has been afforded by the
 Temperature-soundings        taken during the First and Second Cruises, in
 support of the doctrine that a general interchange of Equatorial and Polar
 waters is continually taking place in the great Oceanic basins.
      94. The total number of Temperature-soundings taken during the 'Light
 ning- Expedition,     in water of more than 100 fathoms- depth, was only 15;
 of which    8 were   in the Warm area, and    6  in the Cold.    These were all
 Bottom-soundings       only.   The total number of Stations at which Tem
 perature-soundings were taken during the     Third Cruise of the 'Porcupine,-
 in water of more than 100 fathoms, was 36; of these, 17 were in the
 Cold area, and 14 in the Warm, whilst 5 showed an intermediate range,
in accordance with their border position.           But besides these Bottom-
soundings,     Serial   Soundings   were taken  at   different depths in three
Stations ; of which No. 87 was in the Warm area, and Nos. 52 and 64
in the Cold.      In the first of these, which was at a point about 125 miles
to the N.W. of Stornoway, the temperatures were taken at 50, 100, 150,

1869.]           on the Scientific Exploration    of the     Deep Sea.            455
200, 300, 400, 500, 600, and 767 fathoms (bottom) respectively, with the
result of showing a reduction of only 1 1°-2 at the last-mentioned depth ;
in the second, which was near the S.E. border of the Faroe Bank, the
temperature was taken at every 50 fathoms down to 300, and then at 384
fathoms (bottom), showing a reduction of 2 10-5; while in the third, which was
nearly midway between the Faroe and the Shetland Islands, the temperature
was taken at every 50 fathoms down to 600, and then at 640 fathoms
(bottom), showing a reduction of 20°- 1. Of these Serial Soundings there
were in all 26, making, with the 36 Bottom-soundings, a total of 62.
    95. With these results, obtained with Thermometers upon which complete
reliance    can   be placed, those obtained last year        with the   best ordinary
Thermometers        are found to be in close accordance, when the proper cor
rection for pressure is applied to them. Thus No. 47 Sounding of the
' Porcupine- having been taken in almost exactly the same spot of the
Warm area as No. xn. of the 'Lightning,- — namely, on what we now
call the " Holtenia-ground" (§ 61), — the former gave 43°-8 as the mini
mum temperature at 542 fathoms, while the latter gave 47°-3 as the mini
mum at 530 fathoms : and the difference of 3°-5 exceeds by scarcely more
than     a  degree  — which    may be    a  mere  seasonal      variation — the error
 (about 2°-l) which the pressure of water          at that depth would        produce
in the unprotected thermometers. On the other hand, No. 55 Sound
ing of the ' Porcupine
                              -
                                  having been taken in the same part of the
 Cold area as No. vm. of the 'Lightning,- — the distance between the
 two being only about 8 miles, — the former gave 29°-8 as the minimum
 at   605   fathoms,    while   the latter  gave 32°    as    the  minimum    at  550
 fathoms    ; and the difference of 2°-2 is exactly equivalent to the correc
 tion   for  pressure at that depth in the unprotected thermometers. Thus
 the difference between the two ' Lightning- Soundings in the Warm
 and Cold areas respectively having been 15°-3, the difference between
 the two corresponding 'Porcupine- Soundings was 14°. This very near
 accordance gave us, of course, a feeling of great satisfaction in our last
 year-s work ; and it fully justified our conclusion that whatever might be
 the pressure-correction required by the instruments then employed, it
 would not affect the differences obtained at nearly approximating depths.
 It further justifies us in assuming the correctness (when thus rectified) of
 the minimum temperatures taken last year at stations considerably west

 ward of the ground over which we worked in the Porcupine.-
     96. The data thus obtained respecting the Temperatures at different
 Depths in the Warm and Cold areas respectively, are correlated in Table I.,
 which includes, with the three sets of Serial Soundings, all the Bottom-
 sounding that accord with them.          The localities of the several Soundings
 are indicated by their Numbers in Diagram         III.

           On examining the Series taken at Station 87 in the Warm area, we notice
        (1) that, the Surface-temperature being 52°-6, there is a fall of 4°-5 in the
       first 50 fathoms ; (2) that from 50 to 500 fathoms there is a slow progres
       sive and nearly uniform descent amounting in the whole to 3°, which is
       at the average rate of about 0°-7 per 100 fathoms; and
                                                                                                (3) that this de
       scent increases to 2°-         1 in the next 100 fathoms, and amounts to 1° 6 in                           the
       interval of 1G7 fathoms between 000 fathoms and the bottom.                                         The     re-

tional parts) each line marks a descent of 1° Fahr. : —

Further, on comparing this Series with the oollom-soundings taken in
various parts of the same area, the accordance is found to be ex
tremely close ; no difference of more than a degree presenting itself any
 where, except at depths of less than 200 fathoms, the bottom-tem
 peratures of which are higher by from 1° to 2°-2 than the temperatures
 at corresponding depths in the serial sounding.          This accordance be
 comes at once pvident when the upper curve of Diagram IV., which is
constructed from twelve W lorn-soundings in the Warm area, is compared
with the upper curve in Diagram III. which represents the serial soundings
 at Station 87 ; while the slight difference is just what might be expected,
 when it is borne in mind that the superficial stratum is not here underlaid
 by colder water.
    97. Turning from   these to the Series of Temperature-soundings     taken at
 Station 52 in the Cold area (distant less   than  60  miles from   Station 87),
 which begins from nearly the same surface- temperature (52°-l), we see
 (1) that the descent during the first 50 fathoms corresponds so closely
 with that  observed  in Series 87, that the two temperatures     at that depth
 are almost precisely the same; (2) that at 100      fathoms  the temperatures
 in the two series are identical ; (3) that at the depths of 150 and 200
 fathoms there is only a very slight difference ; but that (4) whilst the re
 duction between    200 and 300 fathoms in the Warm area is only 0o,2,
 it amounts to not less than 14°-8 in the Cold area, bringing down the
 temperature at that depth to 30o-8 ; and that (5) this is further reduced
 to 30°-6 at the bottom of 384 fathoms. — Thus it is evident that a tempe
 rature of 32° would have been reached at somewhat less than 300 fathoms,
 and that the temperature of the water occupying the 100 fathoms beneath
 was absolutely below the freezing-point of fresh water.

  the surface ; and this was still more remarkably the case with No. ix., the

  surface-current that comes up from the S.W. obviously extends over that
  bank, so as to modify in greater or less degree, according to the depth, the
  effect of the deep cold current coming down from the N.E. The intermixture
  of the two is well seen in Nos. 75, 78, 82, and 83, the depths of which
  range from 250 to 3G2 fathoms j but at the shallower depths, ranging
  from 76 to 203 fathoms, at which Nos. 66, 71, 72, 73, 74, and 79 were
  taken, the influence of the warm surface-current is obviously predominant.
  On the other hand, the position of No. 51 marks it                       as   just on the border
  ground between No. 50, which was taken at or near                          the northern margin
  of the warm current, and Nos. 52, 53, which clearly lie within the southern
  margin of the cold      ;   and we thus see how the southern and deeper portion
  of the cold current may here        lose itself by intermixture with the warm ; whilst
  the northern portion seems to flow onwards unchanged over the shallower
  bottom, until, having passed the Faroe Banks, it runs down the slope
  forming the eastern margin of the great Atlantic basin, to the deeper waters
  of which it helps to impart the coldness by which they will presently                         be
  shown to be characterized.
      101 . Although we have spoken of
                                                    " currents," it is     not to be inferred that
  we have detected any actual opposing movements in the waters of the two
  Areas respectively, or in the warm superficial stratum of the Cold area
'
  as compared       with its deep frigid layer.               But it may be assumed as a
  physical necessity that a great body of ice-cold water could not be always
  spread over the bottom of a large area between Lat. 59|° and Lat. 62°,
  often to   a depth of 2000 feet, unless it had arrived thither from within the
  Arctic circle   ; and, conversely, it can scarcely be conceived that the upper
  stratum of this very area should maintain a temperature equal to that of
  the Warm area (a slight allowance being made for difference of Latitude),
  without a continual flow of a warmer stream from some southerly quarter.
  — A further indication of the derivation of the                      deep     water of the Cold
  Area from a northern source is afforded by the presence, among the
  small stones and sand brought up from this bottom, of Volcanic detritus,
  which seems to have been brought southwards either from the Faroe
  Islands or from       some more         remote       source,    such as       Jan Meyeu.    The

presence  of Volcanic detritus on that part of the floor of the channel between
the Faroe Islands and Iceland which lies between its deepest point and the
S.E. shore of Iceland has been already urged by Dr. Wallich*. with great
force, as an argument for the existence of" an offshoot of the Arctic current
                              " in a line about 250 miles to the westward of
slowly moving downwards
that which we consider ourselves to have now conclusively established ; and
it can scarcely be doubted that a set of Temperature-soundings taken in "the
682-fathom locality about forty miles from the southern shore of Iceland"
would give Thermometric results similar to those we have obtained in the
corresponding channel between the Faroe and Shetland Isles.

of the presence of similar Volcanic detritus on the bed of the Mid-Atlantic,
as first pointed out by        Prof. Bailey, will       be considered hereafter      (§ 117).
  102.    Although the thermal condition of the Warm area does not afford
the like striking evidence of the derivation of its whole body of water from a
Southern source, yet a careful examination of its phenomena seems fairly
to justify such an inference. For it has been shown by the Serial souading
No. 87 in Lat. 59° 35', that while the surface-water is about 4|° warmer
than the water at 50 fathoms- depth, the latter is only 0°-8 warmer than
the water at 100 fathoms; and that below this the thermometer remains
almost stationary down to 400 fathoms. Now at that                         depth it is only 2°-4
colder than water at the same depth (Station 42) at                       the northern border
of the Bay of Biscay, in a Latitude more than 1 0° to                     the south, where the
surface-temperature was 62°,7 ; and the approximation    of the two tempera
tures is yet nearer at still greater depths, the bottom-temperature at 767
fathoms at Station 87 being 41°-4, whilst the temperature at 750 fathoms-
depth at Station 42 is 42°-5.       So great an excess above the Isotherm
of Lat.  59° 35' can scarcely be attributed to the summer atmosphere of
the locality, which we scarcely ever observed to be above 54°, and of which
the effect, if exerted at all, seems limited to the " superheating" of the
superficial stratum.  It is obvious, again, that the surface-drift caused by
the prevalence of South-westerly winds, to which some have attributed the
phenomena usually assigned to the extension of the Gulf-stream to these
regions, cannot account for such an elevation of temperature in a stratum
altogether removed from its agency ; and it seems equally difficult to
conceive    that in a region so remote from the source of the Gulf-stream
proper, its influence,  even if exerted in an elevation of the surface-tempe
rature,    should extend to a depth of at least 400 fathoms.   It may be
pretty certainly affirmed, indeed, that the effect of the warm current is
exerted to the very bottom of the Warm area : for its temperature even at
767 fathoms is 41°-4, which              is several     degrees   above    the theoretical iso
therm of the latitude      ;   and such
                                    temperature could scarcely be maintained

  torial Waters (§ 92) seems the only hypothesis that is competent to account
  for the facts of this case * ; and it will be found to derive further support
  from the Temperature-phenomena of the North-Atlantic basin, which we
  shall presently discuss on the basis of the Thermometric observations taken
  in the First and Second Cruises of the 'Porcupine,' with additional evidence
  from other sources. — Before proceeding to these, however, we shall inquire
  whether any rationale can be given for the special peculiarity of the Arctic
  current,     which produces the depression of temperature to from 32°-30°
  everywhere noticeable at depths of from 300-640 fathoms in our Cold area.
      104. A glance at the North Polar region, as laid down either on a Globe,
  or on   any projection    of which the Pole is the centref, — as in           the accom
  panying Chart (Plate 7) shows that the Polar Basin is so much shut-in by
  the northern shores of the European, Asiatic, and American Continents,
  that its only outlet, besides the narrow and shallow channel of Behring's
  Straits,    and the circuitous passages leading into Hudson's and Baffin's
   Bays,   is  the space which intervenes between the eastern coast of Green
  land and the north-western coast of the Scandinavian Peninsula.                         If,
  therefore, there be any such general movement of ice-cold water towards
  the Equatorial regions as that for which we have argued, this movement
  must take place mainly through the deeper portions of this interspace ;
  at the north      of which lies Spitzbergen, whilst Iceland and the Faroes
  lie in the middle of its southerly expanse.             Now in the western portion of
  this channel, lying between Greenland and Iceland, the depth of water for
  the most part ranges from 800 fathoms to nearly double that amount ;
  and there will here, therefore, be a free exit to the water which has been
  cooled down within the Arctic basin, and has consequently subsided to its
  deeper portions.      But on the eastern side of Iceland the case is very dif-
     * The existence of " Polar Currents " beneath the heated waters of Tropical regions
 liad  been indicated by various   observers  (see 'Lightning' Report, p. 186); but they
 seem   to have been generally,  if   not universally, regarded as local peculiarities. Con
 versely, a movement of Equatorial water in the Polar direction, quite independent of
 such local accidents as those which produce the Gulf-stream proper, had been noticed
 in several localities ; particularly between the Indian and Antarctic Oceans (see
 Maury's 'Physical Geography of the Sea,' §§ 748-750), where the whole movement
 is forced to take place towards the South pole, by the barrier interposed by the Con
tinent of Asia to any flow in a northerly direction. — The real import of such facts as
 these could not be recognized by Physical Geographers, so long as they were under the
" dominant idea" of a uniform deep-tea temperature of 39°; and our present endeavour
is simply to show that the doctrine of Oceanic circulation, being at the same time in
accordance with Physical theory (as laid down by Prof. Buff), and consonant with all
the reliable facts yet observed, is entitled to the same rank as a fundamental principle
in the science of Physical Geography, as the parallel doctrine of Atmospheric circulation
holds in Meteorology.
    T The ordinary Hemispherical projection of our Atlases does not give by any means a
correct idea of this Polar Basin ; and the Mercator's projection (which is employed by
Dr. "Wallich) so exaggerates the Longitude-distances in high Latitudes, as to give an
entirely fallacious conception of it.

along the whole bottom as far as the Faroe Islands*; and                an effecto«l
barrier is thus interposed to any current moving southwards                 at a depth
exceeding this.   A similar barrier is presented, not merely by             the plateau
on which the British Islands rest, but also by the bed of the North Sea;
whieh (as its depth nowhere exceeds 1 00 fathoms between the coast-linc
of the British Isles from Shetland to Dover on one side, and the coast-line
of Norway, Denmark, and Holland from Bergen to Ostend on the other)
must give to such a movement a not less effectual check than would be
afforded by an actual coast-line uniting the Shetland Islands with Norway.
Consequently it is obvious that a flow of ice-cold water at a depth exceed
ing 300 fathoms from the     surface,   down the north-eastern portion             of this
interspace,     only find its way southwards through the deep
               can                                                                channel
between the Faroe and Shetland Islands, which will turn it into                    a S.W.
course,  and finally discharge it into the great North-Atlantic basin, where
it will meet the Icelandic and Greenland currents, and unite with them
in spreading over the deepest portions of the sea-bed.
   105. Hence it is obvious that if a subsidence were to take            place in the
area now covered by the North Sea and the British Channel, so as to depress
their bottom below the level of that of the channel between the Faroe and
Shetland Islands, the course of the Arctic current would be deflected from
the latter to the former, lowering its bottom-temperature by at least 14°;
and as the warmer current coining up from the S.W., and now ocupying
our Warm area, would then meet with no check, it would extend itself
over the whole of what is now our Cold area, and would raise                its tempera
ture at least 12°. This would have the general effect of altering almost
the entire Fauna of both regions ; and of modifying the characters of the
deposit forming on the bottom of each.

       107. Amongst all these the coincidence of Temperatures at corresponding
  Depths is extraordinarily close ; the chief differences show themselves,
  as might be expected, in Surface-temperature.                          This was peculiarly high
  in the most Southerly stations, which lay between Lat. 47° and 49° 51',
  rising to 62°-6 at Station 42, to              640t8 at Station 38, to 65°-6 at Station

 466               Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson              [Nov. 18,
 37    (which was that of the 2-135 fathoms- dredging), and to 66° at Sta
 tion 31 : whilst it fell in the more Northerly Stations, which lay between
  Lat. 53° 41' and 54° 53', to 54°8 at Station 19, to 53°-2 at Stations 17
  and 18, though these were rather to the southward of the preceding,
 and to 52°-2 at Station 12, which was yet further south.            A comparison
 of  the temperature    of the Surface-water with that of the Air at each Station
 indicates that a large part of the variation in the former is due, on the one
  hand, to the heating effect of the solar rays, and on the other to the cool
 ing influence of winds.      Thus at three Stations at which the Surface-tem
 peratures were 64°-8, 65°-6, and 66° respectively, the thermometers in Air
 showed 63°-5, 70°, and 72° ; whilst at four Stations at which the Surface-
 temperatures ranged downwards from 54°-8 to 52°-2, the temperature of
 the Air ranged from 55°-5 to 53°.        In only one instance was the tempera
 ture of the Air decidedly lower than that of the Surface-water ; and this
 was at Station 42, where, although the Surface-temperature was 62°-6, the
 temperature of the Air was only 59°. But as this observation was made at
 4h 30m on the morning of July 27, and as the wind was from the N.W.,
 the discrepancy may be regarded as accidental.
     108.  At the last-mentioned Station, in Lat. 49°   12-, about 250 miles  to the
 S.W.of Cork, aSeriesof Temperature-soundings was taken atevery l0fathoras
 from the surface to 50 fathoms, with the view of determining the rate of ther
 mal decrease at successive     depths in the superficial stratum.     The total  de
 crease in this descent amounted to 9°-4    ; the most rapid diminution being     be
 tween 20 and 30 fathoms, within which vertical space the reduction amounted
 to3°-4.    In the next  10 fathoms it was only l°-6, and in the  10 following only
 l°-2. Between 50 and 100 fathoms the total reduction was only 20-l ; and
it may be fairly surmised that a large part of this occurred in the upper
20 fathoms; for below 100 fathoms the rate of diminution becomes ex
tremely     slow,  the total reduction between      100   and 500 fathoms      being
only 3°-7, or at an average of 0-9 per 100 fathoms.         The rate of diminution
then again becomes more rapid, the total reduction between 500 and 800
fathoms being 5°-4, or 1°8 per 100 fathoms ; and between 800 and 862
falhoms (bottom) there is a still more rapid diminution, a reduction of
2°-3 taking place in this comparatively small descent.
    109.   On comparing with this the Series taken at every 100 fathoms at
Station 23, in Lat. 50° 13', we see a very close general accordance in the
rate of descent ; although the actual temperatures of the latter are from 2°
to 3° lower than those of the former at corresponding depths, as might be
expected from its higher Latitude.          In the Surface-temperature, indeed,
the difference amounts to 5°-3 ; but this becomes reduced to 2° 6 at 100
fathoms, to 2°-5 at 200 fathoms, to l°-8 at 300 fathoms, and to l°-0 at 400
and 000 fathoms.        The total reduction in the first 100 fathoms is here
8°-8, as against 1 1°\5 in the preceding case ; while the reduction between

    Although the difference between the Surface-temperatures                         at Stations
42 and 87 amounts to 10°-1, the difference is reduced to                            3°-8      at 100
fathoms, to 3° at 300 fathoms, to 2°-5 at 600 fathoms, and to 1°- 1 at
750 fathoms.       So, again, the reduction in the first 100 fathoms at Sta
tion 87 being only 50-2, the total reduction between 100 and 500 fathoms
is only 2° 2, or at the rate of 0o-55 per 100 fathoms.                    But the rate of de
pression then undergoes nearly as marked an increase as at the corre
sponding depth in Station 42 ; for whilst the diminution of temperature
between 500 and 750 fathoms amounts at Station 42 to 4°"2, or 10,7 per
100 fathoms,     it amounts at Station         87 to 3°-7, or l°-5 per 100 fathoms.
    111. It becomes obvious, therefore, in the first place, that there is a de
cided superheating of the superficial stratum, not extending to a depth much
greater than 70 or 80 fathoms, and that this is more considerable (as might
be expected) at the Southern than at the Northern stations.                        Whether this
"  superheating
                   " is
                          entirely due to the direct influence of solar heat, or de
pends     in any degree (especially in the southern portion of this area) on an

extension of the Gulf-stream,           is   a    question which can only he resolved         by
the determination of its relative amount in summer and in winter ; and as
this solution could be very easily obtained (sets of Temperature-soundings
at every 10 fathoms down to 100 fathoms, taken in these opposite periods
of the year, being nil that is requisite), it may be hoped that the cause of
this "superheating" will not long remain undetermined.
    112. With regard, secondly, to the Temperature of the 400 fathoms
beneath the superficial 100, which ranges between 51°-1 and 46°-7 in Lat.
49° 12-, between 48°-5 and 45°-8 in Lat. 56° 13-, and between 47°3 and
45°-l in Lat. 59° 35-, it may be pretty certainly affirmed that whilst it is
somewhat higher than the Isotherm of the Southern station, it is so con
siderably above that of the Isotherms of the Northern stations, as decidedly
to indicate that the body of water between these depths has found its way
thither from    Southern source (see § 102).

       13. Proceeding,
ratures are recorded in Series 22 (1263 fath.),Ser. 19 (13G0 fath.), Ser. 20
(1443 fath.), Ser. 21 (147G fath.), and Ser. 38 (2090 fath.), all which are in
remarkably close accordance with each other, we meet with a decided
change in the rate of decrease of temperature at equal intervals of depth ;
for whilst the average of the whole five gives a reduction of no more than
l°-6 between 250 and 500 fathoms (that is, 0°-6 per 100 fathoms), the
reduction between 500 and 750 fathoms is 5°-4, or at the rate of 2°-I per
100 fathoms;                 750 and 1000 fathoms it amounts to 3°-l,
                       while between
bringing down the temperature at the latter depth to an average of 380-G.
Though the rate of diminution of temperature then becomes slower, there
is stilln progressive decrease of temperature with increase of depth, the
total reduction between 1000 and 2090 fathoms being just 2°, so as to
bring down the temperature at the latter depth to 36°-3.
   114.     With       these Series the numerous fiotffom-temperatures taken in the
First and Second Cruises, and tabulated in Table III., are for the most part
in remarkably close accordance. This accordance is greatest at depths be
tween      1000 and 2435 fathoms ; the temperature at the last-mentioned depth
showing no reduction*      below that of the 2090 fathoms- sounding.       The
accordance     between the Serial and the Bottom-soundings is not so constant,
however, at smaller depths ; the temperature of the bottom being in several
instances from two to four degrees lower than that of the corresponding
stratum in the serial soundings.  Thus in No. 24, at a depth of only 109
fathoms, the bottom-temperature was 46°-5, or 4° below the ordinary tem
perature at that depth.          In No. 26,    of 345 fathoms, the bottom
                                                   at a depth
temperature was 4G°-7;    at least 2° below the average.   In No. 23 b, at
664    fathoms, the bottom-temperature was 41°-6, and in No. 12, at 670
fathoms, the bottom-temperature was 42°-G, being in the one case about
2|° and in the other about 1        below what might have been expected at
                                            J-°
those depths.     These differences suggest the hypothesis that variations                    in

 the same scale as the two preceding figures of the same kind (pp. 457, 458)
 enables the relation between Depth and Temperature in the Atlantic
Basin to be compared with the like relation in the Warm and Cold Areas
respectively. For the sake of convenience, the Surface-temperature is here
taken at 54°, this (as shown in Table III.) having been its average at those
Stations in which the " superheating" did not conspicuously manifest itself.
   116.          the rates of decrease of Temperature in successive
              When                                                                  strati
of this deep  Atlantic Basin are compared with those which have been                shown
to exist in the thinner strata of our comparatively shallow Cold area,              a very
remarkable relation presents itself, the Thermometric changes requiring in
the former case a much greater Bathymetric descent than in the latter, but
corresponding very closely with them when this allowance is made.         This
relation may be presented to the mind by ideally extending Diagram II. in
a vertical direction, so that its horizontal lines should be separated by four
times their interval.           It   has   been shown   (§ 98) that    in the   latter the
stratum of about       fathoms which lies below the superficial 50 shows
                         1 00
but a very slight decrease of temperature, presenting almost exactly the
same rate of descent as the stratum between similar depths in the
neighbouring Warm area.       Now with this 100 fathoms- stratum, a
stratum of about   500 fathoms beneath the superficial 100 in the deep
Atlantic       closely corresponds, the reduction down to 500 fathoms
               very
being at an extremely slow rate.   Between 150 and 300 fathoms in the
Cold area, however, the rate of reduction becomes very much greater;
and this is     just what presents itself in the Atlantic Basin between 500 and
1 000    fathoms    ; so that as in the Cold area we come     down at very little
below        300 fathoms upon a stratum of ice-cold water, so in the Atlantic
basin we come                   fathoms upon a stratum averaging 38c.6.
                      down at 1000
And further, as there is below this a slow progressive diminution of about
2° as we            through the lower 300 fathoms of the Cold area, so a
               descend
like progressive diminution is shown as we descend through the lower 1000
fathoms of the deep Atlantic Basin.
   11    The significance of these facts becomes yet more apparent, when the
        7.
varying rates of diminution of temperature in successive strata of the deep
Atlantic Basin are reduced to a curve (Diagram VI.), in the same manner as
the corresponding rates in successive strata of the Cold area ; but with a re
duction in the scale of depths in the former case, so as to make 500 fathoms
in the deep basin correspond with 150 in the comparatively shallow channel.
It is true that there is by no means the same absolute reduction in the
one case as in the other ; but this difference is just what would be antici
pated on the hypothesis we have     been advocating.   For if it be supposed
that the body of ice-cold water brought down from the Arctic basin by the
various Polar currents is discharged into the wide and deep Atlantic Basin,
it will tend to diffuse itself over its bottom, partly displacing and partly
mingling with the water which previously occupied                it,
                                                            so as to form                a
stratum of considerable thickness, which, while much colder than the

1869.  J      on the Scientific Exploration  of the Deep Sea.          471
water nearer the surface, has lost the extreme frigidity which characterizes
the current at a comparatively small depth when it comes fresh from the
Arctic basin. And just as the rapid descent of temperature between 150
and 300 fathoms in the Cold area may be taken to indicate that this is
 the stratum of intermixture between the warm superficial stream coming
from the Southward and the deep flow of ice-cold water coming from the
 Northward, so may the like rapid diminution between 500 and 1000 fathoms
in the Atlantic basin be taken as indicating that this is the stratum of in
 termixture between the great body of surface-water carrying a higher tem
 perature from the Equatorial towards the Polar regions, and the diluted

472                 Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson            [Nov.  18,
Polar    stream    which  seems to occupy all the deeper     parts of the basin to
within about 1000 fathoms          of the surface, and thus carries back Polar
water to the Equatorial area.
    118. These inferences are fully borne out by the Temperature-soundings
recently taken by Commander Chimmo, R.N., and Lieut. Johnson, R.N., at
various points of the North-Atlantic Basin ; for although the temperatures
of these Soundings were recorded by unprotected Thermometers, yet the
error to which the best of those instruments are subject from the effects of
pressure at different depths can now be estimated, and the requisite correc
tion applied to each observation, so as pretty certainly to give the true tempe
rature in each case within a degree.          These Soundings give a temperature
of about     39° at 1000 fathoms, which      is almost exactly accordant with the
average of our owu ; but the
                                    " stratum of intermixture," indicated by the
rapid   reduction   of  temperature with increase of depth, seems to lie rather
nearer the surface, the rapid reduction commencing at about 400 fathoms
instead of at about 500.          Below 1000 fathoms, at depths progressively
increasing to 2270 fathoms, the temperatures are in extraordinarily close
accordance with our own, the minimum,              however, apparently falling a
little lower. Thus at 2270 fathoms, the temperature recorded by an un
protected Casella thermometer was 44° ; but the estimated correction for
the instrument       at that depth being 9°, the real      temperature would     be
35°.
    119.    It has thus been shown that the hypothesis advanced       in our   pre
ceding Report, when worked out in connexion with the peculiar Geo
graphical relations of the Arctic to the North-Atlantic basin, goes far to
account for the two orders of phenomena which have now been examined,
namely    : —
    (I.) The    movement of    a vast  body of warm water, extending to a depth
of several hundred fathoms, in a north-east direction, which moderates the
cold of the Boreal area by bringing into it the warmth of that vast expanse
of the North-Atlantic Ocean which is heated beneath the Tropical sun.
    (II.) The existence of a flow of ice-cold water, at depths greater than
300 fathoms, in a south-west direction along the floor of the channel be
tween the North of Scotland and the Faroe Islands, which contributes,
with other frigid streams from the Arctic basin, to diffuse over the North-
Atlantic sea-bed, at depths greater than 1 000 fathoms, a Temperature below
39°, ranging downwards with increase of depth to about 35°.
    And it further appears : —
                        "                "
    (III.) That the Gulf-stream may be regarded as a kind of intensifi
cation of the ordinary flow of Surface-water from the Equatorial to the
Polar   area,   this intensification   beiug due to the peculiar local conditions
which produce an extraordinary          "superheating" of water in the Gulf of
Mexico, and the diffusion of this superheated water thence over a vast
proportion of the North-Atlantic area, raising its Surface-temperature by
several degrees.

     (IV.) That the Frigid stream which imparts to our Cold area, in the
latitude of the Shetland Islands, a Bottom-temperature below 30°, may in
like manner be considered as an intensification of the ordinary flow of deep
water from the Polar to the Equatorial area, this intensification being due
to the peculiar local conditions which limit the flow into the Atlantic basin
of the water that has been cooled in the Polar basin, and thus keep it from
intermixture          with warmer water, whilst, by the narrowing of its channel, it
is forced up nearer to the surface.
   (V.) That as the temperature of the Gulf-stream is reduced, and the
depth of its stratum diminished, the further it diffuses itself over the sur
face-water   of the Atlantic, so the temperature of the Frigid Stream                           is.

shown to prevail, not only over the deepest portion of the North-Atlantic
sea-bed, but throughout the enormous mass of water which lies below the
"stratum of intermixture"       117),  attributable solely, or even prin

perature of the deepest parts of the great Southern Ocean even        below that
of the North -Atlantic Sea-bed.         Now so far as onr present     knowledge
extends, both these inferences are in accordance with fact       ; for it  is well
known to Navigators that in all the Southern Oceans there is a perceptible
"set" of warm surface-water towards the Antarctic Pole (this "set" being
so decided in one part     of the Southern    Indian Ocean   as to be compared
by Capt. Maury to the Gulf-stream of the North Atlantic) ; and it b ob
vious that such a constant flow of surface-water cannot be maintained
without an equivalent flow of deeper water in the opposite direction. Of
the great depression of temperature which would be produced by such an
unrestricted spread of frigid water over the deeper parts of the Southern
Oceanic basins, indications are afforded by the deep Temperature-soundings
taken in Sir James C. Ross's Antarctic Expedition, the Voyage of the
'
  Venus,' &c.   ;  for when, as in several of these observations, the    indicated
Temperature was from 39° to 36° at depths greater than 1500 fathoms,            the
probable correction for pressure would reduce these to actual       temperatures
of from 32° to 29°, or even lower.
   1 22.  It would appear from the foregoing considerations that         the Tem
perature of the Deep Ocean will everywhere depend upon the amount of
Frigid water which can find its way from the Polar towards the Equatorial
area ; and that this will be mainly regulated by the Distribution of Land
and Water,     any    considerable alteration  in which   may produce a wide
spread general change of submarine climate over vast areas, besides modify-
ing, in the manner already pointed out (§ 105), the distribution of sub
marine climate over the parts of the Sea-bed traversed by special Polar or
Equatorinl Polar currents.        And thus great additional force is added to the
remark    made    in the 'Lightning' Report (p. 194) that a considerable
modification     of Submarine Climate might depend upon alterations in
the contour of the land, or on the level of the sea-bottom, at a greet
distance.    For when the South Polar basin was in great part shut in by
the Antarctic Continent which (as appears from Dr. Hooker's Botanies!
researches) must have formerly united South America, New Zealand, and
Australia, the Deep-sea temperature of the Southern Oceanic area generally
must have been higher by some degrees than we have reason to believe it to
be at present ; whilst, on the other hand, if there ever was a time when the
present North Pacific Area had a more free communication with the Arctic
Basin than the present narrow and shallow channel of Behring's Straits
affords, its Deep-sea temperature must have been lower by some degrees
than it is likely to be found at present.
   123. It is obvious that the distribution        of Submarine Climate must
exert  a most important influence on the distribution of Animal Life ; and
of such influence      the Deep-sea Dredgings     carried on in this Expedition
through a wide Geographical range have afforded most convincing evidence;
as will be fully set forth in the Second Part of this Report.          For many
species  of Mollusca, Crustacea, and Ecbinodermata previously supposed to

1869.]           on the Scientific Exploration    of the Deep Sea.           475
to be purely Arctic have been found to range southwards in deep water as
far as those dredgings extended — namely, to the northern extremity of the
Bay of Biscay ; and the considerations already urged render it highly pro
bable that an extension of the same mode of exploration would bring
them up from the abysses of even Intertropical seas, over which a simi
lar Climate prevails, and that an actual continuity may thus be found to
exist between     the Arctic and the Antarctic Faunae.         This idea was well
 put forth some years since by our excellent friend Prof. Loven of Stock
holm, in his discussion of the results of the deep-sea Dredgings executed
 by the Swedish Spitsbergen Expedition of 1861, under Torell.              "Con
sidering,"   he  says,
                       "  the power of endurance   in these lower marine animals,
and recollecting the facts that properly Arctic species which live also on
the coast of Europe, are generally found there at greater depths than in
their proper home, and that certain Antarctic species very closely agree
with Arctic species, the idea occurs that, while in our own seas and those
of warm climates, the surface, the coast-line,        and the lesser depths are
peopled   with   a rich and varied Fauna, there exists in the great Atlantic
depression, perhaps in all the abysses of our globe, and continued from
Pole to Pole, a Fauna of the same general character, thriving under severe
conditions, and approaching the surface where none but such exist, in the
coldest seas."      It had, moreover, been long previously suggested by Sir
James C. Ross, on the basis of observations made during his Antarctic
voyage ; for these observations had led him to believe that water of similar
temperature to that of the Arctic and Antarctic seas exists in the depths of
 the Equatorial Ocean, and that Arctic species may thus find their way to
 the Antarctic area, and vice versd, — The " similar temperature" believed
 by Sir James Ross to have had this general prevalence seems to have been
 39° ; whereas our observations distinctly prove that a temperature even be
low 30° may be conveyed by Polar streams far into the Temperate zone, and
 that the general temperature of the deepest part of the North-Atlantic
 sea-bed has more of a Polar character than he supposed.              Further, as
 there must have been deep seas at all Geological epochs, and as the Phy
 sical forces which    maintain   the Oceanic circulation     must have been in
 operation throughout, though modified in their local action by the parti
 cular distribution of land and water at each period, it is obvious that the
presence of Arctic types of animal life in any Marine formation can no
 longer be accepted as furnishing evidence per se of the general extension
 of Glacial action into Temperate or Tropical regions.
    1 24. Whilst the question of Deep-Sea Temperature is one of the greatest
 Biological   interest, its determination is of even greater importance to the
 Geologist, as affecting his interpretation of the phenomena on which his belief
in a former general prevalence of a Glacial climate is founded. For if a
 Glacial temperature should be found now to prevail, and types of Animal life
conformable thereto should prove to be diffused, over the deeper portion of
the existing sea-bed in all parts of the Globe, it is obvious that the same

476               Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson                   [Nov. 18,
may hare been the case at any Geological epoch ; for there must have
been deep seas in all periods, and the Physical forces which maintain the
Oceanic circulation at the present time must have been always in operation,
though modified in their local action by the distribution of land and water
existing at any particular date.         And as the elevation of the present deep
sca-bed of even the intertropical Oceanic area would (if we have correctly
interpreted the results of our own and others- observations) offer to the
study of the Geologist of the future a deposit characterized by the presence
of Polar types, so must the Geologist of the present hesitate in regarding
the occurrence     of Boreal types in any marine deposit          as adequate evidence
per   se of the general extension of Glacial action into Temperate or Tropical
regions.     At any rate, it may be considered as having been now placed
beyond     reasonable   doubt that a Glacial Submarine Climate may prevail
over any Area, without having any relation whatever to the Terrestrial
Climate of that Area *.
    125. Composition of Sea- Water. — A considerable number of samples
of Sea-water were collected in different localities and at different depths,
for the purpose of being submitted, on our return home, to the complete
analysis which Dr. Frankland had been kind enough to undertake.                    As the
quantities collected in the first two cruises, however, proved insufficient for
his special purpose — the determination of the quantity of Organic matter, —
a set   of Winchester    quart bottles was taken out in the Third cruise ; and
these were filled from surface- and from ioMom-waters in four localities, two ia
the Warm and two in the Cold area.             The important results of Dr. Frank-
land-s analyses    of these samples are given     in Appendix II. The differences
in Specific Gravity, and in the proportion of the-ordinary Saline constituents
(as indicated by that of the chlorine) are scarcely as great as might have
been anticipated    ;  but in so far as they extend, they are generally conform
able to the doctrine of Forchammer, that Polar water is more dilute than
Equatorial.      In particular it may be noted that the lowest Specific Gra
vity (1-0262), which coincided with a still lower proportion in the total of
Solid matter, presented itself in the waters taken from the Arctic stream
nearest its presumed source (§ 70).           But the most noTel and important
feature in these analyses is the large quantity of Organic Matter indicated
by them as universally present in the water of the open Ocean at great
distances from land and at all depths.              This has a direct bearing on a
question of the greatest Biological interest, — What is the source of Nutri
ment for the vast mass       of Animal life covering the abyssal Sea- bed?
    1 26. That Animals have no power of themselves            generating the Organic
Compounds which         serve   as the   materials   of their   bodies — and that      the
production of these materials from the carbonic acid, water, and ammonia

 of the Inorganic world, under the influence of Light, is the special attribute
of Vegetation — is a doctrine so generally accepted, that to call it in ques
tion would be esteemed a Physiological heresy. There is no difficulty in
accounting for the alimentation of the higher Animal types, with such an
unlimited supply of food as is afforded by the Globigerince and the Sponges
in the midst of which they live, and on which many of them are known to
feed. Given the Protozoa, everything else is explicable.       But the ques
tion returns, — On what do these Protozoa live ?
    127. The hypothesis has been advanced that the food of the abyssal
Protozoa is derived from Diatoms and other forms of minute Plants, which,
ordinarily living at or near the surface, may, by subsiding to the depths,
carry down to the animals of the sea-bed the supplies they require. Our
examination of the surface-waters, however, has afforded no evidence of the
existence of such Microphytic vegetation in quantity at all sufficient to
supply the vast demand ; and the most careful search in the Globigerina-
mnd has failed to bring to light more than a very small number of speci
mens of these Siliceous envelopes of Diatoms, which would most assuredly
have revealed themselves in abundance had these Protophytes served as a
principal component of the food of the Protozoa that have their dwelling-
place on the sea-bed. — Another hypothesis has been suggested, that these
Protozoa, which are so near the border of the Vegetable kingdom, may be
able, like Plants, to generate Organic Compounds for themselves, — manufac
turing their own food, so to speak, from Inorganic materials. But it is
scarcely conceivable that they could do this without the agency of Light ;
and, as it is obviously the want of that agency which excludes the possibi
lity of Vegetation in the abysses of the ocean, the same deficiency would
prevent Animals from carrying on the like process.
   128. A possible solution of this difficulty, first offered by Professor Wyville
Thomson in a Lecture delivered in the springof 1869, has received so remark
                                                 in the ' Porcupine

able   a   confirmation from the researches made                       expedi

marked, the distinctive character of the Protozoa, that        " they have no
special organs of nutrition, but that they absorb water through the whole
surface of their jelly-like bodies. Most of these animals secrete exquisitely
formed skeletons, sometimes of Lime, sometimes of Silica. There            no       is
doubt that they extract both of these substances from the Sea-water,
although Silica often exists there in quantity so small as to elude detec
tion by chemical tests. All Sea-water contains certain amount of Organic

intelligible that a world of animals should live in these dark abysses : but
it is a necessary condition that they should chiefly belong to a class capable
of being supported by absorption through the surface of matter in solution,
developing but little heat, and incurring a very small amount of waste by
any manifestation of vital activity.         According to this view, it seems highly
probable that at all periods of the earth-s history some form of the Pro
tozoa (Rhizopods, Sponges, or both) predominated over all other formi
of animal life in the depths of the Sea, whether spreading, compact, and
reef-like, as in the Lanrentian and Palaeozoic Eozoon, or in the form of
myriads of separate organisms, as in the Globigerince and FentriculiteseS

    129. During each Cruise of the Porcupine,- samples of Sea-water ob
tained from various depths, as well as from the surface, at stations far re
moved from land, were submitted to the Permanganate test after the method
of Prof. W. A. Miller, with an addition suggested by Dr. Angus Smith
for the purpose of distinguishing the Organic matter in a state of decom
position from that which is only decomposable ; with the result of showing
the uniform presence of an appreciable quantity of matter of the latter kind,
which, not having passed into a state of decomposition, may be assimilable
as food by animals, — being, in fact, Protoplasm in a state        of extreme dilution.
— Until,    therefore, any other more probable hypothesis shall have been
proposed, the sustenance of Animal life on the ocean-bottom at any depth
may be fairly accounted for on the supposition of Prof. Wyville Thomson,
that the Protozoic portion of that Fauna is nourished by direct absorption
from the dilute Protoplasm diffused through the whole mass of Oceanic
waters, just as it draws from the same mass the Mineral ingredients of the
skeletons it forms.        This diffused Protoplasm, however, must be continu
ally undergoing decomposition, and must be as continually renewed ; and
the source of that renewal must lie in the surface-life of Plants and Ani
mals, by which (as pointed out by Prof. Wyville Thomson) fresh supplies
of Organic matter must          be continually imparted to the Oceanic waters,
being    carried  down    even to  their greatest depths by that liquid diffusion
which was so admirably investigated by the late Professor Graham.
    130. The analysis of the Gases contained in Sea-water, collected not
only at the surface but from various depths beneath it, was systematically
carried on during the whole of the Expedition.                 The results cannot be
considered as entirely satisfactory ; since it is by no means certain that the
relative proportions of the gases obtained by boiliug water taken up from
great depths may not have been affected by the liberation of a portion of
these gases when the superincumbent pressure was removed.                     But they
will be found extremely suggestive, and seem to have a tolerably definite
relation to the Respiration of the Abyssal Fauna.            Referring to Appendix I.

      following as   the percentage proportions : — 25' 1 Oxygen, 54'2 Nitrogen, 20-7
      Carbonic Acid.       This proportion, however, was subject to great variations,
      as  will be  presently shown.     As a general rule, the proportion of Oxygen
      was   found to diminish, and that of Carbonic Acid to increase, with the
      depth, the results     of analyses of intermediate waters giving      a percentage
      of 22'0 Oxygen, 52'8 Nitrogen,         and 26-2 Carbonic      Acid; whilst the    re
      sults of analyses   of bottom- waters gave 19 -5 Oxygen, 52*6 Nitrogen, and
      27"9 Carbonic Acid.        But bottom-vf&ter at a comparatively small depth
     often contained as much Carbonic Acid and as little Oxygen as interme
     diate water at much greater depths ; and the proportion of Carbonic Acid
     to  Oxygen in bottom-water was found to bear a much closer relation to the
     abundance      of Animal life (especially of the more elevated types), as shown
     by the Dredge, than to its depth.          This was very strikingly shown in an
     instance    in which   analyses  were made    of the gases contained in samples of
     water collected at every 50 fathoms, from 400 fathoms to the bottom at
     862 fathoms, the percentage results being as follows : —
                                         750 fath.        800 fath.  Bottom, 862 fath.

        The    extraordinarily    augmented percentage of Carbonic Acid in the
    stratum of water here immediately overlying the Sea-bed was accompanied
    by a great abundance of Animal life.            On the other hand, the lowest per
   centage      of Carbonic Acid found in bottom-water (viz. 7*9) was accompanied
   by a
           " very    bad haul."     In several cases in which the depths were nearly
   the same, the analyst ventured a prediction as to the abundance, or other
   wise,   of Animal life, from the proportion of Carhonic Acid in the bottom-
   water    ;  and his prediction proved in every instance correct.
       131. It would appear probable, therefore, that the increase in the pro
   portion of Carbonic Acid, and the diminution in that of the Oxygen, in the
  abyssal waters of the Ocean, is due to the Respiratory process ; which is no
  less a necessary condition of the existence of Animal life on the sea-bed
 than is the presence of food-material for its sustenance.             And it is further
 obvious that the continued consumption of Oxygen and liberation of Car
 bonic Acid would soon render the stratum of water immediately above the
 bottom completely irrespirable (in the absence of any antagonistic process
of     Vegetation)      were  it not for the upward diffusion of the Carbonic Acid
 through, the intermediate waters to the surface, and the downward diffusion
of Oxygen from the surface to the depths below. A continual interchange
will take         place at the surface between the gases of the Sea-water and those
of the Atmosphere ; and thus the Respiration of the Abyssal Fauna is pro
vided for by a process of diffusion, which may have to operate through three
           or    more of intervening water.
                                                                         2 o 2

   132.  The varying proportions     of Carbonic  Acid and Oxygen in the
*ur/ace-waters are doubtless to be accounted for in part by the differences
in the amount and character of the Animal life existing beneath ; but a
comparison of the results of the analyses made during the agitation of the
surface by wind, with those made in calm weather, showed so decided a re
duction in the proportion of Carbonic Acid, with an increase in that of
Oxygen, under the former condition, as almost unequivocally to indicate
that superficial disturbance of the sea by Atmospheric movement is abso
lutely necessary for its purification from the noxious effects of Animal de
composition.     Of this view a most unexpected and remarkable confirmation
has been afforded by the following circumstance : — In one of the analyses
of Surface-water made during the Second cruise, the percentage of Carbonic
Acid fell  as low as 3-3, while that  of Oxygen rose as high as 3 7- I ; and
in a like analysis made during the Third cruise, the percentage of Carbonic
Acid was 5-6, while that of Oxygen was 45-3. As the results of every
other analysis of Surface-water were in marked contrast to these, it became
a question whether they should not he thrown out as erroneous ; until it
was recollected that whilst the samples of surface-water had been generally
taken up from the bow of the vessel, they had been drawn, in these two
instances, from abaft the paddles, and had thus been subjected to such a
violent agitation in contact with the Atmosphere as would preeminently
favour their thorough aeration. — Hence, then, it may be affirmed that
every disturbance of the Ocean-surface by Atmospheric movement, from
the gentlest ripple to the most tremendous storm-wave, contributes, in

depths ; doing, in fact, for the aeration of the fluids of their inhabitants
just what is done by the heaving and falling of the walls of our own chest
for the aeration of the blood which courses through our lungs.      A perpe
tual calm would be as fatal to their continued existence as the forcible
stoppage of all Respiratory movement would be to our own ; and thus
universal stagnation would become universal death.

I. — Summary of the     Results  of the Examination of Samples of Sea-water
      taken at the Surface and at Various Depths.         By Wm. Lant Car
      penter, B.A., B.Sc.
                     — Care was taken to obtain these samples as pure
    Surface-waters.
as possible, and free from any contamination caused by matters de
rived from the vessel, by dipping them up in clean vessels at a few inches
below the surface    at or near the bow of the ship.    In two instances, how
ever, the samples were taken from abaft the paddles.
    Waters taken at depths below the surface. — It was found desirable to
coat the brass Water-Bottles (§ 19) internally with sealing-wax varnish,
owing to the corrosive action of the sea-water.        The apparatus was then
found to work perfectly satisfactorily in all cases in which there was suffi
cient weight on the Sounding-line to which they were attached to keep the
bottles perpendicular, or nearly so.     When, from the smallness of the at
tached weight, or the roughness of the sea, the sounding-line was at an acute
angle with the general level of the sea-surface while it was being drawn up,
the results of the examination of water thus obtained rendered it highly
probable that some water at or near the surface         had found its way into
the bottle, and that its contents were not to be relied on as coming from
the lowest depths.
   When Bottom-water was obtained from depths beyond 500 fathoms,
it was almost invariably charged with a quantity of very fine mud in sus
pension, rendering it quite turbid.      Many hours- standing was necessary
for the deposit of this ; but it was readily removed by filtration.      In no
instance was there any evidence of water from great depths being much
more highly charged with dissolved gases than Surface-waters ; a consider
able elevation of temperature being in all cases necessary for the evolution
of any dissolved gas.
   Mode of Examining Samples. — The samples of water thus taken were
examined with as little delay as possible, with a view to determine : —
   (1) The Specific Gravity of the water.
   (2) The total quantity of dissolved Gases contained in them, and the re
          lative proportions of Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Carbonic Acid.
   (3) The quantity of Oxygen necessary to oxidize the Organic matter
          contained in the water ; distinguishing between
             a, the decomposed    organic matter, and
             b, the easily decomposable   organic matter.
   (1) The Specific-Gravity     determinations were made at   a temperature as
near 60° Fahr. as    possible, with delicate glass Hydrometers, so graduated
that the Specific gravity could be read off directly to the fourth decimal
place with ease.
   (2) The apparatus for the analysis of the Gases dissolved in the sea-
water was essentially that described by Prof. Miller in the second volume

                     Messrs. Carpenter, Jeffreys, and Thomson                                [Nov. 18,

of his             of Chemistry.-                         was    found necessary to make             se
veral modifications in   to adapt it,            it   to the motion of the vessel.               These
consisted chiefly in suspending much of   from the cabin-ceiling, instead
                                                            it
of supporting     from beneath, and in rendering all the parts less rigid
                     it
by   a    free use   of caoutchouc tubing, &c., the utmost                     care    being taken      to
keep all     joints tight.
     It   was found possible to make             correct analyses,         even       when the vessel
was rolling sufficiently to upset chairs and cabin-furniture.
  The method of Analysis may be thus summarized — From 700 to 800          :
cubic centimetres of the sample to be examined were boiled for about 30
minutes, in such     way that the steam and mixed gases evolved were col
                          a
lected over mercury in     small graduated Bunsen-s Gas-holder, all access
                                  a
of air being carefully guarded against. The mixed gases were then trans
ferred to two graduated tubes in      mercurial trough, where the Carbonic
                                                 a
Acid                        strong solution of caustic potash
          was first absorbed by         a                        and subse              ;
quently the Oxygen  was  absorbed by the  addition of  pyrogallic acid, the
remaining gas being assumed to be Nitrogen.
  The results of the analyses were always corrected.to the standard Tem
perature of 0° Cent., and to 760 millimetres Barometric pressure, for com
parison among themselves and with others.     In nearly every case the du
plicate analyses from the same gaseous mixture agreed closely,   they were                  if
not identical.
    (3) The examination of the Sea-water for Organic matter was made ac
cording to the method detailed by Prof. Miller in the Journal of the Che
mical Society for May 1865, with an addition suggested by Dr. Angus
Smith. Each sample of water was divided into two; to one of these                                       a
little free acid was added, and to both an excess of standard solution of a
Permanganate of potash.      At the end of three hours the reaction was
stopped by the addition of Iodide of potassium and Starch, and the excess
of Permanganate estimated         standard solution of Hyposulphite of soda.
                                        by   a
The portion to which free acid was added gave the Oxygen required to
oxidize the decomposed and easily decomposable organic matter; the second
portion gave the oxygen required by the decomposed organic matter alone,
which was usually from about one-half to one-third of the whole.

   Specific Gravity. —The Specific Gravity of Surface-water was found to
 diminish slightly as land was approached ; but the average of 32 observa
tions upon water         at a sufficient distance from land to be unaffected by local
disturbances was         1   -02/79, the maximum being l-0284
                                      and the minimum          ....    1 -0270.
   It was almost        always noticed that, during a high wind, the specific gravity
of surface-water        was above the average.
    The   average     of 30 observations upon the Specific Gravity of Interme
diate water was                                    1   0275,
the maximum being                                  1-0281,
and the minimum                                    1-0272.
  The Specific Gravity of Bottom-waters at depths varying from                                     77 to
2090 fathoms, deduced from an average of 43 observations, was
                                                   1-0277,
the maximum being.             . ,                 1   0283,
and the minimum                                    1-0267.
   It   will    be noticed    the average Specific Gravity of Bottom-water
                               that
is slightly less than that of Surface-water. In several instances the Specific
 Gravities of Surface- and of Bottom-waters taken at the same place having
 been compared, that of the Bottom-water was found to be appreciably less
than that of the Surface-water.                Thus
                At   1425 fathoms depth            (Station    17)    it   was   . .   1-0269
                Surface at the same                                                    1   -0280
And
                At  664 fathoms depth (Station 26 b)                  it   was   . .   l-0272
                Surface at the same                                                    1-0280
   According,        however,        to a Series       of observations       made at the same spot
(Station 42) at intervals of 50 fathoms, from 50 to 800, the Specific Gra
vity increased with the depth from 1 0272 at 50 fathoms to 1-0277 at
800 fathoms*.
   Several series of Sp.-Ur. observations were made near the mouths of
rivers and streams ; showing the gradual mixture of fresh and salt water,
and the floating of lighter portions above the denser sea-water, as well as
the reverse effect produced by the influence of tidal currents.  Thus out
side Belfast Lough a rapid stream of water of Sp. Gr. 1-0270 was found
above water which at a depth of 73 fathoms had a Sp. Gr. of 1-0265.
    Gases of Sea- water. — The analyses of the Gaseous constituents of sea-
water may be divided into two groups: (1) Analyses of Surface-waters.
(2) Analyses of waters below the surface ; and these last may be again
subdivided into (a) Intermediate, and (6) Bottom-waters.
   The total quantity of dissolved gases in sea-water, whether at the surface
or below    was found to average about 2-8 volumes in 100 volumes of water.

    It will be seen from this that while the quantity of Nitrogen is only
 1-97 per cent, less than in surface-water, the quantity of Oxygen is dimi
nished by 4-48 per cent., and the quantity of Carbonic acid increased by
6-45 per cent. This difference is greater                 if Bottom-waters         only are com

   The two Series of analyses, before referred              to, performed duringthe Second
 cruise upon Intermediate waters at successive depths over the same spot
 both show a regular increase of the Carbonic acid, and diminution of theOxy-
gen, as the depth increases, the percentage of Nitrogen varying but slightly.
    These general results appear to show that the Oxygen diminishes and
the Carbonic acid increases with the depth until the bottom is reached ;
 but that at the bottom, whatever the depth from the surface, the propor
tions of Carbonic acid and of Oxygen do not conform to this law, Bottom-
 water at   a comparatively small depth often containing as much carbonic
acid and as little oxygen as Intermediate water at a greater depth.                               No
instance occurred during the first two Cruises in which (where samples of
surface and intermediate or bottom-waters were taken at the same place)
the quantity of Carbonic acid was less and of Oxygen greater than at the
surface   ; the only exception occurred in the Third cruise, at a place where,
it is believed,  currents of water were meeting.
    It was frequently noticed that a large percentage of Carbonic acid in
Bottom-water was accompanied by an abundance of Animal life, as shown
by the   dredge   ; and that where the dredge-results were barren, the quantity
of Carbonic acid     was much smaller.             The greatest percentage of Carbonic
acid ever found was accompanied by an abundance of life ; while at a short
distance (62 fathoms) above the bottom, the proportion of Carbonic acid
was conformable to the law of variation with depth before referred to :
                               Bottom, 862       Cms.         800 fms.             750 fms.

   The lowest percentage of Carbonic acid (7-93) ever found in Bottom-
water, occurring at a depth of 362 fathoms, was accompanied by a " very
bad haul."

   In crossing the wide channel from theN.W. of Ireland towards Bockall,
where the water for some distance is over 1 000 fathoms depth, so that the
other circumstances varied very little, if at all, the proportion of Carbonic
acid appeared to vary with the dredge-results ; so that the analyst ventured
to predict whether the collection would be good or not before the dredge
came to the surface — drawing his inference from the results                         of his    analyses

     In the   analyses      made of the water in the Cold Area, and generally in
the Third cruise,          there appears, as might be expected from the various
currents      &c.,   a   greater variation in the results than in the other series.
In  the Bottom and Intermediate waters the Nitrogen appears to be rather
in excess of the average, and the Carbonic acid has a large range of varia
tion — from 7-58 per cent, at Station 47       fathoms, Temp. 43°-8) to
                                                             (540
45-79 per cent, at Station 52(384 fathoms, 30°-6 Fahr.).                             The     average of
the Surface-waters is much the same as in the other parts                           of the cruise.
     It
     may be worth notice that in localities where the greatest depth did
not exceed 150 fathoms, the results of the gas-analysis of Bottom and
Surface-water were frequently so nearly the same, whatever the amount of
Animal life on the bottom, as to lead to the supposition that there might
be at that limit a sufficient circulation, either of the particles of the water
itself or of the     gases dissolved in         it,   to keep the gaseous       constitution alike
throughout.   The coincidence of this depth with the extreme depth at
which Fish are usually found to exist in these seas suggestive.        is
     Organic matter.       — With
                            view to test the method of analysis by Per
                                       a
manganate of potash, two or three series of analyses were made where fresh
and salt water mixed together, as in Killibegs Harbour, Donegal Bay, &c.                                ;
and the results in all cases justified the expectation formed, that the amount
of permanganate was an index of the comparative purity of the water, both
as regards the "decomposed" and the "decomposable" organic matter.
   Disregarding the above series,  total of 134 experiments were made

    These figures appear to show (1) that Intermediate waters are more free
from Organic contamination than either Surface- or Bottom-waters, as
might be expected from the comparative absence of animal life in these
waters ; (2) that the total absence of Organic matter is least frequent in
Bottom-waters, and most frequent in Intermediate waters, Surface-waters
occupying a middle place in this respect ; and (3) that there is not much
difference between Bottom- and Surface-waters, either in the total quantity
of Organic contamination or in the relative proportions of the " decom
        " and "
posed              easily decomposable"    organic matter.
    It may be worth notice that when the Bottom- water from great depths
was muddy, tests made before and after filtration showed that some of the
Organic matter was removed by this operation.

     Dear Dr. Carpenter, — Herewith                  I    enclose results of analyses of
the samples of sea-water       collected during                                    '
                                                          your recent cruise in the Por
cupine.'
  I shall not attempt to draw any general conclusions from these results                           ;
your own intimate knowledge of the circumstances under which the differ
ent samples were collected will enable you to do this much better than I.
  There     is,
           however, one point which      highly remarkable and to which
                                                is                                           I
would draw your attention       the large amount of very highly nitroge-
                                ;   it   is
nized Organic matter contained in most of the samples, as shown by the
determinations of organic Carbon and organic Nitrogen, and the proportion
of organic Carbon to organic Nitrogen.  For the purposes of comparison,                       I
have appended the results       of   analyses    of Thames-water           and   of the   water
of Loch Katrine, the former representing probably about       fair average   a
of the proportion of oTganic nitrogen reaching the sea   in the rivers of
this country, but being presumably considerably greater than that con
tributed by rivers in other parts of the world.  If this be so, follows              it
either that   soluble nitrogenous organic matter                 is
                                                     being generated from
inorganic    materials in the sea, or that this matter                is
                                                          undergoing con
centration by the evaporation of the ocean, —the rivers and streams con
tinually furnishing additional quantities whilst the water evaporated takes
none away.
   The amounts of Carbonate of Lime given in the Table are obtained                            by
adding the number     (representing the solubility of carbonate of lime in
                         3
pure water) to the temporary hardness which denotes the carbonate of lime
thrown down on boiling.    As the determination of temporary hardness                         in
water containing so much saline matter  not very accurate, the numbers
                                                     is
in the columns headed  " temporary hardness
                                            " and " carbonate of lime "
must only be regarded as rough approximations to the truth    moreover,          ;
a small proportion of carbonate of            magnesia      is   mixed with the carbonate
of lime and estimated with it.
    In all their peculiar features    these analytical results agree with those
which  I    have    previously obtained from numerous samples of sea-water
collected   by    myself off Worthing and Hastings.
                                                           Yours very truly,

           of the  -
                     Porcupine     in 1869.   By David Fobbes, F.R.S.
        Atlantic Mud contained in       a small bottle marked    " Soundings
                              No. 20,   1443  fathoms."
    A  complete analysis of this sample shows its Chemical Composition             to
be as follows   : —
            Carbonate of lime                                       50- 1 2
            Alumina     *("  soluble in acids  ")                    1-33
            Sesquioxide of iron ("soluble in acids")      ....       2-17
            Silica (in a soluble condition)                          5-04
            Fine insoluble gritty sand (rock debris)      ....      26-77
            Water                                                    290
            Organic matter                                           4-19
            Chloride of sodium and other soluble salts       . .     7-48
                                                                  10000
    If we compare the chemical composition as above with that of ordinary
Chalk, which consists all but entirely of carbonate of lime, and seldom
contains more than from 2 to 4 per cento of foreign matter (clay, silica,
&c.), it will be seen that it differs chiefly in containing so very large an
amount of rock-matter in a fine state of division.            If we subtract the
water, organic matter, and marine salts, which would probably in greatest
part be removed before such mud could in process of ages be converted
into solid rock, even then the amount of carbonate of lime or pure chalk
would not be more than at highest some 60 per cent, of the mass.
    As such deposits must naturally be expected to vary greatly in me
chanical character nnd chemical composition, it would be premature to
generalize as to the actual nature of the deposits now in course of forma
tion in the depths of the Atlantic, before a careful examination had been
made of a series of such specimens from different localities.           The soluble
silica is principally from siliceous organisms.
    [Mr. Hunter-s analysis of the Atlantic Mud brought up from the             2435
fathoms- dredging, will be found in p. 428].
    As regards the probable origin of the pebbles and gravel found in the
various dredgings, it will be at once seen, from the description, that they
consist principally of fragments of volcanic rocks and crystalline schists.
The former of these have in all probability come from Iceland or Jan
Mayen ; whilst the latter, associated as they are with small fragments of
grey and somewhat altered calcareous rock, would appear to have pro
ceeded from the north-west coast of Ireland, where the rocks are quite
identical in mineral character.        The north of Scotland and its islands also
contain similar rocks ; but without being at all positive on this head, I am

 1869.]           on the   Scientific Exploration of the Deep Sea.                491
 rather inclined to the opinion that they have been derived from Ireland,
 and not necessarily connected with any glacial phenomena, believing that
 their presence may be accounted for by the ordinary action of marine
 currents.
                   " Pebbles from     1215 fathoms      (Station 28)."
     The  stones were all subangular, the edges being all more or less worn         or
 altogether rounded off.         The specimens were 38 in number, and upon
 examination were found to consist of : —
   5  Hornblende     schist ; the largest of these (which also was the largest in
       size  of the entire series) weighed 421 gr. (g of an ounce), was ex
       tremely compact, and was composed of black hornblende, dirty-
       coloured quartz, and some garnet.
  2 Mica schist ; quartz with mica, the largest weighing 20 grains.
  5 Grey pretty compact limestone, the largest being 7 grains in weight-
  2 Fragments (showing the cleavage faces rounded off on edges) of ortho
       clase (potash felspar), evidently derived from granite ; the largest         of
       the two fragments weighed 15 grains.
  5 Quartz, milky in colour or colourless           ;  the largest of these weighed
       90| grains, and showed         evidence   of having been derived from the
       quartz-veins so common       in clay-slate.
 19 Fragments      of true volcanic lava, most of which         were   very light and
—      scoriaceous (vesicular), although       some small oues were compact and
38     crystalline  ; and in these     the minerals augite, olivine, and glassy
       felspar (Sanadine) could be distinctly recognized.              Amongst these
       were fragments      of trachytic trachydoleritic, and pyroxenic (basaltic)
       lavas,  quite similar to those of Iceland or Jan Mayen of the present
       period, from which they had probably been derived.
                    "Gravel from 1443 fathoms (Station 20)."
    This sample of gravel consisted of 718 subangular fragments, in genera)
not above from | to | grain in weight, with occasionally some of a littla
greater size ; but the most considerable of all (a fragment of mica schist)
only weighed 3 grains. They consisted of : —
     3 Fragments of orthoclase felspar.
    4 Bituminous      or carbonaceous    shale (? if not  accidental).
     5 Fragments     of shell (undistinguishable     species).
     4 Granite, containing quartz, orthoclase, and muscovite.
  15 Grey compact limestone.
  62 Quartzose mica schist.
317 Hornblende schist; sometimes containing garnets.
273 Quartzite fragments, with a very few fragments of clear quartz j the
          majority of the pieces being of a dirty colour, often cemented
          together, were evidently the débris of quartzite rocks or beds of
          indurated sandstone,     and not from granite.
  28 Black compact         rock   containing augite, most probably          a volcanic
          basalt.
718

492               On the Scientific Exploration      of the Deep   Sea.
                          " From   12G3 fathoms (Station    22)."
     A single   rounded pebble, weighing 18 grains, chiefly quartz, with a little
of   a  black mineral hornblende or tourmaline, probably from a metamorphk
schist.
                    "  Gravel from 1366 fathoms (Station 19a)."
     Consisted of    5 1  small subangular pieces of rock, all less than   \ grain   in
weight, excepting only one fragment (angular) of quartz, which               weighed
2 grains ; they consisted of : —
19    Fragments of quartz, all of which appeared to have proceeded          from    tk
          disintegration of crystalline schists, and not from granite.
   9  Hornblende      schist.
   8   Mica schist.
   7 Loose, dirty-white tufaceous limestone.
   3 Small fragments of augite or tourmaline (? which).
   1 Fragment of quartz, with tourmaline.
   4 Fragments      of indistinct and uncertain character.
51
                     "  Gravel from 1476 fathoms (Station       21)."
     Six small subangular fragments, the largest of which             did not   exceed
two grains in weight ; they were respectively : —
 1 Yellow quartz.
 1 Quartzose chlorite schist.
 3   Mica schist.
 1   Small fragment, apparently        of volcanic lava.
 6
     The   specimen     from Rockall is not   a fragment  of any normal   rock, but     is
only a breccinform aggregate, principally consisting of quartz, felspar, and
 crystals of green hornblende, held together by a siliceous cement.               It has
 evidently     been  broken    from  the projecting edge   of a fault or vein  fissure    ;
 and although it cannot settle the matter definitely as to what rocks this
 islet may really be composed of, it would indicate that it most probably u
 a mass of hornblendic gneiss or schist, and certainly not of true volcanic
origin.       I may mention that it does not at all resemble any of the frag
ments found in the deep-sea dredgiugs which             I have as yet examined.

Parkinson, Capt. R. M. Parsons, Dr. W. H. Ransom, Mr. R. H. Scott, Dr.
A.    Voelcker, and Dr. S. Wilks were admitted into the Society.
     The following communications        were read   :   —
 I. " On Compounds Isomeric with the Cyanuric Ethers." By A.
  W. Hofmann and Otto Olshausen. Received April 29, 1870.
   Some time ago M. Cloez* described a remarkable body, which has the
composition but none of the properties of ethylic cyanurate.     This sub
stance, which he called cyanetholine, is distinguished from cyanuric ether
by its behaviour with alkalies, which, according to the observations of
Cloez, evolve from it ammonia and not ethylamine. Cyanetholine, accord
ing to Cloez, combines with acids, forming crystallizable salts, none of
which, however, up to the present time, has been more carefully investi
gated.  It is rather strange how little the attention of chemists has been
directed to this interesting compound.     M. Cloez contented himself with
the discovery of cyanetholine  and establishing its composition, but has not
again reverted to the subject.  Of the researches of other chemists who
have touched upon cyanetholine, the only ones known to us are the few
but rather important experiments of M. Gal f. According to his obser
vations, cyanetholine is changed by treatment with potash solution into
potassium cyanide and alcohol, and by the action of hydrochloric acid into
cyanuric acid and ethylic chloride ; and Gal and Cloez, in consequence of
these reactions, are of opinion that cyanetholine is the true ether of cya
nuric acid constructed upon the water type —

whilst the earlier known ethylic cyanate of M. Wiirtz corresponds to the
ammonia type —

     It   need scarcely be mentioned how completely this view has been  con
firmed      the subsequent discovery of the isonitriles and of the series of
            by
mustard oils isomeric with the sulphocyanic ethers.
  The formation of cyanetholine, which, as      known,   isobtained bv the

494                Messrs. Hofmann and Olshausen on Compound/ [June                                     16,
between this body and the ethylcyanamide, discovered     Messrs. Cahours            by
and Cloez*, which    formed by treating thy lam in
                              is                    with chloride

 monia causes in the one case the formation of ethylic cyanate, and      the                       in
.other that of ethylcyanamide.   The  close analogy   between   cyanetholine
 and ethylcyanamide, which                  is,
                               perhaps, best represented      the formulae               by
                             CN(C3     H,)0           and           CN(C3 H5)HN,
cannot possibly be doubted, and accordingly the easy polymerization                                       of
ethylcyanamide, which     readily converted into triethylmelamine, natu

rally raised the question as to whether cyanetholine could not be poly
merized, in    similar manner in other words, whether there might noi
                   a                        ;
exist   a   series                              known cyanuric
                       of combinations isomeric with                the                       ethers.
    The experiments undertaken for the solution of this question                              have beta
performed in the methyl-, ethyl-, amyl-, and phenyl-series.
  We begin the communication of our observations by description                     a                of the
experiments made in the methyl-series    for although in the first instance

and the excess of methyl alcohol then distilled off,      brown oil remans         a
behind, similar to that which Cloez obtained by the corresponding experi
ment in the ethyl-series, and which he described as cyanetholine. This
oil sometimes           remains fluid for
                                       long time, but generally solidifies aa

difference of their solubility in ether, which dissolves the needles and leaves
the rhombic tables behind.

   Methylie Cyanurate. —When the ether which has been poured off the
crystals is evaporated, a crystalline mass is left, which may be recrystallized
from alcohol, or, better, from hot water. The needles thus obtained possess
the characters of a pure substance. Determination of the carbon, hydrogen,
and nitrogen, the latter of which can easily be weighed as ammonia, yields
as the simplest atomic expression for this body the formula

but it only required a somewhat closer examination to prove that this is
not the methylie cyanate but the methylie cyanurate, not the mono-
molecular but the trimolecular combination.            The melting-point of the
crystals    is 132°,  the  boiling-point (we  were  only in possession of a mode
rate quantity) between 160° and 170°.             These properties unmistakably
characterize    the trimolecular compound, the cyanurate.
   It   would have, nevertheless, been desirable experimentally          to confirm
these indications by the vapour-density determination ; but this was pre
vented by a peculiar comportment of the new body, which, however, fur
nished evidence almost as conclusive as the vapour-density for the molecular
weight of the compound.           When the new cyanurate is heated in a retort,
it  distils without    leaving an appreciable residue, the distillate solidifying
to a white crystalline mass.          But these crystals are no longer the un
changed body ;      their  melting-point has risen from 132° to 175°, and their
crystalline form is entirely changed ; in the place of fine       needles we have
now short, thick prisms with sharply defined summits.             It  is easily per
ceived that the new cyanuric ether, by an atomic migration               within the

of ammonia on the    new methylic cyanurate ; but it is not easy to obtain
it pure by this means, as the reaction generally goes further, and a mix
ture of substances is produced, the separation of which we have not
hitherto been able to effect.   The compound in question, however, is
always formed in larger or smaller quantity as a by-product in the pre
paration of the trimethylic cyanurate ; it                       is,
                                           in fact, the substance insoluble

action    of ammonia.        They have not yet been investigated, but it has been
ascertained      that methyl alcohol is liberated, as might have been expected.
     Finally,   as regards the formation of the amido-ether by the action of
chloride of      cyanogen upon sodium methylate, this is obviously due to the
presence of traces of water, which could scarcely be avoided in this process.
Water causes first the formation of hydrochloric and cyanic acids, the
latter of which splits up into carbonic acid and ammonia ; ammonia and
methylic cyanurate coming together in the nascent state form methyl
alcohol and the amido-ether.
     In fact the common salt which separates during the reaction contains
a considerable quantity of cyanate and carbonate.
                            Experiments in the Ethyl-series.
     Our first experiments were conducted in this series, and we have ac
tually worked more in it than in the methyl group.              We have, however,
not yet been able to obtain the ethylic cyanurate in a pure state ; on the
other hand, we have succeeded in obtaining the ethers of both amidic
acids.
     The action of chloride of cyanogen upon sodium ethylate present the same
 phenomena as the analogous treatment of the methylate, and which more
 over have been well described by      M. Cloez. We      have sometimes obtained at
 once a solid body     ;  but generally there is formed an oil, which after some
 time deposits crystals, the quantity of which in different operations varies
 exceedingly. The idea naturally suggested itself that they were the trimole-
 cular modification of cyanetholine     ;  but analysis showed that these crystals,
 in spite of their beauty, were but       a mixture containing the desired cyanu
 rate,   when at all, only in small quantity.          They contain, as numerous
 analyses have proved, the ethylie ethers of the two amidic acids, the sepa
 ration of which has cost indeed very considerable trouble.
     Diethylic Amido-cyanurate. — By treatment with animal charcoal and
 numerous      recrystallizations of considerable quantities of the crystals ob
 tained from the crude cyanetholine, we succeeded in obtaining thin white
 prismatic crystals melting at 97° ; this melting-point remained unchanged
 after several recrystallizations from water, a sign of the purity          of the
 substance.      The same body was obtained when crude cyanetholine was
  heated   for  some   hours with aqueous ammonia in a sealed tube.           The
  digestion,  however,   must not be carried too far, as then other products are
  formed, amongst these an amorphous substance quite insoluble in water.
     The analysis of the crystals, which are soluble both in alcohol and ether,
  especially when warm, has proved them to be the ethylic compound corre
  sponding to amido-ether      of the methyl   series, having the composition

be the ethylic diamido-cyanurate,      —

been analyzed.
                           Experiments   in  the AmyUseries.
    Up to the present time we have only worked qualitatively in this series.
The product of the action of chloride of cyanogen on sodium amylate is
 oily ; it distils at about 200°, but not, as it would appear, without being
thoroughly altered.        The last portions of the distillate solidify to a mass
of white lustrous crystals, which can easily be obtained pure by solution
and recrystallization.       "We are inclined to consider this substance as
amylic cyanurate, but        at present we have no numbers           to confirm      this
opinion.
                          Experiments  in  the Phenyl-series.
    Lastly,   we may here mention some experiments which were made in the
 phenyl-series.     Chloride of cyanogen acts with the same energy upon
sodium phenylate (which in this case was dissolved in absolute alcohol) as
 on the other sodium compounds. The solution poured off from the common
 salt which had separated gave, on the addition of water, an oil heavier than
 water, which was submitted to distillation.         What first came over was almost
 pure phenol ; the distillation was interrupted as soon as a drop of the
 residue solidified to a crystalline mass.         The residue in the retort was then
 mixed with cold alcohol, thrown on        a  filter and washed for some time with
 the same liquid. The white crystalline mass thus obtained was then re-
 crystallized from a very large quantity of boiling alcohol.               When the
 solution was allowed to cool slowly, long thin needles separated which were
 almost insoluble in alcohol and ether, but were found            to dissolve, though
 sparingly, in benzol.

     The latter, which must now be regarded as the phenylic isocyanurate,
is easily distinguished from the new cyanurate, both by its crystalline
form and behaviour with solvents.             It has yet to be determined whether
the phenyl compound,           like the methyl one, is changed under the influence
of heat into the cyanurate already known.

     When a cold saturated alcoholic solution of this body is mixed with
 an alcoholic solution of iodine, the latter is immediately decolorized with
 separation      of sulphur.      If  the addition of iodine solution be continued
 until even after      a  short boiling free iodine remains, which can readily be
 detected by starch-paste, the solution filtered from the sulphur, and poured
 into water, solidifies to a mass of white interlaced needles, which can rea
 dily be freed from adhering hydriodic           acid by washing with cold water.
      This substance can be obtained pure by repeated crystallization from

the sulphur, however, offers no difficulty when the vapour of the coin-
pound is passed over a red-hot mixture of nitre and sodium carbonate.
    The careful analysis of the new crystals leads to the formula
                                     CuH10N2S.
They    are consequently derived from two molecules        of thiobenzamide from
which one atom of sulphur and four atoms of hydrogen have been removed,
the latter in the form of hydriodic acid,
                   2C, H7NS + 2II=CuH10NgS+4HI + S.
 Chlorine, bromine, and moderately diluted nitric acid act upon thiobenia-
mide in the same way as iodine.            These reagents, however, are not to be
 recommended for the preparation of the new compound, as the action
easily goes too far, causing the formation of chlorinated, brominated, and
nitro-products, which contaminate the normal compound.                  Iu fact, Mr.
 Richard Dunklenberg, whilst studying thiobenzamide last summer in the
Berlin Laboratory, has had already in his hands the new sulphuretted
compound ; hut as he employed bromine for its preparation, the substance
was obtained in a less pure state,          and consequently he did not succeed
in interpreting the reaction.
    With regard to the constitution of the new body, it may be considered
as   consisting of two molecules of benzonitrile, which are held together
directly by the sulphur.        Different views may be taken of the arrange
ment of the atoms in the molecule.             Probably the carbon atoms outside
the phenyl group are joined together by the sulphur ; and there is
then also connexion between the nitrogen atoms.            This latter supposition
 is strengthened by the behaviour of the crystals with nascent hydrogen,
 described below.      But I will not go further into this question at present,
 since  the  prosecution of the new reaction in other series promises to yield
further experimental data for a profitable discussion of the subject. For
the same reason,     I  refrain at present from proposing a name for the new
sulphur-compound.
    The stability of this    substance    is remarkable.   It can be heated for a
 long time to 150° in        sealed  tubes    with hydrochloric   acid, dilute sul
 phuric acid, and even moderately strong nitric acid, without undergoing
 decomposition.      It dissolves in concentrated sulphuric acid by the aid of
 a gentle heat, and the addition of water precipitates it again unchanged.
 The compound      is decomposed       rather more readily by alkalies, although,
 as already mentioned, it is necessary, even in this case, to boil for days.
 In this case benzoic acid is reproduced with slow evolution           if ammonia.
 Evidently   the sulphur    here first separates from the molecule, and is dis

 solved in the ordinary manner by the alkali ; the benzonitrile set free at
 the same time yields ammonia and benzoic acid. The separated acid,
 which was recognized as benzoic acid by the sparing solubility of its sodium
salt,   was further    identified by  a determination of its melting-point and an
analysis of the silver salt.        The sulphur-compound suffers a very interest
ing change by the action of nascent hydrogen. I have already * called
attention to the fact how much more readily the thioamides are converted
into the corresponding amine bases than the nitriles. This experience
has again been verified in the new body. When its alcoholic solution is
decomposed by zinc and hydrochloric acid, sulphuretted hydrogen is
evolved in abundance. After ten or twelve hours the total decomposition
of the sulphur-compound is recognized by the addition of water no longer
producing any precipitate in the alcoholic solution. The new product is
collected and purified by a process repeatedly proved to be successful ; the
addition of an excess of alkali until the zinc hydrate at first thrown down
is redissolved leaves the base in the supernatant alcoholic layer. After
evaporation of the alcohol, the base still containing fixed alkali is dis
solved in ether, and withdrawn from this by hydrochloric acid, whereby a
small quantity of brown resin is separated and remains dissolved in the
ether. On evaporating the hydrochloric solution on the water-bath, the
hydrochlorate of the base is left behind as an oil, which in a short time
solidifies to a mass of indistinct crystals.         When the aqueous solution of
this salt is decomposed by ammonia, oily drops immediately separate and
sink to the bottom ; in the course of a day these solidify to a crystalline
mass, the supernatant fluid being filled with iridescent plates.
    The analysis of the hydrochlorate, purified by recrystallization from
water, and dried at 100°, which it can be without change, leads to the
formula
                           CuHuN,Ca = CuHuN„HCa,
which     was  satisfactorily confirmed by a determination of the crystalline
platinum    salt  dried at 100°, containing
                   Ca5 H30  N. PtCl, = 2(CM Hu N„ HC1), PtCl4.
    In the formation of the above-mentioned          base 4 at. hydrogen have taken
the   place of  1  at. of sulphur,
                    CM H10 N2 S    + 3HH = H, 8 + Cu HM N,.
If the molecular arrangement of the sulphur body formerly indicated be cor
rect, the action of the hydrogen would remove the sulphur bond from be
tween the carbon atoms, and by simultaneously loosening the attraction
between these carbon atoms and the nitrogen atoms, the union of two
hydrogen atoms to each carbon atom would be rendered possible ; both
nitrogen atoms would then be doubly linked together.                  That these are, in
fact, very strongly united is shown by the circumstance that the new base
undergoes no further change under the influence of hydrogen.                     I had

with water yielded him an oily product, which,              however, could not be dis
tilled without undergoing decomposition.
     Robert Williamson * also         made    experiments on the formation of this
compound, and, from the amount of anhydride and ethylic chloride enter
ing into the reaction, came to the conclusion that it was the ethylic com
pound, homologous with Williamson's sulphuric chlorhydrate, which he
also, by an analogous process, succeeded in obtaining by the action of hydric
chloride on sulphuric anhydride.
     Excepting these two short notices, nothing was known of the properties
and constitution of this body ; and it therefore appeared to me of interest
to submit it to a more close examination.
                                                               f
     Whilst occupied therewith, a paper of Pourgold's appeared on the same
subject, by the series of reactions described in which it is proved that the
 formula ascribed to it by Robert Williamson is in reality the rational one.
     Thus further experiments of mine in this direction were rendered unne
 cessary.
     According to my observations, however, the simple formation of this one
 chloride is not the only phase of the reaction. One always obtains, as Pour-
 gold also mentions, considerable quantities of products of higher boiling-
 point ; and I have found that, by heating the same some time with water
 in a sealed tube at 120° C, afterwards evaporating to drive off the hydric
 chloride formed, and neutralizing with baric carbonate, a permanent salt
 was obtained, which by analysis was proved to have the composition of
 baric isethionate.
     The formation of the chloride from which this salt has resulted is cer
 tainly remarkable, although           easily explicable,    as seen by the following
  equation   : —
                          C3H5Cl + S03=CaH4HO

      Again, on one occasion the impure liquid obtained -directly by passing
  the ethylic chloride into a flask containing the sulphuric anhydride, kept
  cool by being surrounded with ice, had, on standing over night, deposited
  a quantity of large, irregular, prismatic needles, of an exceedingly decom
  posable nature, the composition of which           I unfortunately did not succeed
  in fixing, and on no future occasion was I able to obtain the same again.
  I  intend, however, shortly to renew the study of these by-products, and
  also of the analogous reactions on employment of methylic and amylic
  chlorides.
      The extension of these experiments to the chlorinated chlorides of the
  Cnll.in+l series was full of interest, as, commencing with carbonic tetra
  chloride,    there was    a   certain possibility of arriving by this means at a
  trichlormethylic alcohol.         I therefore entered upon the investigation with

the intention of applying the reaction to members of the several series of
organic haloid compounds.          In the following are contained the results of
most of the experiments hitherto made ; and although in a less complete
form than    I  could wish,   I  am induced   to make them now public, as for
several reasons it will be some time before I shall be enabled to continue
my experiments in this direction.
          Action of Sulphuric Anhydride       on Carbonic   Tetrachloride.
    In this, as  in all the following experiments, the liquid was added to the
sulphuric anhydride by means of a drop-funnel provided with a glass stop
cock. The anhydride was prepared by distillation of Nordhausen sulphuric
acid, and condensed in a wide-mouthed flask.           This flask was connected,
by   means   of  a cork  provided   with two  borings,  with an inverted Liebig'i
condenser, and with the drop-funnel.
    The action set in immediately on allowing the carbonic tetrachloride to
drop on to the anhydride, and was accompanied from the beginning by i
constant evolution of gas.        The smell and suffocating properties of this gas
characterized it at once as carbonic oxychloride ; it was entirely absorbed
by absolute alcohol, the absorption being accompanied by a great rise in
temperature.       On the subsequent addition of water a heavier layer was
precipitated, which was separated from the wash-water and dried over calcic
chloride.     It was then obtained as a colourless, mobile liquid, boiling
between 90° and 95° C, traces of which exercised a most irritating action
on the eyes.      The B.P. of chlorocarbonic ether, with which it agrees in all
its properties, is given as 94° C.
    The rise in temperature on adding C C\t to the anhydride was very con
siderable ; and after one equivalent of the former to two of the latter was
present, it was only necessary to apply the heat of a water-bath for a short
time in order to complete the reaction ; there then remained a heavr, dark
brown-coloured liquid in the flask, on subjecting which to distillation a
small quantity C Cl4 first passed over, whereupon the thermometer ro«
rapidly, and between 1 30° and 1 50° the whole distilled over. After repeated
rectification the pure product was obtained of B.P. 141°-145° (uncor
rected) under a normal pressure.         Thus prepared it is a colourless, hearr,
mobile liquid, constantly fuming in the air, and which refracts light
strongly.
    On analysis, the following numbers       were obtained : —
                   •342 grm. gave    -/36fi grm. Ba S01=29\'>6 S.

      The formation of this chloride, and of carbonic oxychloride, is explained
by the      following equation            :   —
                                CC1, + 2SG,= COO, + Sa05Cla.
  This body, which I, for reasons to be mentioned later on, call pyrosul-
phuric chloride, was first discovered by H. Rose, who, in his description of
its properties, especially calls attention to its being but slowly decomposed
in contact with water at ordinary temperatures, — a statement which I can
thoroughly endorse.
    Schutzenberger *, however, who in the meantime has also published a
series of observations on this reaction, with which on the whole mine agree,
differs very considerably in his description of this chloride, which, accord
ing to him, boils at 130° Ct, and is  decomposed immediately by water.
On this he lays particular stress, and
                                     draws the conclusion that either his
substance is isomeric with Rose's, or that Rose worked with an impure
substance.
      It      to me, however, that the contrary is the case, — that Rose
           seems
describes the properties of the pure substance, although, to judge from his
analyses, his was not a chemically pure one.    To make the chlorine and
sulphur estimations,           I
                        broke a very thin glass bulb, filled with a weighed
quantity of the liquid, under water ; but so great is the relative stability of
the chloride, that a considerable time elapsed before the small quantity
employed       was decomposed,                even when        I   used a dilute        potassa       solution,
which       was warmed to          50°-60° C.

     The experiment was made under exactly the same conditions as the
 former one.      The action set in immediately on addition of the chloroform,
 and was also accompanied by a rise in temperature and an evolution of
 gas, which gas proved to be pure carbonic         oxide, and, as was ascertained
 by experiment, free from hydric chloride, whose formation by the reaction
 was not impossible.
     The reaction    was easily completed by aid    of a gentle heat, and the liquid
 remaining in the flask was then subjected to distillation.      After repeated rec
 tification the greater part boiled constantly at 139°-140°, and was obtained
 as a colourless, mobile liquid, differing only in B.P. from the chloride ob
 tained by the action of the anhydride on the tetrachloride.
     The analysis yielded the following results : —
                   -1051 grin, gave -138 grm. AgCl =32-4 CI.
                   -1 150 grm. gave -242 grm. BaS04 =28-8 S.

     It is evident from the above     comparison of the numbers obtained with
those calculated for each of the formulae SOaHOCl and S^OjCl,, that they
lie midway between the two, and there is therefore no doubt that this liquid
is a mixture of both.
     Pyrosulphuric chloride and sulphuric chlorhydrate are therefore derived
from sulphuric anhydride and chloroform, as is explained by the following
 equations, —
                2SO, + CHC1, = CO + HC1 + 8,0,0,.
                 SO, + HC1          = SOaH0Cl.
     There was a probability of formylic chloride, HC0C1, instead of the
products of its decomposition, CO + HC1, being obtained by this reaction,
as is evident from the equation, —
                       2S0, + CHC1, = HC0C1 + S,OsCla.
    This is not the case, however, as is proved, 1, by the fact that carbonic
oxide is evolved immediately on adding chloroform to the anhydride, which
is also the case on reversing the experiment, and allowing sulphuric anhy
dride vapour to act on an excess of chloroform ; 2, had it resulted it must
have been detected on distillation, either as such, or if it became decom
posed, by an evolution of CO and HC1 ; but the distillation only yielded the
above-mentioned chloride, and was not accompanied by any further disen

gagement of gas. If it be formed at all, which I certainly                 do not hold   to
be the case, it is immediately decomposed again in contact                 -with the anhy
dride into carbonic oxide and sulphuric clorhydrate.
                 Action of Sulphuric Anhydride          on Hexachlorbenzol.
     This experiment was instituted in the hope of obtaining tetrachlorquinon,
which, as is known, Graebe* succeeded in converting into hexachlorbenzol
by the action of phosphoric chloride. The first step in the reaction would
be the formation of the body C6C1,0, which probably, by the intervention
of another molecule of the anhydride, would then be converted into
            .0
                  * sav Pr°bably, because there seems no tendency in the benzol
 CgClX^y
 series to form derivatives in which two of the monovalentic hydrogen atoms
 are replaced by a single divalentic atom.
      However, no action whatever took place on heating the hexachlorbenzol
 in   sealed tubes with sulphuric anhydride alone, or with addition of pyro-
 sulphuric chloride as dissolvent, to a temperature over 200° C. The tubes
 burst frequently, but in all        cases   it was possible to   separate  out the hexa
 chlorbenzol perfectly unaltered on addition of water. Possibly better re
 sults might be obtained with tri- or tetrachlorbenzol in which is still
  replaceable hydrogen.
      Experiments      were    also  made      with chlorobenzol,   benzotrichlorid,   and
  dichlorhydrin, from the first two of which respectively benzoic aldehyde and
  chlorbenzol      might have been formed, — a view which was favoured by Op-
  penheim's t having obtained benzoic aldehyde by the action of concentrated
  sulphuric acid on chlorobenzol and after-treatment with water.
      Dichlorhydrin was perfectly carbonized by the action of the anhydride,
  HC1 and SOa being evolved, and the other two chlorides were converted,
  also with evolution of HC1, into that peculiar resin-like substance which is
  a so characteristic product in many reactions with these bodies.
      There seems, therefore, to be no doubt, as was indeed probable, that the
  substitution of Cla by O can only be effected in such compounds as are ca
  pable of resisting the action of the pyrosulphuric chloride formed thereby,
  and that consequently it is only attainable in its purity in those cases where
   the whole or greater part of the hydrogen is replaced by chlorine.
    Action    of Sulphuric Anhydride         on  Perchlorinated Chloride     of Ethylene.
       On bringing these two bodies together and slightly warming, the reaction
   soon set in, the latter melting ; a disengagement of gas also took place, an
   examination of which proved it to be a mixture of carbonic oxychloride and
    sulphurous anhydride.         On continuing the application of heat, the contents
    of the flask gradually       became    liquefied, and on subjecting afterwards to
    distillation, the liquid commenced to boil at about 60° C. ; the thermometer

     According to Genther *, carbonic disulphide and sulphuric anhydride are
without action on one another, a simple solution of the anhydride taking
place. Notwithstanding this I thought it advisable to repeat the experi
ment, and have by so doing found that a reaction does take place exactly
                 I
in the sense had expected.
     If  equivalents of the two are mixed together, action sets in, even at com
mon temperatures, after a short time, but at once on warming the mixture,
and is accompanied by a continuous evolution of gas, which, by alternate
heating or cooling, can       be regulated at   will.
    The escaping      gas   was   first  passed  through    a wash-bottle    containing
water, and then, to free it from carbonic-disulphide vapour, through tubes
filled with pieces of unvulcanized caoutchouc placed in a freezing-mixture
of ice and salt f, and, finally, to remove the last traces of sulphurous an
hydride, over plumbic peroxide. Thus purified, it possessed all the pro

analysis, which gave the following data : —

evident, is nearly the case.
    Amnionic sulphocarbamate, formed by the direct union of carbonic oxy-
sulphide with ammonia, and first described by Berthelot, I found to be
produced in quantity on passing the gas and ammonia together into abso
lute alcohol, it separating out from the concentrated solution, on standing,
in long prismatic needles.
    Than, by decomposing carbonic oxysulphide over mercury in the one
limb of a V tube provided with platinum wires, found that a separation
into an equal volume of carbonic oxide and sulphur, which appears as a
thick cloud on the tube every time on passing the spark, took place.
On repeating his experiment with my gas, I found exactly the same to be
the case.

tained, after washing with water, as a yellow friable mass, consisting en
tirely of sulphur.

  The following simple equation, therefore, explains                         the reaction   which

          Action of Sulphuric Anhydride on Phosphorous Chloride.
   The ease with which the foregoing reaction had taken place led me to
try the action of the anhydride on a compound which, possessing latest
affinities and a predisposition to combine with oxygen, it was to be expected
would cause the separation of the " extraradical
                                                  "
                                                    oxygen atom, as I tens
the atom which is signalized by its great mobility.                        The compound     chosen
was phosphorous chloride.
   On adding this to the anhydride, which must be in a flask surrounded
by ice, a violent reaction takes place, attended by a copious evolution of
sulphurous anhydride.     No further action is observable after equal equi
valents have been employed ; and on distilling the resulting liquid and
fractioning two or three times, two products are obtained, the one boiling
from 1 10° to 1 14°, which, from all its properties, is undoubtedly phosphoric
oxychloride.
  The reaction has         therefore partly taken place                    as was expected, and
according to the equation —                                       •    •
                          PCI, + SO, = P0CL. + soa.
   The       second product, which is obtained         in varying quantity, according           u
more or less anhydride is employed, the more being formed, the greater
the proportion of the latter *, boils at the first distillation between 1 20° and
 1 70°, and cannot be obtained of constant B.P., even by repeated rectifica
tion, by each of which it only suffers further decomposition, a thick varnish
like residue remaining every time. This product contains phosphorus,
chlorine, and sulphur.
   II.Hose, who also studied this reaction, though without observing the
formation  either of phosphoric oxychloride or of sulphurous anhydride,
which latter he only remarked was given off on subsequent distillation, aha
describes this second         product     ;   he ascribes   to   it,   however, an exceedingly
complicated formula.
   It   is   very possible that   a   further substitution of chlorine            by oxygen    has
ta ken place, as explained by the equation —
                      poci, + 2S0, = poaci + s,osci,;
and this compound can be viewed as metaphosphoric chloride, which                             it

the reaction by means        of distillation under reduced pressure.

below 100° and the other consisting of the pyrosulphuric chloride which
had escaped     decomposition.         The first portion was found to be sulphuric
anhydride contaminated with traces of pyrosulphuric chloride; for on
passing a stream of dry carbonic anhydride through it the whole solidified.
The decomposition is therefore expressed             by the equation —

    The result of       a vapour-density       determination,      according to Dumas's
method, also speaks for the above decomposition.                   The following are the

    The old view of considering Nordhausen sulphuric acid as merely a so
lution of sulphuric anhydride in ordinary sulphuric acid has now probably
but few partisans among chemists, it being looked upon as a true chemical
compound, although of a very unstable nature, for the reason that on one
side definite (sodic and potassic) salts of it are known, and on the other
it presents analogies with certain chromium and phosphorus compounds, in
which groups     we are acquainted with the following series       : —

       Temperate to Tropical, and the reverse."                    By Alexander

    Besides its obvious bearing on the long-vexed and still unsettled question
of the unity of the human species, and on the closely related one of accli
matization, the present inquiry is of great medical importance.             Tropical
pathology, whether of native or foreign races, cannot be fairly studied until
we thoroughly know its physiology ; nor can we recognize and properly
estimate disturbed action of organs till we understand their healthy func
tions. Otherwise natural phenomena may be mistaken for symptoms of
sickness.     Many so-called tropical diseases are merely exaggerations of the
ordinary   effects of climate, physiological merged into pathological pheno
mena ; a knowledge of the one is the first step to an accurate acquaintance
with and philosophical method of treating or preventing the other.
    No inconsiderable part of our present knowledge of the vital phenomena

514            Dr. Rattray on   the effects  of  Change  of Climate     [Jane   16,
induced in the human economy in passing from cold to warm regions, or
the reverse, is derived from experiments carried out in artificially made or
seldom encountered climates.        By hot-air chambers we illustrate the effect*
of augmented temperature on the respiration, pulse, &c, and by the
rarefied atmosphere of mountain-tops show how diminished density acts.
 Neither of these, however, are fair examples of natural climates. Thus the
 former, dry and warm, is unlike the tropics, with its triple combination of
 increased heat, rarefied air, and excessive moisture ; as the latter, dry md
 chilly, is dissimilar from the usual surface-climates of extra-tropical latitudes,
 which conjoin cold, condensation, and moisture.           The dry and warm, or
 dry and cold, climates which      occur  in nature are usually local and limited.
 Nor do such abrupt and temporary exposures to heat and cold have aoy
 parallel in ordinary life, or are they likely to induce results similar to tkt
 comparatively slow transition involved in an ordinary change of clinutt;
 and though the rarefied air of heated chambers will decrease, while that of
 great altitudes will accelerate respiration, the former will do so less, and the
 latter more, than they otherwise would, from the skin, and especially the
 more slowly acting liver and kidneys, being unable at once to increase thai
 action so as to aid the lungs in eliminating carbon.      The functional changes
  so induced cannot therefore be taken as a fair criterion of what occurs ia
 nature ; and as mere approximates to truth, such observations, though in
 teresting, are evidently wanting in practical importance.
            I.  The Influence of Tropical Climates    on the Respiration.
     It has been ascertained, by the experiments already alluded to, that the
  respirations are diminished in frequency in warm and increased in cold air ;
  but we do not yet know what happens in the tropics, where great heat,
  rarity of air, and moisture are conjoined.         Nor has it yet been shown
  whether the quantity of air respired is greater in the tropics or less. It is
  obviously necessary to ascertain both before we can decide whether the total
  quantity of air and oxygen respired, and the amount of carbonic acid and
  watery vapour exhaled, be different or not.
     The following experiment will show that the capacity         of the chest for
  air is materially affected by tropical climates   : —

The other two cases remained stationary.      The total average in the twelve
cases, during this fifty days' residence in the tropics, was 31 cubic inches
(12-24 per cent.).  In order to test whether this was due to climatic cause,
or resulted from custom in using the instrument, the same cases were again
tested about three weeks afterwards, on return to England        September,
                                                                                in
when   it          (column 4) that the capacity of the chest for air had
            was found
again decreased in every case by an average of 26 cubic inches.    Although
the temperatures were identical (65° F., shade) on quitting and returning                          to
England, the time was apparently too short to allow the capacity          the                of
lungs to resume their first standard average of 256 cubic inches, being stl
at 260 cubic inches.     But this result followed a subsequent reduction                            of
temperature to 42° F. (shade) in February 18/0, when the average capacity
of eleven of the same cases was found to be 253 cubic inches, that       cubic         is,3
inches below the first trial. This fact, however, goes far to prove that there
isa  limit to this reduction in the pneumatic capacity of the chest health,            in
which was probably nearly reached. The results among the other adulti
were identical, and showed that the capacity of the chest for air con                        is
siderably greater in the tropics than in temperate climates. This was
noticeable in five of the six cadets.  During the three weeks of the return
voyage between the tropics and England, when from faulty diet their growth
was nearly or altogether stopped, the capacityof the chest decreased con
siderably, when  might have been reasonably expected that the diminished
                    it
capacity from climatic causes would have been more than counterbalanced
by expansion from growth, usually very rapid at that age. This actn&Ilj
occurred in the sixth (Lees),  tall growing youth, in whom an increase
                                   a                                                                of
27 cubic inches showed that his chest had enlarged considerably. The
greatest increase in the pneumatic capacity of the chest from this sojourn
in the tropics, of the twenty-four cases here recorded, amounted to 39 cobk
inches, and the lowest to 21.

the tropics to 210 cubic inches, it became reduced in the winter of England

    Here, in all four cases, there was         a decrease      from 8 to 15 cubic inches,
even in so brief an interval as five days, caused by the cool dry north-east
trade-winds, suddenly met with after calm, moist, sultry weather near the
equator.       The period was evidently too brief, and the disease not sufficiently
active   in  any of these cases, for this to have resulted from the formation or
increase of cavities in the lungs ; and it can only be ascribed to the law that
the pneumatic capacity of the chest varies with temperature, increasing in
tropical, and diminishing in temperate and cold climates.
    A knowledge of this law is evidently of practical application in prevent
ing mistakes in the spirometric diagnosis of certain lung-diseases.                             Thus
 the capacity of the chest of an individual debilitated by residence in the
tropics, and weak-chested, but with no active lung-disease, being, say, 250

or 270 cubic inches, he might be supposed to have contracted incipient
phthisis on reaching England in winter labouring under catarrh, with the
pneumatic capacity of his chest reduced by from 25 to 35 cubic inches.
On the other hand, a patient actually in incipient phthisis might be erro
neously considered to have permanently recovered by a trip to the tropics
having raised the capacity of his lungs for air by a similar amount, i. e. al
most or actually up to the normal standard for his age and height in a
temperate climate.         A similar mistake might be made, especially if the
instrument is carelessly used, in the same climate, e. g. that of England, at
different seasons of the year, such as the height of summer and depth of
winter, when a considerable difference in the capacity of the lungs for air
must not be taken as an index of disease *. The greater the range between
the summer and winter temperatures, the more marked will be the differ
ence   in the spirometric indications.
    But it is not by deep inspirations like these that ordinary respiration is
carried on ; and it is important to ascertain whether the air inspired
in each ordinary breath undergoes a similar increase and decrease according
to climate.     The difficulty in limiting and measuring the small quantity
of air expired during our usual faint breathings makes this a far more
delicate and difficult experiment than the preceding.                  From analogy,
however, we may infer that it does vary ; and the following will go far to
prove it. My ordinary respirations ranged from 4 to 8, and averaged 6
cubic inches in a temperature of 44° F. (shade) during the winter of
England.      At Lisbon, during an average temperature of 65° F. (shade),
they ranged from 5 to 13, and averaged 9 cubic inchest-                  Unfortunately
while in the tropics I had not the proper apparatus to ascertain how much
they increase during the far greater temperature of equatorial regions.              As
these results therefore only prove the existence of an increase, and do not
show its extent, it will be necessary, as it is doubtless correct, to calculate
the minor from the major increase.
    The following Table will show the negative effect of period              of the day
on the capacity of the chest for air in the tropics.

   Column       1   gives   the average      of the entire voyage, during which the
equator was crossed and again recrossed.                  Here the results, morning, after
noon, and evening, hoth           in the tropics generally and in its warmest part,
the equatorial doldrums, are so very nearly identical that we may conclude
that period of the day has very little influence on the capacity of the chest
for air, or the power of taking deep inspirations.
   Closely allied to the foregoing is the influence of tropical climates on
the frequency of the respirations.                 In heated air-chambers respiration
becomes less       in man*.      Vierordt and Ludwig also found that the respira
tions are lessened        in number in animals subjected to heatf. Does this
occur in natural tropical climates ?               We might infer that as the volume
inspired   increases,     so does the number of respirations. But fact (Table V.)
proves the reverse, and shows that, as in hot artificial climates, they are
diminished in number.

   This Table is compiled chiefly from the daily results of a three months-
voyage to Bahia and back, the observations being taken in the standing
posture at 9 a.m., 3 p.m., and 9 p.m. ; the averages are for a week.                       Thus
in the summer of England, with an average temperature of 62° F., the
average number of respirations per minute was 15f ; whereas in the dol
drums, or warmest part of the tropics, during the outward voyage, with a
temperature of 78£° F., the average was only 12|, and on the return
voyage 1 3£, — a decided decrease.              In the winter of England (February),
with a temperature of 42° F., the average had increased to 16 J, and at
freezing-point (32° F.) to                    With those results similar experiments

 10-907 per cent, as the grand total difference in favour of a temperate
climate,    after deducting the real decrease in volume, and correcting for ex
pansion by heat.            By again reducing the 9-243 oz. of carbon by 3-614
per cent., or 0-33409 oz., we get 8-909 oz. as the total amount which the
lungs throw off in the tropics, the difference between the tropical and
extra-tropical quantities being 1-1028 oz.                  This result in the human
species     accords    with    Vierordt-s     observation  on   the lower animals, viz.
that less carbonic acid and presumably less water are eliminated when
 they are subjected to heat*.             This, then, is probably the rule, but in ex
 ceptional cases, from idiosyncrasy, accelerated or forced respiration may
 make the quantity of carbon which the lungs can exhale in temperate and
 tropical regions more nearly alike.
     Thus the relative proportions of carbon thrown off by the several depu
 rating organs in the tropics differs from those of temperate latitudes.
 Hooperf gives the latter as : —lungs 10| oz., skin oz., faeces \ oz., urine
                                                                 |
 \  oz., total  1
                  If  oz. ; we have found that     in the tropics the amount eliminated
 by the lungs is reduced by 1^ oz.             Under judicious hygienic, and especially
 dietetic management, that for the skin, liver, and urine may not be
 materially altered from these figures ; but otherwise it is probably on the
 skin that the greatest share of its burden is thrown.                 We may presume
 that the liver-work and bile are increased, though perhaps only slightly,
 in the tropics, although this has not yet been actually proved.                    The
 kidneys may assist to a greater extent ; for though the urine is diminished
 in quantity     in the tropics, the relative amount of solids is not correspond
 ingly altered.        Much of the latter may be carbon ; for though the urea
 eliminated      by the kidneys in the tropics is diminished +, the quantity of
 uric acid,   which contains thrice the amount of carbon, has not yet been
 ascertained.
     The mutual bearing of these two closely related but very opposite re
 sults, viz. an increase in the capacity of the chest for air in the tropics,
 with a decrease in the number of the respirations, is an interesting if not
 important study.           Hasty inference might lead us to attempt to explain the
 former    by a greater volume           of the rarefied and moisture-laden air of the
  tropics being required to supply the system with the requisite quantity of
  oxygen.      But there are several objections to this theory, e. g. : —
      1. Nature might do this in health as she often does in disease, such as
  phthisis, pneumonia, &c., by increasing the frequency of the respirations,

The     bulk of the lungs remaining the same in the tropics as in colder lati
tudes, or being even somewhat diminished from their comparative abeyance
as excreting and heat-generating organs, the blood, diverted to the func
tionally excited and congested skin and liver, permits the ingress of a
larger quantity of air into the pulmonary air-cells and tubes ; whereas in
colder latitudes this is reversed, the lungs being more and the skin and
liver    less active ; the blood drawn         from the latter to the former dimi
nishes the calibre of the air-vesicles and bronchi, lessening the quantity
of contained air, as happens to a still greater extent in some lung-diseases,
e. g. bronchitis, pneumonia, pulmonary congestion *, and phthisis, tu
bercle and not blood being in the latter the displacing agent. Briefly, the
lungs (identical in size in both) contain less blood and more air in tropical
than in temperate climates. The truth of the above explanation appears to
be confirmed by facts noticeable in Table I., viz. that it is in thoroughly
warm tropical regions, where the skin acts most freely and the sensible
perspiration is most abundant, that the greatest difference is observable in
the capacity of the lungs for air. Thus the difference between the capacity
near the equator (temp. 83° F.) and September in England (temp. G5° F.)
 was 26 cubic inches ; while between the latter and the winter of England
(February, temp. 42° F.), when the functions of the skin were much more
in abeyance, was no more than six cubic inches. And it corresponds with
what Dr. Francis (Bengal Army) t has observed, viz. that the lungs are
lighter after death in Europeans in India than the European standard.
 Parkes has made the same observation, and remarks that it shows appa
rently a diminished respiratory function.
     A knowledge of this law, in addition to its diagnostic value, is evidently
 of considerable therapeutic importance as furnishing a guide to the rational
 treatment of many, and especially congestive or inflammatory diseases of
 the lungs. By its facts the true rationale of the benefit derived in the
 earlier stages of phthisis, or where it is merely imminent from a sojourn
 in a subtropical climate, is of easy explanation.               Residence in a warm
 atmosphere is followed by        a decrease    in the quantity of  blood in the affected
 lungs, by diminished activity in the vital          processes carried on therein, by
 facilitated respiration, and, above       all,   by diminished lung-work from vica
 rious action of the physiologically excited skin and liver ; while the in
 halation     of milder,   more     equable,    and less irritant air diminishes the
 chances of excitement or increase            of distressing local inflammation and
 descent of the diaphragm ; and the exceptional case above related of diminution of the
 co.stal circumference may possibly be explained by the diaphragm counteracting the
 other respiratory muscles, whilst unusually contracting in answer to the room required
  by this reserved power of the bases of the lungs being called into action.

     Here two facts are apparent, — first, that the number of respirations
 (morning, afternoon, and evening) are all less than in temperate regions ;
 and, second, what is more specially designed to prove, viz. that in tropical
 as in temperate latitudes the respiration is least frequent in the morning,
 and gradually increases as the day advances. Thus at 9 a.m. it was 13' 15,
 at 3 p.m. 13-65, and at 9 p.m. 14-18. The Table further appears to
 indicate that the difference between the number of morning and evening
 respirations is not so great in the tropics as in colder latitudes.                    In the
 former the lungs play a less active part as a heat-generator and eliminator
 of   carbonic acid and water.           Hence the respiration is calmer and more
 equable.      Thus in the tropics there is only             one respiration and a fraction
 more in the evening        ;  while in the temperate zone there is 1 1 nearly.
 Had the     season been      winter instead of summer, and the weather colder,
 the difference would       have been greater.
               II. The Influence        of Tropical Climates       on the   Pulse.
     Like the previously detailed experiments on the respiration, the present
 were made during a voyage from England (lat. 51° N.) to Bahia (lat.
  11° S.) and back, i. e. across the equator, and extend over 60 days (53 in
 the tropics, and     7  in the latitude of England), during which the thermo
 meter ranged from 57° to 84° F. (27° F.). The observations were taken
  thrice a day in the standing posture. Table VII. shows that, as in tempe
  rate latitudes*, the highest pulse of the day in the tropics occurs (though
  by no means invariably) in the morning.

    The following Table shows, first, that the            average  pulse for the    tropics
(87J)   is lower by    2\   beats than that for the temperate      zone  (90),   indicating
a more languid          circulation  ; second, that the same holds good for the
average morning and evening pulse ; third, that the average afternoon
pulse is higher in the tropics than in temperate latitudes, probably from
solar heat, greatest at that period of the day ; fourth, that the highest and
lowest pulse of the period occurs in the morning ; fifth, that the                  morning
pulse has the greatest, and the evening the lowest range.

    The reduction of the pulse in the tropics is doubtless related to the
 diminished respiratory function ; and further observation may prove what
 the latter fact suggests, viz. that the pulse is diminished not only in fre
 quency but in force*.           The rise in the pulse towards afternoon and its
 subsequent     fall are   doubtless   physiologically connected with a correspond
 ing rise and fall in the temperature of the body at the same periods
 (Table IX.). The relation, however, does not extend to the volume or
 number of the respirations, the former being nearly alike during these
 three periods of the day, and the latter greatest towards night.                   As these
 observations, however, on the most excitable of all organs, the pulse, were
 made on one individual only, and at sea, where motion of the ship, weather,
 &c. render it impossible to ensure day by day the identical conditions
 necessary     to give completely        satisfactory results,    their   confirmation      is
 necessary.
 III.   The Influence      of Tropical Climates       on the Temperature     of the    Body.
     In this inquiry, so intimately connected with the two previous ones, vis.
 the respiration and circulation, the facts were ascertained by placing »n
 ordinary Fahrenheit thermometer under the tongue thrice a day, during
 the same voyage as last, the temperature of the air in the shade on the
 verge of the tropics being 72° F., at the equator 84° F., and the average
 of the tropics generally 76-9 ; and the atmospheric humidity represented
 by a difference between the wet and dry bulbs of a Mason-s hygrometer of
 0° to 7*°, the average being 3°-8 F.
    * Parked
              (- Practical Hygiene -) avers that the pulse is quicker in Hie tropics, though
 perhaps not so full. In animals moderate heat does not, but great heat does quicken
 the pulse.  The latter, however, is evidently an unnatural temperature.

      The following Table contrasts the average heat of the body in the
  tropics and in temperate climates. Thus, while in England during n
  Bummer and almost subtropical temperature ranging from 60° to 70° F.,
  the   average temperature of the body was 980-3 F. it rose in the tropics
  to 980,6, and iu the equatorial doldrums to 99° F. The difference would
  have been greater had the season in England been winter, or the latitude
  higher. From column 3 it appears that the temperature of the body in
  the tropics is greatest during the afternoon, when the sun is
                                                                                  high and the
  body most active, and least in the morning — an interesting fact in connexion
  with the pulse, likewise highest and lowest then.

 body about the latitude of England is 98°-3 F., the following Table shows
 that it rises in the tropics to 98|-99-99£, and occasionally even to 100° F.

 V.    "Observations         on   the Mode of Growth of Discoid and Turbi
          nated Shells."        By Alexander Macalister, Professor of Zoo
          logy, University of Dublin. Communicated by the Rev. S.
          Haughton, F.lt.S. Received May 4, 1870.
      A  most interesting paper on the geometrical forms of turbinated and
 discoid shells was published by the Rev. Canon Moseley in the Philoso
 phical Transactions for 1838, p. 351, in which some important points
 were noticed regarding the geometrical construction of shell-forms.                   The
  author of that paper describes discoid shells as generated by the revolution
  around a central point of the perimeter of a geometrical figure, which
  latter, although regularly increasing in size, yet remains always geometri
  cally similar in form.        The producing figure in many Gasteropodous Mol-
  lusks is represented by the operculum, and in all it may be recognized by
  making a vertical section in the plane of the radius vector.             A turbinated
   Bhell is similarly    generated, but the generating figure in the production of
   the helix slips down along the axis instead of revolving in a constant
   plane.    The Rev. Mr. Moseley gives, as illustrations of these points, mea
   surements    of Nautihts potnpilius, Turbo phasianus,        Turbo duplicatus, and

 530           Prof.   A. Macalister      on the Mode     of Growth of           [June   16
 Buccinum tubulatum, and describes many interesting particulars regarding
 the formation and growth of the operculum in different shells.
     This subject does not seem to have attracted much attention from natu
 ralists, as, with the exception of a notice in Professor Goodsir's lecture
 "On the Use of Mathematical Modes of Investigating Organic Forms"*,
 it is not, to my knowledge, referred to by any            writer on zoology.
     While   engaged    in arranging the     large collection of shells in the      Museum
 of the University of Dublin, I was led to make measurements of univalve
 shells in order to see whether any deduction of zoological importance might
 be drawn from these valuable geometrical observations, and more especUIIj
 to determine whether it might be possible to arrive at constant specific
 numerical parameters in these cases ; and in all instances                I have been sur
 prised by finding that, in well-formed shells, the ratios of the successive
 whorls have been specifically constant. In making these measurements, the
 points to be determined are three, viz. : — 1st, the ratio of elongation of the
 radius vector of the spiral (A) ; 2nd, the degree of linear expansion of the
 generating figure in the successive whorls (m); and 3rd, the degree of
 translation or slipping of the spiral on the central axis (n).                 The second
 of these we may call the discoidal coefficient, and the third the helicoidal
 coefficient.
     On applying      these  measurements to univalve shells,            we find that      the
 possible combinations are five in number           :—
                        1st, those in which n = 0 and m<&,
                       2nd, those in which       n=0 and m=h,
                       3rd, those in which n=m,
                       4th, those in which n>-m,
                       5th, those in which n<m.
     The   cases   of discoid shells in which n=0 are two, the first and second
 on the list.     The first and most uncommon is that in which the amount of
 elongation of the radius vector in the formation of the successive whorb
 exceeds the transverse linear increase of the producing figure. The result
 ing form of this case (which may be formulated thus, k >¦ m) is an open
 spiral, as in the fossil Gasteropodous genus Eccyliomphalus, or the Cepha-

    t In all the specimens measured and referred to in this paper I have made at least
three measurements of each individual, and in the majority of cases I have measured
at least six specimens of each species.    These measurements are in decimal parts of u
English inch, and were made with a finely pointed pair of compasses and a diagonal scale,
the eye being in some cases aided by a
                                             magnifying-glass. Some specimens were mea
sured by means of sections made in a
                                        plane perpendicular to the axis.

hence the widths of the whorls measured on the radius vector will form a
series of numbers in geometrical progression, the common ratio of the pro
gression being, in discoid shells of the second group where m=k, equal to
the coefficient of linear increase of the generating figure. To verify the
coefficients          deduced from the numbers obtained by measurement, I have
used the method given by the Rev. Canon Moseley, which depends upon
a well-ascertained property of the logarithmic spiral, that if ft be taken to
represent the ratio of the sum of the lengths of an                              even number (m)             of the

 this formula to the             cases given below,             I  have in the majority             of   cases ob
 tained results which confirm the ratios of the                                  series      of measurements
 otherwise          obtained.
      The     second case        of discoid shells, in which m=k and n—0, is by far the
 commoner, as to it belong all genera of discoidal mollusks, with the few
 exceptions noticed above.                   The case m > k is one which cannot occur, as
 then the outer whorl must necessarily crush the inner, and then the gene
 rating figure could not retain its geometrical identity while enlarging ;
  hence we find no examples of it in discoid shells.
      I   have placed in this second case sonic instances in which the ratio of
  slipping or translation on the axis                     is   not easily measured,                and virtually
  amounted to nothing.

       Hitherto         we have been examining the formulae for discoid shells                             j but by
   far the greater number                 of shell-forms            are those        in which        the whorls,
   instead     of remaining in the             same      plane, slide down on the central axis,
   thus making a turbinated shell-form.                            A new principle enters into our
    calculation here ; for the shape of a turbinated shell depends on the mutual
    relation of three, and not two constants.                        These are, first, the form of the

 coidal coefficient n.              Upon the relations of these parameters to each other
 depends the shape of the shell.                           Thus in some n is nearly equal to m, mi

     VII. " On     Supersaturated Saline Solutions."— Part II. By
         Charles    Tomlinson, F.R.S. Received May 17, 1870.
                                    (Abstract.)
    The object of this paper is to develop more fully the principles
attempted to be established in Part I.*, not only by clearer definitions of
terms, but also by new facts and conclusions.            The paper is divided into
two sections ; in the first of which are stated the conditions under which
nuclei act in separating salt or gas or vapour from their supersaturated
solutions, while in the second section is shown the action of low tempe
ratures on supersaturated saline solutions.
   The first section opens with definitions of the terms used.
   A nucleus is a body that has a stronger attraction for the gas or vapour
or salt of a solution than for the liquid that holds it in solution.
   A body is chemically clean the surface of which is entirely              free from
any substance foreign      to its own composition.          Oils and other liquids
are chemically clean if    chemically pure, and contain no substance, mixed
or dissolved, that is foreign to their composition.         But with respect to the
nuclear action of oils &c., the behaviour is different when such bodies
exist in the mass, such as a lens or globule, as compared with the same
bodies in the form of films.
    Catharization is the act of clearing the surface of bodies from all alien
matter, and the substance is said to be catharized when its surface is so
cleared.
   As everything exposed to the air or to the touch takes more or less a
deposit or film of foreign matter, substances are classed as catharized or
uncatharized according as they have or have not been so freed from
foreign matter.
   Referring to the definition      of  a nucleus, substances       are divided   into
nuclear or non-nuclear.
   The nuclear     are those that may, per se,         become   nuclei.     The non-
nuclear are those that have not that quality.
   The nuclear substances would seem to be comparatively few, the larger
number of natural substances ranking under the other division.
   Under nuclear substances are those vapours and oily and other liquids
that form thin films on the surfaces of liquids and solids ; and generally
all substances in the form of films, and only in that form. Thus a stick
of tallow, chemically clean, will not act, but a film of it will act power
fully ; and again, a globule of castor-oil will not act, if chemically clean ;
but in the form of a film, whether chemically clean or not, it will act
powerfully.
   If  a drop of a liquid be placed on the surface of another liquid it will
do  one  of three things (apart from chemical action), — (1) it will diffuse
through the liquid, and in general, under such circumstances, not act as a

a, the drop will spread into a film ; but         on the contrary,  if,

   This general proposition may not always apply in the case of super
saturated saline solutions, on account of the superficial viscosity, or the
greater or less difficulty of the superficial molecules to be displaced.

   Under the non-nuclear, forming by far the larger class of substances,

     Among the non-nuclear                 will be found air for its ascribed

body be non-catharized,  the gas or vapour or salt of the solution adheres
to    more strongly than the liquid portion, and hence there

film.
     Some liquids (absolute alcohol for example) form films, and act as
nuclei      by
           separating water instead of salt from supersaturated solutions.
     Other liquids (glycerin for example) diffuse through the solutions
without acting as nuclei.
   Fatty oils may slowly saponify, or oil of bitter almonds form benzoic
acid in contact with supersaturated solutions of Glauber's salt without
acting as nuclei.
   The solutions (say of Glauber's salt) arc prepared with          or                                1,    2,        3

rated       solution.    In an experiment described, a drop of pale seal-oil formed
a well-shaped film, with a display of iridescent rings, and immediately
from the lower surface of the film there fell large flat prisms with dihe
dral summits of the 10-atom sodic sulphate. The prisms were an inch or
an inch and a half in length, and three-eighths of an inch across. The
 crystallization       proceeded from every part of the lower surface of the film,
 and      as one set   of crystals fell off, another set was formed, until the whole
 solution became a mass of fine crystals in a small quantity of liquid, an
 effect quite different from the usual crystallization which takes place when
 a supersaturated solution of Glauber's salt is subjected to the action of a
  nucleus at one or two points in its surface, as when motes of dust enter
 from the air, or the surface is touched with           a nuclear point.   In such case
  small crystalline       needles  diverge   from   the  point and  proceed rapidly in
  ¦well-packed      lines to the bottom, the whole being too crowded and too
  rapid to allow of the formation of regular crystals.
        Similar experiments were made on solutions of Glauber's salt of dif
  ferent strengths, with drops of ether, absolute alcohol, naphtha, benzole,
  the oils of turpentine, cajuput, and other volatile oils, sperm, herring, olive,
  linseed, castor, and other fixed oils of animal and vegetable origin, with
  this general result, that whenever the liquid drop spread out into a film,
   it acted as a powerful nucleus ; but when the oil formed a lens there
  was no separation of salt, even when the flasks were shaken so as to break
   up the lens into small globules.          If, however, a sudden jerk were given to
   the flask so as to flatten some of the globules against its sides into films,
   the whole solution instantly became solid. A similar effect was produced
   by introducing a clean inactive solid for the purpose of flattening a por
   tion of oil against the side of the flask.
        Stearine from sheep's tallow that had been exposed to the air produced
   immediate crystallization, but by boiling the solution and covering the
   flasks, the stearine, now catharized, had lost its nuclear character on the
   cold solution.       Similar observations were made with the fixed oils that
   form lenses or globules      in the solution. So also volatile oils containing pro
    ducts of oxidation,      dust, &c. are nuclear, but when catharized       by being
    redistilled they are inactive   in the globular state, active in the form of films.
        Supersaturated solutions of potash alum, ammonia alum, sodic acetate,
    and magnesia sulphate were also operated on with results similar to
    those obtained with solutions of Glauber's salt.
        When a liquid forms a film on the surface of a supersaturated solution,
    the surface-tension of the solution is so far diminished as to bring the film
    into contact with the solution, when that differential kind of action takes
    place whereby the salt of the solution adhering more strongly to the
    film than the water of the solution, the action of separation and crystal
    lization,  thus once begun, is propagated throughout.             A similar action
     takes place with solid bodies that have contracted filmy nuclei by being
     touched or drawn through the hand, or merely exposed to the air ;

     On the other hand, when             a   drop of oil (or many drops)    placed on    is
the surface of      supersaturated

ticular form, or even flattens into            a   disk, such lens or disk         is   separated from
actual contact with the solution by surface-tension.  That the                                adhesion      ii
very different from that of    film may be shown by pouring
                                    a                                                    a    quantity       of
recently  distilled turpentine, for example, on the surface of                                chemicallv
clean      water, and scraping upon             it    some      fragments     of   camphor;            these
will    be immediately covered          with    a     solution of camphor          in    the oil, which
solution         will form iridescent        films,    and      sail about    with       the camphor,
vigorously displacing the turpentine, and cutting     up into smaller disks

and lenses.   So in the case of supersaturated saline solutions, the oil-lem
isnot sufficiently in contact with the surface of the solution to allow                                of    tbt

     Asolution of ferrous sulphate, for example, at 0° Fahr. formed tetn-
hedral crystals at the surface, which spread downwards until the contents
of the tube became solid. In snow-water at 32° the frozen mass shrank from
the sides of the tube, formed into   smooth rounded mass, and gradually

nuclear particles from the air.
   Solutions of such a strength as to be only saturated at ordinary tempe
ratures, and therefore not sensitive to the action of nuclei, become very
much so by reduction of temperature below 32° Fahr.        Salts that con
tain   alarge amount of water of crystallization,  such as the zincic and
magnesic sulphates, require             only   a    small portion     of added          water    in   order

to form      supersaturated solutions, and they become more sensitive to the
action of nuclei      as the temperature falls, or, in other words, as they be
come more highly supersaturated.            Thus a very strong solution of calcic
chloride, which is not sensitive       to nuclei at 40° or 45°, becomes very much
so at 24° to 34°.
     The sodio-zincic sulphate contains only           4   proportionals of water of
crystallization, and hence its supersaturated solutions are not stable at
low temperatures. When freshly made, they may be reduced to 10°Fahr.
 withouts eparation of the salt ; but by repose, even in clean tubes and in
 the absence of nuclei, long crystals of the separated salts occupy the
 length of the tube, but they are invisible on account of having the same
 refractive index as that of the solution in which they are immersed. In
 the course of time, probably from the escape of vapour of water through
 the porous plug, they become visible.
     A solution of the ammonia zincic sulphate at 4° Fahr. formed beautiful
 large feathery crystals of an opaque white, which gradually filled the tube.
  They melted rapidly at 32°.
      A supersaturated solution of nickel sulphate resisted          a temperature   of
  6° Fahr.     Mixed with an equivalent weight of cupric sulphate, the two
  salts separate if the solution be exposed to the air, but in closed tubes the
  solution at 0° Fahr. forms beautiful feathery crystals, which melt rapidly
  nt  32°, without any separation     of salt.
      Similar phenomena      are produced    by a supersaturated solution of zinc
  sulphate    and potash alum      in equivalent proportions exposed to a tempe
  rature of 4° Fahr.       A  similar solution of the cupric and magnesic sul
  phates at —4° also became solid, and melted rapidly at 32°.
      Experiments were also made with the sodic and magnesic sulphates,
  cadmic, and some other sulphates.           The addition of potassic sulphate to
  other sulphates, in atomic proportions, forms double salts, which, so far
  as they were examined, do not form supersaturated solutions.
      The effect of low temperatures was in some cases to throw down a
  portion of the salts in the anhydrous form, upon which were formed by
  repose crystals of a lower degree of hydration than the normal salt. Some
   cases  of this kind  are described   in the paper.

other of      its usual sources,    always contaminated

    Furfuraniline hydrochlorate. — The beat method of preparing this salt
was to dissolve 46 parts aniline and 65 parts aniline hydrochlorate in 400
parts of warm alcohol, and then add 48 parts furfurol, likewise dissolved
in   400 parts spirit ; after the solutions were thoroughly mixed, they soli
dified in the course of a few minutes to a mass of crystals of the salt.
When cold, these were thrown on to a filter, freed from the mother
liquor by means of a vacuum filter, and washed with a small quantity of
coloured spirit.       They were then readily obtained in a pure state by re-
crystallization from boiling spirit.         The substance analyzed was dried in
 vacuo.

posited minute purple needles of the furfuraniline sulphate, contaminated,
however, with colourless crystals of aniline sulphate.  When an attempt

the purple colour disappeared, giving place to a pale brown.  Warm                               water

could be needed    in successive quantities of warm water, in order                                   to
remove  the ammoniacal salts and free ammonia.    The base, as thus pre

 X. " On       a Method of graphically representing the Dimensions and
        Proportions of the Teeth of Mammals." By Geobge Buse,
        F.R.S. Received May 20, 1870.
     Of all the hard parts of animals, the teeth, more especially for    palaeonto
 logies! purposes, undoubtedly afford the most constant and the most gene
 rally available characters.       Any plan, therefore, by which the study and
 ready comparison     of  these   organs may be facilitated and simplified cannot
 fail to be of some use to the zoologist and palaeontologist.
     Having myself found the method I am about to describe convenient in
 many instances, more particularly in the case of fossil mammals,            I   have
 been led to believe, by the representations      of several to whom   it has    been
 communicated, that it might be found useful by others, and consequently,
                                                                               '
 though at first sight but a trifling matter, worthy of a place in the Pro
            -
 ceedings of the Society.
    The characters afforded by the teeth        are derived from   their number,
 proportions (absolute and relative), and pattern.
    In many cases the pattern of the teeth must undoubtedly               be taken
 into account ; but in a very great number it will be found               that    the
 number and proportions, more particularly of the premolars and molars,
 are sufficient for the purpose of diagnosis, or, at any rate, that a knowledge
 of these particulars alone will reduce the necessity for further comparison
 within   a small compass.       A good illustration of this is afforded in the
 smaller Felidae, in which, owing to their high specialization, the pattern of
 the teeth is in the main so very closely alike as to render it of very little
 assistance   in diagnosis, though not altogether.
    The statement of the particulars above mentioned, in words or figures
 when numerous comparisons are needed, is tedious and laborious to both
 writer and reader ; and even in the most carefully arranged tables it is
 difficult without close attention to perceive at once differences which
 though minute are, from their constancy, important and in fact necessary
 for the diagnosis of nearly allied forms.
    My plan may be termed one for the graphic or diagrammatic represen
 tation of the absolute and relative or proportional dimensions and number
 of the premolar and molar teeth, or of those constituting the molar series,
 and which have appeared to me in most cases sufficient for the purpose in
view.     But of course the incisors and canines might be included in the
 scheme    if thought  requisite.
    The method in which these "odontograms" are prepared will be at once
obvious on inspection of the accompanying examples. Each horizontal line
in the figures, which represent the maxillary and mandibular molar series
of   a species, corresponds to a single tooth, whose extreme length or an-
tcro-posterior diameter is indicated by the extent of the lighter shade, and
its extreme breadth or transverse diameter by the darker shade.               Both
dimensions are, of course, measured from the same base-line.

    The respective                which may be taken with a pair of sharp-
                         measurements,
pointed caliper-compasses, having been pricked out upon the equidistant
horizontal lines, the points showing the length and breadth of each tooth
are connected by straight lines, and a sort of figure is thus obtained which,
in nearly all  cases, will be characteristic of the genus or family, and in
many   instances  sufficient to determine the species also. In some cases,
as for instance in Canis and Viverra, the odontograms are at first sight so
nearly alike that recourse must be had to the pattern of the teeth in addi
tion, as before alluded to.
   In order to render figures of this kind easily comparable inter se, it is
necessary     that they should be drawn upon some common scale for the
distance    between the horizonal lines. This                is,
                                              of course, entirely arbitrary,
all that   is                  should not be too great nor too small.
                requisite being that   it
   The accompanying odontograms are drawn upon scale of "25 inch=     a
6'35 ram., which appears convenient for the purpose and       suitable for
                                                                         ;    is
all teeth of the dimensions that readily admit of this mode of definition,
that is to say, which are neither too large, as those of the Elephant, nor
too small, as in the smallest mammals.
    Moreover,    if   the figures are drawn upon ruled paper, the actual measure
ment  of the size of the teeth can be read off at sight and with this object
                                                                      ;

  The examples selected to show the application of the method above
described have necessarily been limited to         very few. They include

and which, in the case of these animals,             is   almost confined to the lower teeth.

they show at   glance the differences between them.

in order to illustrate the uniformity of the generic type throughout       and         ;
amongst these forms, two will serve to show how the method may he used
in palseontological research. Plate IX. fig. 13 represents the dentition of the

more obvious.    The other figures are introduced merely to indicate the

spectrum   of  bright  lines to coincide  very nearly with the absorption
spectrum of some compounds of erbium.
  A few weeks since, when in Ireland,                                  I   made      the observation that the
spectrum of the ordinary lime-light contains bright lines-f.     Dr. Emerson
Reynolds, Director of the Laboratory of the Royal Dublin Society, kindly
undertook to make experiments to ascertain from the position of the hues

   In all the experiments described in this paper hydrogen alone was first

examination observed with the spectroscope.     Oxygen was then admitted

 which accompanies Bahr and Bunscn-s paper were seen, but the lines were
more distinct when a small proportion of oxygen was admitted.           With the
full proportion of oxygen, the light from the glowing erbia was more
intense, but the lines were not so well seen.        Even with the intense heat
 of the oxyhydrogen flame        I   was unable to trace the lines beyond the
limits of the solid erbia, though the line of sodium could       be seen for some
 distance from the erbia.     I found, however, that the lines appeared more
 distinct, in consequence,   probably, of their being brighter relatively to the
parts of the continuous       spectrum where they occur, when the slit was
directed from the side upon the gas immediately in front of the glowing
part of the erbia.
    The spectrum of bright lines obtained by means of the oxyhydrogen
flame agreed more completely with the absorption spectrum represented by
Bahr and Bunsen (No. 2 in their diagram) than the spectrum of bright
lines figured by those observers (No. 3).         The most important differences
occurred in the band in the red, which           showed two points of greatest
brightness, thus forming a double line with a little outstanding light, and
the line in the green at 05 of the scale, which was double, precisely as the
corresponding absorption-line is represented in spectrum No. 2 of the
diagram.
    Lime. —The experiments were made with the cylinders of lime prepared
for use with the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, and also with pieces of pure
caustic lime, but there was no sensible difference presented in the spec
troscope.
    The bright lines consisted of       a double line in the green, and several
bands in the orange and red, which were found to form a spectrum iden
tical with that which is produced when chloride of calcium is heated in the
flame of a Bunsen-s burner.
    When the spectroscope       was   directed to  a  point in the flame a little
above the incandescent portion of the lime, the lines appeared beyond the
bright continuous spectrum, showing that they are not produced by the
white-hot solid lime, but by the luminous vapour into which a portion of
the lime has been converted by the heat of the flame.
    Magnesia. — The commercial heavy oxide of magnesium was made into a
paste with distilled water, and formed into a small pellet upon the end of a
platinum wire.      The pellet of magnesia was slowly dried, and then placed
in the oxyhydrogen       flame.    I  was surprised  to see a spectrum  of bright
lines precisely similar to that which is produced by lime.            Chloride of
magnesium,     when  introduced into the Bunsen flame, gave a similar spec
trum.     I record these results as the oxide and chloride were those sold as
pure.     I found afterwards that a very small trace of lime may be detected
in magnesia by    means of the oxyhydrogen flame.
    I then took metallic magnesium, which I had found by the spectroscope
to be nearly pure, and formed from it magnesia and chloride of magnesium.

    When this magnesia, formed into. a small ball upon a wire, was sub

  jected to the oxyhydrogen flame, two bright bands were seen in the green.
   One of these was found to be coincident with the triple line of Fraunhofer's
   b, which distinguishes magnesium, and the other with a group of bright
   lines which is seen between b and F, nearly in the position of the brightest
   double line of nitrogen, when metallic magnesium is burnt in air.
       The chloride formed from magnesium, when introduced into the Bauson
   flame, gave the same bands, but the more refrangible         band was  exceedingly
   faint.
       When an induction-spark        was   taken from a wire covered with     cotton
   wool soaked with a solution        of the chloride, the lines   at b and the  more
   refrangible group were seen.         If  the heating-power of the spark      be in
  creased by the introduction of a Leyden jar, the band between 6               and F
  becomes scarcely distinguishable, while the lines peculiar to metallic          mag
  nesium are much more intense.            "When a spark is taken between electrodes
  of the   same specimen     of magnesium from which the chloride was formed,
  no trace of this band was detected.
      Baryta. — When pure caustic baryta is subjected to the heat of the
  oxyhydrogen flame, a brilliant spectrum is seen identical with the well-
  known spectrum which presents itself when chloride of barium is heated in
 the Bunsen flame.        Baryta furnishes a larger quantity of vapour than lime
 and magnesia, and therefore the lines could be traced to a greater distance
 from the solid baryta.
      Strontia. — Pure strontia was fused into a large bead upon a platurom
 wire.     When this bead was heated by the oxyhydrogen flame, the same
 spectrum of bright lines presented itself as is seen when chloride                  of
 strontium is placed in the flame of a Bunsen's burner.
     Zirconia. — One of the small pellets of zirconia prepared in France for       use
 with the oxyhydrogen blowpipe was found to give no trace of bright lines.
 This great fixity of zirconia as compared with lime is in agreement with the
 inalterability of the substance under the action of the oxyhydrogen flame.
     Alumina. — Pure alumina treated in the same way as the magnesia g«e
a continuous spectrum only, without any trace of bright lines.
      Glucina. — Glucina gave a bright line in the red, which         I found to be
 due to potassium.        Glucina, therefore, appears not to form vapour of       any
kind     under  the  heat of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe.
     Titanic acid gave a continuous spectrum without lines.
     Oxide   of uranium    a continuous spectrum without lines.
     Tungstic acid a continuous spectrum without bright lines.
     Molybdic acid a continuous spectrum without bright lines.
     Silica (precipitated)   a continuous spectrum without bright lines.
     Oxide of    cerium a  continuous   spectrum without bright lines.
     The question presents itself as to the nature of the vapour to which the
bright lines are due in the case of the earths, lime, magnesia, strontia, and
baryta.      Is it the oxide volatilized ? or is it the vapour of the metal reduced
by the heat in the presence of the hydrogen of the flame ? The experi

ments show that the luminous vapour is the same as that produced by the
exposure of the chlorides of the metals to the heat of the Bunsen gas-
flame.      The character common to these spectra of bands of some width, in
most    cases gradually shading off at the sides, is different              from that which
distinguishes the spectra of these           metals when used as electrodes in the
metallic state*.
    Roscoe and Clifton have investigated the different spectra presented by
calcium, strontium, and barium, and they " suggest that at the lower tem
perature of the flame or weak spark, the spectrum observed is produced by
the glowing vapour of some compound, probably the oxide, of the difficultly
reducible metal ; whereas at the enormously high temperature of the in
tense electric spark these compounds are split up, and thus the true spectrum
of the metal is obtained. In none of the spectra of the more reducible
alkaline metals (potassium, sodium, lithium) can any deviation or disap

pearance of the maxima of light be noticed on change of temperature "f.
    As the experiments recorded in this paper show that the same spectra
are produced by the exposure of the oxides to the oxyhydrogen flame,
Roscoe and Clifton's suggestion that these spectra are due to the volatiliza
tion of the compound of the metal with oxygen is doubtless correct.
    The similar character of the spectrum of the bright lines               seen when erbia
is rendered incandescent would seem to suggest whether this earth may not
be volatile in a small degree, as is the case with lime, magnesia, and some other
earths.      The peculiarity, however, of the bright lines of erbia, observed by
Bahr    and Bunsen, that they could not be seen in the flame beyond the limits
of the solid erbia,      deserves attention.       My own experiments to detect the
lines in the Bunsen gas-flame, even          when     a very thin wire was used, so as
to allow the erbia to attain nearly the heat of the flame, were unsuccessful.
The bright line in the green         appears,    indeed, to rise to a very small extent
beyond the continuous spectrum, but I was unable to assure myself
whether this appearance might not be an effect of irradiation.
    It is perhaps worthy of remark that the chlorides of sodium, potassium,
lithium,    csesium,    and rubidium give spectra of defined lines which are not
altered in character by the introduction of a Leyden jar, and which, in the
case of sodium, potassium, and lithium, we know to resemble the spectra
obtained when electrodes of the metals are used.                    Now all these metals
belong to the monad group ; it appeared therefore interesting to observe
the behaviour of the other metal belonging to this group.
    Chloride    of silver when introduced into the Bunsen flame gave no
lines.    The chloride was then mixed with alumina, which had been found
to give a continuous           spectrum    only, and exposed          to the oxyhydrogen

was      placed      on    cotton and subjected to the induction-spark               without         a
jar, the true metallic spectrum          was seen, as when silver electrodes                       are
used.
   The behaviour of silver, therefore,  similar to that of the other metals
                                                  is
of the monad group.    Now the difference in basic relations which known                 is
to exist between the oxides of the monatomic and polyatomic metals would
be in accordance with the distinction which the spectroscope                       shows      to   exist
in the behaviour               of the chlorides   ;     the   chlorides    of the       polyatomic
metals would              be   more   likely to split up in      the presence of         water into
oxides and hydrochloric acid.
   In the case of some of the oxides and chlorides,                  one or more        of   the lines
appeared  to agree with corresponding lines in the metallic spectra;   may                    it
be, therefore, that under some circumstances, as in the case  of magnesium
burning in air, the metallic vapour and the volatilized oxide may be simul
taneously present.

     " After you         the occurrence of two bright lines

pound probably present as an              impurity in the sample of limes used                  in   the
experiments.              If
                   this explanation was found to be true for lime, the bright
lines seen in the spectrum of erbia might possibly be accounted for in
a  similar manner.    In order to examine the matter fully, arranged the       I
experiments described below.
  " selected two oxides for comparison with erbia, viz. lime
     I                                                                             and magnesia.
As    it     seemed desirable to-prcpare these oxides          in precisely   the same        manner
as the erbia, some calcium              and magnesium nitrates were made chemically
pure to ordinary tests, and then used            in the preparation of the respective
oxides.
     " The oxyhydrogen flame             was employed as the     chief    source   of   heat.       The
hydrogen was made from zinc and sulphuric acid in the usual way, and the
oxygen from potassium chlorate.    As both gases are certain to     con                       be

moistened with syrupy phosphoric                      acid, and some magnesium nitrate
made to adhere.     The nitrate was then heated in the hydrogen name, and
a residue of magnesia obtained.     No lines were observed in the spectrum

tensely heated in the oxyhydrogen jet only a continuous spectrum was
seen*.
      " 2. Experiments with Lime. — A platinum wire of the same thickness as
the last was moistened with the phosphoric acid, some calcium nitrate was
then taken up in the loop, and heated in the hydrogen flame until a residue
of lime was obtained. At the outset the calcium-spectrum was observed, but
 the light speedily gave only a continuous spectrum.                  The lime and loop of
 wire were kept well enveloped in the hydrogen flame for nearly half an hour
 in order to ensure the complete decomposition of the nitrate.                   During this
 time no lines could be detected on the background of the continuous
 spectrum, or in the spectrum of the flame surrounding the lime. More
 hydrogen was now turned on and oxygen slowly admitted, the light being
 examined with the spectroscope during the time.                  When the proportion of
  oxygen had reached a certain point, faint traces of the two brightest Ca
  lines appeared on the bright background, and the intensity of these lines
  increased with the amount of oxygen admitted up to a definite extent.
  When a certain proportion of oxygen was exceeded, the hues became less
  distinct. The best results were obtained when the hydrogen was decidedly
  in excess of the oxygen in the flame, that is to say, more than in the pro
   portion of 2 : 1.
       " When the slit of the spectroscope was pointed in such a way that only
   the   light from the      flame surrounding the incandescent lime entered the
   instrument,      all the Ca lines and bands Were observed with great ease with
   out a continuous spectrum.            On looking at the mantle of flame with the
   naked eye it was easy to perceive a reddish tinge.               I next maintained the
   small fragment of lime at the highest temperature its supporting wire was
   capable of resisting for three hours ; at the end of this time the Ca lines
   were as strongly marked as before, and the lime on the wire had very
    appreciably diminished in amount.            The same results were obtained when
    no phosphoric acid was employed to attach the calcium nitrate to the wire
    in the first instance.
       " Again,    a piece  of well-burned quicklime, of very small         size, was heated
    alone on a platinum       wire for more than an hour, and the bright Ca lines
    were seen     during the whole time.
       "   From the results of these experiments,       we must draw the      conclusions(l)
    that when lime is sufficiently heated the light which it emits is derived in
    part from the incandescent solid, and partly from ignited vapour ; (2) that
    lime is either volatile as such, or that in the first instance it suffers reduc
    tion by the excess of hydrogen in the flame, the luminous vapour of calcium
     then giving its own peculiar spectrum.

 The erbia lines were most distinctly seen when the slit of the spectroscope
 took in the light from the extreme edge of the incandescent solid. Vhen
 the bright lines were best observed, the continuous spectrum was relaurerf
 faint.         Again, when the slit       was made to cut the edge                   of   the ignited       bead
 of the earth, the strong green line of erbia was seen to extend to                                        a   very
 small but appreciable distance above or below (as the case might                                           be)   the

candescent erbia.
     " The
        erbia was next heated in the oxyhydrogen flame to the maximum
temperature that the wire would bear for three and a half hourt, but the
green  line was seen to be just as strongly marked at the end as at the
beginning of the experiment.   The bulk of the erbia was so much reduced
 by   this treatment, that          I   have now scarcely           a   trace left.
     " From the results of these experiments,                    I      think   we must conclude                   (1)
that the light emitted by incandescent erbia     derived chiefly from theis
ignited solid, but that the bright lines observed in its spectrum have as
their         source    a vapour of extremely low tension at even the
                            luminous
highest temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame (2) that this interrupted  ;
spectrum belongs either to erbium or to its oxide.

to the ordinary law.

       would appear that in these experiments three substances have                                          been
employed, varying   their degree of volatility.

oxyhydrogen flame magnesia appears to be less volatile than lime but                              ;        I      am
in doubt what relative volatility to assign to erbia, since its spectrum                                           of
bright lines can be seen when the earth      heated in the plain hydrogen

   " Finally, we have yet to learn whether or not in all these cases reductiou
of   the oxide precedes volatilization            ;   if   reduction takes place, the                 luminous
vapour          must be      that  of the metal.             The settlement of this                   question

    Although in the measurement of small quantities of radiant heat by
means of the thermopile much may be done towards increasing the sensi
bility of the apparatus by carefully adjusting the galvanometer and ren
dering the needle as nearly astatic as possible, there must necessarily be
some limit to this, and  therefore appears desirable that the principles on
                              it
which thermopiles of great sensibility can be constructed should also be
carefully attended to.
  With the view of obtaining    pair of thermopiles of greater sensibility

sensibility of the thermopile is much increased by redaction of its m&s«,
and more especially by a diminution of the cross section of the elements.
   To obtain a clear idea of the problem before us, which is, hnw to con
struct the thermopile so that, with a given amount of radiant heat falling
on its face, the greatest current may be sent through the galvanometer,
let us consider the thermopile under two different conditions : —
     1.    With the circuit open.
    2. With the circuit complete.
    In the first case, when radiant                heat         falls on the face   of the   pile,   the
whole mass of metal rises    in temperature, the rise being greatest at the
anterior face, and less and less as you approach the other end.   This rise
of temperature will increase till the heat radiated from the anterior faci*,
together with that which traverses the depth of the pile and is radiated
from the posterior face, is just equal to that radiated to the anterior face
at that moment, or when
                                                       sc
                               k(t+tf)=kt + 1 (<-t')= Q,

mean conductibility of the material of the pile, (Q) the quantity of heat
falling on the pile in unit of time, and (k)
                               a               constant.           a
   Let us now suppose the circuit completed, and we shall have,       addi                    in
tion to the above, two causes operating to reduce the temperature of the
anterior face, — the abstraction of heat the electric current, and propor
                                                        is by
tional to that current             =LI,   where the intensity
                                                   I                            of the current       aad

the smaller the other two terms become   and therefore as long as the first

           in the pile    is
cuit, we shall increase the intensity of the current by every reduction
of the cross-section of the elements of the thermopile.
   There   another point which, though less important, cannot be entirely
                    is
lost sight of, namely, that the more we reduce the mass of the anterior
face and adjacent parts of the pile, the more rapidly will the temperature
rise to its state of equilibrium, and therefore the more convenient will                              it
be for use where the needle      liable to disturbances from various causes,
                                         is
and where consequently the more speedily the needle can be brought to
rest, the more accurately will its observed motion be        measure of the      a
radiant heat falling at that moment on the face of the pile.
   Let us now compare the case of       single pair of small cross-section

that of     pile of (n) pairs, each of equal dimensions with those of the
            a
single pair, the area of face being the same in the two cases.
   By increasing the number of elements from one to n, we increase the
number of solderings in that proportion ;        consequently the average

amount of heat reaching any soldering is                            as great as that reaching the
soldering of the single pair ; therefore, if the same percentage of the
total heat be lost by conduction, the total electromotive force is the same
in the two cases. But inasmuch as the total cross-section of metal to
conduct the heat away from the anterior face is n times as great in the
pile as in the pair, and the resistance of the pile is n times as great as
that of the pair, the pile will be inferior in power to the pair, unless
these two causes of inferiority are counterbalanced by the loss due to the
greater average distance to the soldering from the points where the heat
reaches the face, in the case of the pair, than that of the pile of n pairs.
  The experiments already referred to                        were    made   with three different
thermoelectric pairs.   These consisted each of a                       pair of bars of bismuth
and an alloy of twelve pnrts of bismuth and one                         part of tin of different
thicknesses, of about equal lengths in each case, and soldered about                                     |   inch
apart upright, on disks of sheet copper of                |   inch diameter.               A slip of wood
was placed between the two bars, to protect them from injury, and to which
they were fixed with thread.    The three piles were compared with a pile of
four   elements,      made by Messrs.         Elliott, and the deviation          due to the latter
being taken equal to unity, the following                     deviations were obtained for the

   Although the above experiments        are far less    complete than    I  could
have wished, they are sufficient to show that the sensibility of thermo
piles may be considerably increased by diminution of the section of the
bars composing them ; whether they may be with advantage reduced to a
greater extent than   I  have already done    I  cannot say, but    I  am inclined
to think that they may.     I have ascertained from Messrs. Elliott that the
alloys used by them in the construction of thermopiles, at the time when
I received mine from them, were 32 parts of bismuth + 1 part of anti
mony, and 144- of bismuth + 1 part of tin.        If allowance be made for the
substitution of the first of these   two alloys for pure bismuth, the differ
ence between Elliott-s pile and the pairs II. &      III.  will be rather greater.
The pile by Messrs. Elliott, if made of the same metals as            I employed,
would have been reduced in power from 1 to 0-9.
   The construction of thermo-couples, on the plan           I have described, is
comparatively easy.                            I
                        In about two hours was able to make one, and in
more experienced hands their construction would be still easier.
   An experiment was made with one of the piles to ascertain whether,
when the heat was not directed centrally on the pile, much diminution of
power would take place. There was less deviation in consequence of the
increase of the mean distance which the heat had to travel before it
reached the soldering ; but    I believe that this defect might be remedied,
probably without diminution of the power of the pile, by increasing the
thickness of the face, and leaving the dimensions of the bars the same.
