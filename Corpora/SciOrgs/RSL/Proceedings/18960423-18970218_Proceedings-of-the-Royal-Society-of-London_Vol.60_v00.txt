    An oral communication was made by Professor J. A. Fleming-,
 F.R.S., on behalf of Professor Dewar and himself, to the following-
effect : —
    In continuing our experiments      on the electrical  resistance of bis
muth at low temperatures and in magnetic fields, by the aid of a
powerful electro-magnet, kindly lent to us by Sir David Salomons,
we have observed the fact that a wire of electrolytic bismuth, when
cooled in liquid air to a temperature of —186° C, has its resistance
increased more than forty-two times if it is at the same time trans
versely magnetised in a field of 14,000 units.          The bismuth, when
cooled in liquid air and thus magnetised, has its electrical resistance
increased more than fifteen times, even when compared with its
resistance at ordinary temperatnres and not in a magnetic field.
There is no reason to believe we have reached the limits of this
increase.     We resei-ve further details for a full communication to the
Royal Society later.

   Crystals belonging to the monoclinic or anorthic systems are rarely
obtained in which the optical orientation            is such that a large
crystal face is so nearly perpendicular to a bisectrix that the
apparent optic axial angle as observed in air can be directly measured
by means of the ordinary Fuess apparatus.                 It thus becomes

8                            Mr. W.   J. Pope.
 necessary   to  first grind plates of known orientation for optical
 examination; this latter operation is by no means easily performed,
 especially in the case of brittle organic substances. Very usually,
 however, crystals belonging to the biaxial systems are obtained in
which an optic axis apparently emerges into air through a particular
face ; in these cases the accurate measurement of the angle between
the apparent direction in air of the optic axis and the normal to the
crystal plate becomes an important element in the determination of
the optical constants of the crystal.
   The ordinary method of determining this angle is a direct one ;
the crystal is adjusted in the optic axial angle apparatus and a read
ing is taken for the above emergence, after the position of the
normal to the plate has been found by reflecting a beam of light
down the telescope tube and turning the crystal until the shadow
and reflected image of the crosswires coincide ; the angular differ
ence between the two readings is then the required apparent angle
of emergence into air. This method of finding the position of the
normal is, however, very tedious, and, unless the crystal plate pos
sesses a highly polished surface, very inaccurate.
   To remedy these defects a method has been devised of indirectly
determining this angle by calculating it from the angle through
which the optic axis is apparently refracted by an oil of high refrac
tive index.     The crystal is mounted and adjusted in the optic axial
angle apparatus in the ordinary way, and a reading is taken for the
optic axial emergence in air; a parallel-sided glass cell containing
a-bromonapkthalene or some other highly refractive liquid is then
raised until it surrounds the crystal, and a second reading is taken
of the apparent emergence of the optic axis. From the difference
between these two angular readings the angle of emergence into air
can be calculated, if the index of refraction of the oil is known.

      In the figure, OA is an optic axial direction in the crystal, OB is
  the direction of optic axial emergence- into air, and OC is the direc

 normal to the crystal plate.         Then a, the angle of emergence into air,
 is NOB, whilst 0, the angle of emergence into the liquid is NOC

a   form more convenient than (1) for logarithmic calculation.
      To test the accuracy of the method, measurements have been made
on biaxial plates of different optical properties, liquids of various re
fractive indices being used.              The index of refraction of the liquid
employed      is conveniently   determined      with the Pulfrich refractometer ;
the refraction is so affected by differences of temperature and of
purity that it is necessary to determine it for the liquid as actually
used; the liquid does not need to be specially purified. The measure
ments given in the two appended tables were made on plates of
topaz, each of them cut perpendicularly to tho acute bisectrix.               By
measurement of the optic axial angles, the apparent emergences into
air for sodium light were found to be 53° 24' and 54° 42', respec
tively.
      These two sets of measurements suffice to show that the method
                                                                             —0

that, as would of course be expected, the most accurate results are
obtained with liquids of high refractive index, which give com
paratively large values of a — 0. By determining the values of a. — O
for each of two optic axes of a given crystal plate, it can easily be
ascertained with what amount of accuracy the plate has been cut
perpendicularly to the bisectrix.

advantageously employed in other branches of optical investigation.
" On Colour Photography by the Interferential Method."                By
      (t. Lippmann, Professor of Physics, Faculty of Sciences,
      Paris.    Communicated by Sir Joseph Lister, Bart., P.R.S.
      Received April 14,— Read April 23, 1896.
   Colour photographs of the spectrum, or of any other object, are
obtained by the following method. A transparent photographic film
of any kind has to be placed in contact with a metallic mirror during

                Photography by the Interferential Method.                 11
 exposure.     It is then developed and fixed by the usual means em
 ployed in photography, the result being a fixed colour photograph
 visible by reflected light.
    The mirror is easily formed by means of mercury.         The glass plate
carrying the film being inclosed in a camera slide, a quantum of
mercury is allowed to flow in from a small reservoir and fill the tack
part of the slide, which is made mercury-tight.         The plate is turned
 mth its glass side towards the objective, the sensitised film touching
the layer of mercury.        After exposure, the mercury is allowed to
flow back into its reservoir, and the plate taken out for development.
    The only two conditions necessary for obtaining colour, trans
parency of the film and the presence of a mirror during exposure,
are physical conditions.       The chemical nature of the photographic
layer has only secondary importance ; any substance capable of giving,
by means of an appropriate development, a fixed colourless photo
graph, is found to give, when backed by the mirror, a fixed colour
photograph.
   We may take, for instance, as a sensitive film, a layer of albnmeno-
iodide    of silver, with an acid developer ; or a layer of gelatino-
bromide of silver, with pyrogallic acid, or with amidol, as deve
lopers.     Cyanide or bromide of potassium may be as usual employed
for fixing the image.       In a word, the technics of ordinary photo
graphy remain unchanged.          Even the secondary processes of intensi
fication and of isochromatigation are employed with full success for
colour photography.
    The photographic films commonly in use are found to be opaque,
and formed, in fact, by grains of light-sensitive       matter mechanically
imprisoned by a substratum of gelatine, albumen, and collodion.
What is here wanted is a fully transparent film, the light-sensitive
matter pervading the whole         of the neutral substratum.       How can
such a transparent       film be     realised ?    This question    remained
insoluble to me for many years, so that         I  was debarred trying the
 above method when        I  first thought of it.      The difficulty, how
ever, is simply solved by the following remark.           It is well known
that the precipitation of a metallic compound, such as bromide of
silver, does not take place in the presence of an organic colloid, such
 as albumen, gelatine, or collodion.     In reality, the metallic compound
 is formed, but remains invisible;        it is retained in a transparent
 modification by the organic snbstances.        We have only, therefore, to
prepare the films in the usual way, but with a stronger proportion         of
 the organic substratum ; the result is a transparent film.      By mixing,
 for instance, a gelatinous solution of nitrate of silver with a gelatinous
 solution of bromide of potassium, no precipitate is formed, and the
 resnlt is a transparent film of dry gelatine containing 15 and even 30
 per cent, of the weight of bromide of silver.

 1 2       On Colour Photography      by the Interferential Method.
     The colours reflected by the film are due to interference : they are
of the same kind as those reflected by soap bubbles or by Newton's
riDgs. When a ray of definite wave-length falls on the sensitive
plate, it is during exposure reflected back by the mirror, and then
gives rise to a set of standing waves in the interior of the film,
the distance between two successive loops being equal to half the
wave-length of the luminous ray. This system of standing waves
impresses its periodical structure on the film.          The photographic
deposit, therefore, takes the form of a grating, a continuous grating,
perfectly adapted for reflecting the particular luminous ray which has
given    it birth.
     This theory can be subjected to experimental proof. If we ex
amine a photograph of the spectrum, or any other object by white
light, we observe the following facts. (1.) Colours are seen in the
direction of specular reflection, and are invisible in every other
direction.      (2.) The colours change with the incidence ; the red
changing successively to green, blue, and violet, when the incidence
grows more oblique.          The whole image of the spectrum is dis
placed,    and  gradually passes into the infra-red region. (3.) If the
film be gradually moistened, the colour changes in the opposite
direction, from violet to red. This phenomenon is due to the swelling
up of the gelatine or albumen, causing the intervals between the
elements of the grating to become larger. The smaller intervals, corre
sponding to violet and blue light, gradually swell up to the values
proper to red and infra-red waves.        A photograph immersed in water
loses all its colours, these appearing again during the process of drying.
For the same reason, a freshly prepared plate has to be dried before
 the correct colours can be    finally seen.
     We have now to consider the case of compound colours, and to
generalise the former theory, which is only applicable to the action
of simple rays. I beg to subjoin an abstract of this generalised
theory.      It will be seen that if a compound ray of definite composi
tion impresses the plate, it gives rise during exposure to a definite
set of standing waves, which impress their structure on the film, and
impart to the photographic deposit a corresponding definite form.
 Though very complex, this can be described as made up of a number
of elementary gratings, each corresponding to one of the simple rays
 which contribute the impressing light.          When examined by white
 light, the reflected ray is shown to have the same composition as the
 impressing ray ; white light, for instance, imparts to the photographic
 deposit such a structure that it is adapted to reflect white light.
     The only a priori condition for the correct rendering of compound
 rays, is a correct isochromatisation of the film. This, again, can be
 practically effected by known processes, such as have been indicated
 by E. Becquercl, Vogel, Captain Abney, and others.

               Photographing with Monochromatic        Rays.             13
   Ab a  verification of this theory,    I   beg leave to project   on the
screen a  series of colour photographs, representing natural objeats :
pictures on stained gl&38, landscapes from nature, flowers, and a
portrait from life. Every colour in nature, including white, and the
delicate hue of the human complexion, is thus shown to be reflected
by a correctly developed photographic film.
   It is to be remarked that, as in the case of the spectrum, the
colours are visible only in the direction of specular reflection. If
I had tried to touch up these photographs by means of water colours
or other pigments, these would be made apparent by slightly turning
the photograph ; these pigments remaining visible under every in
cidence, they would thus be seen to stand out on a colourless back
ground.     Thus the touching up or falsifying by hand of a colour
photograph is happily made impossible.

      D.C.L., F.R.S. Received March 31,— Read April 30, 189b".
   In a paper " On the Production of Monochromatic            Light," com
municated to the Physical Society, and read on the 27th June, 1885,
                                '                          '
and which appears in the Philosophical Magazine              for August in
that same year,     I  stated  that  by the   apparatus  then   described a
monochromatic image of the sun could be thrown upon the screen.
In the same periodical for June of the same year, Lord Rayleigh
described a plan for obtaining a monochromatic image of an external
object, in which a concave lens was placed behind the slit of a spectro
scope to produce an image of the object in monochromatic colour,
the object being viewed through       an aperture placed in the spectrum
produced by the apparatus.        I  had been working independently at
the subject at the   same  time, and my object was to get an image on a
screen or photographic plate rather than to use the apparatus for
 visual observation.    When a lens is placed behind the spectrum in
 the maimer described in the paper above referred to, a white image
 of the prism can be obtained on a screen placed at some distance
 from the lens, and the size of the image can be increased or diminished
 according to the focal length of the lens, and its distance from the
 spectrum.     Evidently, then, if an image of a luminous object can
 be cast on the surface of the prism, and a slit be placed in the
 spectrum, the image of the luminous object will be seen of the
 colour of the light passing throngh the slit.          There are devices
 adopted at the present time for photographing the sun with light of
 various wave-lengths, but, as far as      I  am aware, they depend upon
  moving the image of the sun across the slit of the spectroscope, the

  plate moving across the slit in the spectrum at the requisite rate for
  the various impressions made by the different parts of the sun's image
  to coalesce. It had struck me some time since that the method thus
  indicated nearly eleven years ago might be more convenient than
                               I
  that adopted, but the time had at my disposal prevented my carry
  ing out a continuation of my experiments. Recently          I have had
  occasion to take up this subject for a rather different purpose, and as
 the method seems to have been untried,     I give it in more detail than
  I did then.
     My investigation called for a determination of the proportions of
 various rays emitted by the various parts of the carbon of the positive
 and negative poles of an electric arc light, and for this purpose the
 system of forming monochromatic images was found to be useful.
 The points of the electric light EL (fig. 1) were placed so that a beam
 of light passed through the slit S of the collimator on to the centre of
 the collimating lens L2. A convex lens Li of shorter focus than La was
 placed in the path of the rays, and so adjusted that a real image of the
 poles was formed on L3.     These passed through the lens L2 as nearly
 parallel rays and  struck upon the prism, and then passed through the
remainder of the apparatus as sketched in fig. 2, where M is the
 prism, L3 a lens to bring the rays to a focus as a spectrum on ab
after passing through a camera, A. Lj is a lens, shown in the figure
connected with a camera, B, which brings the image of the prism and
the bright image cast on it to a focus at P. By placing a slit Sa in
the spectrum, the image cast on P will be as monochromatic as the
light coming through the slit. Li should be of such a focal length
that it should be as near the slit as possible. With this arrangement
it is very curious to watch the variations in the brightness of the arc
and of the flame which accompanies the movement of the slit through
the spectrum, and as each variation can be photographed on a Cadett
polychromatic photographic plate, we can obtain records of all that is

               Determination     of Coronal Light during Eclipse.                 15
occurring.        Farther, by using strips of lenses cut ont at suitable
distances      from the axes (fig. 3), images of various colours can be
placed side by side upon P, since a slit may be placed in the
spectrum opposite each such strip of lens.               Incidentally, I may men
tion that investigations into the cause of the variable nature of
different flames can be carried out by this plan.
     For solar work, a long collimator appears to be a necessity, bnt the
aperture need not be large.            Suppose we determine to have an image
of the sun on P (fig. 2) of 2 in. diameter, the image on M need not
be more than 1 in. at most.           For this purpose we must have a colli
mator 10 ft. long.         Two lenses of this focal length can be fixed one at
each end, and a slit in front of that lens which is presented to the
sun's rays.         The arrangements followed will be the same as those
given for the electric light. There appears no difficulty in producing
a monochromatic image of almost any size if the collimator be suffi
ciently long and the face of the prism sufficiently large to take in the
whole of the image cast on it.*
    I   have replaced the prism by fiat refraction gratings with most
satisfactory results.         The gratings    I employed had about 6,000 and
12,000 lines to the inch.            The images were sharply defined, but, of
course, weaker than when the prism was employed.                     For solar work
this   should    not  be  an  objection, since  there   is plenty  of  light to work
with.
   I show somo        pictures taken by the plan      I   have described. For my
purpose the images are sufficiently sharp, although simple uncorrected
lenses have been employed.

p. 363, with certain    slight modifications suggested by their experience
on that occasion.       Two sets of observations were made : the first
with a photometer equatorially monnted, and designed to measure
the comparative brightness of the corona at different distances from
the moon's limb, and the second with an instrument arranged to
measure the total brightness of the corona, excluding as far as
possible the sky effect.     In both cases the principle of photometry was
that of Bunsen, the intensity of the coronal light being compared
with that of a standard glow-lamp, according to the method of Abney
and Festing.
    The measurements with the equatorial photometer were made by
Dr. Thorpe, assisted by Mr. P. L. Gray, B.Sc, those with the second
or integrating instrument were made by Mr. Jas. Forbes, jun., assisted

by Mr. Willoughby, of H.M.S.
    The mean of ten concordant readings with the integrating photo
meter reduced to values of light intensity and expressed in Siemens*
units was 0"026.
    The measurements with the equatorial photometer show that the
visual brightness of the corona of the 1893 eclipse varied within
comparatively wide limits, and that, at all events close to the moon's
limb, there was marked variation in local intensity.             If the several
values taken in the direction of the poles and equator are grouped as
in the former paper (loc. cit.), they are found to afford a curve almost
identical in character with that already given, showing that the
diminution in intensity from the moon's limb outwards               is less rapid
than accords with the law of inverse squares.

    These numbers would appear to show that the actual brightness of
 the corona was probably not very dissimilar at the two eclipses, the
 slight apparent diminution observed during the 1893 eclipse being,

 in all probability,  due to the haze, or opalescence, in the air which
 prevailed   at the time. This haze, caused more by snspended and
finely divided solid matter than by precipitated moisture, undoubtedly
contributed to the general sky-illumination at the time of totality.
The actual gloom during this phase of the eclipse at Fundium was
certainly much less than at Grenada in 1886.              It must not be for
gotten,  however,    that the altitude    of the   sun was very different on
the two occasions.       At Grenada it was only about 19° : the amount
of cloud was from seven to eight (overcast = 10) at the time of to
tality, and much of the cloud was in the neighbourhood of the sun :
whereas at Fundium the sun's altitude was 52°, and the sky was of
a bluish-grey colour and practically free from cloud.
   The effect of these different conditions in the sky in the neighbour
hood of the disc is seen in Mr. Forbes' measurements when com
pared with those of Lieutenant Douglas, at Grenada.               The ten fairly
concordant observations at Fundium give, as already stated, an
average value of 0 026 Siemens units at 1 ft. from the screen ; and
the value observed by Lieutenant Douglas, 15 seconds after totality,
with the same photometer, although with a different lamp and galva
nometer, was 0-0197 light units.

   The memoir first gives reports by Mr. Fowler and Mr. Shackleton
as to the cirenmstances under which photographs of the spectra of
the eclipsed sun were taken wi'h prismatic cameras in West Africa
and Brazil respectively on April 16, 1893.          These are followed by a
detailed description of the phenomena recorded, and a discussion of
the method employed in dealing with the photographs.                The coronal
spectrum and      the  question   of  its possible  variation,   and  the wave
lengths of the lines recorded in the spectra of the chromosphere and
prominences, are next studied.
   Finally, the loci of absorption in the sun's atmosphere are con
sidered.
   The inquiry into the chemical origins of the chromospheric and
prominence lines is reserved      for a subsequent memoir.
   The general conclusions which have been arrived at are as

short exposures, so that the phenomena can be recorded at short
intervals during the eclipse.
     (2) The most intense images of the prominences are produced by
the H and K radiations of calcium.             Those depicted by the rays of
hydrogen      and  helium   are less intense,  and  do not reach to so great n
height.
     (3) The forms of the prominences photographed in monochromatic
 light (H and K), during the eclipse of 1893, do not differ sensibly
from those photographed at the same time with the coronagraph.
     (4) The undoubted spectrum of the corona in 1893 consisted of
 eight rings, including that due to 1474 K. The evidence that these
 belong to the corona is absolutely conclusive.            It is probable that
 they are only represented by feeble lines in the Fraunhofer spectrum,
 if present at all.
      (5) All the coronal rings recorded were most intense in the
 brightest coronal regions, near the sun's equator, as depicted by the
 coronagraph.
      (6) The strongest coronal line, 1474 K, is not represented in the
 spectrum of the chromosphere and prominences, while H and K do
 not appear in the spectrum of the corona, although they are the most
 intense radiations in the prominences.
      (7) A comparison of the results with those obtained in previous
 eclipses confirms the idea that 1474 K is brighter at tho maximum
 than at the minimum sun-spot period.
      (8) Hydrogon rings were not photographed in the coronal spec
 trum of 1893.
      (9) D3 was absent from the coronal spectrum of 1893, and reasons
 are given which suggest that its recorded appearance in 1882 was
 simply a photographic effect due to the unequal sensitiveness of the
  isochromatic plate employed.
      (10) There is distinct evidence of periodic changes of the con
  tinuous spectrum of the corona.
      (11) Many lines hitherto unrecorded in the chromosphere and
  prominences were photographed by tho prismatic cameras.
      (12) The preliminary investigation of the chemical origins of the
  chromosphere and prominence lines enables us to state generally that
  the chief lines are due to calcium, hydrogen, helium, strontium, iron,
  magnesium, manganese, barium, chromium, and aluminium.                   None
  of   the lines  appear  to be  due  to  nickel, cobalt,  cadmium,   tin,  zinc,
  silicon, or carbon.
      (13) The spectra of the chromosphere and prominences become
  more complex as the photosphere is approached.
      (14) In passing from the chromosphere to the prominences, some

   Although       some   account of his recent discoveries in Somaliland
(tropical Africa)        has already been given to the Anthropological
Institute by Mr. Seton-Karr, and has been published in their Journal,*
these discoveries seem to me to have so wide an interest, and such an
important bearing on the question of the original home of the human
race, that    I  venture to call the attention of this Society to them.
    In the course of more than one visit to Somaliland for sporting
purposes, Mr. Seton-Karr noticed, and brought home for examination,
a number        of worked flints, mostly of no great size, which he laid
before the Anthropological Section of the British Association, at the
meeting last year at Ipswich.f           Although many of these specimens
were broad flat flakes trimmed along the edges so as to be of the
"le Moustier type" of M. Gabriel de Mortillat, and although tho
general facies of tho collection was suggestive of the implements
being of palaeolithic age, they did not afford sufficient evidence to
 enable a satisfactory judgment to be formed whether they undoubtedly
 belonged to the palaeolithic period.

20      On some Palaeolithic Implements   found in Somaliland.
   Before returning to Somaliland, Mr. Seton-Karr visited my collec
tions, and studied the various forms of implements found in the
river-gravels and Pleistocene deposits in different parts of the world,
so as to become familiar with their leading features; and on revisiting
Somaliland during the past winter, he was fortunate enough to meet
with a large number of specimens in form absolutely identical with
some from the valley of the Somme and other places which he had
seen in my collection.
   Of this identity in form there can be no doubt, and though at
present no fossil mammalian or other remains have been found with
the implements, we need not hesitate in claiming them as palaeolithic.
They seem to be scattered all over the country, and to have been
washed out of sandy or loamy deposits by the action of rain, or, in
some instances, to have been laid bare by the wind.       They appear
also to occur most frequently in the neighbourhood of existing water
courses, which is at all events suggestive of the beds in which they
occur having been in some manner the result of river-action.          It
is, however, at present premature to enlarge on the circumstances of
their discovery. Their great interest, consists in the identity of their
forms with those of the implements found in the Pleistocene deposits
of North Western Europe and elsewhere. Any one comparing the
implements from such widely separated localities, the one with the
other, must feel that if they have not been actually made by the same
race of men, there must have been some contact of the closest kind
between the races who manufactured implements of such identical
forms. Those from Somaliland occur in both flint (much whitened
and decomposed by exposure) and in quartzite, but the implements
made from the two materials are almost indistinguishable in form.
Those of lanceolate shape are most abundant, but the usual ovate and
other forms are present in considerable numbers.
    Turning westward from Somaliland we meet with flint implements
of the same character found by Professor Flinders Petrie at a height
of many hundred feet above the valley of the Nile. A few have
been discovered in Northern Africa, they recur in the valley of the
Manzanares in Spain, in some districts in Central Italy, and abound
 in the river-valleys of France and England. Turning eastward we
 encounter implements of analogous forms, one found by M. Chantre
 in the valley of the Euphrates, and many made of quartzite in the
laterite deposits of India ; while in Southern Africa almost similar
 types occur, though their age is somewhat uncertain.
    That the cradle of the human family must have been situated in
some part of the world where the climate was genial, and the means
 of subsistence readily obtained, seems almost self-evident ; and that
 these discoveries in Somaliland may serve to elucidate the course by
  which human civilisation, such as it was, if not indeed the human

subject     for  speculation.        But, under any circumstances, this dis
covery aids in bridging over the interval between paleolithic man
in Britain and in India, and adds another link to the chain of
evidence by which the original cradle of the human family may
eventually be identified, and tends to prove the unity of race between
the inhabitants of Asia, Africa, and Europe, in Palaeolithic times.

        Sir G. G. Stokes, Bart., F.R.S. Received April 14 —

    The molecular distribution of the metals in alloys of gold and of
metals of the platinum group has been described by me at some
length, in a series of papers which have already been published by the
 Royal Society.*          New interest in the subject has, however, arisen in
 connexion with the extraordinary development in various parts of the
 world especially in South Africa, of certain processes which are now
 employed for extracting gold from its ores.                     Their use has been
 attended with the introduction into this country of a series of alloys
 of gold and the base metals which have hitherto rarely been met
 with in metallurgical industry.              The base metals associated with the
 gold in these cases are nsually the very ordinary ones lead and zinc,
 but their presence in the gold has given rise to unexpected difficul
 ties, as the distribution of the precious metal in the ingots which
 reach     this country is so peculiar, that it is not possible to estimate
 the    value of the ingots by taking the pieces of metal required for
 the assay, by any of the well-known methods now in use.
     The grouping of the metal in these ingots presents mnch scientific
 as well as        industrial interest, and the following is a brief state
  ment of the facts which have been observed.
     A. An ingot of gold weighing 3-545 kilograms was assayed with a
  view to subjecting it to the ordinary operation of refining.                    A piece
  of metal     was, therefore, cnt from the base of the ingot at the point
  marked     A, and the following are the results of four assays made
  on this piece     of metal : —
                              Gold    1                6658

   There was also 0'061 part of silver present in 1000 parts of the
mass, the remainder being base alloy.
   Another set of assays from the same ingot, but from the opposite
end, at the point marked B, gave the following results : —
                      1             4299
                      2             459-5
                      3             439 0
                      4             429-0    Silver          0"071
                Average     ....    439 35
   The difference in the amount of gold between the two opposite
ends of the ingot was, therefore, no less than 223'10 parts in 1000.
The base metal present was proved by analysis to be chiefly zinc,
lead, and copper, as the following results will show on metal taken
by a " dip," t'.e., from the molten metal : —
                         Zinc                        150

at different parts of the ingot the following results by assay :—

  Average of the whole number
         of the assays made    ....    5762         0090
   It  became evident, therefore, that the only method of determining
the true quality of this ingot consisted in actually separating the
pold and silver in mass, and this was effected by dissolving in nitro-
hydrochloric acid, the silver being recovered as chloride and reduced
to metallic silver, and the gold precipitated by iron chloride as pure
metallic gold.
    The result of this operation yielded
                     Gold                7 504 kilograms.
                     Silver              0-928
which showed that the standard fineness of the ingot       was
                           Gold                6140
                           Silver                75-8
and its true value £1,028 ; while the value, as calculated from the
average of the assays previously made,
                           Gold                   576

 woald have been only £965.
    Analysis proved that the metals present other than gold were
 as follows : —

                                                   1000
    The cause of the differences revealed by assays made from metal
cut from various parts of the ingot was clearly due to liquation ;
bnt previous experience failed to afford any guide to the probable
 distribution of the precious and base metals in the ingot.
    C. Another instance, and on a much larger quantity of gold alloy
than the two fornur examples, was afforded by an ingot weighing
39,625 kilograms, which showed such great variation in its gold con
tents at various points that the ingot was re-melted and cast into
two separate ingots, from which portions of metal were removed for
assay by   drilling.
   All  these    results fare the averages of assays made in triplicate,
and a "dip" assay from the melted metal showed that it contained
 701 parts of gold in 1000.
    The analysis of this metal gave —
                         Zinc                        7'1
                         Lead                        49

                                                   1000
   As in the former case, the gold and silver present were isolated
in mass, and the actual yield of fine gold and silver so obtained was
as follows : —

               On the  Liquation of certain Alloys of Gold.             25

which proved that the actual gold standard of the ingot was 703-9.
  The base metal in two similar ingots was found by analysis to be
composed as follows : —

from which it would appear that the presence of one or both of the
metals — zinc and lead — bears in some degree upon these variations
in quality — it being well known that gold will alloy, and be constaut
in quality, with either silver or copper or with both in almost any
proportions.
   Advancing progressively, I now cite an instance of irregular dis
tribution in a much baser alloy of gold.
   An ingot of base gold alloy (P. 13) weighing        9'570 kilograms.

    In  order to ascertain the effect exerted by these two metals — lead
and zinc — in conjunction with gold,      I prepared an alloy of 700 parts
pure gold and 300 parts pure lead, and after mixing and casting into
an open mould      I  cast the melted alloy into a spherical mould 2 in.
in diameter, made of cast iron. Determinations made from different
parts, after cutting the sphere into two halves, gave the following
results, the assays being made in triplicate upon each portion of

    The result shows a decided tendency of the gold           to liquate to the
centre   of the mass.
    In the next experiment gold     was alloyed   with lead and zinc in the
following proportions : —

 adding the zinc when the alloy of the first two metals was thoroughly
 fluid, and after casting this into an open mould, the alloy was
 remelted and cast into the 2-in. spherical mould before mentioned.
 This alloy was extremely hard and very brittle. Portions removed
 from the different parts of the sphere, after cutting it across, gave
 the following results : —

   There is evidence of re-arrangement by liquation in this case
which sends gold to the centre, but the result is complicated, as
gravity appears also to send gold to the lower portion of the spherical
mass.

Here   again, gravity appears to send gold to the lower portion of the
sphere.
   The question arises, does the silver play any part in the distribu

   I therefore melted sphere No. 3 with 10 per cent, of silver, so that
there were present: —

This sphere seems constant all over.
   In order to see what was the effect with pure gold alloyed with
metallic zinc only,  I cast an alloy of fine gold with 5 per cent, of
zinc into a 3-in. spherical mould.        The weight of the sphere was
3-438 kilograms.
   The results were as follows  : —

   The same alloy, containing 95 per cent< of gold and 5 per cent, of
zinc, was then alloyed with a further 5 per cent, of zinc and cast
into the same sphere. This weighed 4-218 kilograms.         The results
were as follows : —

   Feeling a little diffident about these results, 1 recast the foregoing

   The results were as follows : —

    This shows that there is still a tendency in this gold alloy with
 10 per cent, of zinc to become enriched towards the centre.

   It is abundantly evident therefore, that zinc alone will not account
for the differences in the ingots of impure gold ; and the question
arose, will the presence of a definite amount of silver in any way
prevent the irregularity in composition ?
   To test this I alloyed the gold, which contained 15 per cent, of zinc
so that it might also contain 7'5 per cent, of silver.
   This was cast into the 3-in. sphere and weighed 3'934 kilograms,
and assays made on portions of metal cut from it gave the following
results  : —

 the extra richness   of the gold over 77-5 being due to the volatilisa
 tion of the zinc.  This experiment appears to confirm that on pp. 27,
28 (see results of fig. 4).
    The foregoing experiments show that lead is far more effective as a
cause of liquation than zinc, and the question arises, do zinc and lead
separate into distinct layers by gravity when they are simultaneously
present in a mass of gold, as they are known to do when they (lead
and zinc) are melted together and allowed to solidify slowly.                    If they
do separate, are they respectively associated with precious metal 't
Professor Roberts-Austen has given us a method of investigating
such a problem.       He has shown that it is easy to place a suitably
protected thermo-junction in a mass of cooling alloy, and obtain by
photography a record of the cooling of the mass,* a method which
was employed by me for determining the temperatures at which the
metals arsenic and antimony separate from bismuth.                             Applying
this method to a mass weighing 44 grams of an alloy containing : —

    From this it will be evident, from the horizontal position (6) (of
 the curve No. I) that the mass solidifies as a whole at 635° C. ; bat
 there is a second break c in the curve at a temperature of 407° C. ;
and there is yet a third break at d, 247° C. These latter points
 evidently are connected with the solidifying points of lead and zinc,
 but it is probable that these metals are, in solidifying, associated with
some gold.
    The second curve, No. II, represents the cooling of the same mass
of gold with 10 per cent, of silver added.         It will be seen that the
metal has still one main solidifying point b, at 645° C. The lower
point (c) of the former curve is entirely absent, but there is an
indication of the lead point at 206°.         The results clearly indicate
that silver is a solvent common to both zinc and lead, which are not,
as in the previous case (Curve I) free to separate from each other.
 Such a mass should be fairly uniform in composition, and assays from
 different portions of it proved it to be so.

    The latter curve  (II) seems to change its    direction at 767°, which
is above the main solidifying point of the mass, and it remains to be
seen whether this is of any significance.
    The inspection of the curves so obtained at once led me to infer
that silver must be a solvent for zinc and lead when these are present

lead to produce a similar metal to P. 13 (see p. 25), say : —

and this     was  cast into two   spheres, a 2-in. sphere and a 3-in.

   This alloy was so hard and brittle that I was compelled to cut
these spheres into two by sawing them.       When so cut asunder it was
evident that the upper portions of both these spheres had a marked
white appearance, as compared with the lower portions, which
possessed the yellow colour of gold.         The 3-in. sphere weighed
3 484 kilograms.      Portions removed from these two spheres at the
points indicated showed the following results : —

half tho united amounts of zinc and lead present in the alloy).
   This, cast into the 3-in. spherical mould, showed the following
results at the points indicated.     In appearance, the metal, when sawn
in two, was homogeneous. The weight of the sphere was 3"459 kilo
grams.

      There is   still evidence of liquation of gold towards the centre, but
comparison        of fig. 12 with those which immediately precede it will
show how    greatly the arrangement of the alloy has been modified by
the presence of the additional 8 per cent, of silver.   The proportion
of silver in this alloy was proved by assay to be 15"5 per cent.
   As there was still evidence of liquation, the metal was cast with
still more silver, making 20 per cent, of silver in all.     The alloy,
when cast into a mould, proved to be almost uniform in composition,
the difference between the centre and the extreme portions being very
slight.
  Liquation had practically ceased, a fact which proves incontest-
ably that silver is the solvent for the base metals, zinc and lead,

                     Alloys of gold with base metals, notably with
lead   and zinc, now largely often met with in industry,        have
the gold concentrated   towards the centre and lower portions, which
renders it impossible to ascertain their true value with even an
approximation to accuracy.
   (2) When silver is also present these irregularities are greatly
modified.
    The method of   obtaining "cooling-curves" of the alloys shows
that the freezing points are very different when silver is present and
when it is absent from the alloy.
  (3) This fact naturally leads to the belief that if the base metal
present does not exceed 30 per cent., silver will dissolve it and form
a   uniform alloy    with gold.
   (i) This conclusion is sustained by the experiments illustrated by
figs. 9, 10, 11, 12, which, in fact, gradually lead up to

form the subject of another communication         dealing with the chem
istry of the process.
   Some    of the photographs were remarkably fine in definition, and
they extended from the less refrangible limit of the red rays to the
ultra-violet, about wave-length 3240.
   It may be mentioned here, however, that every line and band in
the different spectra was identified.          Some of the photographs
afforded evidence of very unusual constituents in the mixture of
gases and vapours, which by their combustion and incandescence
give the Bessemer flame. The identity of these conld have been
established only by means of very complete investigation of oxy-
hydrogen blowpipe spectra.          Apart from all technical considera
tions which were kept in view, and of such purely scientific -questions
as were involved in similar previous researches carried out by one of
us, the examination of these spectra was of great interest, more
especially because of the proof of the rare element, gallium, being
present in the Bessemer metal, and in the roasted ore from which
it was extracted. It was shown by very careful analyses that the
gallium was concentrated in the iron, but all details of the operations
involved in its separation and of the quantitative determinations are
reserved for a future communication.
   The evidence of the existence of gallium in the ore and in the
metal rests on the measurements of the wave-lengths of the lines in
a large number of photographed           spectra and upon the relative
strengths of the lines in the different materials examined and in the
precipitates obtained therefrom.
   The following examples show the nature of this evidence : —
               1. Evidence from the Bessemer Flame Spectra.
   Seventy-six of the photographed spectra of the Bessemer flame
contain a strong line with wave-length about 417T5, which does not
appear to be related to any other line in these spectra, and belongs,
therefore, to some other element than those otherwise identified.

   The   " mixer metal " heated in the oxy-hydrogen          flame gives a
spectrum of iron with a strong line having a wave-leugth of 4171'6.
   The residue left after dissolving the iron by boiling with hydro
chloric acid also gives this line 41 71 "6 very strongly.
   Precipitates obtained by boiling the solution of the iron with am
monium acetate give the line 4171"6 and also a weaker line, wave
length 40327.

  The experiments were made upon six specimens of Malapterurus
electricus, 12 to 15 cm. in length, brought from the River Senegal by
Mr.  A. Ridyard (ss. "Niger "J, and generously placed at the dis
posal of the authors by the Liverpool Corporation Museum Committee,
to whom and to Dr. Forbes, the Director of tho Museum, the authors
desire to express their thanks.
   Three of the specimens were killed, in order to carry out experi
ments upon the isolated organ.    The instrumental methods employed
  bythe authors for determining for the first time the characters and
 time relations of the activity of the organ response were chiefly the
 following   :—
       (o.) The record of the      frog nerve muscle galvanoscope.
       (t.) The galvanometer connected            with   a   suitable rheotome.

      (c.) The capillary electrometer, a large number (about 250) photo
  graphic records being taken of the movements of the meniscus.
  Facsimile reproductions of typical records are given in the fuller
  communication.      The electrometer was used either shunted by a
  resistance of from 80 to 100 ohms, or in connection with the outer
  plates of a special condenser, the inner plates of which were con
  nected with the fish or its electrical organ.
     The organ responded to mechanical or electrical excitation of its
  nerves after removal from the fish, the response being unaffected by
  1 per cent   curare, or 1 per cent, atropine solution.      No response
  could be evoked by such chemical agents as sodium chloride, gly
  cerine, or weak acid, when applied either to the organ or its efferent
  nerve.
     The conclusions drawn by the authors from the experiments on the
 isolated organ and on the entire uninjured fish may be summarised as
 follows : —
     (1) The isolated organ responds to electrical excitation of its nerves
 by monophasic electromotive changes, indicated by electrical currents
 which traverse the tissue from the head to the tail end ; this response
 commences from 0 0035" at 30° C. to 0-009" at 5° C. after excitation,
 the period of delay for any given temperature being tolerably constant.
    (2) The response occasionally consists of a single such monophasic
 electromotive change (shock) developed with great suddenness, and
 subsiding completely in from 0 002" to 0'005", according to the tem
 perature ; in the vast majority of cases the response is multiple, and
 consists of a series of such changes (shocks) recurring at perfectly
 regular intervals, from two to thirty times (peripheral organ rhythm) ;
 the interval between the successive changes varies from 0'00-l" at
 30° C. to 0'01" at 5° C, but is perfectly uniform at any given tempera
 ture throughout the series.
    (3) Such a single or multiple response (in the great majority of
 cases the latter) can also be evoked by the direct passage of an induced
 current through the organ and its contained nerves, in either direc
 tion heterodromous (i.e., opposite in direction to the current of the
 response) or homodromous.
    (4) The time relations of the response are almost identical whether
 this is evoked by nerve-trunk (indirect) stimulation, or by the passage-
 of the heterodromous induced current.
    (5) There is no evidence that the electrical plate substance can be
 excited by the induced current apart from its nerves, i.e., it does not
 possess independent excitability.
    (6) The organ and its contained nerves respond far more easily to
 the heterodromous than to the homodromous induced current, and the
period of delay in the case of the latter response is appreciably
lengthened.

 Electromotive Properties of Electrical  Organ    of Malapterums.    39
    (7) The peripheral organ rhythm (multiple response) varies from
about 100 per second at 5° C. to about 280 per second at 35° C.
    (8) One causative factor in the production of the peripheral
rhythm is the susceptibility of the excitable tissue to respond to the
current set up by its own activity (self excitation).
    (9) In the uninjured fish mechanical or electrical excitation of the
surface of the skin beyond the limits of the organ evokes a reflex
response with a long delay (0'03" to 0"3") ; this reflex response con
sists of groups of shocks, each group showing the peripheral organ
rhythm, but separated from its neighbour by a considerable interval
of time (reflex or central rhythm).
   (10) In the uninjured fish electrical excitation of the skin over
the organ evokes a response which may consist of a direct peripheral
organ effect followed by such a reflex effect.
   (11) The minimal total reflex delay at 20° C. is 0 023", giving a
central excitatory time of about 0-01".
   (12) The reflex or central rhythm in our specimens showed a
maximum rate of 12 per second and an average rate of from 3 to
4 per second.
   (13) The number of separate groups in the reflex response recurring
at the intervals mentioned in the preceding paragraph was in our fish
limited to from 2 to 5.
   (14) The E.M.F. of each single change in the organ response
depends upon the number of effective plates with their nerves, and in
10 cm. of     excited organ cannot possibly be less than 75 volts,
and is probably much nearer 150 volts.         As in our specimens the
number of plates in series in 1 cm. of organ was 180, this gives a
minimal possible E.M.F. of 0'04 volt, and a probable E.M.F. of
007 volt for each plate.
     The authors further conclude that, since each lateral half of
the organ is innervated by the axis cylinder branches of one efferent
nerve cell, and has no independent excitability, the specific characters
of the reflex response of the organ express far more closely than
those of muscle the changes in central nerve activity, and are pre
sumably those of the activity of a single efferent nerve cell.
   The single efferent nerve cell, the activity of which is thus for the
first time ascertained, shows —
    (a.) A minimum period of delay of 0"008" to 0-01".
    (6.) A maximum rate of discharge of 12 per second.
    (c.) An average rate of discharge of 3 to 4 per second.
    (d.) A susceptibility to fatigue showing itself in the discharge
 failing after it had recurred from two to five times at the above
 rates.

   The Occurrence of nutritive Fat in the Human Placenta.                     A
       Preliminary Communication."             By Thomas Watts Eden,
       M.D., M.R.C.P. Communicated by Dr. Pye Smith, F.R.S.
       Received April 23,— Read May 7, 1896.
(From the Laboratories of the Conjoint Board of the Royal Colleges of Physicians
                          (Lond.) and Surgeons (Eng.)).
    Recently, while examining specimens of ripe placentas for fatty
degeneration,    I was struck by the regularity of the occurrence of fat
in this structure, and especially by the nature and extent of its dis
tribution.    I  was then led to examine a series of specimens taken at
different periods of gestation, with the result that a free deposit of
fat was found in ten different placentas, all of which          I believe to be
non-pathological,     and ranging practically through all periods of
gestation, from the sixth week up to term.
    The method employed for the demonstration of this fat, was to take
slices from different parts of the placenta, and harden them for a few
days in Miiller's fluid ; then to transfer thin strips, not exceeding one-
third of an inch in thickness, to Marchi's fluid (1 per cent, solution
of osmic acid 1 part, Miiller's fluid 2 parts) for a week. The pieces
were then embedded in paraffin, cut with a rocking microtome, and
stained lightly with saffranine, eosine, or logwood and eosine, or
mounted unstained.        By this process the fat is completely blackened,
while the other tissues retain their normal staining reactions, so
that the outlines of the fat-containing cells can be distinctly made
out.
    By this method      I  have   been  able to demonstrate the constant
occurrence     of fat in    certain   well-defined regions of the human
placenta.
    In the young   human placenta, the epithelial covering of the villi
consists of two layers, a superficial, nucleated, plasmodial layer, and
a deep cellular layer.      In a six weeks' ovum I found fat in the form
of minute droplets in both these layers, but much more abundantly in
the former than in the latter. These fat droplets show comparatively
little variation in size, and they remain discrete, showing little or no
tendency to form larger droplets by fusion ; they are confined to the
perinuclear protoplasm, and are never found in the nuclei, which
remain unaltered in number, form, and arrangement.              The stroma of
these villi contains here and there a trace of fat, but it is apparently
healthy, and is furnished with well-formed wide capillaries filled
with blood. The villi are, in fact, to all appearance healthy. Every
villus does not show this deposit of fat, but it is present in very large
numbers of them; in every field of the microscope several villi

           The Occurrence   oj nutritive Fat in the Human Placenta.     41
containing fat may be found.         The amount of fat also varies con
siderably.
   In a yonng ovum the plasmodial       layer of the villi shows great pro
 liferative activity ; it throws out numerous club-shaped processes or
 buds, which represent the first stage in the development of new
 villi. These buds very frequently contain large numbers of minute
fat droplets.      I believe that this is a point of very great importance,
 showing,   as  it does, that the deposit of fat occurs in actively growing
tissues of undoubted vitality.
    In the ripe placenta the proliferation of the plasmodial layer has
ceased, and degenerative changes are present in scattered regions.
Bat, of course, the great majority of the villi retain their vitality,
and in these villi a free deposit of fat is present, showing the same
distribution and characters as in the young placenta.
    I have also found a similar deposit of fat in the serotina. The six
weeks' ovum, above referred to, showed very many decidual cells
containing minute, discrete droplets of fat in the perinuclear proto
plasm.      A placenta of the sixth month also showed an abundant fat
deposit    in  the same region.       At term, the serotina shows many
degenerative changes, and although it contains fat, it may well be
doubted whether, at this period, this is a physiological deposit.
    The placenta, indeed, appears to be a storehouse of nutritive fat,
just as is the liver.     This appears to throw some light on what has
long been one of the problems of foetal physiology, viz., the source
frcm which the foetus obtains its supplies of fat. Diffusible substances
such as sugar, salts, peptones, &c, were supposed to pass by osmosis
from the maternal blood in the inter- villous spaces, to the fcetal blood
in the villi.     But this could not be assumed of indiffusible substauces
such as fat.       The truth would seem to be that fat is deposited from
the maternal blood in the epithelium of the villi, and stored up there
by    the foetal tissues for their use.  No great accumulation of fat
occurs, as it appears to be from time to time absorbed and disposed
(if    the foetal circulation. It is, however, not altogether clear how
      by
;i         of fat in the decidual cells can be
     deposit                                       made available   for the
purposes of footal nutrition.
   Since finding this fat deposit in the human  placenta,  have begun
                                                           I
a  series of comparative observations upon     the placenta? of other
mammals.      Up to the time of writing, have
                                          I      examined two rabbits'
placenta?, one from an early, and the other     from a late, period of
gestation.   In both there was a marked deposit of fat, chiefly in the
superficial glandular layer of the maternal placenta, but also, though
to   less extent, in the processes of the chorionic mesoblast, which
      a
form the homologues of the villi of the human placenta.
   The process appears to correspond closely to that observed by
Mr. George Brook, in the transmission of fat from the yolk to

42          Mr. E. A. Minchin.        Note on the Larva and the
the segmenting germinal area, by the parablast of mesoblastie
ova.*
   T was under the impression when these observations were made,
that fat had never been fonnd, in this form, in the placenta before.
I   find that    I  am to some extent anticipated by a paper in the
' Archiv fUr
                 Gynaekologie,' February, 1896. f           One of the authors
(Aschoff) wished to examine a malignant uterine growth, which he
believed to be of the nature of Deciduoma malignum.                Before doing
so, he examined several specimens of young human ova, in order, as
he says, to learn something of the structure of growing chorionic
villi. Some of the specimens he hardened in Flemming's solution,
and in all of these he found fat in the plasmodial layer of the villi.
Aschoff's description of the fat deposit agrees very closely with that
already given of my own specimen.
                                                  " An den Flemmingschen

    Aschoff scarcely appreciates the physiological importance of the
observation, but there can be no doubt that his observations and my
own are mutually confirmatory.

 ence with which I approached the difficult task of rearing these
 larvae, my results are not so complete in all details as I could wish,
but in the case of L. variabilis I was able to obtain a more or less
perfect developmental series, and in the other three species I was able
to make out satisfactorily the main points in the metamorphosis,
especially the important question of the relation between the cell-
layers of the larva and those of the adult.           I hope to bring my inves
tigations    to  completion during       the present year, but, in the meantime,
the results obtained seemed to me of sufficient importance to form
the subject of a preliminary note.             The material which I collected
and preserved was further studied at Munich, in the laboratory of
Professor Richard Hertwig, to whom I am indebted for much kind
help and advice, as well as hospitality.
The Development        of Leucosolenia variabilis (Ascandra          variabilis, H.).
    The larvae of     L. variabilis  are  of the so-called amphiblastula type,
but in many respects more            primitive than the amphiblastula larva
hitherto described in other Calcaiea.             The minute larvaa (70 — 80 fi
in length, 50 — 60 fi in breadth) leave the mother sponge by the
osculum, and at once rise to the surface of the water, where they
swim for about twenty-four hours.              They then sink to the bottom,
where, after swimming about slowly for twelve to twenty-four hours
more, tliey fix themselves and undergo metamorphosis.                    The larval
life thus lasts for thirty-six to forty-eight hours.
    The oval larva (figs. 1 and 2)* is divided into an anterior region
composed of ciliated cells and a posterior region composed of non-
ciliated granular cells.        The centre of the transparent larva is occu
pied    by a conspicuous         mass    of yellowish-brown       pigment.       The
ciliated cells are slender and elongated, reaching from the pigment to
the surface of the body.          Each cell bears a single flagellum, and the
body of the cell is divided into an internal refractile portion and an
external granular portion.           These two portions of the cell are so
distinct in the living object that a superficial examination gives the
impression of an internal layer of refractile cells covered by an
external grannlar layer, but by more careful investigation it is easy
to make out that these two apparent layers are merely parts of a
single layer of cella.         The ciliated cells situated more posteriorly
entirely lack the retractile inner portion, and appear granular
throughout.        They are also slightly broader, and have more convex
outer surfaces than the other ciliated cells, forming an equatorial
 none of inter mediate cells, not very distinct in tho living object.            The

region of the intermediate cells is generally marked by a slight con
striction, giving a -waist, as it were, to tbe larva. The granular cells
are much fewer in number than the other elements, and are also of
much larger size, but there are gradations in this respect, those
placed at the posterior pole being much larger than those which
border upon the intermediate cells.
   During the free-swimming larval period, considerable changes take
place in the relative proportions of the different parts of the larvae.
In the newly hutched larva (fig. 1) the anterior ciliated region is
relatively large, with a very broad granular border to the cells, and
the posterior granular cells are few in number. The number of
granular cells now increases at the expense of the ciliated cells.
Some of the ciliated cells, by absorption of the internal refractile
portion of the cell, become intermediate cells, and these, in their turn,
absorb their flagellum, increase in size, and become granular cells.
This process goes on pari passu with a decrease in the granular
border of the ciliated cells. Tn the larva of about twenty-four hours
(fig. 2), the granular cells form a mass equal to that of the ciliated
cells, and the latter have now a very narrow granular border.          In

short,  granular cells are formed during larval life by modification of
ciliated cells, the intermediate cells being a stage in this process.
    Sections of larvae confirm and amplify the results obtained from a
study of the living object (fig. 8).      The inner portion of each ciliated
cell, which in life appeared retractile, is seen to contain a series of
vacuole-like structures, containing granular masses suspended in
their interior. At the junction between the internal vacuolated and
external granular portions of the cell is situated the opaque and
deeply staining nucleus, which has a form like an onion, and is con
tinued externally into the flagellum.           Often the inner side of the
nucleus is indented by the vacuole beneath it, sometimes to such an
extent that the nucleus has the form of a crescent in section.           The
intermediate cells are veiy distinct in sections, and by some methods
 of preservation and staining, e.g., osmic acid followed by picrocarmine,
their protoplasm takes up the stain in a remarkable manner, so that
 larva? treated in this way appear to have a brightly coloured equatorial
 zone.    They lack the vacuolated inner portion, characteristic of the

ciliated cells proper, and their nuclei are larger and paler with one
 or two nucleoli.      The nucleus of the first intermediate cell frequently
 presents a curious appearance, being swollen out into a large vesicular
 structure containing two or tliree chromatin masses.               This condition
 is apparently    in  connexion     both   with  a  process   of rearrangement of
 the chromatin and with the absorption of the vacuoles.              The granular
cells are arranged in a single layer, and have large pale nuclei with
nucleoli.    Often the nucleus of the cell nearest the intermediate cells
has a pointed outer end, evidently           indicating     the former connexion
with the flagellum.
    Sections reveal a remarkable set of structures in connexion with
the central pigment, which is now seen to have the form of a tube,
open in front and behind, and enclosing a rounded, lens-like body,

doubtless, of the segmentation cavity.               Behind these bodies are a

the condition of granular cells, they leave the pigment behind, so
that the pigment is thickest in the region of the intermediate cells,
at the sides of the lens-like body.
    The larva is thus composed of four kinds of cells, which may be
termed the ciliated, intermediate, granular, and central cells.                   Since
the intermediate          cells are merely a transitional form between the
ciliated cells proper and the granular cells, we have to reckon with
three classes of cells only in the fully developed larva.
    The fixation takes place by the anterior pole of the larva, and the
granular cells grow round the ciliated cells.                 The metamorphosis is
complete      in a few hours.       Sections of fixed stages of the first day of
fixation (fig. 4) show them to be composed of two very distinct cell

 layers: (1) a compact central mass of cells, easily recognisable, by
 their opaque, irregularly shaped nuclei and vacuolated cell protoplasm,
 as the former          ciliated cells, snrrounded by (2) a single layer of
 flattened     epithelial cells, the former granular cells of the          larva.     No
  trace is to be found of the central cells, which appear to                be thrown
 out, together with the pigment, at the metamorphosis.                      The inner
  mass is the future gastral layer of the sponge, the outer                 epithelium
  the  future dermal layer.

48           Mr. E. A. Minchin.           Note on the Larva and the
    The two component layers very soon begin to undergo changes of
 form and structure, which are best described separately, since the two
 layers develop more or less independently of one another, and a given
 stage in the development of one layer is not alwav s found combined
 with one and the same stage in the development of the other.
    The dermal layer becomes divided (fig. 5) into two kinds of cells :
 (a) cells which retain the original form and characters and remain on
the surface, and (6) cells with smaller nuclei, which sink below the
outer epithelium and form a scattered layer between it and the

                  represented as slightly in advance of the rijjht side.
gastral cells.      The former (a) secrete each a single monaxon spicule,
which appears first on the inner side of the nucleus, but soon grows out
and projects free from the surface. The latter (6) unite into groups
and secrete the triradiate spicules. The monaxons appear first, as in
Sycandra raphanus,* and begin to appear about twenty-four hours
after fixation, the triradiates about twelve hours later. The dermal
layer has thus become divided into two parts, which gradually assume
the adult characters.         I have not observed the origin of the pores.
    The gastral layer, at first a compact mass with no definite arrange
ment, soon begins to form a cavity (fig. 5). The cells assume a
radiate arrangement, and a split-like lumen appears in the centre.
Sometimes two or more such lacunar spaces arise, at first quite
independent of one another, but later fusing to form a single gastral
cavity, which soon becomes very large, causing the larva to increase
considerably in size as a whole.            At first the cavity is surrounded on
all sides by gastral        cells, but   as  it increases in size a spot appears
where gastral cells are wanting, and the cavity is limited only by
dermal cells (fig. 6). This is the region of the future osculum, and
the dermal cells at this spot form the f uture oscular rim, wherejcollar

cells are lacking. The gastral cells are at first elongated, but later
become shorter, and take on the characteristic appearance of collar
cells.    I have not been able to make out whether all the gastral cells
become collar cells, or whether some of them do not become tho
wandering cells of the adult, which seems very probable.                              The

immigration of cells into the interior. The process is most easily
followed in the more transparent larva of L. reticulum (fig. 7), where
the modification of ciliated cells into granular cells, and their sub
sequent immigration, takes place at the posterior pole.                      When the
 larva is ready for fixation, a considerable quantity of granular cells
has been formed, though the cavity is far from being obliterated. In
the opaque larvaa of L. cerebrum, and coriacea the process is more

 difficult to follow, bat in both immigration appears to take place
 from any point on the surface.
    In L. cerebrum and L. reticulum the larva swims for about
 twenty-four hours at the surface, and as long at the bottom, and fixes
 on the third day.        L. coriacea, on the other hand, is remarkable for
 its abbreviated larval period as compared with the two Mediterranean
 species, since the larva fixes in a few hours, a fact doubtless in con
 nexion with its life between tide marks, where the violent currents to
 which it is exposed renders a very sheltered, and therefore limited,
 habitat necessary for so delicate an organism.
    After fixation, the larva undergoes changes whereby the ciliated
 cells become surrounded by the formerly internal granular cells, so
 that the ciliated external layer of the larva represents the gastral
 layer of the adult, while the inner mass becomes the dermal layer ;
 the reverse of what was supposed by Metschnikoff and Schmidt (loc.
 cit.) to take place.
                       I
    In L. cerebrum was able to observe the first appearance of the
 spicules. As in variabilis, the complete metamorphosis results in a
 stage in which the gastral cells form a compact internal mass, sur

dermal epithelium then form themselves into groups, usually of three
cells, and each cell of such a group secretes the ray of a spicule. The
first spicules    are usually triradiate, hut quite irregular in form, and
st   their  first appearance they are quite superficial, their secreting
cells forming part of the general epithelium, but later they become
covered by the remaining epithelium,             so that the dermal layer
becomes     divided into an internal connective tissue layer and an
external flat epithelium.       The process is essentially similar to that
occurring in variabilis, except that in the latter the cells of the flat
epithelium secrete each a monaxon spicule, which in cerebrum is not
the case.
                             General Considerations.
   The larva of L. variabilis is of interest as affording a transition
from larva? such as that of L. reticulum, to the amphiblastula larva
of the Sycons.       The larva of reticulum (fig. 7) is composed of (1)
ciliated cells, comparable to those of the amphiblastula, of which
some (2) at the hinder pole are undergoing modification, and may be
compared with the intermediate cells, and of (3) internal granular
cells comparable to the posterior granular cells of the amphiblastula.
To obtain a larva like that of variabilis from the type represented
by reticulum, we must suppose the large cavity of the latter reduced
to the extent to which this has occurred in the former.            Then the
granular cells which are formed at the posterior pole must remain
where they are, since the cavity is too small to contain them, and, as
more ciliated cells are continually being modified around them, we
get a larva with the three kinds of cells arranged as in variabilis.
The central cells of variabilis — on the origin of which         I  have no
observations to bring forward — are probably to be regarded as con
stituting a larval organ, a special adaptation of no importance for the
postlarval development.
    The development of both reticulum and variabilis points to an early
stage in which the larva is composed          entirely of similar and equi
valent ciliated cells.     I have not seen such a stage in any species, and
 doubt if it actually occurs in nature ; it is more probable- tbat the
 process of cell differentiation begins before the larva is hatched in all
 cases.    In the absence of segmentation stages, it is impossible to
 decide this question ; nevertheless, the facts seem to me to indicate, as
 the primitive larva in ascon phylogeny, a blastula composed of indif
 ferent ciliated cells, in which a second type of cells (the future dermal
 layer) is formed by modification of certain of the cells.       The collar-
 cell layer of the adult is derived directly from the primitive ciliated
  cells of the blastula.
     Comparing, now, the larva of variabilis with that of Sycon raphanus,

 52      On the    Larva and Development of Leucosolenia variabilis.
as described by Schulze,           it is obvious that the development is         essen
tially similar in both, the chief difference being with regard to the
periods at which the various events take place. In both the granular
cells increase greatly in number, bnt in raphanus this takes place
while the larva is still in the maternal tissues, as is obvious from
 Schulze's figures,* and the larva is hatched in a condition similar
to that of variabilis when about to fix. In variabilis the granular
cells do not surround the ciliated cells until after fixation ; in raph-
anus this process is begun while the larva is still swimming, and
the granular cells may even give rise to spicules (monaxons) during
the free swimming period (Metschnikoff, loc. cit.).                      It is obvious
that in Sycon we have before us a hastening and shortening of the
development, and, allowing for these embryological adaptations, we
are able to understand            how, from a larva such as that of reticulum,
there has arisen a type of development apparently so different as
that of the Sycon amphiblastula.
    The most important event in the post-larval development is the
differentiation of tho dermal layer into the outer epithelium and the
inner connective tissue layer.             This might seem at first sight to be a
process     comparable       to the  formation   of a new layer, a mesoderm ; so
that from this period onwards the sponge would be a three-layered
organism.       I  do not, however, take this view, for the following reason.
The immigration of cells from the epithelium to form the layer of
triradiates is not an event, like the formation of a germ layer, which
takes places once and for all in the life cycle of an individual, but it
goes on whenever new triradiates are formed. In adult ascons                    I have
found that the triradiates and the basal rays of the quadriradiates
arise from cells of the outer epithelium which migrate inwards and
arrange themselves into groups to form spicules, each ray being
secreted by one cell or by cells derived from the division of a
single cell. In the adult also the nuclei of the spicule secreting cells
diminish in size after quitting the epithelium.              Hence in the develop
ment of the sponge also,            I  regard this process as one not of blasto-
genetic,      bnt   of  histogenetic significance.        The fact that in variabilis
the epithelial cells also secrete spicules is to my mind a decisive
proof of the unity of the dermal layer,           t

refers this increase in the number of the granular cells to their multiplication by
cell-division, but as the granular cells do not at the same time decrease in size, it
seems more probablo that their increase is due, as in variability to their numbers
being recruited from the clear (ciliated) cells.

raphanut ('Zeitschr. f. Wiss. Zool.,' vol. 31, pi. XIX, figs. 10, 11), although he
states in the text that the spicules arise in the hyaline substance between the two
layers.

   To chronicle a list of failures is not an agreeable task ; and yet it
is sometimes necessary, in order that the record of the behaviour of
newly discovered substances may be a complete one.            It is with this
object  that  we place on record an account of a number of experiments
made to test the possibility of forming compounds of helium and
argon.
   It will   be  remembered that in our memoir on Argon,* Lord
Rayleigh     and Professor Ramsay described numerous experiments,
made in the hope of inducing argon to combine, all of which
yielded negative results.      Two further experiments have been since
made  — again without     success.
   1. The electric arc was maintained for several hoars in an atmo
sphere of argon.      The electrodes were thin pencils of gas carbon,
and, previous to the introduction of the argon, the arc was made
in a vacuum, and aW gas evolved was removed by pumping.                Argon
was   then admitted up to a known pressure, and the arc was again
made.     A slow expansion took place ; one of the electrodes di
minished in length, and the bulb became coated with a black deposit.
The resulting gas was treated with caustic soda and with a solution
of ammoniacal cuprous chloride, and, on transference to a vacuum-
tabe, it showed the spectrum of argon along with a spectrum
resembling that of hydrocarbons.            Having to leave off work at this
                                             ' Chemical News ' on a Possible
stage, a short note was sent to the
Compound of Argon. On resuming work after the holidays, the gas
was again investigated, and, on sparking with oxygen, carbon dioxide
was produced.       But it was thought right again to treat the gas with
cnprous chloride in presence of ammonia, and it now appeared that
 when left for a sufficient time in contact with a strong solution,
considerable contraction took place, carbonic oxide being removed.
 There can, therefore, be no doubt that, although apparently all gas
had been removed from the carbon electrodes before admitting argon,
some carbon dioxide must have been still occluded, probably in the
 upper part of the electrodes, and that the prolonged heating due to
the arc had expelled this gas and converted it into monoxide.               It
was, indeed, inexplicable how an expansion should have taken place
 unless by some such means ; for the combination of a monatomic
gas must necessarily be accompanied by contraction.               It appears,
therefore,    certain that argon and carbon do not combine, even at

the   high temperature of the arc, where any product would have a
chance of escaping decomposition by removing itself from the
source of heat.      It is hardly necessary to point out that such a
process    lends itself to the formation of endothermic compounds
such as acetylene, and it was to be supposed that if argon is
capable of combination at all, the resulting compound must be
produced by an endothermic reaction.
   2. A product rich in barium cyanide was made by the action of
producer gas on a mixture of barium carbonate and carbon at the
intense temperature of the arc. This product was treated by Dumas'
process so as to recover all nitrogen ; and, as argon might also have
entered into combination, the nitrogen was absorbed by sparking.
All the nitrogen entered into combination with oxygen and soda,
leaving no residue.        Hence it may be concluded that no argon
enters into combination.       For the successful carrying out of these
experiments we have to thank Mr. G. W. MacDonald.
   3. A mixture of argon with the vapour of carbon tetrachloride
was exposed for several hours to a silent discharge from a very
powerful induction coil.        The apparatus was connected with a
gauge    which   registered   the  pressure of the vapour of the tetra
chloride and of the argon of which it was mixed. Careful measure
ment of the pressure was made before commencing the experiment,
and after its completion.       Although a considerable amount of other
chlorides of carbon was produced, no alteration of pressure was
noticeable ; the liberated chlorine having been absorbed by the
mercury present.       Here again the argon did not enter into the
 reaction, but it was recovered without loss of volume.
   The remaining experiments relate to attempts to produce com
pounds of helium.       The plan of operation was to circulate helium
over the reagent at a bright red heat, and to observe whether
any alteration in volume occurred — an absorption of a few c.c.
could have been observed — or whether any marked change was pro
 duced in the reagent employed.          As a rule, after the reagent had.
 been allowed    to cool  in the  gas, all  helium was removed with the
pump, and the reagent was again heated to redness, so as, if a com
pound had been formed, to decompose               it and expel the helium.
Every experiment gave negative          results ; in no case was there any
 reason to suspect that helium had entered into combination.
   A short catalogue of the substances tried may be given.

had no effect.
    11.   Thallium was heated to bright redness    in the gas, retaining
 its metallic lustre.
     12.  Titanium oxide mixed with magnesium dust was heated to
 bright redness, and caused no absorption.
     13. Similar absence of action was proved with thorium oxide and
 magnesium powder.
    14. Tin and, 15, lead, were heated to  bright redness in the current
 of gas,   and remained untarnished.
     16. Phosphorus was distilled in the gas, and caused to pass through
a length of combustion-tube       heated to softening.   Some red phos
 phorus was formed, but no alteration of volume was noticed.
     17. The same process was repeated with elemental arsenic.
     18. Antimony and, 19, bismuth, at a bright red heat, retained their
metallic lustre.
    20. Sulphur and, 21, selenium, were treated in the same way as
phosphorus ; no action took place.
    22. Uranium oxide, mixed with magnesium dust, was heated to
bright redness in helium.        No change, except the rednction of the
oxide, took place.       The mixture was allowed to cool slowly in the
current, and the helium was removed with the pump till a phos
phorescent     vacuum was produced in a vacuum tube communicating
with the circuit.       The mixture was re-heated, and no helium was
evolved — not even enough to show a spectrum. The vacuum remained
unimpaired .
    It had been hoped that elements with high atomic weight, such as
thallium, lead, bismuth, thorium, and uranium might have effected
combination, but the hope was vain.
    23. A mixtnre of helium with its own volume of chlorine was
exposed to a silent discharge for several hours.        The chlorine was
contained in a reservoir, sealed on to the little apparatus which had
the form of an ozone apparatus.       No change in level of the sulphuric
acid confining the chlorine was detected after the temperature, raised
by the discharge, had again become the same as that of the room.
Hence helium and chlorine do not combine.
    24. Metallic cobalt in powder does not absorb helium at a red heat .
    25. Platinum black does not occlude it.
    26. It is not caused to combine by passage        over a mixture of
soda-lime and potassium nitrate heated to bright redness.       This was
hardly to be expected, for it resists the action of oxygen in presence
of caustic soda, even when heated by the sparks which traverse it.

    28. Induction sparks in an ozone apparatus passed through a mix
ture of helium with benzene vapour in presence of liquid benzene
for many hours, gave no change of volume. The benzene was, of
course, altered, but the sum of the pressures of the helium and the
benzene-vapour remained as at first.               Had helium been removed,
contraction would have occurred.
     This ends the catalogue of negative experiments. Any compound
of helium capable of existence will probably be endothermic, and the
two methods of producing endothermic compounds, where no simul
taneous exothermic reaction is possible, are exposure to a high tem
perature, at which endothermic compounds show greater stability,
and the influence of the silent electric discharge.               These methods
have been tried, so far in vain.             There is, therefore, every reason to
believe that the elements, helium and argon, are non-valent, that is,
are incapable of forming compounds.

 of oxygen, gave a final residue of 37 c.c, after removal of all gases
 known until recently.            The spectrum of the residue, observed at
 atmospheric pressure, showed argon, and the D3 lino of helium very
 plainly.
     The easy visibility of D3 suggested the presence of helium in some
  .such proportion    as 10 per cent., and this conjecture has been con
  firmed by a determination of the refractivity of the mixture.              It may
  be remembered that while the refractivity of argon approaches
  closely that of air, the relative number being 0 961, the refractivity
  of helium (as supplied to me by Professor Ramsay) is very low,
  being only 0'146 on the same scale.            If we assume that any sample

proportions in which the components are present.
    The observations were made by an apparatus similar in character
to that already described, but designed to work with smaller quan
tities of gas.     The space to be filled is only about 12 c.c, and if the
gas be at atmospheric pressure its refractivity may be fixed to about
1/1000 part.       By working at pressures below atmosphere very fair
results could be arrived at with quantities of gas ordinarily reckoned
at  only 3 or 4 c.c.
    The refractivity found     for the Bath residue after desiccation was
0 896    referred to air, so that the proportional amount of helium is
8  per   cent.   Referred to the original volume, the proportion of helium
is 1'2   parts per thousand.

    The action of the low temperature produced by           liquid air upon the
magnetic moment of steel magnets was studied by one of us in a few
cases in a preliminary research made some time ago.*               We have re
cently returned to the subject and made further investigations on
the   influence of the low temperatures thus obtained on magnetised
iron   and steels of very various compositions, with the object of de
termining the nature of the changes which take place in the
magnetic moment of small magnets constructed of these metals,
 when cooled gradually or suddenly down to the lowest temperature
obtainable by the use of boiling liquid air.        The arrangements adopted
in this investigation were as follows : —
    A reflecting magnetometer consisting of three small magnetised
needles of watch-spring         steel, cemented to a concave glass mirror,
suspended by      a  single cocoon fibre, was placed in a tube so as to be
free from disturbance by draughts of air.             The small magnets were
8 to 10 mm. in length.         The image of a portion of the filament of
an incandescent lamp was reflected by the mirror on to a divided
scale placed at a distance of 70 cm. from the mirror.              The edge of
the very sharp image of the filament, focussed upon the scale,

58    Profs. J.  Dewar and       J. A. Fleming.     Changes produced in
enabled any angnlar displacement of the magnetometer needle to be
easily determined.     The position of this magnetometer needle was
regulated by   the field produced by an external controlling magnet.
The small magnet, the behaviour of which at low temperatures was
to be studied, was placed behind the magnetometer, with its centre at
a distance of 1 to 10 cm. from the centre of the magnetometer needle
and its axis in a direction passing through the centre of the magneto
meter needle, and at right angles to the direction of the undis
turbed magnetometer needle.          The magnet to be examined was fixed
to a brass wire, held in a wooden support in such fashion that the
magnet under examination could be easily removed from its position
behind the magnetometer, and restored to it again exactly.         A large
number of samples of steel and irou were then prepared in the form
of small needles, generally 15 mm. long and about 1 mm. in diameter.
These steels comprised nickel steels, with various percentages of
nickel ; chromium steels, with various percentages of chromium ;
aluminium steels, with various percentages of aluminium ; tungsten
steels,  manganese    steels, silicon steel, ordinary carbon steels in
various states of tempering, soft-annealed transformer iron, soft-
iron wire, and the same irons hardened by hammering.             For most
of these samples of steels we were indebted to Mr. R. A. Hadfield,
of Sheffield, who kindly furnished them to one of us in the form of
wires.
    These short steel magnets were then all magnetised to " satura
      "
tion    by placing them for a few moments between the poles of a
powerful electro-magnet.          One by one they were then placed in
position behind the magnetometer, and the deflection produced on
the magnetometer needle observed.             In any particular case this
 deflection may be taken as approximately representing the intensity
 of magnetisation of the sample, although, owing to the varying sizes
of the sample and distance from the magnetometer, the deflections in
 the case of different magnets are not comparable with one another,
 and cannot be taken as indicating the relative intensities of mag
 netisation of two different samples.       This, however, was not impor
 tant, as our object was not to compare the absolute values of the
 magnetisation of different classes of steels, but to observe the mode
 of variation of the magnetisation of any one sample when cooled
 from ordinary temperatures down to the temperature of liquid air.
    The method of proceeding was then as follows : — Having adjusted
 the image of the lamp filament to the zero of the scale, the small
 magnet under observation was placed behind the magnetometer, and
 the deflection of the magnetometer needle observed.              A small
 vacuum-jacketed cup,      filled   with liquid air, was then brought up
 underneath the sample, and by its aid the magnet cooled suddenly
 in situ to a temperature in the neighbourhood of —186° C. In the

     Magnetised Iron, §-c, cooled to Temperature    of Liquid Air.     59
many cases this sudden cooling immediately deprived the magnet of
a considerable    percentage of its magnetisation, and the magnetic
moment was reduced. This, however, was not universally the case.
In some cases, as in that of the chromium steels, the first effect of
this sudden cooling was an increase in the magnetic moment of the
magnet ; in other cases hardly any change in the magnetic moment
at all.   The vessel of liquid air was then removed, and the magnet
allowed to heat up again, which it very quickly did, to the tempera
 ture of the room, or rather to a temperature at which the deposit of
snow formed upon the needle immediately on coming out of the
liquid air, fully melted. This was taken to be at about 5° C. It
was found that each magnet had certain peculiarities of its own.
   Taking first the ordinary carbon steel (a sample of knitting-needle
steel) we observe the following facts :
                                        —
   Knitting-needle Steel (a) Tempered Glass Hard. — The first effect
of cooling this magnet was to diminish the magnetic moment by
6 per cent.      On allowing the magnet to heat up again to the
ordinary temperature, the magnetic moment still further dimin
ished by about 16 per cent-     On cooling again the magnetic moment
increased 10- per cent., and from and after that time cooling the
magnet always increased the magnetic moment, and allowing to
heat up again to ordinary temperature always diminished               the
magnetic     moment,  the magnetic   moment   at  —  185°  C. being about
 10 per cent, greater than the magnetic moment at 5° C.          The first
effect, therefore, of the cooling was to permanently diminish the
magnetic moment, but after a few alternations of heating and cooling,
the magnet reached a permanent condition in which its moment,
when cold, was greater than its moment when warm.           These changes
of magnetisation may be best represented as in the diagram in fig. 1,
in which the firm lines represent to some arbitrary scale the moment
of the magnet when at its ordinary temperature of 5° C, and the
dotted lines represent to the same scale the moment of the magnet
when cooled to -185° C.
   Knitting-needle   Steel (b) Medium Temper. — The same general
results were obtained with knitting-needle steel tempered to a
medium temper. The first effect of the cooling to the low tempera
ture was to diminish the moment of the magnet. On allowing it to
heat up again the moment of the magnet diminished still more. The
next cooling caused an increase of magnetic moment, and from and
after that time the steel settled down into a permanent condition in
which the magnetic moment was greater at — 185° C. than at 5° C.
by nearly 20 per cent, of its value at 5° C. (see fig. 2).
   Knitting-needle Steel (c) Annealed Soft. — The same general course
of events was noticed in the case of the knitting-needle steel when
made soft by heating to a red heat and allowing it to cool very
                                                                F 2

slowly.   In this case, however, the first diminution of magnetic
moment was still greater.          On first immersion in the liquid air
the magnet lost about 33 per cent, of its moment.                On allowing
it to heat up again to 5° C. it still further diminished in moment,
and from and after that point it arrived soon at a permanent
condition, in which its moment, when cold, was greater than its
moment when warm by 30 per cent, of its moment at 5° C. These

                           is

the case of the same steel    with a medium temper about 22 per cent.,
and     in the case of the same steel tempered very soft about 33 per
cent,
        (see fig.   3).
  Chromium Steels. — Observations were then made with the magnets
 ofchromium steel, having respectively 0'29 per cent., 1'18 per cent.,
•V44 per cent., and 9-18 per cent, of chromium.     In all these cases
the first effect of cooling the magnet was to cause at once an increase
 ofmagnetic moment, and the subsequent heating up again to the ordi
nary temperature caused         decrease of magnetic moment.

about 10 per cent, greater at —185° C.than at 5° C.                It will be seen,
therefore, that these steels differ from tho chromium steels in this
respect, that whereas in the chromium steels the effect of the first
cooling is to cause an increase in magnetic moment ; in the case of
the aluminium steels, the effect of the first cooling was to cause a
decrease of magnetic moment, although much smaller relatively than

greater than    the magnetic moment when warm, when the permanent
state had been reached. But it will be noticed from the diagrams (see
fig. 13) that in the case of the 7'G5 per
                                                 cent, nickel steel, the effect of
the first cooling was to cause a slight increase in magnetic moment. A
remarkable peculiarity, however, was found in the case of the 19'64 per
cent, nickel steel.     In this case the effect of the first cooling was to
cause a very considerable reduction of magnetic moment, very nearly
50 per cent., that is to say, the magnetic moment fell instantly, on
cooling in the liquid air, to about half the value that it had at the
beginning of the experiment. On taking the magnet out of the liquid
air and allowing it to warm up again to the temperature of the room,
the magnetic moment immediately increased again, and from and after
that time the effect of the temperature change on the magnetic
moment was such that the magnetic moment, when cooled to the
temperature of liquid air, was always less than the magnetic moment
at 5° C. by about 23 per cent, of the latter value.               These relative
changes    are  shown     in the diagram (fig. 14).          These experiments

with the 19 per cent,      nickel steel were repeated a great many times,
and always with the same general results.                 The sample of 29 per
 cent, nickel steel was then examined, and it was found that the mag
 netic changes produced in it on heating and cooling were of the same
 general character as in the case of the 19 per cent, sample, only le.ss

 (!6     Proi's. J.  Dewar and       J.  A. Fleming.         Changes produced    in
 marked.       Steels having these high percentages of nickel are, as Dr. J.
 Hopkinson has pointed out,* remarkable for the wide range of tem
 perature within which they can exist in two states, one considerably
 magnetic, and one practically non-magnetic or but feebly magnetic.
 In these two states their mechanical and other physical properties are
 entirely different.         In the experiments here mentioned, the nickel
 steel Bamples were iu the magnetic condition.                 They are put into this
 condition by dipping for one moment in liquid air, and are only trans
 formed back into the feebly magnetic condition by heating to a
 cherry-red heat.        The 29 per cent, sample of nickel steel being in the
 magnetic condition was magnetised by contact with the poles of the
 electromagnet. On cooling it in liquid air it immediately lost about
 20 per cent, of its moment, on warming up again to 5° C. it lost about
 5 per cent, more, and from and after that point remained in a condi
 tion in which cooling the magnet to — 185° C. caused its moment to
 become about 10 per cent, less than it was at 5° C.                 Hence the 29 per
 cent, nickel steel exhibits the same quality but in a less marked
 degree than the 19 per cent., in that its magnetic moment is decreased
 by cooling to — 185° C, and recovers again on heating up to 5° C.
 In this respect the two samples of nickel steel differ from all other
 samples of steel which we have examined, in that they have a negative
 temperature coefficient for magnetic moment change with tempera
 ture, after the first change on cooling has taken place.
     Pure Nicfal. — In order to see if this peculiarity extended to pure
 nickel, we examined the behaviour of a small magnet made with
Mr. Mond's pure nickel, but we found that such a nickel magnet,
magnetised to saturation, behaved exactly as did a carbon steel
 magnet (see fig. 15). The effect of the first cooling to the tempera
 ture of liquid air was to diminish the magnetic moment. On allow
 ing the magnet to heat up again to the ordinary temperature the
 moment diminished still more, and from and after that time the
behaviour of the magnet was perfectly normal, that is to say, its
magnetic moment when at 5° C. was less than its magnetic moment
at —186° O, but only by about 3 or 4 per cent, of the latter value.
     Silicon Steel. — A sample of silicon steel, containing 2-67 per cent,
of silicon, behaved         in a normal manner (see fig. 16). The magnet
experienced      a  permanent diminution of moment on cooling for the
first time, and after that, its magnetic moment when cold was greater
than its magnetic moment when warm.
     Soft Iron.
                 — In order to determine if similar changes of magnetic
moment could be produced in the case of soft annealed iron, small
magnets of Swedish iron were prepared, formed of a short length,
about 15 mm., of soft iron, or a small slip of annealed transformer
iron. On magnetising these in a strong field, and testing them with

by plunging into liquid air hardly produced any effect on the magnetic

                                                        a

   A series of tungsten steels were then examined, having respec
tively 1, 7'5, and 15 per cent, of tungsten in them.
    Magnets were prepared of these steels, both in the glass-hard con
dition and in a carefully annealed condition.               These steels were fonnd
to resemble the simple carbon steels in that the first effect of cooling
the magnet      to — 186°C. was to cause a diminution of magnetic
moment, and the subsequent warming up again to 5° C, a still fur
ther decrease in magnetic moment.                   From that time forth cooling
the magnet always caused                an increase of magnetic moment. The
effect of increasing          the percentage of tungsten was to cause a
decrease in the variation of the magnetic moment over a given tem
perature range.        That is to say, the hardened 15 per cent, tungsten
steel temporarily lost magnetic moment to the extent of about 6 per
cent, by heating up from — 185° C. to 5° C. when once the initial
condition had been passed.                The 7'5 per cent, tungsten steel lost,
moment to the extent of about 10 per cent., and the 1 per cent, tungsten
steel lost moment to the extent of about 12 per cent, when the tempera-
tares rose between the same limits.               As regards these tungsten steels,
 softening the steel caused the magnetic moment to decrease by a
 ereater percentage when heated up from —185° C. to 5° C. than was
 foand to be the case when the steel was in its hard condition.                   A
 sample of manganese          steel containing 12 per cent,       of manganese was

netic moment, and on heating up again to 5° C, its magnetic moment
decreased to the extent of about 3 per cent, of its moment at — 185°C.
There was no initial decrease of moment in thif. case. In this
respect, therefore, it resembled the chromium steel magnets.
    Broadly speaking, the results so far obtained are : —
    (1) That the sudden cooling to the temperature of liquid air
usually permanently decreases the magnetic moment of short mag
nets made of many varieties of steel, assuming them to have been
initially magnetised in a strong field.
    (2) This initial decrease is fonud both in hardened steels having
great coercive force, and also in the same steels in a soft or annealed
condition, and is especially conspicuous in the case of the 19 percent,
nickel steel.
    (3) In the case of most steels so far examined, the effect of cooling
magnets made of them to — 185c C. is to temporarily increase the
magnetic moment after the permanent magnetic condition has been
reached.                                  '
    (4) The exceptions to the above rule so far noted are the nickel
steels with percentages of nickel from 19 to 29 per cent., in which
case the magnetic moment is always decreased temporarily by cooling
to    —185°   C,    after the permanent   magnetic   condition  has  been
reached.
    (5)  It appears  from these experiments that one of the best ways of
ageing a permanent magnet is to dip it several times into liquid air.
It then arrives at a constant condition in which subsequent tempera
ture changes have a definite effect, and in which the subpermanent
 magnetism is removed.
                            Note added May     4.
    Since the 19 per cent, nickel steel magnet increases in magnetic
 moment when heated from — 185° C. to +5°C., and since it is well
 known that at some higher temperature it would lose magnetic
 moment altogether, it was considered very desirable to ascertain the
 temperature at which it would have its maximum magnetic moment.
 The magnet was accordingly heated (on April 2) in an oil bath
 gradually np to a temperature of about 300° C, and the deflections of
 the magnetometer observed at intervals, both as the temperature rose
 and as it fell.     The result showed that this nickel steel magnet con
 tinued to increase in magnetic moment, until a temperature of about
 30° C. was reached, and the magnetic moment then began to de
 crease.
    At  a temperature of +300° C, the moment of the magnet was not
 much greater than it was at — 185° C. On cooling down again from

before, and    on repeating the cycle of temperature from about 15° C. to

in fig. 20, and the temperature                 of maximum magnetic moment

     In the course of last year we published             some observations      (see
'
   Phil. Mag.,' September, 1895, p. 303)* on the electrical resistance
of bismuth at the temperatures of liquid and solid air, in which
the resistivity of certain samples of bismuth was measured at various
temperatures down to the temperature at which air solidifies.                 These
observations showed some anomalous results.                  In the case of two
samples      of bismuth used by us, and prepared by different chemical
means, it was found that the resistivity reached a minimum value at
a temperature of about —80°, and that after that point further cool
ing increased the electrical resistivity of these samples of the metal.
In the case of another sample of commercial bismuth, the resistivity
curve was a curve of double curvature.                   These results, together
with the high absolute value of the resistivity of the samples, caused
us to feel a strong conviction              that different results would be
obtained with bismuth prepared by an electrolytic method.                      Some
observers, particularly M. van Aubel, who have investigated the elec
trical properties of bismuth, have expressed the opinion that bismuth
cannot be prepared in a state of perfect purity by any chemical means.
Finding the chemical methods of doubtful utility, we accordingly
solicited the assistance of Messrs. Hartmann and Braun, who have
devoted a large amount of attention to the preparation of pure electro
lytic bismuth for the purposes of constructing spirals of bismuth for
measuring the strength of magnetic fields. They kindly prepared
for us at our request a considerable quantity of bismuth by an
electrolytic method, which examination showed to be exceedingly
pure, and this metal was pressed into a uniform wire with a diameter
of about half a millimetre.           This electrolytic bismuth is very soft,
and in the form of wire can be bent without difficulty. Resist
ance coils were accordingly constructed of this wire, of a form
suitable for use when measured in liquid air and at low temperatures.
In the case of one resistance coil, which may be denoted as electro
lytic bismuth No. 1, the length of the wire employed was 8085 cm.;
the diameter of this wire was carefully measured with a microscopic

 there is no tendency of the resistivity cnrve to a minimum value.
 Down to the lowest temperatures reached in these experiments, the
resistivity of bismuth continues to decrease in a perfectly regular
 manner, and in such a way as to show that it would be no exception,
 in all probability, to the ordinary law, that resistivity of pure metals
vanishes at the absolute zero of temperature.                   On comparing the
results of these measurements with those in the former experiments
made with chemically prepared bismuth, it is seen that the electro
lytic bismuth used by us has a very much lower resistivity at 0° C,
viz., 108,000 units, and it has a lower value than that given by
Matthiessen for pure bismuth, which is 129,700.                 We have, then, an
additional indication that the bismuth used by us in the experiments
in 1895 must have contained sufficient, though slight, impurity to
markedly alter its resistivity, and to change entirely the character of
the resistivity curve. With this electrolytic bismuth we have repeated
the experiments which we made last year, on the variation of the
electrical resistance of bismuth when placed transversely to the
direction of tho force in a magnetic field, and when cooled to the
temperature df liquid air. For this purpose we constructed a flat
spiral of the electrolytic bismuth, so arranged that its resistances
could bo measured at ordinary temperatures, and at the temperature
of liquid air, by immersing it in a flat vacuum-jacketed test-tube.,
both when in a powerful magnetic field, and when merely in the
terrestrial field. With this electrolytic bismuth we have confirmed the
observation which we made last year, with a small sample of electro
lytic bismuth, viz., that the effect of a given transverse magnetic
field in increasing the resistivity of bismuth is immensely increased
by cooling the bismuth to the temperature of liquid air. The figures
in the following table will show the actual results obtained in these
last experiments      : —

   It will thus  be seen that whereas the immersion of the electrolytic
bismuth wire,     at ordinary temperatures, transversely in a magnetic
field of  strength 2,750 C.G.S. units, only increased its resistance by
about 6 per cent., the immersion of the same wire in the same mag
netic field increased its resistance to more than four and a half times
when it was cooled to the temperature of liquid air, and the effect of the
cooling with liquid air is more than nullified by the field, so that the
bismnth cooled in liquid air and at the same time placed in the field
has a resistance of 50 per cent, greater than it was when not cooled
and not in the field.     We are engaged in extending these observa
tions to stronger fields.
   The behaviour of electrolytic bismuth in fields of various strengths
and at various temperatures, from 0° C. to 100° C, has been studied
by Mr. J. B. Henderson
                                 '
                            (see   Phil. Mag.,' vol. 38, 1894, p. 488), and
he has given a series of curves showing the variation of resistance of
bismuth between these temperatures for fields of strength varying
from zero to 22,700 C.G.S. units.        Our observations at low tempera-
tnres are quite consistent with Mr. Henderson's curves.          His curves
indicate that at lower temperatures the effect of any given field in
increasing the resistance of the bismuth becomes moro marked.
   Pressed to its limit it would appear that pure bismuth, which
would in all probability be made a perfect conductor by reducing to
the absolute zero of temperature, would be then converted into a
nou-conductor if at the same time immersed in a magnetic field of
sufficient strength.    Both M. van Anbel and Mr. Henderson have
pointed   out  that the temperature coefficient of bismnth at any given
temperature is quite altered by placing it in a magnetic field, and it
will therefore be a matter of great interest to examine the effect of
an exceedingly strong magnetic field as bismuth when cooled to the
temperature of solid air.
   By enclosing a bismuth wire and a platinum thermometer wire in
the same mass of paraffin wax we have been able to measure the
variation of resistance of the bismuth from the temperature of liquid
air up to ordinary temperatures at a number of intermediate points,
and to determine the resistance both in a zero magnetic field and
in one of known strength, but the results we wish to reserve until
we have had the opportunity        of repeating them with stronger mag
netic fields.

       Fullerian Professor of Chemistry in the Royal Institution,

       Received May 19, — Read June 4, 1896.
   Although the electrical resistivity of mercury at ordinary tem
peratures has been carefully examined by many observers, and accu
rate determinations made of the specific resistance* and temperature
coefficient, and in addition an examination made of the variation of
resistivity in mercury when cooled to temperatures as low as
 — 100° C.,f we considered it would be of interest to examine the
behaviour of pure mercury in respect of change in electrical resist
ivity when cooled to the temperature obtained by the employment of
boiling liquid air. With this object we prepared a sample of very
pure mercury in the following manner : Ordinary distilled mercury
was shaken up with nitric acid in the usual manner to free it from other
metals, and then carefully dried.         It was then introduced into a bent
glass tube formed of hard glass. This bent tube had both ends sealed,
and a side tube connected in at the bend, by which it could be con
nected to a mercury vacuum pump.             Two or three hundred grammes
of the mercury was then introduced into one bend, and a high vacuum
made in the tube.        The side tube was then sealed off from the pump,
and the mercury distilled over from one leg into the other. For this
purpose, one leg of the bent tube was placed in ice and salt, and the
other submitted to a gentle heat just sufficient to make the mercury
distil under reduced pressure without ever bringing it into active
ebullition.     In this way the mercury is distilled over at a very low
temperature, and the portion condensing in the cooler limb of the
bent tube is entirely free from any contamination with silver, lead,
zinc, or tin. By performing this distillation two or three times suc
cessively on the same mercury, a small quantity of mercury is at laat
obtained in an exceedingly pure condition.                A glass spiral tub©
was then formed of lead glass, consisting              of  a tube having an
internal diameter of about 2 mm., and a length of about 1 metre.
 This tube was bent into a spiral of about twelve close turns, each
turn being nearly 2"5 cm. in diameter, and the ends of this spiral
provided with enlarged glass ends formed of wider tube. The spiral,

        Resistivity   of Mercury at the Temperature    of Liquid Air.    77
  after being cleaned, was then     very carefully filled with the purified
  mercury, and by running the mercury through a spiral several times,
  all air bubbles and air film were finally removed. Into the wider
  ends of the spiral,    amalgamated copper electrodes were introduced,
 consisting of copper wire 4"4 mm. in diameter ; the wider terminal
  ends of the spiral were then closed by paraffined corks to keep the
 copper electrodes in position.      This spiral, full of mercury, was
 placed in a test-tube, and paraffin wax cast round it so as to enclose
 it entirely, leaving only the copper electrodes   protruding. In order
 to determine the temperature of the mercury      in the glass spiral tube,
 a platinum wire, the resistance of which was known at all tempera
tures down to the temperature of liquid air, was also embedded in the
paraffin wax closely in contact with the glass spiral, and proper
electrodes brought out to enable the resistance of this platinum wire
to be determined.        This mass of paraffin wax was then cooled down
in a vacuum vessel kept filled up with liquid air until the whole mass
 reached the temperature of the liquid air.         The glass spiral and
 thermometer      enclosed in wax was then removed from the bath of
liquid   air and   placed in a vacuum-jacketed test-tube, in order that it
might warm up with extreme slowness to the ordinary temperature
of the air.
    Having in this manner cooled the mass of paraffin enclosing the
glass spiral filled with mercury and the platinum resistance wire
entirely to the temperature of liquid air, a series of observations were
taken with the aid of two observers, one measuring the resistance of
the mercury by a Wheatstone's Bridge, while at the same time the
other observer at another slide wire bridge measured the resistance
of the platinum wire, these observations being taken quite simul
taneously, and continued whilst the mass heated up from — 197'9°
(platinum temperature) to 0°.          All proper corrections were then
applied to correct for the resistance of the connecting wires and the
bridge temperature ; and the observed resistance of the platinum
wire employed was corrected to determine from its resistance tem
peratures in terms of the standard platinum thermometer employed
by us in our investigations on the thermo-electric power of metals
and alloys (see Dewar and Fleming, 'Phil. Mag.,' July, 1895, p.

    Adopting the value for the specific resistance of pure mercury at
0°   C, which has been recommended by the Board of Trade Electrical
Committee, viz., 94,070 C.G.S. units, we have reduced the observed
resistances of the mercury column at various temperatures to their
equivalents in resistivity in absolute units, and placed these numbers
against the observed resistances in the table above.             As the specific
resistance of mercury       has been so carefully observed by many
observers, we did not, for a moment, consider it necessary to attempt
a further determination       of this constant.        On plotting out these
values of the resistivity of mercury in the form of a carve in terms
of the corresponding platinum temperatures, we find the resistivity
curve has the form shown in fig. 1.              It will be noticed that the
resistivity of the mercury decreases gradually from the point at
which the observations finished, viz., at +35° C, to the temperature
 —36° on the platinum scale.          At this point the resistivity rapidly
decreases to about one-quarter of its value in falling from —36° to
 —50°, and this sudden change all takes place within the range of
about 14° of temperature.       At the temperature of — 50° on the plati
num scale the resistivity curve again changes direction, and con
tinues downwards iu such a direction as to show that if produced
along the same line from the lowest temperature actually observed,
viz., —204° on the platinum scale, it would pass exactly through the
absolae zero of temperature on this scale, which is — 283° pt.                It is
also interesting to note that the part of the curve which corresponds
to the mercury in the liquid state is almost exactly parallel to that
 part of the curve which corresponds to mercury in the solid condi
 tion, although, owing to the difference in the absolute values of the
resistivities at these parts, the temperature coefficients as nsually
defined are very different.       In the solid condition between the tem
 peratures of —197-9° and —97°, the mean increase in resistivity is

80       Resistivity of Mercury at the Temperature of Liquid Air.

platinum scale as above defined.           It may be stated here that tem
peratures defined by this platinum scale do not differ by more than
about 0'5° from the Centigrade scale down to temperatares of — 100°,
but that the temperature of boiling liquid oxygen which, on the
Centigrade      scale  is denoted by     —182°, is, on the platinum   scale

derived    from our standard thermometer, denoted by — 19G'7°.                This
would show, therefore, that the temperature coefficient as usually
defined is 0-000884 between -35° and 0° *
    These observations are specially interesting as giving additional
proof that in the case of a metal of known purity the variation of
resistivity, as the metal is continuously cooled, is such as to indicate
that it would in all probability vanish at the absolute zero of tem
perature.       In the case of mercury, we are able to obtain a metal in a
state of almost perfect ohemical purity, and which, when continuously
cooled, passes into the solid condition under circumstances which arc
entirely favourable to the prevention of stresses in the interior of the
metal, due to cooling.             These measurements, therefore, afford a
farther confirmation of the law which we have enunciated as a
deduction from experimental observations, that the electrical resis
tivity of a pure metal vanishes at the absolute zero of temperature.

       Low Temperatures."                By J. A. Fleming, M.A., D.Se.,

    Although        considerable    attention   has  been    paid to the changes
 produced      in the magnetic properties of iron, particularly its magnetic
 permeability and hysteresis, at ordinary and at higher temperatures,
 but  little information has been obtained up to the present on the
 behaviour      of iron and steel as regards magnetic properties when
 cooled to very low temperatures.                By the employment of large
 quantities of liquid air we have been able to conduct a long series of
 experiments on this subject, the results of which we propose here
 briefly to summarise, leaving for a future communication                    fuller
 details and discussion of the results.             The experimental work has
 consisted   in making measurements, chiefly by ballistic galvanometer
 methods,    of the permeability and hysteresis loss in certain samples of
 iron and      steel, taken in the form of rings or cylinders.            The first
 experiments were concerned with the variation of the magnetic
 permeability of soft iron under varying magnetic forces, the iron
 being kept at a constant low temperature, obtained by placing it in
 liquid air in a state of very quiet ebullition in a vacuum vessel.
    *
      This is in close agreement    with the values obtained  by Guillaume, Mascart,
  •nd Strecker   for temperatures between 0° C. and + 30° C.

of the side of the cylinder so formed was 0'5229 sq. cm. The mean
diameter of the cylinder was 3'612 cm.               This cylinder of iron was
placed in a clay crucible packed with magnesia, the lid luted on with
fire-clay, and the crucible then raised to a bright red heat in a forge,
after which it was allowed to cool very slowly.            The iron cylinder was
thus carefully annealed out of contact with air or any material con
taining carbon. This soft annealed iron ring was then wound over
with silk ribbon, and two windings of silk-covered copper wire placed
upon it ; the first or primary circuit consisted of 131 turns of No. 26
double silk-covered wire ; the secondary circuit consisted of 112 turns
of No. 36 silk-covered copper wire.           The magnetising force to which
the ring is subjected when a current is sent through the primary coil
is measured by the value of 4n-/10 x the ampere-turns per unit of
length of the mean perimeter of the ring, and this, in the case of the
present ring, reduces to the nnmber 14'507 times the ampere current.
The magnetising force in absolute units is therefore very closely
given by the number obtained by multiplying the current flowing
through the primary coil in amperes by ]4'5.              The resistance of the
primary    coil  at  about   15° C.  was  0"92  ohm,   and  the resistance of the
secondary at the same temperature 8'98 ohms.                      The secondary
circuit of this ring coil or transformer was then connected through
appropriate resistances with a ballistic galvanometer, having a
resistance of 18 ohms. The primary circuit was connected through
suitable resistances and a current reverser with a circuit of con
stant potential.       By these arrangements it was possible to reverse
a definite current passing through the primary coils, and by observ
ing the throw produced by the ballistic galvanometer, to calculate
the induction in the iron core.          The galvanometer was calibrated by
reversing a known current passing through a long solenoid, in the
centre of which was placed a secondary coil of known turns and
dimensions, which was always kept in series with the secondary coil
of the transformer.          In this manner h series of observations was
taken with gradually increasing magnetising forces.                  Before com
mencing    each   series  of observations,   the  ring  was  carefully demagnet
ised by passing through the primary coil an alternating current,
 which was gradually reduced in strength to zero, the ring coil being
thus brought into a magnetically neutral condition.                An increasing

primary coil and reversed, the throw of the ballistic galvanometer
being noted in each case.           In the first set of observations the ring was

demagnetised the         ring as described by an alternating current.                   The
 ring was then taken out of the liquid               air,  allowed    to  warm up again
 to the   ordinary temperature, and another complete set of observations
 taken at the ordinary temperature.                    In this manner a series of
 eighteen complete sets of observations were taken, about half of them
 being at 15° C. and half of them at —185° C.                    In cooling the ring in
 liquid air, it was found to be important to cool it slowly by holding
 it somo time in the dense gaseous air lying over the liquid air.                         If
 suddenly plunged         into  liquid   air the  iron   becomes     hardened.       It was
 found that after the first five sets of observations, which were some

 84         Profs.  J. A. Fleming and    J. Dewar.     On  the
what variable, the annealed iron ring was brought into a completely
 stable condition, in which the cnrve of magnetic induction plotted in
terms of magnetising force taken at the low temperature waa different
from that taken at 15° C. by a perfectly constant amount, the observa
tions at the low temperature always lying on one curve, and those at
the higher temperature always lying closely on the other curve. In
the diagram in fig. 1 the two magnetisation curves are shown, the
firm line curve being the magnetisation curve at 15° C, and the
dotted curve being the magnetisation curve taken at —185° C. in the
liquid air. The figures in Table I are the mean values obtained from
the curves plotted from the thirteen sets of closely consistent observa
tions. These curves show that the permeability of soft annealed iron
is reduced when it is cooled to about 200° below zero, for the whole
range of magnetic forces between zero and 25 C.G.S. units.          The
permeability enrves for the two states are likewise similarly shown on
the same chart. The maximum permeability for this iron corresponds
with a magnetising force of about 2 C.G.S. units; the maximum
permeability at the ordinary temperatures for this iron is 3400, being
reduced to 2700 when the iron is cooled to the temperature of liquid
air. The percentage reduction in permeability becomes less as the
magnetising force is increased beyond or reduced below this critical
magnetising force. These experiments were repeated, as above
stated, many times very carefully with this ring of annealed soft
Swedish iron, and also with a second ring of the same kind, and
have invariably shown the same results, viz., that the permeability
of soft annealed iron is decreased by being cooled to this low tem
perature within the range of magnetising forces from 0 to 25.         It
will be seen that the highest induction reached in the case of this
iron is 14,500 C.G.S. units, corresponding to a magnetising force of
25.   This iron is of very high magnetic quality, and is of the same
character as that which is much used for the construction of alterna
ting current transformers in commercial use.
   A series of experiments was then made with the same transformer,
keeping the magnetising forces constant, but allowing the iron to rise
gradually in temperature up from the temperature of liquid air to
15° C.   In these experiments the transformer was embedded in a
mass of paraffin wax with a platinum wire resistance thermometer
also embedded in the same mass in close contact with the ring coil.
The paraffin wax encasing the ring coil and thermometer having
been cooled down to the temperature of liquid air by immersing it in
a large bath of the liquid air, it was then lifted out and placed in a
vacuum-jacketed test-tube, so as to heat up with extreme slowness,
and a series of observations taken by reversing a constant magneti
sing force at intervals, and observing at the same instant the tem
perature of the ring coil as given by the platinum thermometer.

   The results show that as the temperature rises up from —185° C, or
 — 200° on the   platinum scale temperature, up to the ordinary tempera
ture, the permeability of the soft iron for the particular magnetising
force selected increases perfectly uniformly, the curve of increasing
permeability with temperature being nearly a straight line.
   In   the next place, we have examined the hysteresis of the same soft
iron ring at different temperatures and for different maximum induc
tions. These observations were carried out by taking a complete
series of hysteresis cnrvcs with the ballistic galvanometer, gradually
increasing the inductions from zero to 12,0C0.            After the complete
hysteresis curves were obtained, their areas were carefully integrated
with an Amsler planimeter, and the values reduced so as to express,
the hysteresis loss in watts per lb. per 100 cycles per second, and
these values plotted in terms of the maximum value of the magnetic
induction per square centimetre of the iron core corresponding to
each particular hysteresis loss.       Nothing would be gained by giving
the full details of all the observations by which these hysteresis
curves were obtained. They were exceedingly numerous, and the
tedious nature of the ballistic observations made it a matter of pro
longed observation to securo the whole series necessary, but the final
results are shown in Table        III. The curve in fig. 3 represents tho
increase of hysteresis loss with induction, and the observations which

with certain conclusions of Messrs. Laws and Warren (see 1 Pro
ceedings of the American Academy of Sciences,' vol. 30, p. 490).
These observers made a series of experiments on a material which
was practically a very soft steel, and employing a differential watt
meter, measured the hysteresis loss in the iron at varying and
increasing temperatures up to 600° or 700°. They found that the
hysteresis loss in this material did not begin to decrease sensibly
until about 150° C. ; after that it decreased regularly in accordance
with the simple linear function of the temperature. In one experi
ment which they tried with the same material cooled to —78° C. in
solid carbonic acid and ether, they found no difference between the
hysteresis loss of this soft steel at that temperature and at the ordinal'
temperatures.      Our results, which have been carried to the mucli
lower temperature of liquid air, indicate that in the case of soft
annealed Swedish iron the hysteresis loss is not changed by cooling
from ordinary temperatures to the temperature of liquid air. As we
kuow that the hysteresis loss of soft iron decreases when the tem
perature is increased, from the ordinary experience with transformers
 in commercial use, the matter that requires further investigation is to
discover the temperature at which the hysteresis loss sensibly changes
 and begins to diminish.
                 Experiments on Unannealed Swedish Iron.
     We have also carried out a series of experiments of the same
 character with unannealed iron and steel.         A ring coil was con
 structed of sheet iron of the same quality as that forming the core of
 the soft iron transformer above described, but no special pains were
                                                          "
 taken to anneal the iron, and as it was " hardened          in a magnetic
 sense by being bent into shape, this difference in quality showed
 itself in the magnetic observations. A ring coil was constructed of
 the following dimensions :— The thickness of the strip was 0 031 cm.,
 width of the strip L'24 cm., the ring was formed by 23£ layers of
  this sheet iron wound up closely into the form of a ring. The out
  side diameter of this ring was 4 cm., the inside diameter 2'13 cm.,
  the cross-section of the iron in the ring was therefore 0'9032 sq. cm.,
  and the mean perimeter of the ring !)62 cm. This iron ring was not
  annealed in any way, but it was simply wound over with silk ribbon,
  and then had placed upon it two coils of wire. The primary coil
  consisted of 150 turns of No. 26 wire, having a resistance of
  0 383 ohm, and the secondary coil consisted of 240 turns of No. 3(5
  wire having a resistance of 8*092 ohms. As the diameter of cross-
  section of the ring was not very small compared with the mean

that the mean magnetising force to which the iron was exposed was
closely expressed by the valuo 20219, multiplied by the ampero
current flowing through the primary coil.           This coil had its second
ary circuit connected up to the galvanometer, as above described,
and a series of observations wore taken with this coil by reversing a
constant magnetising current passing through the primary coil, arid
observing the throw of the ballistic galvanometer connected with the
secondary circuit. The ring coil, together with the platinum thermo
meter, was embedded, as above described, in a mass of paraffin wax,
and the whole mass, after having          been cooled down to the tempera
ture of  liquid ail-, was slowly allowed to boat up again. Observations
were taken with two different magnetising forces over the range of
temperature      from —185° C. np to the ordinary temperature, and
from the calculated induction in the ring determined for each mag
netising    force, the permeability was found corresponding to each
particular force and temperature.          The results of these observations
are given in Table IV, and are delineated in fig. 2, in the form of
two curves marked nnannealed iron.

    The    results of the observations, as indicated in fig. 2 in the
curves marked Unamiealed Iron, show that for this unannealed iron
 the permeability     increases as the temperature falls, and is exactly
 the reverse in the case of the same quality of iron carefully annealed.
 The difference, also, between the two materials is very marked

112        Profs.   J.   A. Fleming and      J.   Devvar.   On the
at low temperatures.         The soft annealed iron if cooled slowly to
— 185° C. recovers its original permeability when heated up again to
ordinary temperatures.         The unannealed iron, however, after cooling
to the same low temperature, retains some of its increased perme
ability when heated up again to 15° C. The unaunealed iron cannot
be taken over the temperature range again and again with the same
definite permeability values at each recurrent temperature, as in the
case of the soft annealed iron.      The unaunealed iron is more or less
permanently changed in magnetic character every time it is heated
or cooled.
    With this transformer, a long series of observations were taken to
determine the hysteresis loss corresponding to different inductions
when taken at the ordinary temperatures, and the temperature of
liquid air.     The hysteresis cycles were taken with the ballistic
galvanometer over wide ranges of maximum induction, the trans
former being alternately at the ordinary temperature and in liquid
air, but no constant magnetic condition could be obtained. In one
net of observations, at a given maximum induction the hysteresis loss
was increased when the transformer was raised in temperature, and
for another series of observations at the same induction it was
 diminished.     It is therefore impossible to make any definite state
 ment with regard to the magnetic hysteresis loss in this unannealed
 iron ring coil at the two temperatures.       The mere fact of immersing
 the unannealed     iron  in the liquid air changes its magnetic qualities
to such a degree that it is no longer the same material, magnetically
 considered, after, as before its immersion. One curious fact, however,
 was noticed very soon with regard to unannealed iron, and that            is,
 that if the unannealed iron ring coil has a small magnetising current
 passed through its primary coil, the secondary coil being connected
 to the galvanometer, the sudden immersion of this ring coil into
 liquid air invariably causes a deflection of the ballistic galvanometer,
 even when the primary magnetising current remains perfectly con
 stant in value, thus showing a sudden and very large increase in the
 permeability of the unannealed iron.          Whilst the iron        in the
                                                                      is
 liquid airit  retains this increased permeability. If brought suddenly
 out its permeability again diminishes, but not with equal rapidity.
 This is  partly accounted for by the fact that the iron        cooled with
                                                                 is
 immense rapidity when      it   goes into the liquid air, but    it
                                                                   heats up
 again  much    more   slowly   when
                                   it   isbrought  out.   The  definite fact,
 however, remains, which has been repeatedly observed, that the
 cooling of this unannealed iron to a low temperature always increases
 its permeability, as far as we know, no matter whatever may be the
 magnetising force employed. One difficulty experienced in dealing
 with unannealed iron      is   the fact that in taking     up to the high
                                                            it
 magnetising forces, and by the process required to remove residual

       Magnetic Permeability, #c,   of Iron at Low Temperatures.         93
magnetism by the application    of an alternating current, the iron is so
altered   in magnetic qualities that it is impossible to repeat two sets
of observations  under precicely similaF circumstances.  With regard
to the  unannealed iron, it may be noted that if an ordinary magnet
isation curve is taken up to very high magnetisation forces, and the
iron then demagnetised by the application of an alternating current
gradually reduced, the first magnetisation       curve can never bo
repeated  exactly again on applying increasing magnetisation forces,
but a curve is obtained which lies slightly inside the first curve, and
which indicates that the permeability has been reduced.       The sub
sequent repetition of this process will give a series of curves which
occupy different positions, but which do not precisely repeat any of
them. Hence it is impossible to repeat at a constant temperature with
this unannealed iron exactly any magnetisation or permeability curve.
In the case of the annealed iron it is quite different.      A magnet
isation curve can be obtained after having carefully de-magnetised
the iron, if this magnetisation is pressed up to nearly its limit and
the iron then de-magnetised by the application       of an alternating
and decaying magnetising force, a second magnetisation curve can be
obtained on again applying an ascending magnetising force, but it
will not coincide exactly with the first curve.     The annealed iron
can, however, be brought back into its original condition by dipping
it a few times into liquid air. Under these conditions, we have been
able   to repeat as frequently as required the observations with the
annealed  iron taken at the different temperatures. In the case of the
unannealed    iron the changes produced in it by immersing it in the
liquid air and by magnetising and demagnetising        it,
                                                       are such as to
render      almost impossible to obtain results capable of precise
           it
repetiiion, with respect to the hysteresis loss and permeability for
varying magnetising forces.
                     Experiments with Hardened Iron.
  A    third set of experiments were taken with a ring coil of the same
dimensions as the ring coil made of soft annealed transformer iron
first described.    This third coil was constructed of the same sample
of   Sankey's transformer     sheet iron as the above described soft
annealed ring, but    it  was treated subsequently to its formation in
the following manner —  :
  A    short piece of iron gas-pipe was made red hot in a forge the  ;
ring coil, having been constructed, was dropped into the red-hot pipe,
and the ends of this pipe loosely plugged up with slag wool     the red-
                                                                 ;
hot pipe was then covered ever with cinders, and the mass allowed to
 cool.   Under these conditions the ring coil was annealed in an atmo
 sphere of carbonic oxide and in contact with hot carbon     ;the sheet

94           Profs.   J.  A. Fleming and       J. Dewar.       On the
iron was, therefore, under these circumstanees, caso-hardened, and
¦will be referred to as the hardened iron ring.            Having been formed
into a transformer in the above-described manner, a long series of
observations were taken with this coil to determine its permeability
at different temperatures and with different magnetising forces. The
results of these observations are shown in the Table V below, and are
delineated graphically in the curves in fig. 2, marked Hardened Iron.
The results show in a remarkable manner that the iron so
treated undergoes a very considerable increase in magnetic perme
ability when it is cooled to the temperature of liquid air ; for certain
magnetising forces the permeability at the lowest temperature
reached may be increased as much as five times. In this respect,
therefore, this iron presents in an exaggerated degree the same
qualities found in the unanuealed iron.

 pianoforte wire.      We have found in this case the curious result that
 pianoforte steel behaves in the same manner as the annealed soft

   We propose   to continue the examination of the anomalous behaviour
so presented by iron in different states of hardening by examining in
the same way the changes of permeability in the case of several iron
rings of the same dimensions formed in the one case of soft annealed
iron, and in another case of the same quality of iron hardened, and in
the remaining cases using steel of known composition at different states
of temper.    We desire to add that in the condnct of this research we
have been under great obligations to Mr. J. E. Petavel for rendering
ns very efficient assistance in taking the exceedingly tedious ballistic
galvanometer observations, and in reducing them when taken.

               The Measurement of Potential in Theory and Practice.
    §   1.  An electrograph belonging to the Meteorological Office has
 been in operation at Kew Observatory, with interruptions, since 1861.
 The results obtained in the early years of its existence were dis

                       Electricity at the Keto Observatory.                      97
cussed     in 1868 by Professor Everett,* and the results obtained in
1880 were discussed           in 1881 by my predecessor, Mr. Whipple, t
Nearly two years ago, with the approval of the Kew Observatory
Committee and the Meteorological Office,            I commenced an investiga
tion intended as preliminary to a consideration of the expediency of
further publication of the electrograph records.
   My first object was to find out whether definite quantitative
measurements of potential could be derived from the electrograph
curves.      To aid in this investigation observations have been made
at several spots near the Observatory with a portable electrometer,
by White, of Glasgow, whose scale value was determined at Uni
versity College by the kind assistance of Professor Carey Foster.
   To render intelligible the bearing of these observations on the
question, a brief description is required of the nature and position of
the electrograph.      J    It consists essentially of a water-dropper and a
quadrant electrometer.           The water is held in a can, some 14 inches
high and 15 inches in diameter, supported on three insulators of the
Mascart pattern.         Prom the can a tapering tube, resting on a fourth
insulator, projects through a hole in a window facing the west. The
end of the tube whence the water issues is 4£ feet from the west wall
of the Observatory, and 10 feet above the ground.                  The stream of
water is regulated by two taps in the long tube. Prom the water-
dropper an insulated wire passes to the needle of the quadrant
electrometer.        One pair of quadrants are kept at a given positive
potential,    the  other   pair at an equal negative potential, by means of
 a battery of 60 cells in scries whose centre is to earth.             The needle
suspension carries a mirror, and light reflected from it produces a
cnrve on photographic paper which is wound round a cylinder driven
 by clock-work.        The position of the base line answering to the earth's
 potential   — treated as zero— is obtained by putting the electrometer
needle to earth, twice at least for each curve.           Of late years the value
 of the cnrve ordinates, in volts, has been obtained from time to time
 by connecting the electrometer needle and one terminal of the
 portable electrometer, and varying their joint potential by means of
 an electrophorus.          Simultaneous readings are taken of the curve
 ordinate and the portable electrometer.
    If  tbe ideal were attainable, the stream from the water-dropper
 shonld break up exactly at the end of the tube, and be always
 sufficiently copious to ensure the immediate picking up by the can
 and the electrometer needle of the potential existing in the air at the
 spot in question.

98            Dr. C. Chree.            Observations on Atmospheric
                    Interpretation of Elecirograph Record.
   § 2. The first question is : supposing the apparatus perfect, does
the electrograph supply information as to the potential anywhere
except at the spot where the stream of water breaks into drops ? To
answer this question, one has to consider the influence of the environ
ment, notably the proximity of a lofty building.
   An investigation into this point was made ten years ago by Pro
fessor Exner, of Vienna, who found the equipotential surfaces near
a building much deflected from horizontality.                    His results indicated
apparently that for practical purposes the whole building might be
regarded as possessing the earth's potential.                  Whilst it was antici
pated   that  Exner's     conclusions     would    hold   good of Kcw Observatory,
it appeared prudent as a check to take observations with the portable
electrometer, at a series of points in a vertical plane perpendicular
to the west wall near the water-dropper.                   Observations were taken
at heights of 3, 6, and 9 feet from the ground, which possesses, it may
be explained, a slope away from the building.                  The base line, starting
at the Observatory wall, terminated 57 feet away in a parallel wall
11 feet high, belonging to a much lower building.                     The observations
were repeated on several days, but one example will suffice.                           The
potential   measurements         are  in volts,  the   distances    from   the   Observa
tory wall in feet.

   In forming the means in the last column the results at                    3  feet from
the Observatory wall wero omitted.                The readings were uncorrected
for variations of potential         during   the   interval occupied by the obser
vations.
   So far as they go, the results are clearly confirmatory of Exner's.
They show that tho influence of a tall building in pulling down the
potential extends to a considerable distance.
                                                                    records on the im
   § 3. The large dependence of the electrograph
mediate environment           of  the   water   jet  complicates      matters, but this
need not prove a serious obstacle if the conditions allow us to regard
the problem as one of statical electricity, in which influencing bodies
are either stationary or at a distance. On this hypothesis, simulta
neous potentials at any two neighbouring points would stand to one

                         Electricity at the Kew Observatory.                                       911
another          in a practically        constant         ratio,   a function   only of their
geometrical coordinates.
   If once this ratio were determined, one could deduce the potential
at either point from that observed at the other. Regarding the spot
where the water jet breaks up as one of these points, and selecting
for the other a spot sufficiently distant from the building, one
could deduce the potential gradient in the open, i.e., the increase in
voltage per unit of height above the ground.     This point of view was
apparently   acted   upon by Exner,*   and  by Elster and Geitel.f In
both instances the existence of corroborative evidence is referred to,
but     I
       am not aware that particulars have been published.      It would
also appear that Exner and Elster and Geitel directed their attention
mainly, if not exclusively, to clear quiet days.
   There being no limitation to the use of the Kew electrograph, it
appeared advisable not to restrict the investigations      to days of a
special kind, or to a particular season of the year.
                                       Selection of Stations.
    § 4.    It
           appeared    desirable to compare the potential at more than
two stations, so as   to ensure a sufficient variety in the surroundings.
I shall distinguish   the stations selected by the letters A, B, C, D, E,
F. Of these A is      the flat top of a stone pillar, 3| feet high, in the
 Observatory garden, about 56 yards from the Observatory; it is
surrounded by a frequently mown grass lawn.             B is the top of a
temporary wooden stand, 6| feet high, and only 3£ feet from the west
wall of the Observatory.       G is the centre of a flat plank supported
3|  feet above the ridge  of a wooden building, situated about 100 feet to
the south-west of the Observatory ; it is 18 feet above the ground. D
is on the south side of a stone parapet, 2 feet high, encircling the flat

                            5^

57 feet above the ground.
   The observations were taken with the portable electrometer, and,
as the burning end of the fuse was at a height of some 12 to 16 inches
above the base of the electrometer, an addition of, say,      feet requires     1^
to be made to the altitudes of the several stations to get the height
from the ground of the spot whoso potential was measured.
    A was the only station that could be regarded as practically unin
fluenced by the neighbourhood of         building, and even in its case we

100          Dr. C. Chree.    Observations on Atmospheric
have the influence of a massive stone pillar some 2\ square feet in
section. A calculation of the potential gradient which regards the
observations at A as referring to a spot 60 inches above the ground
in the open is certain to give an under-estimate.     As it is impossible,
however, to dispense with a support of some kind, and the presence
of the observer is also a disturbing influence, no exact allowance can
be made for this.
   There have been four principal scries of observations. In the first,
occupying part of November and December, 1894, observations were
taken, when practicable, once a day at stations A, B, C, D, and latterly
at E also.   In the second series, during part of March and April,
1895, observations were usually taken about 10.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m.
at each of the stations except F. The third series, during part of
June and July, 1895, closely resembled the second; and the only
material difference in the fourth was the substitution of station F for
station D.
   No observations Were taken on Sundays or on Saturday afternoons.
The observations were taken in a fixed order, and, thanks to the skill
of the observer, Mr. E. G. Constable, a complete set of readings
occupied only some seven or eight minutes.          The time scale of the
electrograph curves is far from open, and for this and other reasons     I
have judged it best not to attempt to reduce the readings with the
portable electrometer to a common instant.
             Comparison  of Results at  the different Stations.
   § 5. I  have taken A as base station, and have found the ratios
borne to the individual readings there by the corresponding readings
at the other stations.
   Let rA, rB represent corresponding readings at A and B, and let
                                   -
                            rat. = n 2 (rB/rA),
where 2 denotes summation for a series of n observations.        Then r„,A
maybe called the mean value of the ratio for the series of observations.
   Also let us apply the term percentage deviation of the ratio from its
mean to the quantity
                        S{(rB/rA)^rB,A}x
in which the terms in the numerator are taken irrespective of sign.
   Table  II gives the extreme and mean values of the ratios during
each series of observations, excluding three or four occasions when
negative potentials were met with.

   In series      I   there were only twelve observations at station E. In
series  III   the mean ratios for the higher stations are depressed by
one abnormally             low reading.           The means in the different series
vary, but the differences are too small to warrant any positive con
clusion. They indeed suggest the possibility of the potentials at the
higher stations being relatively somewhat higher in winter than in
summer, but this may arise from a slight want of uniformity in the
procedure followed at the different seasons.
   The departures of the maxima and minima in Table                                 II  from the
means are considerable, but the number of instances in which the
departures from the mean are large is in reality small.                             This will be
seen by reference to Table             III,    which gives the percentage deviations
of the ratios from their means, treating each series of observations
separately.

    The irregularity in rB/rA maybe due in part to the slightly unsteady
character of the stand forming station B. The potentials at B were
 also much the lowest, so that errors of reading were there of most
 importance.       At the highest station, F, the variations occurring in
 the potential sometimes made accurate measurements difficult.
    § 6. To give a clearer idea of the degree of uniformity shown by
 Table III,   I  give in Table IV the extreme and mean readings at the
 several stations, omitting, as in Table II, occasions of negative
 potential.

   On one exceptional day the potential at A varied from —1200 to
 + 1290 volts in less than forty minutes; at station F it varied from
— 2424 to over +4000 volts in about the same time.

   § 7. Table V gives the mean values of the ratios for the forenoon
and afternoon observations, treated separately, during those days
when there were readings at both 10.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. The days
available numbered 17, 10, and 9 respectively in the second, third,
and fourth series of observations.           The headings " a.m." and " p.m."
distinguish the forenoon and afternoon observations.
   In each case treated in table V the mean value of the potential for
the forenoon was considerably higher than that for the afternoon.
Thus, at station A the ratio of the forenoon to the afternoon mean

    The difference          between the mean potentials at the two hours on
the specified days being so large, we may reasonably suppose                                 that if
any two other hours had been selected results would have been'
obtained showing a degree of accordance similar to that in Table V.
The degree of accordance in the case of series                          II  is truly remarkable,
and in series IV, considering the smaller number of observations, it is
but little inferior.           If series      III  stood alone, we might suspect that in
the afternoon the potential fell off more at the higher stations than at
the lower, and this may of course be a true phenomenon of the season,
midsummer, to which that series belongs.
                    Possible Dependence of Ratios on the Weather.
    § 8.   It is conceivable that under one regular set of climatic condi
tions the potentials at the higher stations might relatively to the
lower be either abnormally high or abnormally low. To test this
point, the observations in each series have been divided into sets,
according to the value of such a ratio as rE/rA.                             Attention has been
confined to series          II,   III,   and    IV,    as in series I the times of observa
tion were less regular ; but the forenoon and afternoon observations
in series     II   and   III   havo been considered separately.
    Supposing the number of measures of, say, rE/rA available in any
one instance to be 2n or 2n + ], the n cases in which the ratio is
largest form one set, the n cases in which it is smallest the other.
For each of these sets the corresponding mean values of certain
meteorological elements have been calculated, the data for the indi
vidual times of observation being derived from the self-recording
instruments employed in the Observatory. The figures as to aqueous
 vapour and humidity have been deduced from the thermograms, with
 the aid of a modification of Glaisher's table, compiled by the Meteoro
 logical Office.

 104         Dr. C. Chree.        Observations on Atmospheric
    By " sunshine in hours
                              "
                                 is meant the number of hours of sunshine
 measured by the Campbell-Stokes recorder up to the time of observa
 tion. The data under this head have been limited to the most sunny
 series of observations, viz.,  II  and III.
    The results are exhibited in Table VI, which shows also the
 maxima and minima values of the meteorological elements observed
 during the several sets of n observations.
    There is in Table VI no uniform and conspicuous connexion
 between the value of rE/A, or rF/A, and the corresponding value of any
 one of the meteorological elements considered.         In the case alike of
barometric pressure and temperature the second mean — answering
 to the n lowest values of rE/A or rr;A — is higher than the first in five
 instances ont of six. The differences between the two means are
 generally, however, so small that the phenomenon may be purely
accidental.    In the afternoon observations of series         II  there is a
somewhat conspicuous association of a low value in r£/A with a high
value of previous sunshine ; but in series       III  there is no trace of
such a phenomenon.
    The question whether there may not be certain occasional types of
 weather, whose influence is masked in such a table as VI, which are
associated with either a high or a low value of the ratio rK,A, remains,
I  think, open. Evidence is in my hands which leads me to believe
that during a low ground fog the potential gradient as a rule is
decidedly higher near the ground where the fog is thick than higher
up where the fog is slight.
                 Summary of Results at Different Stations.
    § 9. The conclusion I am disposed to draw, though I regard it as
only a probability, is that such general phenomena as diurnal or
annual variation of potential near the ground in the open may be
deduced with fair accuracy by applying a constant factor to the
records of a portable electrometer, employed regularly at a fixed
point on the Observatory roof or near its walls. It must be remem
bered, however, that all six stations were comparatively close together,
and that the equipotential surface passing through the highest station
would be in the open perhaps only 14 or 15 feet above the ground.
There is thus no evidence to warrant the deduction of conclusions
for a spot a mile or t wo away or a few hundred feet above the ground.
    On the trustworthiness of individual results deduced by means of
a constant factor, one would not, after inspecting Tables         II and  III,
be disposed to place much reliance.        This question can hardly, how
ever, be settled satisfactorily unless one have apparatus for taking
the observations at the different stations absolutely simultaneously.
The largest departures from the means in Tables             II  and   III  are

106          Dr. C. Chree.       Observations on Atmospheric
doubtless due in great part to changes occurring whilst the observa
tions were in progress.
               Possible Influence of Pattern of Instrument.
   § 10.  The conclusions in the previous paragraph refer as yet only
to the portable electrometer.       They can bo extended to the electro-
graph records only if we are able to show that a fairly uniform
ratio exists between the potential obtained with the water-dropper
at a fixed station and that obtained with the portable electrometer at
one or other of the stations A to E.
   The position of the water-dropper was maintained undisturbed,
 barring accidents, throughout the observations.              It thus suffices to
¦compare the curve readings with the corresponding ones with the
portable electrometer at station A. The curves were accordingly
measured at the mean times of each set of observations.                 The ratios
of the individual readings to those at station A were                   calculated,
and results obtained analogous to those in Table II. It will suffice
for our present object to consider the results analogous to those in
Table III.

   The spot where the jet breaks up resembles B more closely than
any other station, and shares its low potential.           Further, the electro-
graph curves are read to the nearest 5 volts only, so that uncertainties
in the reading are even more important than with the portable, read to
the nearest 1 or 2 volts, at station B. Thus, the results in Table VII
are, at least, not conspicuously worse than those          in Table    III.   As a
matter of fact, the results in Table       VII     were,   I  believe, somewhat
prejudiced by    a variation  in  the  water   jet throughout the day (see
§ 11). Supposing this defect removed, the evidence points to the
conclusion that the diurnal, and possibly the annual, variations got
out with the water-dropper situated in the Observatory, and the
portable electrometer at station A, may be expected to be in good
accord, assuming the conditions under which each instrument works
to be maintained uniform.
   Attention was also directed to the possibility of the two different
patterns of instrument being differently affected by the same climatic
conditions.    Each series of observations — the forenoon and afternoon
observations of series     II  and    III  being treated separately — was

 the  mean values of the ratios borne by the electrograph readings to
 the corresponding ones with the portable electrometer at station A
 were calculated for the first n and the last n instances separately.
 Supposing ru ra, and r to denote the mean ratios for the first », the

 may     be   regarded     as the average     percentage deviation     of the two
 groups from the mean.           Table VIII gives the value of this quantity
in the case of the three meteorological elements from which a differen
 tial effect   was most feared.

     A plus sign denotes that when the meteorological element in
 question was above its mean the water-dropper was more than usually
 effective, relative to the portable electrometer ; a minus sign implies
 the  contrary.
    The evidence in the case of wind velocity is so contradictory that
we can safely assume that no uniform differential action exists.
    In the case of the two other elements the evidence is more consistent,
and it is possible that a small differential action may exist.              It looks
as if much moisture, when not counterbalanced by a contrary action of
sunshine, tends slightly to pull down the reading of the water-
dropper relatively to that of the portable electrometer.              The pheno
menon, supposing it to exist, might be ascribed to a loss of efficiency
in a water jet when the vapour in the air increases, and a similar loss
in a flame collector during bright sunshine.           But an influence at least
as likely is that of moisture, during damp weather, on the insulation
of the   electrograph.

108           Dr. C. Cliree.    Observations on Atmospheric
            Defects in Water-dropper and Portable Electrometer.
    §11. Both instruments aim at communicating the potential at a
¦fixed point in the air to an insulated conductor by detaching from a
mass in electrical connexion with the conductor a continuous succes
sion of small elements.     It is at least doubtful whether either instru
ment can ever fully accomplish its object. If the object were so far
accomplished that a constant fraction of the true potential were
recorded, the deficiency of this fraction from unity would hardly be
of primary importance in dealing with diurnal or annual variation ;
but if the fraction has itself a diurnal or secular variation it is a very
different matter.
    In the water-dropper a uniform state of insulation of the water-
can, electrometer needle, and connecting wire is not easy. Absolute
insulation, when a voltage runs up to hundreds, is a somewhat ideal
state of perfection.    When the insulation is indifferent, the recorded
may    fall far below  the true potential.   The water jet, so to speak, is
running up the potential, leakage from the can, wire, &c, running it
down. The resultant effect depends on a variety of things, e.g., the
rate at which the air potential is changing and the supply of water
particles.    Unless the potential is unusually steady, and the insula
tion exceptionally good, one may expect higher potential records with
a copious jet than with a restricted one.
    In the portable electrometer there is similarly some ground for
expecting the potential recorded to be influenced by the rate of com
 bustion of the fuse.
    The uniformity of the disintegrating mass may also be of import
 ance. With a water-dropper there ought not to be much uncertainty
on this ground, but as electrometer fuses are articles of commerce
 uniformity in their material and condition is less easily ensured.
    There is a final source of uncertainty common to the two instru
 ments as commonly nsed. With the water-dropper the spot where
 the jet breaks up is apt to be slightly influenced by variations in the
 water pressure. When the issuing jet makes as usual an angle with
 the wall of a building, the consequences, as appears from Table II, are
 likely to be appreciable. It was a recognition of this fact that led to
 the taking of the observations with the portable electrometer at two
 nearly fixed hours, the afternoon one when the can was nearly full,
 the forenoon one when it was about half empty.
     The corresponding defect with the portable electrometer is the
 burning down of the fuse. When the fuse is used in a vertical
 position, the height of the spot whose potential is being measured
 diminishes as the fuse burns, and with the height the potential falls
 off.
     No direct comparison of the readings of the two instruments at one

                    Electricity at the Kew Observatory.                109
and    the same spot was attempted during the observation!;, as it
seemed undesirable to interrupt the continuity of the electrograph
records.     All that § 10 shows is that during any one series of observa
tions the fractions of the true potential picked up by the two instru
ments stood to one another in a fairly constant ratio.       The presump
tion, certainly, is that neither fraction altered much throughout the
few weeks covered by any one of the four series of observations.
                     I
    It is, however, regret to say, perfectly certain, from the data on
which § 10 is based, that one at least of the two instruments varied
very considerably in the course of a year and possessed an appre
ciable diurnal variation.
    § 12. On the discovery of these defects it became not only justifi
able but necessary to subject the water-dropper            itself to direct
experiments.       These have led to my proposing certain alterations
which are now in process of execution.         They aim at bringing the
water-can and electrometer close together, and at maintaining a
more uniform water pressure than heretofore.
    It appears also desirable to check the working of the apparatus in
some way [involving the arrival at exact numerical results.            The
following operations A, B, C will, it is hoped, prove sufficient. The
operation C need not be performed so frequently ns A or B.
    A. Charge the quadrant electrometer needle to a high potential,
and observe the rate of leakage over a fixed range by timing the
motion of the spot of light across a scale with —
     (1) the wire connexion to the water-can complete, but the jet not
          flowing ;
     (2) t he wire connexion broken at the   can ;
    (3) the wire connexion broken at the     electrometer.
    B. As a substitute, or as subsidiary      to A. Connect a portable
electrometer to the water-can, and, with      the jet flowing, observe the
potential recorded by the portable, when —
     (1) the can is connected as usual to the qnadrant electrometer;
     (2) the connexion is broken at the quadrant electrometer ;
     (3) the connexion is broken at the can.
     C. Take a sufficient number of observations at a fixed station out
side with a portable electrometer, at or near two fixed hours a day,
 so chosen that at one hour the can is almost full, whilst at the other
 it is at least half empty.
     The use to be made of the results is obvious.
     I should also recommend any one using a portable olectrometer to
 testits scale valne from time to time by comparison with an absolute
 electrometer or a large battery of constant cells. It is well to lay in
 a new stock of fuses before exhausting one's supply, and to compare

                                     Part IT.
       Application of Results    to Theories of Atmospheric Electricity.
    § 13.  It  seemed   desirable to consider what bearing the special
 experiments might have on the general facts and theories of atmo
 spheric electricity.     In this investigation special attention has been
 given to the possible influence of aqueous vapour on electrical
 potential, on account of the important researches of Exner, and of
 Elster and Geitel.
                 Theories  of Exner and of Elster and Geitel.
    § 14. Exner has advanced the view that the potential gradient in
the open, dVjdn in his notation, and the density q0 of aqueous vapour
simultaneously present in the atmosphere, are connected by a formula
                       dYjdn = constant-;- (l + kq0),
whero k is apparently a constant, the same at all places and at all
seasons of the year.       Exner,   I believe, limited his observations, and
presumably the application of the formula, to days comparatively
quiet and free from clouds. To test the formula he arranged his
observations in groups, according to the amount of vapour present,
and compared the mean vapour density — measured in grams per
cubic metre — with the mean potential gradient, measured in volts
per metre of height above the ground.          In the ' Wien. Sitz.,' Bd. 99,
p. 618, he gives a table including results from Vienna, Wolfenbuttel,
St. Gilgen, and India, in which the vapour densities vary from 1'7
to 23 5.      The table unquestionably shows a diminishing mean
potential gradient accompanying an increasing moan vapour density.
For values of qa from 12"4 and upwards, however, — including all the
Indian and most of the St. Gilgen observations — the change in dVjdn
is somewhat small and irregular. An earlier, and somewhat similar,
but less extensive table by Exner will be found on p. 434 of ' Wien.
Sitz.,' Bd. 96.
   For information as to Elster and Geitel's work I am mainly indebted
to a long paper by them in the ' Wien. Sitz.,' Bd. 101, p. 703, 1892.
During 1888-91 they took an extensive series of observations on
quiet days at Wolfenbuttel. If I follow their explanations, they took
ej*e observations some ten times a day with an electrometer, in which
flame from a lamp acts as collector, and deduced the mean value of
the potential gradient dYjdn for the day.              They compare these
potential gradients grouped according to the value of the vapour
density with Exner's formula, taken to be
              {dYjdn) (in volts per metre)    as 1410/(1 4- 115 go),

    It would appear that Elster and Geitel, like Exner, found large
 departures from the mean dYjdn of a group amongst its individual
 members.
    §  15. Elster and Geitel next proceed to investigate a possible con
nexion between the potential gradient and the intensity of that species
of solar radiation which dissipates a negative charge on an insulated
sphere of polished zinc. If          I understand them rightly, they measured
the mid-day intensity         J  of this radiation, and compared the potential
gradient with several formulas in which the variable was either                        J  or
if, where      f   is a " Beleuchtungsfactor," equal apparently to (possible
hours of sunshine) /12.            Taking a formula dVjdn = 110 + 360a_J,
where log a          =  O'OIOO, they give the following comparison of the
resnlts of observation and theory : —

    The agreement seems better than in the case of Exner's formula,
and     Elster and Geitel seem strongly inclined to regard ultra-violet
radiation as the direct cause of variations of potential on normal quiet
clear days. They consider apparently that there are only two defective
links in the chain of evidence, viz. : —
    (1) absolute proof that the earth          is electrified negatively       ;
    (2) proof that there is a sufficient supply at the earth's surface of
materials susceptible to the influence of ultra-violet light.
    There are, of course, numerous other theories of atmospheric
electricity, but none, so far as           I  know, admits of numerical com
parison with observation.

112           Dr. (J. Chree.     Observations on Atmospheric
                  Method of Treating Kew Observations.
    § 16. In discussing the Kew observations        I have in general em
ployed   a method   differing from   the  grouping system of Exner and
Elster and Geitel, and have also treated the several series separately.
It is clear from data mentioned by Exner that the potential gradients
for individual members of his groups varied in some instances
largely from tlie mean ; and it was soon obvious that the same
phenomenon would present itself if any similar treatment were
 applied to the Kew results.      This is undesirable, because by varying
 the limits of the groups the accordance of the results with a par
ticular formnla may be much improved, or the reverse. However
impartially, so to speak, the lines may be drawn, there is undeniably
a risk of introducing some fictitious result ; and no critic can feel
that he is in a position to judge of the results until he has examined
for himself the circumstances of the grouping, a labour he naturally
shrinks from. Again a wide range of such an element as vapour
density can be obtained at a particular place only by combining
results from all seasons of the year. This brings us to a second
question. Electrical potential gradient has like vapour density, sun
shine, and temperature, a large annual variation, only, unlike these
elements, it is highest in winter. It is thus obvious that when obser
vations from all seasons of the year are treated promiscuously, there
is almost sure to be a marked association of high potential with low
vapour density, little sunshine, and low temperature ; and a judi
ciously selected formula which makes potential diminish as any one
of these elements incrcasos is certain to show some approach to
agreement with observation. It is thus desirable to compare together
observations from a limited portion of a year, or, even better, from
the same season of a scries of years.        Similar considerations show
an advantage in treating separately results from different hours of
the day.    The isolation of particular seasons and hours has the dis
advantage of reducing the number of observations compared togother.
This is, however, partly compensated for by the greater homogeneity
of the material.    It also enables ono in some cases to compare readily
the mean potential gradients which answer at different seasons or
hours to like values of some one meteorological element (see § 23).
                      Anticipation of  sume Criticisms.
   § 17. The   Kew observations were not limited to quiet, compara
tively cloudless days, in the same way as the observations of Exner
and Elster and Geitel seem to have been.         It may thus not unlikely
be supposed that the Kew results are affected by a variety of dis
turbing causes, which diminish their intrinsic value and their suit

                     Electricity at the Kew Observatory.             113
ability for comparison with other results free from these extraneous
effects.
   As to intrinsic value, there are, at least in England, seasons of the
year when a nearly cloudless day is exceptional. For instance, during
November and December, 1894, in ten days out of eighteen, on which
observations were taken a little before noon, no bright sunshine was
recorded up to the hour of observation.         At such a season, if one
confined one's attention to nearly cloudless days, hardly any data
would be obtained, and they might not unreasonably be regarded as
abnormal.
   As to the disturbing action of clouds, this is no doubt in some
cases very large ; but with clouds of this character the influence may
be considerable when they cover only a small fraction of the sky, and
probably, in some cases, even when they are below the horizon. Thus
on one occasion at Kew, when part of the sky was covered by a
thundercloud — so distant that only one or two faint lightning flashes
were detected — sudden changes of potential of thousands of volts
from negative to positive and back again were observed on the roof,
whilst the sun shone at intervals. The sudden alternations of potential
doubtless accompanied flashes of lightning, but no rain was falling
anywhere near, and possibly an observer a few miles away might
have regarded the day as an ideal quiet one. Again, there are other
forms of clouds whose influence seems not unlikely to be much less
than that of invisible vapour in motion nearer the ground.           The
mere interception of sunlight by cirrus clouds or detached masses of
cumulus, if we may judge from some few experiments at Kew, has
little  if any effect.
    It shonld also be borne in mind that wind velocity and amount of
cloud must both have varied appreciably from day to day, and even
throughout the individual days of Exner's experiments. Some one
— forget who — defined a "quiet " day as one in which the flame of
    I
Exner's electrometer was not blown out. All the days of the Kow
observations satisfied, of course, this definition, if one is allowed to
substitute the portable electrometer for Exner's, yet on one occasion
the anemometer was recording           a mean velocity of forty miles an
hour.
    If  aqueous vapour, as Exner supposes, is the sole, or even the
 dominant, agent in producing changes in potential, its activity can
 hardly be confined to days when there is little cloud, and tho wind is
 low.
    § 18.  As regards Elster and Geitel's theory, the data available for
 criticism are,   I admit, defective, inasmuch as no measurements are
 taken at Kew of the dissipative effect of sunlight on negative elec
 tricity.   I  presume, however, that bright sunshine — such as the
  Campbell-Stokes instrument records — always possesses this power,
                                                               k 2

114              Dr. C. Chree,        Observations on Atmospheric
though doubtless in very variable degrees at different seasons. Solar
radiation occurring after an observation is taken, clearly cannot
affect it. Thus the data got out as to the amount of bright sunshine
recorded prior to the observations must,             I  think, bear fairly directly
on Elster and Geitel's theory. If it be true, the potential gradient
must,     I  think, fall conspicuously as the number of hours of previous
sunshine increases.
     § 19. An objection of a different kind is the proximity of the Kew
Observatory to London.               This objection has already been urged
against Greenwich by investigators* whose theories do not harmonise
with the results obtained there. A weekly period exists, they say.
 in the Greenwich electrograph curves, and this, tliey assume, can
arise only from a weekly fluctuation in the amount of smoke, due to
onr insular habits of keeping Sunday.               If, for a moment, we suppose
the phenomenon and explanation both true — a pretty large assump
tion —there seems a wide step to the conclusion that results so
affected are useless.           I  do not myself see that they need lead to
¦erroneous conclusions, unless one is dealing with a cycle whose period
 is seven days, or a multiple thereof, which a lunation, for instance,
is not.
                                   I
     In the present instance would point out that the prevailing winds
 during each one of the series of observations were from directions
 included between N.N.W. and S., and that as Kew Observatory is
 some       miles to the west of London, while the manufacturing
  districts are mainly in the east, it is difficult to see how London smoke
 could affect the results.          The Observatory,      I shonld add, is situated
  in a large open park to the immediate west of the extensive Kew
  Gardens.
      Even if the prevailing winds had been easterly, I question whether
  smoke would have exerted an appreciable influence. The analysis
  above mentioned of the electrograph results for 1880, by the late
   Mr. Whipple, seems to show that if any relation existed then between
  ¦electric potential and wind direction, it varied with the season of the
  year ; this would hardly have occurred if smoke present in east
   winds had an appreciable effect.
                                     Tables of Results.
       § 20.  In discussing     the observations,    I  have decided to commence
   by incorporating the actual details in a series of tables.                    This
   will enable any one to judge for himself whether the conclusions
   finally arrived at are in accordance with the facte. The rirst eight
   tables give full particulars of the results. The arrangement is not

122 Dr. C. Ohree. Observations on Atmospheric
                  Electricity at the Kew Observatory.                   123
chronological, but in descending order of the voltages observed at
station A. In all the tables the humidity of saturation is taken as
 100.
   § 21. I  have divided the results in each of the previous eight
tables into two groups, according to the order of voltages at station A.
The two groups are equal in number of constituents, except as
regards Table XV, where, following a marked line separating the
voltages,  I have included six in the first group, and seven in the
second ; and Table X, where       I  have included four in the first group,
and three in the second.      In the last-mentioned case, the best line
of demarcation is doubtful, and, on account of this, and the small
number of constituents, little weight can be attached to the results.
   Tt may seem arbitrary to determine the groups by reference to
station A exclusively.     It is, however, the station least influenced
by buildings, and best     fitted   for accurate readings, while B is the
worst. Also it will be seen that if one had adopted either C, 1), or
E as the standard station, or had taken a mean from all the stations,
whilst the order of the constituents would in some tables have
been considerably affected, the groups themselves would have suf
fered little or no change.
   Table XVII gives the mean potentials at station A for each group
in the several series of observations, with the corresponding ratvin
values of the meteorological elements.

    § 22.    A discussion might        be based on    the previous nine tables alone.
Partly, however, to satisfy those who prefer a grouping system like
that of Exner,         I  add further tables, in which the observations are
arranged in groups, according to the magnitude of some one meteoro
logical element. In dealing with vapour density, bai-ometrio pressure
and wind volocity, separating lines have been drawn at fixed values
of the element considered. In the case of vapour density the limits
required to be altered with the season.                   In the case of barometric
pressure      and    wind   velocity     it  was   deemed      sufficient to draw only
one separating line, which answered, it will be seen, very nearly to
the mean value. In dealing with sunshine and temperature,* the
division has been into equal, or as nearly equal, groups as possible.
After the tables follows a discussion, which embraces Tables IX to
XVII      as well.

128            Dr. C. Chree.      Observations on Atmospheric
                                Vapour Density.
   § 23.    In Tables   XVII    and   XVIII   the forenoon observations      of
series  IV,   and both forenoon and afternoon observations of series II,
support Exner's theory to a certain extent, inasmuch as they decidedly,
on the whole, associate higher potential with lower vapour density.
The forenoon observations, however, of series I lead in both tables
to exactly the opposite result.        Also in Table XVII, in five cases
out of eight, the higher potential is associated with the higher vapour
density.      In some instances, e.g., the afternoon obsei-vations of
series  III   and IV, Tables XVII and         XVIII    lead to diametrically
opposite     conclusions.   The  following  are  instances   of corresponding
means of vapour density and potential, culled from the several tables.
In Table XVIII, 8'12 occurs with both 185 and 93 ; in Table XI,
6-64 with 229 ; in Table XII, 6"62 with 180 ; in Table XVII, 657
with 204, 6 35 with 342, and 6 31 with 237; in Table XVIII, 6 61
with 141, 6 45 with 168, and 6 39 with 170. Again, in Tables XV
and XVI we find 610 associated with 273, and 617 with 217. Lastly,
in Table XVIII we have the following combinations, 5'46 with 219,
5 40 with 333, 5"37 with 171, and 5 27 with 147.
   In the face of such results, it seems difficult to believe in any
intimate and uniform connexion whatsoever between potential gradient
and vapour density.
                              Relative Humidity.
   § 24.   No special table is devoted to this.       In Table XVII no less
than six sub-cases out       of  eight associate higher relative humidity
with higher potential.       It will be noticed, however, that in three out
of the six sub-cases referred to the differences between the mean
humidities answering to the two groups are smaller than in either of
the two sub-cases which associate higher relative humidity with
lower potential.      With the exception of the forenoon observations of
 series  I,  and  the afternoon observations of series     III, the differences
between the mean relative humidities in the two groups are very
small.     Thus, on the whole, the evidence in favour of any distinct
association of higher relative humidity and higher potential is insuffi
cient.
                                    Sunshine.
    § 25. There is in both the Tables XVII and XIX a balance of
evidence in favour of a connexion of low potential with long previous
sunshine. Out of eight sub-cases in each table, five favour this con
nexion in Table XVII, and six in Table XIX. The only sub-case in
which the tables agree in associating higher potential with longer
previous sunshine is the afternoon observations of series I, and, for

                   Electricity at the Kew Observatory.                  \2&
reasons already mentioned, this is not an important cxcoption. There
is thus a certain amount of general support to Elster and Geitel'a
theory.    An examination, however, of numerical details does not
seem favourable to any such intimate connexion between sunshine
and potential, as the formula suggested by them would imply.
   Taking, for instance, Table XIX, we notice in series       III   that, in
the afternoon, a mean potential of 106, answering to a mean of 3'6
hours' sunshine, falls only to 101 -when the hours of sunshine rise to
9'5. Again, in the foi-enoon observations of the same series, the mean
hours of previous sunshine increase fully six times, while the poten
tial falls only from 111 to 93.
   The afternoon observations of series     II  are a striking illustration
of the diverse conclusions to which the different methods adopted in
Tables XVII and XIX may lead.
                                Temperature.
   § 26. The forenoon observations of series IV, and both forenoon
and afternoon observations of series     II  associate high potential with
low temperature in both Tables XVII and XX ; and the balance of
evidence is unquestionably in this direction.         The only sub-case in
which the two tables agree in associating higher potential with higher
temperature is the afternoon observations of series I, which, as
already explained, is the least important of the eight instances.
   On the whole, the evidence in favour of a connexion of high poten
tial with low temperature is just about as strong as that in favour of
a connexion of high potential with little previous sunshine.
                            Barometric Pressure.
   § 27. Higher potential is associated with higher pressure in the
forenoon observations of each of the four series both in Tables XVII
and XXI.       In the afternoon observations, however, the higher
potential is associated with the lower pressure in three cases out of
four in Table XVII, and in two cases out of four in Table XXI. The
phenomenon,     in short, is an apparently clear association of high
potential and high barometric pressure in the forenoon, and an appa
rent absence of any connexion in the afternoon.
                               Wind Velocity.
   § 28. A somewhat striking similarity exists here to the phenomena
observed in the case of barometric pressure.
   In both the Tables XVII and XXII there is in the forenoon results
a conspicuous association of high potential with low wind velocity.
In Table XXII, it is true, series    I observations form aD exception,.
                                                                l  2

instance two equal groups with the following results —                    :
                      Group.        Mean velocity.        Mean potential.

  Higher potential     here associated with lower velocity, and, as the
                         is
groups are equal, the result     presumably
                                     is          fairer representation of
                                                          a
the facts than that afforded by Table XXII.
   Whilst the association of high potential with low wind velocity in
the forenoon seems thus conspicuous, there          in the afternoon no
                                                               is
certain evidence of any such connexion.         Thus, in Table XVII,
higher potential      associated
                       is        as often with higher as with lower
velocity and in Table
            ;            XXII,   whilst higher potential        associated    is
with lower velocity in three sub-cases out of four, the differences
between the mean potentials for the first and second groups are
small. In series      III
                      observations the difference     also very uncertain.
                                                                is
If, for instance, we divide these observations into two equal groups,
by taking 15 as separating value for the velocity, we obtain for each
group identically the same mean voltage, 103, though the mean
velocities for the two groups are respectively 18"7 and 8"1.
   In Table XXII the figures obtained by combining all four series of
observations, afford an excellent example of what may happen when
results, from all seasons of the year, are treated promiscuously.      The
individual series, as we have seen, show no clear association of high
potential with low velocity in the afternoon observations, but, when
the four series are combined, such an association seems conspicuous.
The phenomenon, in reality,      mainly due to the comparatively large
                                     is
number of instances in which the velocity happened to be high
during the season when the potential was at its minimum.
                General Summary     of    bearing   of   Results on Theory.
  §   29.   A
            comparatively small number of observations may be suffi
cient to disclose defects in an existing physical theory, and yet be
inadequate to warrant the promulgation of a positive opinion as to
the true theory. This        the most satisfactory point of view from
                               is
which to regard the facts presented here.      They are, in my opinion,
sufficient to show the incompleteness of any theory which assumes
simultaneous values of potential and any single meteorological element
to be so intimately connected that the value of the one can be
deduced,    as a rule, from that of the other without taking into
account other important influences.      On the other hand, they are
not sufficiently varied to justify the conclusion that the connexions

                     Electricity at the Kew Observatory.                   131
  traced  in §§ 25 to 28 between low potential and long previous sun-
 Bhine, high temperature, low barometric pressure, and high wind
  velocity constitute the normal state of matters at every station,
 irrespective of the hour or the season.             Provisionally I should
 prefer to regard these associations as possibly accidental, even at
  Kew, but believe they indicate the lines on which more exhaustive
  inquiries might profitably proceed.
     Another possibility indicated by these associations, viz., that the
 potential tends to be higher during anticyclonic than during cyclonic
 weather seems also worthy of attention.            An attempt was indeed
 made in the present instance to check this conclusion directly by
 reference to the weather reports of the Meteorological Office.            The
 published    data  relate,  howeves,  to  8  a.m. and  6 p.m. ; so that, on  a
 considerable number of occasions the nature of the isobars at the
 hours of the observations was uncertain.             Taking the remaining
 instances,   I calculated the mean potential for the cyclonic and anti-
 cyclonic conditions separately for each one of the four series, treating
 the forenoon and afternoon observations apart, except in the case of
 the first series.     In five cases out of the seven thus presented, the
.mean potential for the anticyclonic           group exceeded that for the
 cyclonic.     There is thus something to be said for the hypothesis. It
 should be mentioned, however, that individual occurrences of high
 potential in cyclonic weather and of low potential in anticyclonic
 weather were not infrequent.
    § 30. The results of the present inquiry are,       I believe, irreconcile-
 able with Exner's theory, in so far as it connects simultaneous
 individual values of potential and vapour density. The question
 remains open whether the annual variations of potential and vapour
 density may not be related through a formula of Exner's type—
                              dV/dn = A/(1+Bgr0),
where      A   and   B are constants for     a given  station, dVldn and q0
representing monthly means of potential gradient and vapour density
near the ground.
     Whilst the data available are far too limited for drawing a final
conclusion,     I think it worth while to add in Table      XXIII   a compari
 son   of  the  results  at  station A —  regarded   as  60  inches  above the
ground    —  with those deduced from Elster and Geitel's special form of
 the equation
                            dV/dn = 1410/(1 + ri52o).

   The density of aqueous vapour is a quantity having but a small
diurnal variation,* and it would appear, from a table published by
General Sabinef that the calculated mean potential for the day —
taken as the mean of the calculated values for the 24 hours — would
differ but little from that answering to only the two times, 10.30 a.m.
and 4.30 p.m. Thus the calculated values in Table                   XXIII   may be
regarded as close approximations to the true calculated means for the
seasons of the four observations.          On the other hand, according to the
table of diurnal variation of potential in the paper by Mr. Whipple
already referred to, the true means obtained from observations at
every honr of the day might be expected to be on an average some
10 per cent, higher than the observed values in Table XXIII.                    It
ought, further, to be remembered that, as explained in § 4, the
potential at station A must fall short of the true potential at a point
00 inches above the ground in the open, also the fraction of the
existing potential picked up by the portable electrometer may be
appreciably less than unity. Thus the fact that the calculated values
in Table    XXIII      are so decidedly larger on the average than the
observed is perhaps rather in favour of the formula than otherwise.
   If we may judge, however, from the few data in the table, there
seems some ground for the suspicion that the formula will prove to
give too narrow a range.
   Before concluding,       I  have much pleasure in acknowledging the
 ready and valuable help        I  have received from Mr. E. G. Constable,
Senior Assistant at the Kew Observatory. Mr. Constable took all
the electrical observations and the measurements of the meteoro
logical curves, and gave me in addition much useful information
derived from his long experience of the working of the electrograph
and portable electrometer.

      On the unknown      Unes in     the Spectra     of certain Minerals.    133
  "On the unknown Lines observed in the Spectra of certain
      Minerals." By J. NoRMAN LOCKTER, C.B., F.R.S. Received
      May    16 —Read June         4, 1896.
   In  the first note of the series " On the New Gases obtained from
                                                  I
Uraninite," by the distillation method, remarked* " I have already
obtained evidence that the method I have indicated may ultimately
provide us with other new gases, the lines of which are also associated
with those of the chromosphere."
   In a subsequent paper " On the Gases obtained from the Mineral
            I
Eliasite," gave a list of several lines unknown to me, and suggested
that they might indicate the existence of a new gas or gases in that
mineral, and     I  addedf
                             " Although the evidence in favour of a new
gas is already very strong, no final verdict can be given until the
spectra of all the known gases, including argon, have been photo
graphed at atmospheric pressure, and the lines tabulated.                This part
of the inquiry is well in hand."
    The inquiry above referred to has now been completed and in the
following manner: —
    Photographs were taken of the spectra at atmospheric pressure of
nitrogen, oxygen, chlorine, carbonic anhydride, coal gas, sulphuric
anhydride, phosphorctted hydrogen, and argon, these being the
gases which, from the experience thus far acquired, arc likely to be
associated with those given off by minerals.                 In addition to these,
the lines of mercury, potassium, and platinum, were also photo
graphed.      The lines of platinum are always present in the spectra
for the reason that the spark is passed between platinum poles, while
the lines of mercury or potassium frequently appear according as the
gases are collected over mercury or potash.
    The spectroscope employed has a collimator and camera with
object glasses of 3 in. aperture, and focal lengths of 5 ft. and 19 in.
respectively.      Two prisms of 60° were used, giving a length of
spectrum of about l-75 in. between K and D.
    In order to facilitate the reduction of the photographs, the solar
spectrum was photographed under exactly similar instrumental con
ditions.    Micrometric measures were made of H and K, and other
 well-known lines throughout the spectrum, and by means of these
and Rowland's wave-lengths, a curve was carefully constructed.
    It may be incidentally mentioned that in the photographs of the
 spectra of gases at atmospheric pressure, H and K are generally
 present as pole lines, being probably due to an impurity of calcium
 in the platinum poles.

134          Mr.  J. Norman Lockyer.        On the unknown
   In  each case in which  K   was present, the micrometer scale was set
to the reading for this line, and the photograph to be reduced then
adjusted until the K line was under the cross-wires of the micro
meter. Each line in the spectrum was then in turn brought under
the cross- wires, and the micrometer readings noted. The corre
sponding wave-lengths were then read off from the enrve, and in
this way, lists of the wave-lengths of the lines in the various spectra
were compiled.      These lists were then all thrown together into one
table, giving the wave-lengths and intensities of all the lines recorded,
and the spectra in which they appear.
   For the wave-lengths thus obtained no greater accuracy than one
indicated by four figures is claimed. It was my intention in tho first
instance to give five figures from the more elaborate tables of some
of the elements given by other observers, but this had to be
abandoned in consequence of the considerable variations fonnd in the
tables between the results as given by different observers.
   First, as regards the gas from eliasite. The following list gives
the lines obtained in the complete inquiry after the lines due to the
old gases have been eliminated.      It should be stated, however, that
several of the lines have wave-lengths very near those of the old
gases ; these have been retained when the more intense lines of the
old gases are absent from the spectra. These cases are pointed out
in the table.
   In the case of some of the lines in the visible part of tho spectrum,
more accurate wave-lengths have been recorded by means of a four
prism Steinheil spectroscope. These lines are indicated by («).
   Attempts have been made to concentrate the eliasite gas by the
process of sparking with oxygen over potash, but the quantity of gas
remaining is so small, and so largely admixed with helium and argon,
that a new research, using very much more material, is essential.
   It should be remarked that the list of lines which have been
observed and photographed in the spectrum of the gases from
eliasite represents the results of several experiments which have
been made with different samples of the mineral.       Some of the lines
have only been seen once, while others have been noted several
times. This suggests that the origins of the lines are very diverse,
and it seems probable that some constituents of the mixture of gases
obtained are absorbed by the potash in the process of sparking.
   Next, with regard to the other minerals already examined. As it
is impossible for me to go on with this research for the next few
months, it seems desirable, in the interest of other workers, to give
at the same time a complete list of the unknown lines, so far as the
observations have at present gone, indicating their mineral origins,
and whether or not lines nearly coincident in position have been
observed in any celestial body.

   This information is given in the preceding table (pp. 136 — 139),
in which for the sake of completeness the lines obtained Irom eliasite
are also shown.
   In most of the experimental work connected with this research, I
have been assisted by Mr. Shackleton, while Mr. Fowler is generally
responsible for the determination of wave-longths            in the less
refrangible part of the spectrum, and Mr. Baxandall for the reduc
tion of the photographs.
"The Relation       between the Refraction of the Elements and
      their Chemical Equivalents." By J. H. Gladstone, D.Sc,
      F.R.S. Received June 3, 1896.
   This paper is intended       to give a  preliminary account of some
recent investigations into the specific refraction of the elements.
It may be conveniently divided into two distinct parts. The first
part is a revision and extension of the list of specific and atomic
refractions, which was first published in the ' Phil. Trans.' for 1870,
and was reprinted with modifications in a lecture given at the Royal
Institution in 1877. The second part is an amplification of some
deductions made in that lecture.
     Part I. — The  Specific and Atomic Refractions of the Elements.
   The following table contains the atomic weights, the specific refrac
tions, and the atomic refractions of the elements as revised and
extended. For the atomic weights          I  have adopted the numbers
recently published by the American Chemical Society's Committee on
Atomic Weights ('J. Amer. Chem. Soc.,' vol. 17), revised up to
January, 1894. In regard to the specific refraction, advantage has
been taken of the work done in some departments of the inquiry
by Landolt,     Haagen, Briihl, Topsoe and Christiansen, Mascart,
Becquerel,   Kanonnikoff,    Soret, Nasini, Ghira, Perrot, Tutton, Lord
Rayleigh, Edwards, and others, as well as many additional observa
tions made by myself or by Mr. Hibbert.
   The atomic refraction is the product of the numbers in the two
earlier  columns, that is,    it equals P      -, where P  is the atomic
                                           ^
weight, and /i—ljd is the specific refraction, that is, the refractivity
divided by the density.      Of course, these are not generally deter
mined by observations of the element itself, but are deduced from
those of its salts or other compounds.

142        Dr. J. H. Gladstone.       The Relation between the
   The most notable change from previons tables is the increase in
the value of hydrogen and the decrease in that of carbon, but the
necessity of this has been gradually recognised by the principal
workers on the refraction of organic bodies.         This in no way affects
the well-determined value CHj = 7'6.
   It should be borne in mind that the specific refraction cannot
claim a constancy equal to that of the atomic weight.         The latter is
generally  believed   to be identical   under  all  circumstances, though
the element may be capable of combining with another in two or more
multiple proportions.     On the other hand, several of the elements,
as oxygen and iron, exhibit two or more specific refractions,
which are not in multiple proportion, but depend upon the manner
of combination.     The best recognised of these are given in the third
column, and the existence of others is indicated by an " &c." Beside
these well-marked differences, there are many smaller variations,
scarcely, if at all, beyond the limits of experimental error, which
depend upon differences of physical condition or chemical structure.
The numbers given in column 3 are therefore subject to an uncer
tainty, which may in some instances amount to 5 per cent.           Where
there is a greater divergence among the values observed, or where
the deductions have been made from only one specimen, it is indi
cated by a query.
     Part II. — The Belation  between  the Specific Refraction and the
                   Combining Proportion of    the  Metals.
                                                                          "
   In the paper " On the refraction       equivalents of the elements
previously referred to, it was shown that if the metallic elements be
arranged in the order of their specific refractions, they are roughly
in the inverse order of their combining proportions.
                                               I
   In the lecture at the Royal Institution, showed that this inverse
order followed an approximate law, namely, that the " specific
refractive energy of a metal is inversely as the square root of its
combining proportion." This generalisation was proved for uni
valent metals, the figures showing (with the exception of sodium) a
practically constant value for the product of the specific refraction
and the square root of the combining proportion.
   By the aid of the table in the first part of this communication, the
generalisation can now be tested throughout the whole range of the
metallic elements.

    This confirms the conclusions drawn in 1877, the mean product for
the univalent metals, omitting sodium, being 1'30.            This is in spite
of the fact that lithium and cesium differ from one another in either
factor in the ratio of about 9 to 2. The two metals below the line,
though acting as monads in the compounds from which these values
are deduced, are considered to be dyad and triad respectively.             With
them, the product is a little higher ; this will be referred to after
wards.

bivalent agree closely, although giving values distinctly below that
of the former list.    The mean of the values is 0-99. The remaining
five metals, which have well-marked higher valencies, have, as in the
case of the corresponding univalent elements, a somewhnt. higher

compounds       in which the metal plays the part of an electro-positive

" Selective Absorption of Rontgen Rays." By J. A. M'CLELLAND,
     M.A., Fellow of the Royal University of Ireland.    Com
     municated by Professor J. J. THOMSON, F.R.S.     Received
      June 11,— Read June       18, 1896.
                      (From the Cavendish Laboratory.)
  The experiments described in this paper were made to determine
whether or not the Rontgen rays given off by a vacuum bulb were of
a homogeneous nature, by examining the manner in which they are
absorbed by different substances.       The induction coil and vacuum
bulb for producing the rays were enclosed in a wooden box thickly
lined with metal, with a small hole in the top, directly beneath which
and close np to it the vacuum bulb was placed. Over the hole a
well-insulated metal disk was placed and connected to one pair of
quadrants of an electrometer.      The two pairs of quadrants are first
connected together and with one terminal of a battery of small
storage cells, the other terminal being connected to earth.
   The quadrants of the electrometer are then separated from each
other and from the storage cells, and the induction coil turned on.
The Rontgen rays passiug through the hole in the box and falling on
the charged disk discharges     it,
                                  and the intensity of the radiation      is
measured by the rate at which the spot of light from the electro
meter needle moves across the scale.      The metal lining of the box     is
connected   to earth, and  the small hole covered with a single sheet of
tinfoil to screen the electrometer from direct electrical disturbances.
   The substance whose absorptive power        to be examined
                                               ig                is placed
over the hole so  that the rays traverse  itbefore falling on the charged
disk.
   Evidences of selective absorption were sought for in the following
manner. The rate of leakage was accurately determined when the
rays were passing through one of the substances used, say a plate of
glass.   Sheets of tinfoil were then substituted for the glass and the

                  Selective Absorption   of Rontgen Rays.                     147
 number — n, say — taken such that the leakage from the charged disk
 was approximately the same as when the glass was used.                The rate
 of leak was then measured accurately.        The  ratio  of the  rate of leak
 with the glass to that with the n sheets of tinfoil gives a measure of
 their relative transparency to Rontgen rays.
    A number of tinfoil sheets is now placed over the hole ; the glass
 plate is placed on the top, and the rate of leak measured. The glass
 is removed and the same n sheets of tinfoil as were formerly used
 put in its place, and the leakage measured.       The ratio of the rate of
 leak in the latter two cases is a measure of the relative transparency
 of the glass and the n tinfoil sheets to the Rontgen rays after they
 have been already screened by passing through several layers of
tinfoil.
    The two ratios thus obtained should be equal if the Rontgen rays
are all  of one kind, but if the glass is relatively less transparent in
the second case it can only be explained by assuming that the
 Rontgen rays are not homogeneous, and that some of them are more
readily absorbed by the glass and others by the tinfoil.
   Various substances were tested against tinfoil in the manner
described. With some there was no selective absorption, with others
it was very marked. Glass gave none, with mica and paraffin the
effect was small, with fuchsine, eosine, fluorescine, aesculin, and
barium sulphide the effect was very marked.          With several fluores
cent screens the. effect was also marked.         Pure water also gave a
distinct though smaller effect.
   The table below sets forth the results obtained with these sub
stances.
   Column B gives the quotient of the rate of leak through the sub
stance in column A to that through a number of tinfoil layers which
gave approximately the same leak.       Column C gives the quotient of
the rate of leak through -the substance to that through the same
tinfoil layers after the rays have already passed through four layers
of tinfoil.

   Of the substances used, the above showed the effect best, but with
wood, paraffin,        and water, although small, it could alwayB be
detected.     We conclnde from the above results that the Rontgen
rays are of different kinds, and that the substances given in the
table differ very much from tinfoil in their selective absorption.
After the rays have been screened by passing through some tinfoil
layers additional layers are much less absorbent, while the absorption
produced by other substances is not so much diminished.
   Of the snbstances tried, those which are fluorescent gave the most
marked difference as compared with tinfoil.
   The above results were all obtained with one vacuum tube, which
was working extremely well. It produced a very rapid teak from the
charged disk, and the pressure of its residual air was very small.
In fact, after working for a time it became too strong for the coil
that was being used to work it. Another vacuum tube, in which the
pressure of the residual air was greater and which was not so
efficient in producing leakages, was then used, and several of the sub
stances used before were again tested, but in no case was any evidence
of selective absorption obtained. As far as the test was efficient, the
radiation from this bulb was homogeneous.
   A third tube was then used, more efficient than the last in produc
ing leakage, but not so good as the first used. With this tube experi-
menta made in the same way as before gave evidence of selective
absorption, bnt not so marked as with the first tube.
   It seems therefore that as a tube becomes more efficient the
character of the rays given off becomes less homogeneous.

power of    the atomic volume          —   ,  is a constant for all metals,
   The divergences shown by several metals from this mean value
arise  from the fact that the presence of small amounts of impurity
makes a    great difference in their elasticity.
   Sutherland* finds a close relation between the atomic volume and
the rigidity of metals, and considers that this rigidity is " in its
essence    a kinetic phenomenon, almost as simple in character as the
elasticity of perfect gases."
   Professor Fessenden,f moreover, has urged that the cohesion of
metals is proportional         to some power of the atomic volume, and he
considers    that the rigidity varies as the fifth power of the distance
of the centre of the atoms, or as (atomic volume)'.                          It will be
evident, therefore, that the atomic volume of a metal is very impor
tant.
   One    of the   authors purified gold with great care, and alloyed
seventeen separate portions of it with foreign elements in quantities
which were in each case close to 0'2 per cent., and from each sample
of this alloyed gold, bars were cast, 88 mm. long by 7'5 mm. wide by
5'2 mm. thick.      The tensile strength, elongation, and reduction of
sectional   area (striction) were determined, and the results were
                       '
published in the          Phil. Trans.' in 1888. These results indicated
in a general way, that the tenacity and ductility of gold is increased
bj the presence of 0'2 per cent, of an added element of smaller
atomic volume than that of gold itself, while, on the other hand,
these properties are diminished when the atomic volume of the added
element is greater than that of gold.
   There are, as might be expected, exceptions and irregularities, but
it is strange that they are not more numerous and more marked.
Even the purest metals are not, from a mechanical point of view,
homogeneous.        Under the influence of internal forces which tend to
make them crystalline, and of external stresses which ara set np by
contraction during cooling, the invisible molecules become arranged
in visible and more or less highly organised groups.                      These groups
 are separated from each other either by planes of cleavage or by joints
 which are often surfaces of least cohesion, and, therefore, of weakness.
 This is especially the caso when these joints have been accentuated by
 the evolution of dissolved gas at the moment of the solidification of
 the metal.    In alloys, chemical homogeneity may, in turn, disappear,

   and free metals, chemical compounds, or various alloys may fall out
   of solution from the liquid mass, and, finally, the eutcctic alloy solidi
   fies, but its presence, as a residual fluid facilitates the arrangement of
   the parts which have previously solidified.
      One of the authors in collaboration with M. Worth* was prob
   ably the first to direct attention to the influence which these fusible
   residues, to which the name of " cements " was given, exert on the
   working of steel and on the mechanical properties of the finished
  products of steel manufacture.           Since then M. Andre le Cbatelierf
  has repeatedly insisted on this point, correctly enough as a prin
  ciple, though perhaps with a tendency to generalise too much from
  ideas which are, in themselves, accurate.
      It is possible to distinguish in metals and alloys both the visible
  structure and the molecular structure, and between them, such
  methods of investigation as it is possible to adopt, enable a well
  defined line of demarcation to be traced. Attention must, therefore,
  be directed to ascertaining to what extent the mechanical properties
  of a given sample of metal are due to each of these kinds of struc
  ture, and how far to their mutual relations.                 This being the case,
 the     authors considered that it would be interesting to submit
 the gold, containing 0'2 per cent, of various elements, to micro-
 graphical examination, and, fortunately,                the identical specimens
 which were submitted to the Royal Society, eight years ago, had been
 preserved intact, and were available for examination.
     Descriptions are then given in detail of the methods adopted in
 preparing, polishing and etching the micro-sections of gold alloyed
 with various impurities, photographs of which sections illustrate the-
 paper. It is difficult to give a brief abstract of the authors' conclusions,
 but they may bo stated as follows.             They consider it to be certain
 that there is no relation between either the structure, the appearance
 of the fractures, the melting points of the alloyed elements and the
 mechanical properties of the masses of alloyed gold. They observe
 that every iron metallurgist who examined the photograph of the
 micro-sectiou of gold with potassium would form a highly favourable
opinion as to the mechanical properties of the mass it represents,
 while it is really, from a mechanical point of view, the worst of the
series.     On the other hand he would think that the micro-section of
the gold alloyed with zirconium, indicated a structure of deplorable
weakness, while as a matter of fact it might equally well represent
alloys which vary in tenacity from less than half a ton per square
inch to 1\ tons, and are either incapable of being extended, or will
elongate 30 per cent.

          On the Structure   of Metals, its Origin and   Changes.    151
tions in detail, and they conclude the first part of the paper by stating
that they do not contest in any way, as their previous publications
abundantly prove, the importance of the part which may be played in
the mechanical properties of the alloys by the residues which remain
liquid after the main mass of the alloy has solidified, the alloys being
tested either at the ordinary temperature or when heated. But, in
order that it may be possible for such cements to intervene and affect
the mechanical properties of alloys, the cements must at least have a
real existence. Nothing indicates that they do exist in ten out of
twelve of the alloys examined. The authors do not express them
selves too positively on  this point, for some new method of etching
may reveal new facts. The impurities which are sought for may
happen to concentrate themselves beyond the particular region which
has been sectioned.      These are, however, gratuitous suppositions.
Polishing only indicates the presence of cement in two cases. The
little secondary crystals which are described in the paper might
readily be mistaken for cements, of definite or indefinite composition,
if they were found only in certain specimens, and then in snch pro
portions as could be accepted.     But they occur everywhere, and in all
cases with identical appearances, forms, and dimensions; and, moreover,
are seen to be collected into crystallites which pervade the whole mass.
These are, therefore, usually and indubitably due to the crystallization
of gold itself, although the alloying substances sometimes (indium and
probably potassium) join up the crystals in question.       For the same
reason the dark line of the joints, traced as furrows by the etching,
are very rarely the empty tracks of cement which has been dissolved
away by aqua regia ; their formation, which it is easy to follow in all
its phases, directly connects them with secondary crystallization.
The authors are led to the belief that in the case of ten of their
alloys of the gold with about 0'2 per cent, of various impurities,
solidification of the whole mass has been directly accomplished at a
single time, and that the foreign bodies have remained as solidified
solutions, as they were fluid solutions when the alloys were liquid,
the impurities being dissociated into their ions in both solid and
liquid. Under these conditions it is difficult to invoke, as explaining
the mechanical properties of the alloy, the intervention of hypotheti
                 "
cal " cements with relatively low fusing points.
    In the second part of the paper attention is directed to the fact
that gold alloyed with bismuth, thallium, antimony, and aluminium
has its structure entirely changed by annealing it in sulphuric acid
at about 250°. The large grains of the metal become divided into a
multitude of little polyhedral grains.         Nothing remains of the
original structure, and the effect closely resembles that which is
obtained by annealing steel castings at a bright red heat (800°).       It

formation of the structure of a metal, at a temperature so far below
its melting point, and, in the case of the gold-antimony and gold-
alnminium series, far below the melting point of the eutectic alloys,
in the presence of only two-tenths per cent, of a foreign body, is
probably not an isolated fact, and appears to open a new field for
research.

                                  (Abstract.)
   In  the Bakerian Lecture     for 1894 the authors gave an account of
their work on the viscosity of over seventy liquids, and they discussed
the interdependence of viscosity and chemical composition.       In order
to render the investigation more complete, they have now made
measurements of the viscosity of (1) a number of esters or ethereal
salts, and (2) of ethers, simple and compound — groups of liquids, which
with the exception of ethyl ether, have not hitherto been studied by
them. The physicochemical relationships previously established mado
such determinations of special interest, for it was shown that one of the
most striking of the various connexions traced between chemical con
stitution and viscosity was the influence exerted by oxygen according
to the different modes in which it was assumed to be associated with
other atoms in the molecule. The influence which could be ascribed
to hydroxyl-oxygen       differs to a most marked extent from that of
carbonyl-oxygen,      and it appeared that ether-oxygen, or oxygen
linked to two carbon atoms, had also a value which differed consider
ably from oxygen in other conditions.
   In the present paper the authors give the experimental values for
the viscosity of the ten lowest fatty esters, carefully purified samples
of which had been placed at their disposal by Professor Sydney
Young. With the help of Mr. Barnett, B.Sc, Assoc. R.C.S. , they
have also investigated the viscosity of five fatty ethers.        By the
kindness of the Photometric Standards Committee they have also
been enabled to make observations upon various samples of carefully
prepared isopentane, and they have supplemented their former
observations by a new series of experiments upon ethylbenzene, for a
sample of which they are indebted to Dr. G. L. Moody, of the City
and   Guilds Central Institute.
   The details of the observations arc given in precisely the same
manner as in the first paper, and formula; of the Slotte type showing

Relations between Viscosity and Chemical Nature of Liquids.         153
the relation          viscosity in absolute measure and temperature
                     between
are calculated for each liquid.   The general results of the observa
tions are then discussed in the same manner as in the previous
memoir. With regard to the two hydrocarbons, it is found that the
isopentane from fusel oil gives slightly different values from that
originally observed, which was obtained from American petroleum,
and which, although of an approximately constant boiling point, was
undoubtedly a mixture.     The new sample of ethylbenzene, however,
gave results which were in very good agreement with those pre
viously obtained.
  The conclusions relating to the graphical representation of the
results may be thus summarised.    Both ethers and esters give no
evidence of molecular aggregation, and conform to the rnles that : —
     (1)    In
             homologous series, the viscosity is greater the greater
          the molecular weight.
     (2) An iso-compound has a smaller viscosity than a normal
          isomer.
     (3) The more symmetrical the molecule of an isomeric compound
          the lower is the viscosity.
  As regards the esters themselves, it is noteworthy, where the com
parison is possible, that : —
     (4) Of isomeric esters, the formate has the larger viscosity.
   As regards the algebraical representation of the results, it is shown
that in the expression ij = 0/(1 +     ft1  yt1), derived from Slotte's
                                             +

           weight increases.
      (2) Of isomeric compounds, the iso-compound has the smallest
  '
           coefficient.
      (3) Ethyl ether, the symmetrical isomer, has smaller coefficients
           than methyl propyl ether.
      (4) As  regards normal isomeric esters, the formate has the
           largest, and the propionate the smallest coefficients, and
           the values of the acetate are larger than of the butyrate.
   The authors then deal with the relationships existing between the
various viscosity magnitudes — the viscosity coefficient, the molecular
viscosity, and the molecular viscosity work — (1) at the boiling point,
and (2) at temperatures of equal slope, the slope adopted being that
employed in their previous paper, namely, 0-04323, and values for the
oxygen in three different conditions are given for each system of com
parison in the same manner as in their first communication.

       (2) The viscosity    of the formate is abnormally large when com

 " On the Determination of Freezing Points."             By  J. A. Habker,

                                   (Abstract.)
     Of recent years great improvements        have been made in the con
 struction of accurate thermometers. For their graduation and study,
 the position of the thread for at least two fixed temperatures must
be known with certainty, and one of these is generally the freezing
point. According to many observers, the methods at present in use
for the determination of this point are unsatisfactory and cannot be
relied on, even when considerable precautions are taken, to more
than about 0001° to 0-002°.         The object of the present communica
tion is to describe a method by which more consistent results can be
obtained, and which is applicable to all kinds of thermometers.
     The method adopted is to cool distilled water in a suitable vessel,
protected from radiation, to a temperature below 0°, to insert the
thermometer, and then bring about the freezing of the water by
dropping in a crystal of ice.          The thermometer then rises, and
finally   attains  a steady temperature, differing only very slightly from
the true zero.
     Within the space allotted to this abstract, it is not possible to
describe in detail all the precautions to be adopted and the apparatus
employed, and for these reference must be made to the original
paper.     The following brief outline may, however, be given.
    The apparatus consists of two portions, the thermostat and the
cooler.     The former is a rectangular copper vessel, filled with some
liquid, which can be cooled below 0° without solidifying.
     Generally either refined petroleum or a strong solution of common
salt is employed.       This vessel communicates by means of two wide
tubes with a system of coils in the cooler, through which the liquid
can be pumped by a rotary stirrer.           These coils are surrounded by
a freezing mixture at about — 8°, and by this means the circulating
liquid can be cooled and maintained for some time at about — 2°.
The distilled water to be frozen is contained in a tube of about
300 c.c. capacity made of clear glass.         This is first placed directly

                On the Determination   of freezing PoptTS^^         155
into the circulating liquid, and cooled quickly ,fcp — 0'5° or1— 0"7".
It is then transferred to a copper cVlinder lined- With1 pC^hed; metal,
placed in the centre of the thennoHfat, an annular space of about
1 cm. being left between them.     The thermometer whose zero is to be
taken is then quickly fixed in position in a spring clamp, the bulb
and a considerable length of the stem above the zero being immersed
in the water. A crystal of ice is dropped in, and the temperature
quickly rises to the freezing point.
    For the details of the arrangement for the illumination of the
divisions, and taking the readings through the mass of the liquid
containing the ice crystals in suspension, reference must be made to
the paper.
    The amount of ice formed in the liquid varies of course with the
undercooling.     Experiments made with good mercnrial thermometers
showed that if ice be present in sufficient quantity, the final tem
perature attained by the mixture of ice and water is not influenced
 perceptibly by variation of the temperature of the circolating liquid
 within fairly wide limits.      As, however, it is extremely donbtful
whether the indications     of any mercurial thermometer can be relied
on   beyond 0"001°,  it seemed desirable to control this result by some
other means.
    A  platinum thermometer and bridge were therefore designed,
 capable of indicating with certainty a change of 0'0001°, and a
description of the whole arrangement employed to attain this degree
of accuracy forms the second half of the paper. The resistances in
 the bridge    were of manganin, whose temperature coefficient is only
 about       that of the usual resistance alloys, and the plugs usually
employed for short circuiting the coils were replaced by copper bars
and mercury contacts of specially low resistance.     The thermometers
employed were of about 10 ohms resistance, and were provided with
the compensating leads, devised by Mr. Callendar.        The maximum
current which can be used in accurate measurements with these
thermometers is about 0-02 ampere, and therefore the galvanometer
 employed required to be extremely sensitive.          The instrument
 selected was a low resistance astatic one with vertical needle system
 of the type described by Weiss, and gives at the greatest sensibility
at which the zero is steady one scale division for 1 X 10-10 ampere
at 2500 scale divisions distance.
    With this arrangement the influence of various conditions on the
final temperature attained by the mixture of ice and water was
studied.     The results were found to be in close agreement with the
theoretical deductions of Nernst, and it was found that with the
right conditions, it was quite easy to keep the temperature in the
 freezing vessel constant, to within one or two ten-thousandths of a
 degree for an hour at a time.

    The conclusion    drawn from the previous experiments made with
mercurial thermometers as to the small influence of changes in the
external temperature, and in the temperature of the circulating
liquid on that of the freezing vessel, was also confirmed, and it was
found that in the final form of apparatus adopted, a change of two or
three degrees in the temperature of the circulating liquid onlj
caused the temperature of the mixtnre in the tube to alter by three
or four ten-thousandths.

    Les combinaisons définies et cristallisées du carbone avec les
métalloïdes et les métaux étaient très peu connues jusqu'ici.          On
savait seulement que certains métaux tels que le fer, pouvaient dis
soudre du carbone, et donner des fontes.
   Les connaissances des chimistes sur ce point étaient peu étendues
parce que ces combinaisons ne se produisent qu'à une température
très élevée.     L'application que j'ai faite de l'arc électrique comme
moyen de chauffage d'un appareil de laboratoire m'a permis d'aborder
cette question.     Je résumerai mes recherches sur ce point dans cette
note.
   À    la haute température du four électrique un certain nombre de
métaux, tels que l'or, le bismuth, le plomb, et l'étain ne dissolvent
pas de carbone.
   Le cuivre liquide n'en prend qu'une très petite quantité, suffisante
déjà pour changer ses propriétés et modifier profondement sa malléa
bilité.
   L'argent à sa température d'ébullition dissout une petite quantité
de carbone qu'il abandonne ensuite par refroidissement sous forme
de graphite. Cette fonte d'argent, obtenue à très haute température,
présente une propriété curieuse, celle d'augmenter de volume en
passant de l'état liquide à l'état solide. Ce phénomène est analogue
à celui que nous rencontrons dans le fer.
   L'argent et le fer purs diminuent de volume en passant de l'état
liquide à l'état solide. Au contraire, la fonte de fer et la fonte
d'argent dans les mêmes circonstances augmenteront de volume.
   L'aluminium possède des propriétés identiques.
   Les métaux du platine à leur température d'ébullition dissolvent
le carbone avec facilité et l'abandonnent sous forme de graphite
avant leur solidification.    Ce graphite est foisonnant.
   Un grand nombre      de métaux vont, au contraire, à la température du
four électrique produire des composés définis et cristallisés.

                     Etude des Carbures Métalliques.                  157
   En 1836 Ed. Davy       a démontré que le potassium pouvait s'unir au
carbone et produire    un corps decomposable par l'eau avec dégagement
d'un nouveau carbure d'hydrogène.          C'est ainsi que ce savant a
découvert l'acétylène, dont la synthèse devait être réalisée pins tard
par M. Bertbelot.
   En chauffant nn mélange de lithine ou de carbonate de lithine et de
charbon dans mon four électrique, j'ai pu obtenir avec facilité le
carbure de lithium en cristaux transparents dégageant par kilogramme
487   litres de gaz acétylène pur.
                       C,Li,+H,0 = 2LiOH       + C,H2.
   De même en chauffant dans mon four électrique un mélange d'oxyde
et de charbon, j'ai pu le premier obtenir par une méthode générale, à
l'état pur et cristallisé et par notables quantités, les carbures de
calcium, de baryum et de strontium.         Le carbure de calcium avait
été préparé auparavant à l'état de poudre noire amorphe et impure.
Sans faire l'historique de la question je rappelerai les recherches de
Wohler, de M. Maqnenne et celles de M. Travers sur ce sujet.
   Tons ces carbures se détruisent au contact de l'eau froide avec
dégagement d'acétylène.        La réaction est complète, le gaz obtenu est
absolument pur.       Les trois carbures alcalino-terreux répondent à la
formule    CaR, et le carbure de lithium à la formule C»Li2. La pré
paration industrielle de l'acétylène est fondée sur cette réaction.
   Un antre type de carbure cristallisé en lamelles hexagonales, trans
parentes, d'un centimètre de diamètre, nous est fourni par l'aluminium.
Ce métal fortement chauffé au four électrique en présence de charbon
se remplit de lamelles jaunes de carbure, que l'on peut isoler par un
traitement assez délicat, au moyen d'une solution d'acide chlorhy-
driqne étendu, refroidie à la température de la glace fondante.
   Ce carbure métallique est décomposé par l'eau, à la température
ordinaire, en fournissant de l'alumine et du gaz méthane pur. Il
répond à la formule     CSA14,
                  CA.l.-r^HjO = 8CH,+2[A1,(0H),].
   Mon préparateur, M. Lebeau a obtenu dans les mêmes conditions
le carbure de glucininm, qui lui aussi, fournit à froid avec l'eau un
dégagement de méthane pur.
   Les métaux de la cérite vont nous donner des carbures cristallisés
dont la formule sera semblable à celle des carbnres alcalino-terreux
C,R.
   Nous avons étudié spécialement, la décomposition par l'eau des
carbures de cérinm C2Ce, de lanthane CaLa, d'yttrium CaY, et de
thorium CaTh.
    Tous ces corps décomposent l'eau et fournissent un mélange gazeux,
                                                                N 2

riche en acétylène et contenant dn méthane.           Avec le carbure de
thorium, l'acétylène diminue et le méthane augmente.
    Toutes les expériences entreprises sur le fer ne nous ont jamais
donné de composés définis et cristallisés.     À la pression ordinaire et à
haute température le fer n'a jamais fourni une combinaison définie.
    On sait depnis longtemps, grâce aux recherches de MM. Troost et
Hantefeuille, que le manganèse produit nn carbnre CMns. Ce carbure
peut être préparé avec le plus grande facilité au four électrique, et au
contact de l'eau froide, il se décompose, en donnant un mélange à
volumes égaux de méthane et d'hydrogène,
                   CMni + 6H,0 = 3Mn(OH),+ CH, + Ha.
    Le carbure d'uranium,     CsUr,, que j'ai obtenu par les mêmes pro
cédés, m'a présenté une réaction plus complexe ; le carbure très bien
cristallisé et transparent lorsqu'il est en lamelles très minces, se
détruit au contact de l'eau et fournit un mélange gazeux qui contient
une grande quantité de méthane, de l'hydrogène et de l'ethylène.
    Mais le fait le plus intéressant présenté par ce carbure est le suivant.
L'action de l'eau froide ne produit pas seulement des carbures gazeux.
11 se forme en abondance des carbures liquides et solides.        Les deux-
tiers du carbone de ce composé se retrouvent sous cette forme.
    Les carbures de cérium et de lanthane par leur décomposition par
l'eau nous ont fourni de même, bien qu'en quantité moindre, des
carbures liquides et solides.
    L'ensemble de ces carbures decomposable par l'eau à la tempéra
ture ordinaire, avec production d'hydrogènes carbonés, constitue une
première classe de composés de la famille des carbures métalliques.
    La deuxième classe sera fournie par des carbures ne décomposant
pas l'eau à la température ordinaire tels qne les carbures de molybdène,
CMoj ; de tungstène, CW, ; de chrome, CCr4 et C,Crs.
    Ces derniers composés sont cristallisés non transparents, à reflets
métalliques.      Ils possèdent une grande dureté et ne fondent qu'à
une température très élevée. Nous avons pu les préparer tous au four
électrique et nous avons donné le détail de ces expériences ainsi que
 tontes les analyses aux ' Comptes rendus de l'Académie des Sciences
 de  Paris.'
    Les métalloïdes vont nous fournir aussi avec le carbone, à la tem
 pérature du four électrique, des composés cristallisés et définis. Noua
 citerons par exemple le carbure de silicium, CSi, découvert par
 M. Acheson, et préparé aujourd'hui dans l'industrie sous le nom de
 carborundum     ;  le carbure de titane, CTi ; dont la dureté est assez
 grande pour permettre de tailler le diamant tendre ; le carbure de
 zirconium, CZr; le carbure de vanadium, CVa. Nous avons indiqué
 la préparation et les propriétés de ces nouveaux carbures.
     Un fait général se dégage des nombreuses recherches que j'ai

                      Etude des Carbures Métalliques.                    159
 entreprises au four électrique.       Les composés qui se produisent à
 haute température sont toujours de formule très simple et le plus
 son vent il n'existe qu'nne seule combinaison.
    Mais la réaction qui nous a paru la plus curieuse dans ces recherches
 est la production facile de carbures d'hydrogène gazeux, liquides ou
 solides, par l'action de l'eau froide sur certains de ces carbures
 métalliques.     Il nons a semblé que ces études pouvaient avoir
 quelque intérêt pour les géologues.
    Les dégagements de méthane plus ou moins pur qui se rencontrent
dans certains terrains, et qui durent depuis des siècles pourraient
avoir pour origine l'action de l'eau sur le carbure d'aluminium.
    En partant de quatre kilogrammes de carbure d'uranium, nous
avons obtenu dans une seule expérience plus de 100 gr. de carbures
 liquides.
    Le mélange ainsi obtenu est formé en grande partie de carbures
éthyléniques non saturés, et en petite quantité de carbures acéty-
léniques.     Ces carbures prennent naissance en présence d'une forte
proportion de méthane et d'hydrogène à la pression et à la tempéra
ture ordinaire ; ce qui nous amène à penser que lorsque la décom
position se fera à température élevée, il se produira des carbures
saturés analogues aux pétroles.
    M. Berthelot a établi en effet que la fixation directe de l'hydrogène
sur un carbure non saturé pouvait être produite par l'action seule de
la chaleur.
    L'existence de ces nouveaux carbures métalliques destructibles par
l'eau peuvent donc modifier les idées théoriques qui ont été données
jusqu'ici pour expliquer la formation de quelques pétroles, ou autres
produits carbonés. Il est bien certain que nous devons nous mettre
en garde contre des généralisations trop hâtives.
    Vraisemblablement     il existe des pétroles d'origines différentes.  A
Autun, par exemple, les schistes bitumineux paraissent bien avoir
été produits par la décomposition de matières organiques.
    Au contraire, dans la Limagne, l'asphalte imprègne toutes les
fissures du calcaire d'eau douce aquitanien, qui est bien pauvre en
fossiles.    Cette asphalte est en relation directe avec les filons de
pépérite (tufs basaltiques), par conséquent en relation évidente avec
les éruptions volcaniques de la Limagne.

ce carbure liquide pourrait dans ce terrain être attribué à l'action de
l'eau sur les carbures métalliques.

le? réactions les      carbures   métalliques ont donné des carbures d'hydro

    On pourrait peut être trouver un exemple de cette réaction dans
les environs de St. Nectaire.           Les granits qui forment en cet endroit
la bordure du bassin tertiaire laissent échapper d'une façon continue
et en grande quantité du gaz acide carbonique.
    Nous estimons aussi que certains phénomènes volcaniques pour
raient être attribués à l'action de l'eau sur des carbures métalliques
facilement décomposables.            Tous les géologues savent que la dernière
manifestation        d'un  centre    volcanique consiste dans des émanations
carburées très variées, allant de l'asphalte et du pétrole au terme
ultime de toute oxydation, à l'acide carbonique.
    Un mouvement du sol mettant en présence l'eau et les carbures
métalliques peut produire un dégagement violent de masses gazeuses.
En même temps que la température s'élève, les phénomènes de poly
mérisation des carbures interviennent pour fournir toute une série de
produits complexes.
    Les composés hydrogénés du carbone peuvent donc se former tout
d'abord. Les phénomènes d'oxydation apparaissent ensuite et vien
nent compliquer les réactions.              En certains endroits, une fissure
volcanique peut agir comme une puissante cheminée d'appel. On sait
que la nature des gaz recueillis dans les fumerolles varie suivant que
l'appareil volcanique est immergé dans l'océan ou baigné par l'air
atmosphérique.          À Santorin, par exemple, M. Fouqué a recueilli de
l'hydrogène libre dans les bouches volcaniques immergées, tandis qu'il
n'a rencontré que de la vapeur d'eau dans les fissures aériennes.
    L'existence de ces carbures métalliques si facile à préparer aux
hautes températures, et qui vraisemblablement doivent se rencontrer
dans les masses profondes du globe,* permettrait donc d'expliquer
dans quelques cas la formation des carbures d'hydrogène liquides ou
solides et la cause de certaines éruptions volcaniques.
" Complete Freezing-point Curves of Binary Alloys containing

    The paper, of which the following is an abstract, contains the
results of some experiments on the freezing points of alloys of two

                Freezing- Point Carves of Binary Alloys.              161
metals, ore of the two being in each case either silver or copper. It
 is an extension into temperatures as high as 1100° C, of experiments
similar to those at lower temperatures with which we have been
occupied for the last seven years. The results of our previous
experiments, in which, mercury thermometers were used, are pub
lished in the ' Journal of the Chemical Society.'          In the work
described in this paper the determinations of temperature were made
by means of platinum electrical resistance pyrometers of the
Callendar-Griffiths type.
    The paper is divided into four sections.
    Section I contains a short survey of certain points in the theory
of concentrated solutions which bear on the interpretation of the
experiments.
    Section  II is devoted to an account of the experimental method.
    Section   III  contains the results of the experiments in a tabular
form,   each  table being followed by notes and remarks taken from the
experimental note books.
    Section IV contains the results expressed graphically as complete
freezing-point curves, together with a discussion and a statement of
the conclusions that can be arrived at from a study of each curve.
                                  Section  I.
    If we  plot the percentage composition of an alloy horizontally, and
the freezing point vertically we get the freezing-point curve. This,
for a pair of metals, would consist of two branches, each starting
from the freezing point of a pure metal, and descending until they
meet in the eutectic point.     Our silver-copper curve gives a fair idea
of this case.
    If the metals A and B form a stable componnd C, then the theory
as developed by Bakhuis, Rooseboom, and by Le Chatelier makes it
probable that the curve will be divided into the systems A C and
C B with two eutectic points, and an intermediate summit at C. This
case is well illustrated by a complete freezing-point curve of copper-
antimony by Professor Le Chatelier, in which two such summits
occur.
    Another not infrequent case is probably that of a compound, which
when molten can only exist in a partially dissociated condition.     Our
silver-antimony     curve resembles such a curve.      Other points of
Section   I will be best deferred to the summary of Section IV.
                                 Section  II.
    The alloys, weighing from 200 to 500 grams, were melted in plum
bago (salamander) crucibles, placed in one of Fletcher's blastfurnaces.

162           Messrs. C.  T. Heycock and F. H. Neville.
A   current of coal gas or of hydrogen was passed through a pipe-stern
into the crucible; and this gas, burning over the surface of the
molten metal, proved a perfect protection against oxidation.         The
metal was stirred by a plunging stirrer of graphite.    The alloys were
made by adding weighed quantities of the second metal in succession
to what was originally a weighed quantity of the first metal, and
taking the freezing point after each addition.
                               Section III.
   This section contains tables divided into parts and into series. The
tables give the freezing point and the composition of each alloy, ex
pressed in percentage weights of one of the constituent metals, and
also in atomic percentages. By atomic percentage we understand
the number of atomic weights of one metal contained in every 100
atomic weights of the two metals in the alloy.
                               Section IV.
   The complete freezing-point curves given in the paper are for the
following pairs of metals — Ag-Cu, Ag-Pb, Ag-Sn, Pb-Cn, Sn-Cu,
Ag-Sb. But incomplete curves are also given, showing the freezing
points of dilute solutions of Bi, An, Ni, Fe, Al, in copper, and of Bi,
Pt, Au, Al, and Tl, in silver.
   It has not been our aim to make a special study of very dilute
solutions, but the results we have obtained when utilised in the equa
tions given in the paper give as the latent heat of fusion of a gram of
copper the number 50 calories, and as the corresponding latent heat
of silver 27 calories. This latter number is considerably greater than
the- 21 calories given by Person, and both numbers can only be
regarded as provisional.
   The silver-copper curve shows no indication of chemical combina
tion, unless it be the unexpected fact that the outectic alloy occurs
exactly at the composition Ag3Cua.       The comparatively small value
of the two atomic falls makes it improbable that the two metals form
monatomic molecules in this alloy.
   In the silver-lead and silver-tin curves, which have a good deal of
likeness to each other, the eutectic alloy contains so little silver that
the curve consists almost wholly of the branch starting from pnre
silver.   For the first 20 atoms of added metal the lead curve agrees
very well, and the tin curve fairly, with the ideal curve of equa
tion (2) ; but with more lead or tin the total depression becomes
much less than that of the ideal curve at the same concentration.
We are disposed to see in this, not an evidence of chemical combina
tion, but rather an aggregation of the lead or tin atoms into larger

                Freezing Point Curves of Binary Alloys.               163
molecules, a process which, in the case of the silver-lead, might almost
amount to the separation of the alloy into conjugate liquids near
50 atomic percentages of lead.
   The lead-copper affords an excellent example of a phenomenon
which has been predicted, we believe, by Ostwald, bnt, so far as we
know, has not hitherto been examined experimentally.         It is that of
the solidification of a system consisting of two conjugate liquids, a
saturated solution of lead in copper, and a saturated solution of
copper in lead.      For dilute solutions of lead in copper, as far as
7 atoms of lead, the curve is in harmony with equation (2) ; but as
more lead is added its effect rapidly decreases, and from 17 to 65
atoms of lead the freezing point remains constant at 954° C. With
more lead the freezing point again falls, until it reaches the eutectic
point.   An examination of the solid alloys shows that the flat part of
the curve corresponds to alloys which have separated into two layers,
while still liquid.
   The copper-tin curve embraces all the remarkable bronzes, gun
metal, bell metal, speculum metal, and it is not surprising to find
that it presents singularities.   The rapid increase in the steepness of
the curve as tin is added suggests that the tin is combining with the
copper to form complex molecules, perhaps of SnCu3 or SnCu4, which
exist in solution. An abrupt change, not only in the direction of the
curve, but also in the character of the freezing point, and the nature
of the precipitate at 15-2 atoms of tin is in accordance with the great
changes in the physical and microscopical character of the alloy noted
by Behrens as occurring here.         The remarkably straight line of
freezing points from here up to 20 atoms of tin is best explained on
the assumption that an isomorphous mixture of SnCu4 and another
body are separating.     The very flat part of the curve between 20 and
25 atoms of tin, along which each freezing point is an extremely
constant temperature may be due to another case of isomorphism, or
may be due to the separation of conjugate liquids.       The existence of
a body SnCu3 is not clearly indicated by our curve, although not in
consistent with it. Double freezing points occur on the horizontal
lines stretching to the left from 15'2 and 20 atoms of tin.
   The silver-antimony curve shows an angle at Ag3Sb, but the
eutectic point, though near Ag3Sb2, is not at this formula.
   It is worthy of note that in three cases in our curves an angular
depression, and not a summit, occui-s at a formula point.
   We have made a few experiments on alloys of gold, nickel, and
iron, in copper. The two latter cause a rise, but gold produces a fall
in the freezing point.
   From what we have hitherto done, silver bismuth promises to
resemble silver-antimony, copper-bismuth to resemble copper-lead.
The silver-gold curve, as is already known, rises above the freezing

point of silver ; and the same is true of silver-platinum.   The silver
aluminium curve presents some singularities ; but here, as with other
aluminium alloys, we have been troubled by partial oxidation of
the aluminium, and we therefore hope to revise our experiments
with this metal, before publishing them in full.
" Note of the Radius of Curvature of a Cutting Edge." By
      A. Mallock.       Communicated by Lord Kelvin, F.R.S.
      Received June 9, — Read June 18, 1896.
   The following note may be of interest, partly as indicating the
extreme thinness to which a cutting edge may be brought by the
ordinary process of grinding, and partly also as showing how readily
the wave-length of light may be used, with only the simplest appli
ances, as a practical unit for the measurement of small distances.
    The object in view was to find the thickness, or at any rate a
superior limit to the thickness, of the cutting edge of a razor, and for
 this purpose two pieces of thin glass (such as is used for covering
microscope slides) were prepared about £ inch long and        wide.
    These were pressed together by a small steel clip   A, and the edge
of the razor was inserted between them as shown in fig. (1).
                                 Fig. 1.
    The razor with the thin glasses in this position was then placed on
 the micrometer stage of a microscope and illuminated perpendicularly
 with light from a soda flame.
    With the microscope, interference bands were of course visible
 between the thin glasses ; and the number of bands, (N), counting
 from the spot where the clip pressed the glasses into optical contact

 up to the edge    of the blade, gives the distance BC in terms of the-
 half wave-length.
    The distance, BD, was measured by the micrometer, and the
 number obtained by dividing BD by the distance between the con
 secutive bands in the neighbourhood of the edge (since the thin
 glasses are hardly at all bent so near their free ends) gives when
 added to N the number of half wave-lengths in DE.
    After these measures had been made, a piece of flat glass was laid
 on the blade of the razor as in fig. (2) and the number of interference-

bands which appeared between the edge and a line parallel to the-
edge, but distant BD from it, was counted; and this observation was
repeated with the flat glass on the opposite side of the blade.
    The angle H P I, i.e., the angle between the two positions of the
flat glass, was also measured.
   If  the grinding of the razor was perfect and there was no rounding
at the edge, no interference bands would be visible between the
blade and the glass, but the two would be in contact up to the
actual edge.
    Fig. (3) is a large scale cross-section of the blade in the neigh
bourhood of the edge.

   On the Determination     of Wave-length  of Electric Radiation.   1(57
   The razor applied at the same distance from the fixed end would
sometimes cnt through the hair before it had bent it as much as 30° ;
and this shows that a force of half a grain must make the pressure
per unit area at the place of contact sufficient to cause crushing or
disruption of the material even when the edge has entered the hair
to a distance comparable with the radius of the latter.
   If we assume that the thickness of the edge is 1/100,000 in. and
that it has entered the hair until the length of the edge engaged is
1/1,000 in., the area in contact will be about 1/100,000,000 of a
square inch and the pressure per square inch rather more than
3 tons, if the total force over the area of contact is half a grain.
   It is difficult to get any direct measure of the pressure required to
destroy by crushing or shearing the material of which hair is com
posed, but horn which is of the same nature requires a much larger
pressure than 3 tons per square inch to crush it.
   A rough experiment showed that a cylindrical steel punch with a
flat end, began to sink into a block of horn when the pressure was
between 12 and 16 tons per square inch.
   It would seem, therefore, that although the optical method shows
that the thickness at the edge cannot be greater than 1/100.000 inch,
the real thickness judged by the pressure per unit area necessary to
cause the edge to cut in the way it actually does, must be considerably
less than this.

       M.A.    (Cantab.), D.Sc. (Lond.), Professor of Physical
       Science, Presidency College, Calcutta.        Communicated by
      Lord Rayleigh, Sec. R.S. Received June 2,— Read June

   While engaged in the determination of the " Indices of Refraction
of various Substances for the Electric Ray " {vide 1 Proceedings of the
Royal Society,' vol. 59, p. 160), it seemed to me that the results
obtained would be rendered more definite if the wave-length of the
radiation could at the same time be specified. Assuming the ref
lation between the dielectric constant K and the index u as indicated
by Maxwell, to hold good in all cases, it would follow that the index
could be deduced from the dielectric constant and vice versa. The
values of K fcund for the same substance by different observers are,
however, found not to agree very well with each other.         This may,
to a certain extent, be due to the different rates of alternation of the
field to which the dielectrics were subjected. It has been found in
general that the value of K is higher for slower rates of alternation

168         J)r.   J.   C. Bose.   On the Determination   of   the
and the deduced value of n would therefore be higher for slow oscil
lations, the longer waves being thus the more refrangible.             The
 order of refrangibilities would in such a case appear to be some
what analogous to that in an anomalously dispersive medium like
iodine vapour.
    With exceedingly quick ethereal vibrations which give rise to
 light, there is an inversion of the above state of things, i.e., the
 shorter waves are generally found to be the more refrangible,            [fc
would thus appear that there        isa neutral vibration region for each
substance at which this inversion takes place, and where            trans

parent medium produces no dispersion.
    It would be interesting to be able to determine the indices of
refraction corresponding to different wave lengths, chosen as widely
¦apart as possible, and plot a curve of refrangibilities.        A curve
could thus be obtained for rock salt, which       is very transparent to
luminous and obscure radiations, and fairly so to electric radiation.
Carbon bisulphide, which is very transparent to all but the ultra
violet radiation, would also be good substance for experiment.
                                    a
    For the construction of a curve of refrangibility for electric rays,
 having different vibration frequencies, the indices could be deter
mined by the method of total reflection referred to above.             The
 determination of the corresponding wave-lengths, however, offers
great difficulties.     Hertz used for this purpose the method of inter
ference,   the  positions of nodes and loops of stationary undulation
prodnced by perpendicular reflection being determined by means of
tuned circular resonators.
    Sarasin and De la Rive subsequently repeated these experiments
with different sized vibrators and resonators. They found that
the apparent wave-length depended solely on the size of the
resonators.      The wave-length found was approximately equal to
eight   times   the   diameter of the circular resonator.     From these
experiments   it   was supposed that the radiator emitted      continuous
                                                               a

spectrum consisting of waves of different lengths, and that the
different receivers simply resonated to vibrations with which they
happened to be in tune. If this supposition be true the emitted
radiation should, by the action of a prism, or better still, a*diffrac-
tion grating, spread out in the form of a continuous spectrum.           If,
on the contrary, the radiation      monochromatic, the spectrum should
                                   is
be linear.     The experiments to be described below may throw some
light on this question.
   Professor J. J. Thomson, referring to the above case,        isof opinion
that the hypothesis of a continuous spectrum        highly
                                                    is           improbable.
It more likely that, owing to the oscillation being of
  is                                                             a dead-beat
character, the resonator is set in vibration by the impact       of incident
electric waves.  Each resonator vibrating at its particular      free period,

     Wave-length  of Electric Radiation       by Diffraction Grating.        169
measures    its own wave-length.        There is, however, one difficulty in
reconciling the theoretical value with that actually obtained.
According to theory, the wave-length should be equal to twice the
circumference, or 2ir times the diameter of the circular resonator.
The value actually obtained by Messrs. Sarasin and De la Rive is, as
has been said before, eight times the diameter of the circle.
   Rubens, using a bolometer and Lecher's modification of the slide
bridge, determined the nodes and loops in a secondary circuit in
which stationary electric waves were produced.                 A curve obtained
by representing     the   bolometer     deflections     as   ordinates  and the
distances of the bridge from one end as abscissae, shows the harmonic
character of the electric disturbance in the wire.            It was found that
the wave-length obtained by this method did not depend on the
period of the primary vibrator; the wave-length measured was
merely that of the free vibration started in the secondary circuit by
the primary disturbance.
   Hertz's method is therefore the only one for the measurement of
electric waves in air, and the result obtained by this method is
vitiated by the influence of the periodicity of the resonator.            It was
therefore thought desirable to obtain the wave-length of electric
radiation in free space by a method unaffected by any peculiarity of
the receiver.
   I  have succeeded in determining            the wave-length of electric
radiation by the use of curved gratings, and the results obtained
seem to be possessed of considerable degrees of accuracy.              Rowland's
method of using the curved grating for obtaining diffraction light
spectra was also found well suited for the production of pure spectra
of electric radiation.     The focal curve        /  in this arrangement is a
circle, having as a diameter the straight line joining the centre of
curvature C with the apex M of the grating.

    The grating, which is cylindrical, is placed vertically on a wooden
table, with its centre at C, occupied in the diagram by the spiral
spring coherer S. With the radius, which joins the centre to the
apex of the grating, as a diameter, a circle is engraved on the table —
the focal curve —on which the radiator and the receiver are always
kept.     A pin is fixed immediately below the apex, and a graduated
ring   sunk   in the table with this pin as the centre. The graduated

  necessary sliding for placing the radiator and the receiver on the
  focal curve. It would be better to have the sliding arrangement at
 the free ends of the arms, the pin passing through the central ends,
 acting as a pivot.      The circle is graduated into degrees,         but one-
 fourth of a degree may be estimated.
                        Description of    the  Apparatus.
    The   Radiator. — Electric oscillation is produced between two
 metallic beads and an interposed sphere 0"78 cm. in diameter. The
 beads and the interposed sphere were at first thickly coated with
 gold, and the surface highly polished.           This worked satisfactorily
 for a time, but, after long -continued action, the surface of the ball
 became roughened, and the discharge ceased to be oscillatory.
 After some difficulty in obtaining the requisite high temperature,             I
 succeeded in casting a solid ball and two beads of platinum.              There
 is now no difficulty in obtaining an oscillatory discharge, and the ball
 does not require so much looking after.
    As an electric generator,   I  at first used a small Buhmkorff's coil,
 actuated    by a battery.     I, however, soon found that the usual
vibrating arrangement is a source of trouble ; the contact points soon
get worn out, and the break becomes irregular.            The oscillation pro
duced by a single break is quite sufficient for a single experiment,
and it is a mere waste to have a series of useless oscillations.         But the
most serious objection to the continuous production of secondary
sparks is the deteriorating action on the spark balls. Anyone who
has tried to obtain an oscillatory discharge knows how easily the
discharge becomes irregular, and the most fruitful source of trouble
is often traced to the disintegration of the sparking surface.            In my
later apparatus   I have discarded the use of       the vibrating interrupter.
The coil has also been somewhat modified. A long strip of paraffined
paper is taken, and tinfoil pasted on opposite sides ; this long roll is
wound round the secondary to act as a condenser, and appropriate
 connexions    made with the interrupting key. This arrangement

secures   a great   saving of space. Two jointed electrodes cany the
two beads at their ends ; the distance between the beads and the
interposed ball can be thus adjusted. This is a matter of importance, as
the receiver does not properly respond when the spark-length is too
large.    Small sparks are found more effective with the receiver used.
After a little experience it is possible to tell whether the discharge is
oscillatory or not.       The effective sparks have a smooth sound,
whereas non-oscillatory discharges give rise to a peculiar cracked
sound, and appear jagged in ontline.
   The wires of the primary coil are in connexion with a small storage
cell through a tapping key. The coil, a small storage cell, and the
 key are enclosed in a tinned iron box.          It must be borne in mind
that a magnetic disturbance is produced each time the primary

circuit of the induction coil is made or broken ; a sudden variation of
 the magnetic field disturbs the receiver.        The iron box in which the
coil is enclosed screens the space outside from magnetic disturbance.
 On one side of the box there is a narrow slit through which the stud
 of the press-key projects. In front of the box is the radiator tube,
 which may be square or cylindrical. The radiating apparatus used
 in the following experiments has a square tube 1 sq. in. in
 section.    The apparatus thus constructed                is very      portable.
 The one which I often use is 7 in. in height, 6 in. in length,
 and 4 in. in breadth.      To obtain a flash of radiation it is merely
 necessary to press   the key and then release it. The break is made
 very sudden by an elastic spring.
    The Spiral Spring Receiver. — The receiving circuit consists of a
 spiral spring coherer in series with a voltaic cell and a dead-beat
 galvanometer of D'Arsonval type. An account of this form of re
                                          "
 ceiver has already been given (vide On the Indices of Refraction of

     Wave-length   of Electric Radiation    by  Diffraction Grating.   173
various Substances for the Electric Ray," ' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 59,
p. 163).    The receiver is made linear by arranging bits of steel spiral
springs side by side, the sensitive surface being 3 mm. broad and
2 cm. in length.     An electrical current enters along the breadth of
 the top spiral and leaves by the lowest spiral, having to traverse the
intermediate spirals along the numerous points of contact.             The
 resistance of the receiving circuit is thus almost entirely concentrated
                                   Fio.  5.

 at the sensitive contact surface, there being little useless short cir
cuiting by the mass of the conducting layer.          When electric radia
tion is absorbed by the sensitive surface, there is a sudden diminution
of the resistance, and the galvanometer in circuit is violently de
flected.   By adjusting the electromotive force of the circuit the
sensitiveness of the receiver may be increased to any extent desir
able.    The receiver at each particular adjustment responds best to a
definite range of vibration lying within about an octave.       The same
receiver could, however, be made to respond to a different range by
an appropriate change of the electromotive force acting on the circuit.
 Very careful adjustment of the E.M.F. of the circuit is necessary to
make the receiver respond at its best to a particular range of electric
vibration.
   The Cylindrical Grating. — The source of radiation — the spark gap
— being a line, the curved diffraction grating is made cylindrical.
The spark gap is always kept vertical ; the grating is made of equi
distant metallic strips, which are vertical and parallel. A piece of thin
sheet ebonite is bent in the shape of a portion of a cylinder and kept
in that shape by screwing against upper and lower circular guide
pieces of wood.     Against the concave side of the ebonite are stuck
strips of rather thick tinfoil at equal intervals.          Five different

gratings were thus made with strips or spaces                  equal to  3 cm.,
2'5 cm., 2 cm., 1*5 cm., and     1 cm. respectively.
   The diameter of       the cylindrical grating is 100 cm. It would
perhaps have been better to use a grating with a less curvature,
but it must be remembered that the intensity of radiation is very
feeble, and    I  was apprehensive of the receiver failing to respond
when placed at too great a distance.           I find from the sensibility of
the receiver used that it would be possible to increase the diameter of
the cylinder to about 150 cm., and this size        I intend to use in the con
struction of my next grating.             The aperture of the grating is
in tbe following experiments reduced to the smallest practicable
limit.
                         Account of   the  Experiments.
   The receiver being placed at      a  suitable position on the focal curve,
the radiator is moved about on the same curve till the diffracted
image falling on the receiver produces response in the galvanometer.
The procedure adopted is as follows.           The receiver is placed, say, at
the centre of the grating (0 = 0°).          The electric ray at first falls on
the grating at a large angle of incidence.              A series of flashes of
 electric  radiation  are  now  produced by manipulating the key, and
 the angle of incidence gradually decreased till the receiver suddenly
 responds. The angle of incidence corresponding to the zero angle
 of diffraction is thus determined. The receiver is then placed at a
 new position on the focal curve, and the corresponding angle of
incidence determined as before.           In this way a series of angles of
incidence, with their corresponding angles of diffraction, are found
for each grating.

    Wave-length   of Electric Radiation    by Diffraction   Grating.    175
   It should be remarked here that numerous difficulties were
encountered in carrying out the experiments.          The reflections from
the walls of the room, from the table, &c, were at first sources of
considerable trouble.    By taking special care,    I  succeeded in elimi
nating these disturbances.      The radiating balls were placed about
1  cm. inside the square tube.       This prevented the lateral waves
acting on the receiver. The receiver was provided with a guard tube,
which stopped all but the diffracted rndiation reaching the sensitive
surface. The insulated wires from the ends of the receiver were
protected by thick coatings of tinfoil, and led to the galvanometer,
which was placed at a considerable distance. The cell and the
galvanometer were enclosed in a metallic case with a narrow slit
for the passage of light reflected from the galvanometer.
   Id spite of all these precautions,    I  was baffled for more than six
months by some unknown cause of disturbance which              I  could not
for a long time account for. It was only recently, when nearly
convinced of the futility of further perseverance, that       I  discovered
the mistake in supposing sheets of tinned iron to be perfectly
opaque to electric radiation.      The metal box which contains the
radiating apparatus seems to transmit a small amount of radia
tion through its walls, and if the receiver happens to be in a very
sensitive condition it responds to the feeble transmitted radia
tion.    I then made a second metallic cover for the radiating box,
which precaution was found effective, provided the receiver was not
brought very close to the radiator.     The receiver is still affected if
placed immediately above the radiator tube, though two metallic
sheets be intervening.                       I
                           For this reason had to postpone taking the
reading for minimum deviation till         I had made a radiation-proof
box.    A soft iron box (to prevent escape of magnetic lines of induc
tion), enclosed in a second enclosure of thick copper, would,      I expect,
be  found impervious to electric radiation.
   With the    second  protective enclosure, all difficulties were prac
tically removed. As a test for the absence of all disturbing causes,        I
observed whether the receiver remained unaffected when the grating
was
      " off." There is a further test for the absence of external dis
turbances. The response, if only due to the diffracted beam, depends
on the position of the radiator on the focal curve.       If this angle of
incidence is decreased, there should then be no action on the receiver.
I found the positions of the radiator on the focal curve producing
                                                  I
action on the receiver, to be well defined, and experienced no further
disturbance due to stray radiations.
   The grating is fixed vertically on the table, so that its centre is at
the same height as that of the middle of the receiving and radiating
tubes.     A small mirror is fixed at the middle of the central strip.
The observer, placing his eye at the same height as that of the

  176          Dr.   J.   C. Bose.      On the Determination       of the
  radiator, levels the grating till the image of the eye is seen reflected
  by the mirror.
     I first obtained an approximate value of the wave-length with a
  2-cm. grating, and then took careful and systematic readings with the
  different gratings.       By different gratings is meant the same curved
 piece   of ebonite,  on   which  strips of different breadths were successively
 applied.    The grating was found fairly adjusted, and the readings
 taken on the right side of the grating agreed well with the corre
 sponding ones on the left side. I did not, therefore, think it necessary
 to take double readings, but took the various readings alternately on
 the right and on the left side.          In one case only I found the grating
 on one side giving slightly better reading than the other.               When the
 incident angle is too oblique, the diffracted image is not sharp, and             I
therefore did not extend the reading beyond 40° of incidence. Spectra
of the first order only were observed. The response iu the receiving
circuit was somewhat feeble when 1 cm. or 1*5 cm. grating was used.
But a 2-cm. grating gave stronger indications.                 With 2'5 and 3 cm.
gratings the response was very energetic and the definition of the
diffracted spectrum very sharp. For example, when the receiver was
kept fixed, and the angle of incidence gradually varied, there was an
abrupt and strong response produced in the receiving circuit, as soon
as the angle of incidence attained the proper value.                A slight varia
tion of this angle, even of less than a quarter of a degree, produced
displacement of the diffracted image, and there was then no further
action on the receiver.           Had my graduated circle permitted it, I
could have got more accurate readings.                The radial arms carrying
the receiver and radiator were of too primitive a design to make it
worth while to attempt greater accuracy.              I   give below the readings
of the angles of incidence and the corresponding angles of diffraction
obtained with the different gratings, and the wave-length deduced
from them.

in connexion with the above.          I took off the central sphere from the

 the diffracted spectrum is not continuous, but linear.                The method
 of determining the wave-length of electric radiation by diffraction
 grating is seen to give results which are concordant.                  The deter
 minations are not affected by the periodicity of the receiving circuit,
 the receiver being simply used as a radioscope.                   With a better
 mounting    and a  finely graduated     circle, it would    be possible to obtain
 results with a far greater degree of accuracy.               I  hope to send, in
 a future communication, the results obtained with a better form of
 apparatus, with which      I intend to study the relation of the wave
 length with the size of the radiator, and the influence of the enclosing
 tube on the wave-length.        I  shall at the same time send an account
 of transmission gratings.

    Effects  of strong   Magnetic   Field upon Discharges in Vacuo.    179
"   The Effects of a strong Magnetic Field upon Electric Dis
        charges in Vacuo." By A. A. C. SwiNTON.            Communicated
        by Lord Kelvin, F.RS. Received June 10, — Read June
        18, 1896.
    As is -well known, when the lines of force of a magnetic field cut
the path of the cathode rays in a vacuum tube, the rays are deflected
in one direction or another, according to the polarity of the lines of
force.     If,  on the other   hand, the relative positions of the vacuum
tube and the magnet are such that the lines of force and the cathode
rays are parallel, the rays are not sensibly deflected.
     Under certain circumstances, however,      I have found that with the
rays    and  lines of force parallel, other phenomena occur both in regard
to the appearance of the discharge and in connexion with the internal
resistance of the tube.
     The apparatus employed consisted of a Crookes tube of the form
illustrated, supported vertically over one pole of a straight electro
magnet.        The tube, which was excited by means of a 10-iuch Ruhm-
korff coil, working much below full power, was about 11 inches in
length.      The cathode terminal consisted of an aluminium plate at
one end of the tube, and the anode a similar plate at one side.        The
 tube was exhausted to a degree that gave considerable green fluor
escence of the glass, with a very slight trace of blue luminescence of
the residual gas in the neighbourhood of the cathode and anode.
 The magnet employed had a soft iron core 12 inches in length and
 1£ inches diameter.       It was wound with 2376 turns of No. 18 S.W.G.
copper wire, which, when supplied with continuous electric current
at 100 volts pressure, allowed from 13 to 14 amperes to pass, and
 magnetised the iron core practically to saturation.
     When the RuhmkorfE discharge passed through the tube, the
 magnet not being excited, the general appearance was as shown in
 fitr. 1, the walls of the tube showing everywhere green fluorescence,
 which was especially strong all over the rounded end of the tube
opposite the cathode. A very small amount of blue luminescence
 could also be faintly seen just below the cathode, and also in the
 vicinity of the anode.
     With the tube and magnet placed as in fig. 2, as soon as the
 magnet was excited, the whole appearance of the discharge in the
 tube was found to alter immediately to what is shown in the illus
 tration.      Excepting for a very little at the top of the tube near the
 cathode, and a very bright spot at the bottom immediately over the
 magnet pole, all the green fluorescence of the glass disappeared,
 while extending from near the cathode to the bright spot at the

bottom of the tube, a very bright cone of blue luminescence with a.
still brighter whitish blue core, made its appearance.   When under
these conditions the tube was slightly moved sideways, the bright
spot at the apex of the cone, and the cone itself moved, the spot and
apex always maintaining a position exactly over the centre of the
magnet pole.    At the same time the minor blue luminescence pro
                                                                      "

current of the Ruhmkorff coil, was bent downwards towards the
magnet as shown, and deflected sideways one way or another accord
ing to the polarity of the magnet, which polarity, however, did not
affect in any way the vertical cathode stream.    The internal resist
ance of the tube, as measured by an alternative spark gap on the
Ruhmkorff coil, was also found to be very greatly diminished while
the magnet was excited.     With the magnet not excited, the alterna
tive spark would leap from 1^ to 1| inches, while, when the magnet
was excited, the gap had to be reduced to about £ inch before the
sparks would pass. As soon as the current from the magnet was cut
off, the appearance of the tube immediately reverted to what is
shown in fig. 1, aud its internal resistance increased to what it had
been before.

   Experiments were also tried with the tube reversed as shown in
fig. 3.   In this case  the internal  resistance was affected by the
magnet just as it had been previously.     The appearance of the tube
was also altered by the diminution almost to vanishing point of the
green fluorescence, the presence of very bright blue luminescence on
the under side of the cathode next the magnet, some less bright blue
fluorescence near the anode, and a considerable amount of faint blue
luminescence throughout the remainder of the tube.
   In this case, as in the other, the tube reverted to its normal
appearance as soon as the magnet was demagnetised, and the appear
ance was the same whether the pole of the magnet next the tube was
north or south.

"The Hysteresis of Iron and Steel in a Rotating Magnetic
      Field." By Francis G. Baily, M.A. Communicated by
      Professor Lodge, F.R.S.        Received April 9, — Read June 4,
      1896.
                               (Abstract.)
   That the hysteresis of iron varies with the conditions of magnetic
change has been ascertained in some instances, notably those in which
the attractions between the molecular magnets of the Weber-Max-
well-Ewitig theory are diminished by super-imposed vibrations in the

             Iron and Steel in   a Rotating Magnetic Field.          183
molecules.    By deduction from this theory it   has been surmised that
the hysteresis in magnetic metals under the influence of a constant
rotary magnetic field will be less than that in an alternating field in
which the magnetising force passes through a zero value.              As
familiar practical examples of the two conditions may be instanced :
the armature core of a continuous current dynamo, and the iron cir
cuit of an alternating current transformer or choking coil.
   It is supposed that residual magnetism is due to the combination
of molecular magnets in stable magnetic arrangements, and that the
energy dissipated in any magnetic change corresponds to the work
done in breaking up these arrangements.         This energy is rendered
kinetic by the movement of the magnets to form new combinations,
the magnets either oscillating about the new position or moving to
it aperiodically, according to the amount of damping to which they
are subject.    It is further suggested that the damping is of an elec
trical or electro- magnetic nature rather than of a frictional character,
being produced by the effect of rapid oscillations of the magnets on
the surrounding particles or medium.       Hence any movement of the
molecular magnets during which the formation of new combinations
is checked or prevented will take place with considerable reduction
in the energy loss due to this cause.
   Such a condition is realised when the magnetic substance is sub
jected to a rotary magnetic field of sufficient strength to force the
molecules to maintain 'a direction parallel to that of the field. If
hysteresis is due only to the formation of new combinations and not
to mechanical restraint, then under these conditions it will vanish
altogether.
    Experiments were carried ont to verify this deduction.       A finely
laminated cylinder of iron was suspended on its axis between the
  oles of an electro-magnet which was capable of rotation about the
axis of suspension of the cylinder, thus producing a magnetic field
rotating in a plane at right angles to this axis. The cylinder, though
 otherwise free to rotate, was restrained from continuous rotation by
 a spring, and the angle of rotation and consequent restoring force of
the Bpring was indicated by a beam of light reflected from a mirror
 on the cy Under. The speed of the electro- magnet and the exciting
 current could each be varied.
    On rotating the magnet, the armature was dragged round until the
 restoring force of the spring equalled the force due to hysteresis, and
 the value of the latter could be obtained from the observed deflexions.
 The result showed that the value of the hysteresis under these con
 ditions was very different from that obtained in an alternating field.
 At first the value was higher for corresponding inductions, but at an
 induction of about 16,000 in soft iron and 15,000 in hard steel the
 hysteresis reached a sharply defined maximum and rapidly dimin

184           Mr. E. Rutherford.       A Magnetic Detector of
ished on more complete magnetisation, until at an induction of about
20,000 it became very small with every indication of disappearing
altogether.     Soft iron and hard steel gave very similar curves, and
in both the curve of hysteresis-induction cut the curve obtained from
the values in an alternating field at a point just before the maxi
mum. The result fully bears out the deduction from the theory,
and proves in addition that hysteresis is not sensibly due to anything
of the nature of mechanical restraint of the molecules. The form
of the curve also gives clear indications of the three stages of molecular
movement, the first stage giving a slowly rising curve, the second a
straight rapid rise, and the third a straight and much more rapid
descent.
    Further experiments were carried out on the effect of speed of
rotation.    In an alternating field the speed of reversal has been shown
to be without sensible effect on the hysteresis, and theory points to
this result as a natural deduction.       The above apparatus was well
adapted for testing the matter, since the hysteresis per reversal could
be read at each instant independently of the speed.          From an ex
tremely    slow   speed up   to   70  revolutions per  second  no definite
change was found in the value of the hysteresis. At the same time
several small modifications were noted, produced by rapid variations
in the speed of rotation or magnetising force.           The effect lasted
through many revolutions, but ultimately the same steady condition
was arrived at.     At and near the maximum value the hysteresis was
very variable.      The effects were much more marked in soft iron
than in hard steel, as would be anticipated from the theory of their
constitution.
    The experiments in their verification of an untried deduction form
a strong proof of the validity of the molecular theory of magnetism,
and throw some light on the nature of the molecular complex anil of
the interactions which take place therein.

    The effect of Leyden jar discharges on the magnetisation of steel
needles is investigated, and    it is shown that the demagnetisation of
strongly magnetised steel needles offers a simple and convenient
 means for detecting and comparing currents of great rapidity of
 alternation.

             Electrical Waves and some of its Application*.            185
   The partial     demagnetisation of fine steel wires, over which is
 wound a small solenoid, was found to be a very sensitive means of
detecting electrical waves at long distances from the vibrator.
Quite a marked effect was found at a distance of over half a mile from
the vibrator.
   Detectors made of very fine steel wire may be used to investigate
waves along wires and free vibrating circuits of short wave-length.
Fine wire detectors are of the same order of sensitiveness as the
bolometer for showing electrical oscillations in a conductor.
   This detector also has the property of distinguishing between the
first and second half oscillations of a discharge, and may be used for
determining the damping of electrical vibrations and the resistances
of the discharge circuit.
   A method of experimentally determining the period of oscillation
of a Leyden jar circuit by the division of rapidly alternating currents
in a multiple circuit is explained.      The capacity and the self-induct
ance   of the circuit for high frequency discharges may also be deduced,
so  that all the constants of a discharge circuit may be experimentally
determined.      In the coarse of the paper the following subjects were
investigated.
   (1) Magnetisation of Iron by High Frequency Discharges. — The effect
of the Leyden jar discbarge on soft iron and steel is fully examined.
Steel needles which had been placed in a solenoid and subjected to a
discharge were examined by dissolving them in acid. It was found
that there was apparently only evidence of two half oscillations in
the discharge, and this effect is due to the demagnetising force
exerted by the needle on itself during the discharge.
   The effect of continued discharges on the demagnetisation of mag
netised steel needles was investigated, and also the effect of varying
the length and diameter of the steel needles.
   When a discharge is sent longitudinally through a magnetised steel
wire the magnetic moment of the needle is always decreased, due to
the circular magnetisation of the wire by the current through it.
This " longitudinal " detector, when of thin steel wire, was found to
 be a sensitive means of detecting electrical oscillations of small
amplitude.
                "longitudinal" and " solenoidal
                                                     "
   Both the                                             detectors may    be
readily used for comparing the intensities of currents in multiple
circuits when traversed by currents of the same period.
    (2) Detection, of Electrical Waves at Long Distances from the Vibrator.
— A compound detector needle was composed of fine steel wires and
a small solenoid wound over it.       When this detector was placed in
series with the wires of a receiver, the electrical oscillations set up in
 the circuit tended to demagnetise the magnetised detector needle.
    By this method electrical waves from a Hertzian vibrator were

  18(5                      Mr.  J. S. Towiisend.
 detected   for long distances. An effect was obtained at over half a
 mile from the vibrator.
     (3) Waves along Wires. — The uses of fine steel wires for examining
 the distribution of currents along wires are explained.
                                    —
     (4) Damping of Oscillations. A method of determining the damp
 ing of discharge circuits is investigated.      The absorption of energy
 in spark gaps is deduced, and the apparent resistance of the air break
 to the discharge determined.
    (5) Resistances of Iron Wires.
                                    — Quantitative results are given for
 the resistance of iron wires for very rapid alternations.        The value
 of the permeability of the different specimens is deduced, and it is
 shown to vary with the diameter of the wire and the intensity of the
 discharge.
    (6) Absorption of Energy by Conductors.
                                                — The absorption of energy
 of iron and non-magnetic cylinders placed in solenoid through which
 a discharge passed were determined.         Iron cylinders were found to
absorb much more energy than copper ones of the same diameter, and
the permeability of the iron for the discharge is deduced.
    (7) Determination of the Period of Oscillation of Leyden Jar Dis
charges. — A method of accurately determining the period of oscillation
is based on the division of rapid alternations in a multiple circuit, one
arm of which is composed of a standard indnctance, and the other of
a variable electrolytic resistance.
    The value of n, the number of oscillations per second, when the
currents in the branches of the multiple circuits are equal, is, under
certain conditions, given by —
where    R=    resistance of electrolyte to the discharge,
        W=     value of the standard inductance.
    The value of the self-inductance and capacity of the discharge cir
cuit for very rapid oscillations may also be experimentally deduced.

    The experiments on the coefficient of magnetisation of liquids were
made with a sensitive induction balance.          Both circuits were com
muted about sixteen times a second, so         that very small inductances
could be detected by the galvanometer in the secondary circuit.        The
principle of the method consisted in balancing the increase of the

mutual   induction of the primary on the secondary of a solenoid
arising from the presence of a liquid in the solenoid against known
small inductances.    Thus, if the sum of the inductances be reduced
to zero, as shown by the galvanometer in the secondary giving no
deflection, the balance will be disturbed to the extent 4?rfcM, due to
the insertion of a liquid into the solenoid whose coefficient of mag
netisation is    and the galvanometer in the secondary circuit will
                    Tc,
give a deflection when the commutator revolves. An adjustable
inductance is then reduced by a known amount, m, till the deflection
disappears     ;   so that we get

where m and M are quantities easily calculated.
   Since the formula does not contain either the rate of the rotation
of the commutator nor the value of the primary current, no particu
lar precautions are necessary to keep these quantities constant.
   In all the determinations the magnetising force was varied from                      1
to9  centigram units, and in no case was there any variation in   The            h.
densities of the salts in solution were also varied over large ranges,
and showed that the coefficient of magnetisation for ferric salts in
solution depended only on the quantity of iron per c.c. that was
present, giving the formula

    The object of the present communication is to give an account of
the chief results of an investigation into the processes connected
with the formation and fertilisation of the oospheres and the
germination      of the spore in Ascophyllum nodosum, Fucus vesi-
culosus,   and    Fucus platycarpus.    The more obvious details of
development have been especially studied by Thuret, and later by
Oltmanns.      But neither of these writers paid any special attention
to the    behaviour    of the cell-nuclei, nor did they succeed in
observing the actual process of fertilisation.       Behrens has com
municated an account (' Ber. d. Deutschen Bot. Gesel.,' Bd. TV) of
some researches made by himself on the fertilisation of the oospheres,
but we are unable to accept his conclusions for reasons shortly to be
recounted.
    The material for these investigations was obtained in London from
Bangor, Plymouth, and Jersey, but it was compared with other
material collected and fixed at the seaside at Bangor, Weymouth,
and Criocieth.       Furthermore, all the growing apices and con-
ceptacles for sectioning were collected by one of us directly at the
three last named places. Some samples were gathered between the
tides, and fixed at once, others were first kept for a time in salt
 water ; the best results, however, were obtained from plants collected
in a boat about two or three hours after the tide had reached the
 plant, and also from other plants taken a short time before they were
 left exposed by the ebb tide.
    In order to study the fertilisation and germination stages, male
 and female plants were kept in separate dishes, and were covered
 over so as to prevent drying up.    This method gave far better results
 than those more usually advocated.        On the appearance of the

extruded sexual products, the female receptacles were placed in sea-
water, and after the complete liberation of the oospheres, a few
male branches with ripe antherozoids were first placed in a capsule
of sea water until it became turbid owing to their number.            If on
examination the antherozoids proved to be active, small quantities
were added to the vessels containing the oospheres.        The latter were
then fixed at intervals of five minutes during the first hour, and then
at intervals of fifteen minutes, up to six hours after the addition of
the antherozoids.      After that, samples were killed at longer intervals
up   to  three days, and this was continued till we had material fixed at
all stages for the first fortnight. At first we used sea water in
which to keep the embryos growing, but a proper solution of
Tidman's sea salt was found to answer quite as well.
    For fixing, we tried the following reagents — chrome alum, picric
slum, Mann's picro-corrosive, corrosive sublimate, and acetic acid ;
these were all dissolved in sea water, absolute alcohol, Plemming's
and Hermann's solutions, and the vapour of osmic and formic acids.
The Flemming's (strong formula) and Hermann's solutions were
diluted with equal parts of sea water.       The first three fixatives were
unsuccessful, acetic-corrosive yielded fair nuclear figures, but the
material proved very brittle, and the spores were somewhat dis
torted.     A portion of the cytoplasm was disorganised and the polar
radiations were not preserved. Absolute alcohol fixed the oospheres
and newly fertilised spores without distortion, but was useless for all
other stages.     Vapour fixing with osmic acid succeeded better than
any of the preceding reagents but was greatly inferior to either
Hermann's or Flemming's solutions in preserving the protoplasmic
structure in an unaltered state.
    After the material had been fixed it was dehydrated and passed in
the usual way into paraffin, the temperature of which was not
allowed to exceed 50° C, and it was then cut with the microtome.
The sections were stained with Heidenhain's iron-hsematoxylin, with
Flemming's triple stain, and a large number of other dyes. The
results, which were compared carefully, led us to rely chiefly on the
two staining processes mentioned, but at the same time we often
obtained valuable preparations with other staining reagents as well.
    In spite of repeated attempts, we have not succeeded in observing
the first nuclear division in the oogonium, but the later ones have
 been seen both in Fucus vesiculosus and in F. platycarpus, in which
eight oospheres are formed.       Oltmanns asserts that in Ascophyllum,
 in which only four oospheres are commonly formed, eight free nuclei
occur at an earlier stage, but that four of these ultimately abort,
 and do not become centres of cell formation.       Our observations tend
 to confirm him in this respect, but we found that in some cases
  a fifth oosphere, smaller than the rest, was occasionally differentiated,
                                                                  P 2

and that when freed from the oogonium it exerted an attraction on
the antherozoids jnst like its larger sister oospheres.
   When an oogonial nucleus is about to divide, it first becomes
slightly, then very much, elongated so as to resemble an ellipse.
Fine radiations are seen to extend from the two ends into the
surrounding cytoplasm.           The latter is at first tolerably uniformly
granular,   but  as  the  radiations  around the polar areas increase, these
regions become cleared altogether of the granules which then become
massed outside them.          The nucleus rapidly becomes more spindle-
shaped,    and  its   chromatic    elements are chiefly grouped near each
pole, leaving a clear space about the equator in which the nucleolus
is situated. In this respect the nuclei of Fucus offer a striking con
trast to those of Pellia epiphylla already described (' Annais of
Botany,' vol. viii, p. 221) by one of us.           In the latter plant the
chromatic portion of the nucleus assumes an equatorial position at
the corresponding stage in division, whilst the polar regions are clear.
   The polar radiations continue to increase and the nucleus to
lengthen, until the entire structure recalls the figure of a dumb-bell,
in which the nucleus answers to the handle, and the radiation areas
to the knobs.       If the radii be traced outwardly, they are seen to
terminate either in the frothy protoplasm, on the angles where the
foam walls meet, or on the large granules which surround the cleared
areas and are embedded             in the foam. This point is one of
considerable importance, and we shall revert to it further on.
No structures were seen which could certainly be identified as
centrosomes, although bodies suggestive of them were often observed ;
but these proved to be so variable in size and position, as well as in
number, that we feel unable to attach any special significance to
them.
   The next stage in the mitosis is that in which the interpolar
spindle arises, with the chromosomes disposed upon its equator.
The spindle is very remarkable inasmuch as it is entirely intranuclear,
somewhat resembling that described by Fairchild for Valonia, or by
Harper for Peziza.          The nuclear wall can be distinguished until
quite   late  in  karyokinesis, and it is possible that no complete
mingling of the cytoplasm with the contents of the nucleus takes
place here.     The spindle is extremely clear, and in several prepara
tions, owing to a fortunate contraction during manipulation, the
 ends of the nuclear part of the spindle also had broken away from
the cytoplasmic poles, and were visible as clean conical structures
forming the poles of the nuclear spindle. The chromosomes were
too minute to admit of their development being satisfactorily studied,
but in all the oogonial spindles their number was estimated at ten
when seen arrayed on the spindle equator. They were only seen in
profile, and consequently it was difficult to be sure whether there

were really ten or twelve, but the absolute number is not of im
portance as all the nuclei were compared from the same aspect.
Remains, more or less preserving the original form, of the nucleolus
were sometimes visible at this and even in a later stage. No division-
planes are formed in the oogonium until the full complement of nuclei
are produced ; after this the positions which they will ultimately
occupy are indicated by the heaping up into lines (or rather plates)
of the cytoplasmic granules above referred to. These seem to be
repelled equally from all the nuclei, thus effecting a symmetrical
division of the entire oogonium.
   After the complete delimitation of the oospheres within the
oogonium, we observed, as an occasional circumstance, that one of
the oospheres might contain two, or even three, nuclei, a fact also
noticed by Oltmanns.         When the oospheres are extruded, and come
to lie free in the water, they grow in size, and are turbid with granules,
which are very abundant in the cytoplasm.               The chromatophores
early   become   distinguishable   from  the other   constituents  of the cell,
and the nucleus occupies a central position.                It is itself sur
rounded by       a  dense   layer  of cytoplasm,   which    later on becomes
very strongly marked.         About five minutes after the mixing of the
sexual cells, the antherozoids are found to have slipped into many of
the oospheres. We failed to observe the act of penetration, but found
a number of cases in which the antherozoid could be recognised
within the oosphere, before its final fusion with the nucleus of the
latter.    It is a roundish, densely staining body, and, unlike the majo
rity of animal sperm cells as yet described, it imports into the egg no
6ystem of radiations along with it. Judging from the short period
of time elapsing between its penetration of the surface of the oosphere
and its arrival at the exterior of the female nucleus, it must pass
through the intervening cytoplasm with great rapidity.                 It then
becomes closely appressed to the nucleus, and is about as large as the
nucleolus of the latter.       It rapidly spreads over a part of the female
nucleus as a cap, and it presents a less homogeneous aspect than
before.     Both it and the female nucleus assume a granular condition,
 which is probably to be interpreted as representing a coiling and
looping of the lining of the respective nuclei. Finally the two nuclei
 coalesce, and the original components can no longer be distinguished.
 Complete fusion may be effected in less than ten minutes after
 addition of the antherozoids to the water. These results are in
 striking accordance with those described by Wilson in connexion
 with the fertilisation of the eggs of echinoderms in his recent " Atlas
 of Fertilisation."
    A delicate pellicle is meanwhile formed around the periphery of
 the oosphere, which is thus easily distinguished from the unfertilised
 oospheres, in which such a membrane is wanting.             The texture of the

 192            Prof.  J. B. Farmer and Mr.           J.  LI. Williams.
 cytoplasm also changes, and tends to assume a more definitely radiat
 ing character, the lines starting from the nucleus as a centre.
    We observed, not unfrequently, rather large cells in which two
nuclei of equal size were lying in close juxtaposition.                     These cells,
with their nuclei, answer exactly to the description given by Behrens
of the fertilisation stage in plants examined by him. We are unable
however, to accept his interpretation, for, in the first place, the
series of fertilisation stages which we have observed, and have
briefly described above, in no way correspond with the appearances
described by him, and secondly, because these large cells (Behrens
himself emphasises their size) are seen in material to which no
antherozoids have had access.            Furthermore, the average size of the
young oospores is not obviously greater than that of the oospheres
themselves.        We regard the bodies in question as representing
abnormal developments of oogonial cells, and not as being in any
way concerned with fertilisation. Moreover, we have occasionally
observed one cell in the divided oogonium, much larger than the rest,
to contain two, or even sometimes three, nuclei, and these nuclei are
then always close together.               These facts have led us to reject
Behrens' account of the process.
    A very large number of experiments were made, in order to deter
mine, if possible, the time which elapsed between the addition of
the antherozoids to the oospheres and the first division of the spore.
A short summary of different sets of observations on Ascophyllum is

    The above observations prove that there is no essential difference
between the behaviour of material examined in London and at the
seaside respectively.
    After fertilisation, the cells rest for a long interval of time- — com
monly about twenty-four hours, as shown in the foregoing table —
before they begin to segment.               The principal changes which occur
during the interval are, first, in the rapid increase in the thickness of
the peripheral cell wall, and, secondly, in the more regular arrange
ment of structure exhibited by the protoplasm.                      The alveolar, or
foam character is extremely clear, and the chromatophores, which by
this time have become very prominent, are noticed to be situated in
the angles formed by the convergence of the foam walls ; they are
often bent and otherwise distorted, and so accommodate themselves
to the structural condition of the foam.                    Other granules, which
stain deeply, and probably represent food reserve of a proteid natnre,
are also abundantly scattered through the cytoplasm.
    The first segmentation-division resembles, in a general way, the
oogonial nuclear divisions already described, and the polar areas
become similarly cleared of granules.               The achromatic threads form
ing the polar radiations are very clearly seen to be attached to the
foam-like     structure      of the cytoplasm, and, indeed, in some cases,
insensibly to pass      into it.    At other times fibrils end on granules (or,
perhaps, on the protoplasmic lining of the granules), and sometimes
again a fibril may fork, and its branches end either on granules or
on the foam angles.            The inference to be drawn from these facts
seems to be that the radiations are the result of a change — a differ
entiation — in the protoplasm as it already exists, and that they do not
owe their origin to the presence of any special " spindle-forming sub
stance," by virtue of which they may be supposed to develop and
"         " as new structures in the
   grow                                          cell. We propose, however, to
discuss the general bearings of our observations on this and on other
questions of theoretical interest in a future memoir, in which the
evidence for our views will be set forth in detail.
    When the achromatic nuclear spindle appears, it also, as in the

194    On Fertilisation, and the Segmentation    of the Spore in Fucus.
oogonial mitoses, is intranuclear, and it is often separated from the
well-defined persistent nuclear wall by a clear space.      The chromo
somes, when assembled on the spindle, at the equator, are seen to be
twice as numerous as in the oogonial nuclei, i.e., seen in profile we
counted them as twenty in number. We were unable to distinguish
any such grouping of the chromosomes as would lead to the conclu
sion that the chromosomes of tbe male and female nuclei respectively
had so far preserved their original identity as to appear in the form of
two separate groups. The long interval of time which, in Fucus,
elapses between fertilisation and the first nuclear division possibly
may admit of a more thorough mingling or fusion of the parental
chromosomes than would seem to be the case in some animals, e.g.,
the Copepoda as described by Riickert and by Hacker.
   During the diaster stage the connecting achromatic fibres are at first
very distinct, but they soon become fainter, and no cell-plate is
formed across them. The two daughter nuclei gradually pass into
the state of rest, each being first hemispherical, with crenate projec
tions on the flattened side turned towards its sister nucleus. Only
after nuclear division is complete does the first cell wall appear. The
cell is sometimes spherical when this happens, and then it is divided
into two similar hemispheres. Further divisions may then appear,
whilst the general contour of the embryo still remains more or less
spherical.   These cases occurred most frequently when the germinat
ing spores were illuminated on all sides. But most commonly the
first cell wall cuts the spore into two dissimilar halves, one of which
grows out and forms a rhizoid.         Often this projection is already
apparent even before the first nuclear division occurs, and in any
case one of the two daughter nuclei always passes down into the
protuberance.
   The immediately succeeding divisions have been sufficiently de
scribed by Thuret and others, but we may remark that the division
of the nuclei in all cases precedes the formation of a cell plate, which
is not formed in connexion with the achromatic connecting fibrils as
in the higher plants.
   The doubled number of the chromosomes is retained daring the
vegetative divisions of the thallns, and is constant throughout the
somatic cells of the mature Fucus plant. Hence it follows that the
reduction in the number of the chromosomes (in the female plants),
is associated with the differentiation of the oogonium — the mother cell
of tbe sexual products. Thus Fucus, in this respect, approximates
more closely to the type of animal oogenesis than to that which obtains
in those higher plants in which the details of chromosome reduction
has been followed out.
   Regarded from the standpoint of the number of its chromosomes,
the Fucus plant resembles the sporophyte of the higher plants, whilst

   Changes  in the Dimensions of Carapace of Carcinus mcenas.       195
 the gametophyto of the latter,   with its reduced number of chromo
 somes, finds its analogue merely in the maturing sexual cells of Fucus.
 But until we know more of the nuclear changes as they occur in other
 Algae, and especially in the more primitive forms, it seems unadvis-
able to go further than to indicate the possibility that we may require
to revise, our present ideas on the comparative morphology of the
higher and lower groups of the vegetable kingdom. Even if we regard
 the reduction in the number of the chromosomes as a fact which is
primarily of physiological importance, we may safely conclude, from
the universality of its occurrence, that it is also intimately connected
with the phylenogenetic development of living forms, and hence it
must meet with due recognition on the part of the morphologist who
is engaged in comparing the life-history of one group of organisms
with that of others.
"On     certain Changes observed in the Dimensions of Parts
       of the Carapace of Carcinus mcenas"                By HERBERT
       Thompson. Communicated by Professor W. F. R. Weldon,
       F.R.S. Received May 19,— Read June 11, 1896.
    In making    some measurements of young male Carcinus mcenas
from Plymouth, corresponding to those made by Professor Weldon
on young females of the same species, and published by him in the
Report of a Committee for conducting statistical inquiries into the
measurable characteristics of plants and animals (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
vol. 57, p. 360), some interesting facts were observed as to changes
taking place in the relative dimensions of certain parts of the
carapace of these crabs in the space of the last three years.
    The carapace of the adult male crab, measured in the median
antero-posterior line is, roughly, from 40 to 60 mm. long. Now, of
young male C. mcenas collected at random at Plymouth in the year
 1893,  I  had, for the purposes of measurement, 3,077 specimens,
 ranging between 10 and 15 mm. in length of carapace, and on these,
 besides the carapace length, as above defined, two other measure
 ments were taken, viz. (1) "frontal breadth," the distance in a
 straight line between the tips of the two teeth which form the outer
 boundaries of the orbits, and (2) the "right dentary margin,"
 measured in a straight line from the tip of the first to that of the
 last lateral tooth on the right side of the carapace.
    The measurements were made in the way described in the Report
 above mentioned (ibid., pp. 361 — 2) : and owing to the rapid growth
 and alteration of proportional dimensions in the young crabs, they
 were sorted into groups, the members of each of which differed by
 less than 0"2 mm. in carapace length, thus giving five groups for

196      Mr. H. Thompson.            On certain Changes observed in the
every   1 mm. of growth        in carapace length, or twenty-five         groups
for the whole range of 10 — 15 mm. carapace length. The numbers
contained in the separate groups ranged from seventy-two in the
smallest group to 178 in the largest group.                     The arithmetical
mean and mean error in each group is set out in Table I infra.
   Similar measurements were made in the case of 1,957 young male
C. meenas from Plymouth of the year 1895.                  These were likewise
divided into groups differing by 02 mm. of carapace length : and
the numbers contained in the twenty-five groups between 10 and
15 mm. carapace length ranged from thirty-four in the smallest one
to 111 in the largest. The arithmetical means and mean errors are
given in Table I infra.
   On comparing the two sets of measurements (expressed in terms
of the carapace length which was taken as the unit) it appears, as
               " frontal breadth," that in
regards the                                        every one of the twenty-five
groups without exception the average size of the frontal breadth in
the 1893 crabs exceeded that of the 1895 crabs of corresponding size.
Seeing how small the groups are the result is a striking one, aud is
given in greater detail in the following Table : —

   On the other hand, if the species in 1895 has a smaller average
frontal breadth, it compensates for tli9 deficiency by having a larger
right dentary margin. This was found to be the case in twenty-three
out of the twenty-five groups, the two non-conformist groups lying
one near each end of the range.           The arithmetical means and mean
errors are given in Table 1 infra, and the results, tabulated in a
corresponding form to those of the frontal breadth measurements,
are as follows : —

   As these results seemed to indicate that a change in regard to
these dimensions was taking          place in the species, it was desirable to
compare similar measurements in the adult.               Fortunately Professor
Weldon was able to supply me with 254 specimens of male 0. moenas
with a carapace length ranging between 40 and 63 mm., taken at
Plymouth at random in 1892-3 : and for comparison he procured
496 individuals collected at Plymouth in January of the present year
and corresponding      in size.
   Measurements similar to those made on the young ones gave the
following results : — In frontal breadth the 1892-3 crabs exceeded
the 1896 crabs on an average by 8"85 thousandths of their carapace
length, which for an average length of 50 mm. is equivalent to
0 44 mm., while in the right dentary margin the 1896 crabs exceeded
those of 1892-3 on an average by 3"1 thousandths, or an equivalent
of 0-16 mm., thus fully confirming the results arrived at in the
young ones.
   Whether these results indicate a permanent change in the species
at Plymouth in respect to these particular dimensions of the carapace,
tending to the establishment of a new variety, or whether it is a
mere oscillation snch as, for all we know, may be constantly going on
in the relative dimensions of the various parts of the members of all
species, can only be decided by further measurements, which, it is
hoped, may be continued on the same species after another interval
of two or three years. Meanwhile, the persistence with which the
same tendency asserts itself in the twenty-six groups into which we
have divided these crabs of 1892-3 and 1895-6 is remarkable, and
may perhaps induce others to take measurements of other animals at
definite intervals, and establish similar comparisons.
   I wish to add my hearty thanks to Professor Weldon for suggest
ing the line of investigation and furnishing material and ever-ready
help.

                                  (Abstract.)
   The research was undertaken in the hope of obtaining evidence in
support of or against the view that the cerebellnm exercises a direct
influence on the spinal centres, as opposed to any indirect influence
exerted through the agency of the cerebral cortex. The inferior
peduncle of the cerebellum was accordingly divided on one side, the
organ itself and ita other peduncles being otherwise left intact, and
the results obtained by this procedure were controlled by experiments
in which the lateral tracts of the medulla oblongata were divided on
one side without injury to the pyramid on the one hand or to the
posterior columns and their nuclei on the other. Further control
experiments consisted in dividing transversely the posterior columns
and their nuclei a few millimetres above the calamus scriptorins, on
one side, without including the lateral tracts of the medulla in the
lesion.
   The results obtained by these different experiments were supple
mented by others in which the electrical excitability of the two cere
bral hemispheres was tested and compared, immediately after division
of one inferior peduncle of the cerebellum, and at some later period,
such as three weeks, after the section of the peduncle ; also after
partial hemisection of the medulla in which all the structures on one
side were divided, with the exception of the pyramid which was left
as far as possible intact.
   Other experiments consisted in observing the ways in which con
vulsions, induced by the intravenous injection of the essential oil of
absinthe, were modified by division of one inferior peduncle of the
cerebellnm, by partial hemisection of the medulla in which the
pyramid was the only structure left intact on one side, and by
transverse section of the posterior columns and their nuclei, on one
side, a few millimetres above the calamus scriptorius.
   Considered in conjunction with results previously obtained by the
author and others after ablation of one lateral half of the cerebellum,
and after intracranial section of the auditory nerve, the results now

 200     Dr. Russell.    Phenomena resulting   from Interruption
 obtained afford valuable information with regard to many of the
 functions of the cerebellum ; but they are not claimed as supplying
 definite information on the important question as to whether the
 cerebellum exercises a direct downward influence on the spinal
 centres or not. Many of the results obtained suggest the possibility
 of such a downward influence ; but most of the effects can as readily
 be explained by supposing that they are the result of the interruption
 of afferent impulses passing from the periphery to the cerebellum.
    The direction of rotation was towards the side of the lesion after
 division of one inferior peduncle, or in other words if, as was always
 the case, the left peduncle was divided, the animal rotated like a right
 handed screw entering an object.         The direction of rotation was
 thus the same as after intracranial section of the auditory nerve, and
 the reverse of what results on ablation of one lateral half of the
 cerebellum.    The bulk of the afferent impulses, whose interruption is
 responsible for this phenomenon, probably reach the inferior peduncle
 from the auditory nerve, but that all the impulses are not derived,
 from this source was shown by the fact that lateral section of the
 medulla below the auditory nerve and its nuclei may result in similar
 rotation.
    The disorders of motility which followed division of one inferior
 peduncle corresponded exactly with those observed after ablation of
 one lateral half of the cerebellum.     In view of the results obtained
 by Claude Bernard, and by Mott and Sherrington, as regards im
 pairment of movement after section of sensory spinal roots, it is
suggested that the defects of movement which result from section of
one inferior cerebellar peduncle may be due to the interruption of
such afferent impulses parsing to the cerebellum, rather than to the
cutting off of efferent impulses from the cerebellum to the spinal
centres. The way in which the sensory defects correspond in dis
tribution to the motor, and the fact that recovery of sensory conduc
tion commences before any improvement in motor power can be
detected, are held to support this view.
    Cutting off of some afferent impulses can alone be considered
responsible for the ocular displacements met with.       These displace
ments correspond with those which are the result of ablation of one
lateral half of the cerebellum, the displacement of the globes being
downward and to the opposite side from the lesion.         The displace
ments following lateral section of the medulla were the same; but
after division of the posterior columns and their nuclei on one side,
the displacement of the globes was downward and to the side of the
lesion.
    Spasm, which was easily detected in the back and neck muscles on
the side of the lesion, causing incurvation of the vertebral axis to that
side, alone furnished any satisfactory information in support of the

           of Afferent and Efferent Tracts of   the Cerebellum.      201
possible control which the cerebellum may exert on the spinal centres.
The state of the knee-jerks afforded no satisfactory information on
this point.
    The blunting of sensibility met with is held to be further proof
that the cerebellum is concerned with sensory as well as motor pro-
-cesses, as was contended by the author in a former paper.
    Faradic excitability of the opposite cerebral hemisphere was found
 to be less than of that on the side of the lesion, both when the in
 ferior cerebellar peduncle was divided, and when partial hemisection
 of the medulla was performed, leaving the pyramid intact. The
 most satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon appears to be that
 the removal of some afferent inhibitory influence from one half of
 the cerebellum allows this half of the organ to further inhibit
 the cortex of the opposite cerebral hemisphere ; an explanation in
 keeping with that offered when the results of ablation of the cere
 bellum were under consideration.
    This view is strengthened by the remarkable results obtained by
 the intravenous injection of absinthe in animals in whom the same
 lesions had been previously produced, for with the pyramidal system
 absolutely intact on both sides, there was an entire absence of con
 traction of the muscles of the anterior extremity on the side of the
 lesion, and diminution of contraction of the muscles of the posterior
 extremity on this side, as compared with those of the opposite limb.
 Such was the result obtained when the convulsions were induced
 soon after the lesion, but when induced at some remote period, such
 as three weeks after, the muscles of the anterior extremity on the
 side of the lesion contracted, though the contractions were much less
 powerful than were those of the opposite anterior extremity, and
 ¦were often largely tonic in character.
    Transverse section of the posterior columns, and their nuclei alone
 on one side, did not alter the character of the absinthe convulsions in
 such a remarkable manner as did division of the peduncle and lateral
 section of the medulla.   After such a lesion the muscular contractions
 in the anterior extremity on the side of the lesion were less power
 ful than were those in the opposite anterior extremity, and there was
 more tonus and less clonus than in the contractions on the opposite
 side. Both these characters were evident in the early convulsions of
 a series, but became much more pronounced in the later convulsions.
 The author contents himself with recording these facts, and makes
 no attempt to speculate as to their probable significance.
    The paper is illustrated by tracings obtained of the muscular con
 tractions resulting from excitation of the cerebral cortex with the
 induced current, and from the convulsions evoked by the intravenous
 injection of absinthe, and demonstrate the points alluded to in that
 part of the text which deals with these phenomena.

" The Menstruation and Ovulation of Maeacus rhesus."                      By
      Walter Heape, M.A., Trinity College, Cambridge. Com
      municated by Dr. M. Foster, Sec. R.S. Received June
      15,— Read June 18, 1896.
                               (Abstract.)
   The specimens used in the following investigation were collected
in Calcutta in 1891.
   Anatomy of the Cervix. — A valve-like structure is formed in the
canal of the cervix by means of three strong folds, one of these folds
fits into a recess formed by the two other folds, and forms a valve
which persists throughout life. It is unlike any other structure of
the cervix with which I am acquainted.
   Breeding. — A definite breeding season for Macacus rhesus seems to
be proved, but it is equally certain that in different parts of the
Continent of India the breeding season occurs at different times of
the year.
    Menstruation. — A congestion of the skin of the abdomen, legs, and
tail, a swelling and congestion of the nipples and vulva, and flushing'
of the face, are all prominent external signs of menstruation.             A
 regular menstrual flow occurs consisting of a viscid, stringy, opaque
 white fluid filled with granules, and containing also red blood
 corpuscles, pieces of uterine tissue, both stroma and epithelium, and
 also leucocytes.
    The following classification of the various stages passed through is
 adopted  : —
    A. Period of rest.       Stage I. The resting stage.
    B. Period of growth.     Stage II. The growth of stroma.
                             Stage    III.  The growth of vessels.
    C. Period of degeneration.
                             Stage IV. The breaking down of vessels.
                             Stage V. The formation of lacuuaa.
                             Stage VI. The rupture of lacunas.
                             Stage VII. The formation of the menstrual
                                clot.
    D. Period of recuperation.
                             Stage    VIII.    The recuperation stage.
    The surface of the uterine mucosa, which is smooth and semi-
 transparent during Stage I, becomes swollen and opaque during
 Stage II, and flushed during Stage        III  ; it then becomes highly con
 gested, Stage IV, and dark red spots, due to the formation of lacuna?,
 appear on the surface in Stage V ; when Stage VI is reached, free

           The Menstruation      and Ovulation  of Macacus rhesus.         203
blood is found in the uterine cavity ; the menstrual clot is formed
during Stage VII, and the torn mucosa is healed in the final, Stage
VITI.
    Histology. — The uterus consists of an internal mucosa and external
muscular layers ; the mucosa is composed of uterine and glandular
epithelium, blood vessels, and stroma. The uterine epithelium lines
the surface of the stroma, the glandular epithelium lines pits in the
stroma and is continued into branches of those pits which extend
from their lower end into the deeper part of the stroma.
    The stroma itself is a delicate connective-tissue-like layer ; the
internuclear protoplasm is drawn out into delicate processes which
form a continuous network, and there is no intercellular substance.
    The histological changes which take place during the menstruation
of Macacus rhesus are very similar to those which             I  have already
described in a former paper,         " The Menstruation of Semnopithecus
entellus ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 54, and 'Philosophical Transactions,'
                                               I
vol. 185). Work similar to that which have already described for
 S. entellus has been undertaken for Macacus rhesus, and the phenomena
compared step by step.          While it has been thought advisable to note
the points of similarity and of difference which occur in the menstrua
 tion of these two species, and to point out the fact that the results
arrived at by the study of the menstruation of Macacus rhesus entirely
confirm the results which my examination of jS. entellus led me to
 publish, I have purposely avoided all unnecessary repetition and have
 been obliged in consequence to assume some knowledge of the details
 given in my former papers. It is all the more important to publish
 this account, as the results which I have arrived at differ in some
 important particulars from the accounts of menstruation which have
 been generally       accepted.
     Stage I. — The mucosa of Macacus rhesus is thicker and the proto
           plasmic network denser, the glands more numerous and more
           branched than is the case in S. entellus.    I find no radial fibres.
     Stage II. — There is a great increase, in the number of nuclei by
           amitotic division and fragmentation. Hyperplasia occurs. The
           mucosa becomes much swollen.
     Stage   III.  — The vessels increase in number and size, and they are
           congested.     There is an increase of leucocytes.
     Stage    IV.  — Hypertrophy of the walls of the vessels in the super
           ficial part of the mucosa, followed by degeneration, occurs ;
           the small vessels break down and extravasation of blood takes
            place.    There is no sign of the migration of leucocytes.
     Stage V.   —   Lacunae are formed at first some distance below the
            epithelium, but they gradually displace the intervening       tissue
            and come to lie directly below the uterine epithelium.

204                            Mr. W. Heape.
    Stage VI. — The uterine epithelium degenerates and ruptures, and
           the blood contained in the lacunae is poured into the uterine
           cavity.
    Stage    VII. — Denudation  follows, and the formation of the mucosa
           menstrualis takes   place in the same way and to the same
           extent as in S. enteUus.
    Stage VIII. — The recuperation takes place as in S. entellus.      With
           regard to the new uterine epithelium     I find fresh evidence in
           support   of my contention that   it is formed, not solely from
           epithelial elements which already exist, such as the torn
           edges of glands, bnt also directly from elements of the stroma
           tissue.
    Ovulation in Macacus rhesus. — Only one case has been met with
in which it can possibly be supposed that ovulation and menstruation
have occurred simultaneously ; this is the only case in which a
recently discharged follicle was found in the ovary of a menstruating
Macacus rhesus; it does not follow that ovulation in this case was
brought about by menstruation ; indeed, the absence of any sign of
the recent bursting of a follicle in any other of the seventeen cases
examined is in itself strong presumptive evidence that the two pro
cesses are distinct.
    This result may be confidently asserted for Macacus rhesus during
the non-breeding season ; at the same time it must be remembered
that     I   have not investigated Macacus rhesus during the pairing
season ; probably at that time ovulation may be more frequent, and
 may more often be coincident with menstruation ; but, however that
may be, menstruation occurs in Macacus rhesus regularly with
 out ovulation taking place, and my former views are confirmed,
 namely, that ovulation does not necessarily occur during each men
strual period, and that it is not nacessarily b;"oujj'it           about by
 menstruation.
    I  feel warranted in going further than this and asserting that the
regular occurrence of menstruation without ovulation, even though
 it be in the non-breeding season, is sufficient evidence that ovulation
 is a distinct process, and that it depends upon a law or laws other
 than the laws which govern menstruation.
     The Discharged Follicle. — The changes undergone by the discharged
 follicles of Macacus rhesus during the non-breeding season are of
 interest. Very shortly after rupture the follicle is pear-shaped, and
 the place where rupture took place is to be seen in sections.
     The wall of the follicle is composed of branched cells which, along
 the inner edge of the follicle, are longitu dinally disposed and form a
  denser layer sharply defining the wall f rom the central cavity.
    The cavity contains a network of densely granular material and no
 blood clot.

   Hypertrophy now takes place                  becomes 'much thickened
and folded, and a growth             takes place fronixhe wall into the
                             oi^cel^
cavity of the follicle, the sharpry-a^rkedhb^nd«ry     of the wall is lost,
and the long protoplasmic processes of thecells within the cavity are
continuous with the cells of the wall.
   The vessels of the wall now become enlarged and increased in
number.     Hypertrophy is no longer evident ; the tissue is denser and
shrunken, and the whole structure is reduced in size. Gradually the
cavity of the follicle is also reduced in size, and the tissue .contained
therein becomes denser until it is hardly to be distinguished from
that composing the wall.
   Finally the whole of the cellular remains of the follicle consist of a
comparatively small mass of cells with no trace of the follicle wall
and no central cavity, a nearly solid mass of tissue, in the midst of
which a few blood vessels run. The cells which compose this mass
now scarcely differ from the ovarian stroma cells ; they have gradu
ally undergone the change, and instead of branched cells they now
appear as polyhedral cells or multinucleated polyhedral protoplasmic
masses with intermediate finely branched connective tissue elements
bounding them.
   This structure is surrounded by a layer of fine nucleated fibres ;
but soon these disappear, and the remains of the follicle are no longer
distinguishable from the rest of the ovarian stroma.
   Throughout, no trace of a blood clot within the follicle was seen,
and therein these ruptured follicles differ from what is usually de
scribed as a normal raptured follicle in the human female. This
difference between two animals, both of which undergo menstruation,
is remarkable and worthy of special attention.
   I have some reason to believe the difference may be due to the
presence or absence of the breeding season in monkeys, and to
periods in the human female, which are in the one case favourable,
and in the other case not favourable, to conception.
   If this be true, the period of the human female which is unfavour
able to conception would be comparable to the non-breeding season of
monkeys, and the period favourable to conception with the breeding
season of monkeys.
   It is not maintained that among civilised peoples at the present
day there are definite breeding and non-breeding times, but the com
parison is in harmony with the view that at one period of its exist
ence the human species had a special breeding season.

" The Homogeneity of Helium and of Argon."                              By William
       Ramsay,       Ph.D., F.R.S.,      and           J.   Norman Collie, Ph.D.,
       F.R.S.       Received    July   21, 1896.
                                     Preliminary.
  It   was pointed out by Lord Rayleigh and one of the authors that it
is a legitimate conclusion to draw, from the found ratio between its
specific beat at constant pressure and that at constant volume, that
argon is a monatomic element (' Phil. Trans.,' 1895, A, p. 235). A
similar deduction can be drawn regarding helium (' Chein. Soc.
Trans.,' 1895, p. 699). And as the molecular weight of hydrogen is
accepted as twice its atomic weight, and as the density of helium is
a pproximately    2f and that of argon approximately 20, the molecular
weights of these elements are approximately 4 and 40 respectively.
 If, however, the molecule is identical with the atom, then the atomic
 weights must also necessarily be 4 and 40.
    But argon, with an atomic weight of 40, finds no place in the
periodic table of the elements,      asif, usual, is     contended that the
                                                              it   is
elements must necessarily follow each other in the numerical order of
their atomic weights.
    Certain suppositions may be made which would obviate this diffi
 culty.   First, the evidence from the ratio of the specific heats may
 lead to a false conclusion.     But        inconceivable that any struc
                                             it   is
 ture, except one of the simplest kind, should transform all energy
 communicated to          as heat, into kinetic energy of translation.
                           it
 Still, before a final decision on this point        arrived at,
                                                             is    would be
                                                                         it
 well to actually determine the specific heat of argon, and this will
 shortly be done.     It may, however, be mentioned, that preliminary
 experiments    have   shown    to be much lower than that of hydrogen,
                                it
 air, or carbon dioxide, volume for volume.
     Second, helium and argon may consist of a mixture of monatomic
 with diatomic molecules. The perfectly normal expansion of these
  gases appears to negative this supposition         Phil. Trans.,' loc. tit.,
                                                              ('
  p. 239, and    Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 59, p. 60).    Even at a tempera
                '
  ture of — 88° there appears to be no marked tendency towards
  association. It      true that the ratios of the specific heats do not
                      is
  quite reach the theoretical number T667.          That found for helium
  was 1'652, and that for argon T659, with the most carefully purified
  samples.    Assuming (what there seems good ground to doubt) that
  the last decimal place may be trusted, helium can bo calculated to
  contain nearly     per cent, of diatomic molecules, and argon rather
                     7
  more than     3per cent. If this calculation be permitted, the atomic
  weight of helium would become          02, taking its found density at

                The Homogeneity of Helium and- Argon.               207
2'15, and of argon 38-62.     This would place argon below potassium,
the atomic weight of which is 39-l. However, it most be acknow
ledged that such refinements in calculation are far from trustworthy.
    Third, helium and argon may each consist of a mixture of two
or more elements.      This view has been expressed with regard to
helium by Professors Runge and Paschen (' Sitzungsber. d. Akad. d.
Wissensch.,' Berlin, 1895, pp. 639 and 759), on the ground that the
lines of its spectrum can be shown to belong to two distinct series.
The question whether argon is a mixture or not was discussed in
the memoir by Lord Rayleigh and one of the authors (he. cit.,
p. 236).     It is with this possibility that the present communica
tion has to deal.
    Two methods suggest themselves as suitable in order to ascertain
whether argon and helium are mixtures of two or more elements,
or are single elements.      The first is fractional solution in water ;
the second fractional diffusion.       The second method is obviously
 the better calculated to yield the desired data ; for if these gases
 contain constituents of different density, diffusion is an infallible
 means of separating them.
                   Description of Diffusion Apparatus.
    After a number of trials, the stem of an ordinary tobacco-pipe
 was found to yield the best results. Plaster of Paris is too porous,
 and various forms of graphite tried did not effect so rapid a sepa
 ration of two known gases as nnglazed clay. In fact, nothing
 could have been more satisfactory than this apparatus.
    It consists of a reservoir for the gas, A, into which projects a
 piece of the stem of a tobacco-pipe, B, sealed at the lower end in
 the flame of an oxy-hydrogen blowpipe.          When the stop-cock C
 is open, and   D  and  E shut,  the  gas in  A  must pass through the
 pipe-clay tube on its way to the reservoir of the pump F. The fall
 of the mercury in the tube G, read on the scale H, is timed, about
 8 cm. fall being taken as sufficient for the purpose.      The mercury
 rises in A, and falls in the reservoir   I during the diffusion. When
 the experiment is finished, the gas is pumped out of the reservoir P,
 and collected in tubes similar to that depicted at K, and stored in
 a frame resembling a miniature umbrella-stand.        The Btop-cock D
 is then opened, and the clip L is shut, and the less diffusible portion
 of the gas is pumped out and collected in other tubes, and set apart.
 The purity of the gas is ascertained by means of the vacuum tube M.
 After all gas has been removed, the stop-cocks C and D are shut; a
 new charge of gas is introduced at N, the stop-cock E being opened,
 and the operation repeated. After a sufficient amount of the first
 diffusate has been collected, it is again introduced into the reservoir
  A, and the process repeated.
                                                               K 2

                            L
   When towards the end only a small amount of gas is available,
the process may be modified by raising the reservoir I, and so dimi
nishing the volume of A. The clip L is then closed, and the gas is
allowed to diffuse as before, but the volume in A is kept constant.
The rate of diffusion can be compared with that of hydrogen under
precisely similar circumstances.
   In all the experiments the temperature did not alter by more than
a degree or two ; as the object was to effect a separation, and not to
make accurate determinations of the rates of diffusion of gases,
careful regulation of temperature was unnecessary.
    Determination of tlie Ratios of Diffusion of Gases of known Purity.
                   —
    (o) Hydrogen. The time required for the column of mercury in H
           to sink through 8 centimetres, starting always from the
           same level, was found in three experiments to be (1) 433",
            (2) 420", and (3) 437" ; the mean is 430". The average

           average rate per millimetre of 21-49".
   (c) Acetylene.
                    — The gas was prepared from pure calcium            carbide
           by the action of water. It dissolved completely in          alcohol.
           The time required for diffusion was 1550", giving a         rate per
           millimetre of 19-37".
   Assuming the times for the diffusion of these gases to              be pro
portional to the square roots of their densities, we have —
                            5-37"    x yi6 = 21-39".

   This process may therefore be trusted to give fairly accurate
results when applied to test the rates of diffusion of gases of known
purity.
                    The Separation of a Mixture of     Gases.
   To ascertain whether       a  separation could be easily effected, experi
ments were made (a)        on a mixture      of oxygen and carbon dioxide,
and (6) on a mixture of hydrogen and helium.
   (a) Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide. — The original mixture contained
36 per cent, by volume of carbon dioxide.             It was split into two
approximately equal portions ; each of these was again split into
two. The most diffusible part contained 30'2 per cent, of carbon
dioxide, and the least diffusible part 41 0 per cent.
   (i>) Hydrogen and Helium.
                                     — The original mixture contained 50 per
cent, of each gas, and its volume was 38 c.c.            19 c.c. were diffused ;
this was again halved, 9-5 c.c. being passed through the pipe ; and
finally another diffusion of the 9-5 c.c. yielded 4'12 c.c. of mixed
gases.    The hydrogen was removed by explosion with oxygen.
This mixture now consisted of 67 per cent, of hydrogen and 33 per
cent, of helium.
   From these experiments it is seen that a partial separation of such
gases is easily carried out.
                      The Fractional Diffusion of Argon,.
   Four hundred c.c. of argon, newly circulated over red-hot magne
sium until spectroscopic traces of nitrogen were carefully removed,
was diffused according to the subjoined scheme         : —

210            Drs. VV. Ramsay and       J.  Norman Collie.
                  More diffusible.    I       Lets diffusible.
               (o) Density 19 93.          (J) Density  20-01.
   The densities were determined by weighing.
   These numbers show that no important separation has been
effected.   The difference in density of the two portions may possibly
be attributed to experimental error. When the density of the heavier
portion was taken the weather was damp, and we have found it difficult
to obtain concordant results under such circumstances, owing doubt
less to the uneven deposition of moisture on the surfaces of the bulb
and its counterpoise. But as it stands, tho difference is an extremely
minute one, and it may, we think, be taken that any separation of
argon, if effected at all, is very imperfect.
                   The Fractional Diffusion of Helium.
   Two hundred c.c. of helium from fergusonite of density 2'13 were
separated into two nearly equal portions by diffusion.          The rate of
diffusion was 7-14" per millimetre as a mean of two experiments,
giving 7-13" and 7-15" respectively. The most diffusible portion of
this gas gave the rate 7-12" per millimetre.            The more diffusible
half of this gas had the rate 7,48", and the least diffusible of the
remainder 7"38", the temperature being lower. A second specimen
of helium from mixed sources, samarskite, fergusonite, broggerite, Ac.,
which showed the nitrogen spectrum strongly, gave a rate for the
first portion of 8'29". This half on rediffusion had the rate 7'64",
and the residue of 8'39", showing that a separation was being effected.
The heavier residue of the remainder from that portion which
showed the rate 8-39" was too small to make it possible to diffuse it
by the usual method. A second method was therefore resorted to,
and it was directly compared with hydrogen under the same circum
stances.    While hydrogen took 12-14" per millimetre, the residue
took 2r00", and calculating its density from these rates, we have —

This would correspond, if it be granted that the impurity is nitro

with oxygen in presence of soda, until the spectrum attested its
absence.     (It will be remembered that 0-01 per cent, of nitrogen is still
visible nnder moderate pressures, ' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 59, p. 265.)
The rate was again measured against that of hydrogen under pre
cisely similar conditions, and it was found that while hydrogen took
20"00" for diffusion, this specimen of helium took28"28".           And calcu
lation shows its density to be now 2'015.
   These experiments were sufficient to show, we think, that while it is
possible to separate nitrogen from helium, even although the former
is present in only small amount, we had not succeeded in separating
helium itself into two portions of different densities.               If, then,
helium were a mixture,      its constitutents must   possess nearly the same
density.      In do case was any alteration of the spectrum to be
noticed ; the diffusate and the residue were similar, and showed all
the well known lines of helium with the usual intensity.
   But it was deemed advisable, in view of the importance of the matter,
to undertake a much more elaborate set of experiments.             The helium
was carefully purified      from   hydrogen    and  nitrogen by circulation
over magnesium, copper oxide, phosphorus pentoxide, and soda lime,
until a small quantity admitted into a vacuum tube in connection
with the circulating apparatus showed no spectrum either of hydro
gen or nitrogen, even at a comparatively high pressure, when these
gases are more easily detected.        The helium was then fractionated in
a, manner exactly similar to that shown in the graphic             scheme for
argon (p. 210). The rates of diffusion of the two samples of gas
were then measured.

   The less diffusible portion was next subjected to the process of
removing     nine-tenths,  the remaining tenth being collected apart.
This process was repeated three times, so that any portion of gas less
diffusible than the main bulk should thus be left as a residue. From
the more diffusible portion nine-tenths was also diffused out. The
more diffusible portions were then mixed, and the density was again
determined.

   This number is practically identical with that previously obtained,
viz., 2 049.
   It was of interest to follow the less diffusible gas, so as to ascertain
what impurity caused its higher density.        Another set of fractiona
tions was therefore carried out, and after five separate processes,
in each of which a residue was left, and that residue further diffused,
so as to separate all light gas as completely as possible, a few c.c.
of gas were collected, in which the spectrum of argon was strong.
Now we are certain that at no stage in the operations was any con
siderable quantity of air admitted by leakage. It may safely be said
that the total amount of air could never have exceeded 5 c.c. And
inasmuch as the density of samples of helium from various sources,
which had undergone very little handling, differed by small amounts,
varying between 2-114 and 2'181, this must be ascribed to contami
nation with argon, contained in the mineral from which the helium
had been obtained.       Every effort was made to detect any unknown
lines in the spectrum of the residue, but in vain.        With the jar and
spark-gap,   the blue  spectrum   of argon was  visible, and  was compared
with that from a standard tube.
   If thus the increased density is due to argon, it is possible to calcu
late the proportion of the latter ; first, in the lightest gas of density
2-117 found in samarskite; second, in the residue in which the argon
had been concentrated, possessing the density 2'452, on the assump
tion that helium possesses the density 2'042. The first must contain
0-42 per cent, of argon ; the second, 2-28 per cent.

                The Homogeneity of Helium and Argon.
   The rate of diffusion of the gas of density 2*057 was determined
finally, so as to afford a check on its density. It took 657-9" for a
quantity to diffuse ; while the same volume of hydrogen under pre
cisely similar circumstances took 492*3".     Reducing these numbers
to density, if hydrogen be taken as 1*0082, the helium possesses the
density 1*801, which compares very favonrably with the number
already found, 1*826.
   As a final check on these results, a sample of helium from an
entirely different source, samarskite, was so diffused, that first nine-
tenths were removed by diffusion ; from the residue nine-tenths was
again removed, and the process was repeated a third time.             The
more diffusible portion was tested as regards rate; while hydrogen
took 492*3" to diffuse, this sample took 652'6".       Stated as density,
the number is 1*771.
   The actual density was next determined, with the following
result : —
             Volume of globe                   162*843 c.c.
             Pressure at filling               691*6 mm.

              Density                          2*080
   This number closely coincides with the density of the previous
specimen, freed from argon by diffusion ; and in this case it must be
remembered, no systematic process for separating two possible con
stituents was carried out, but the heavier portion only was removed.
The heavier gas separated by diffusion was examined for argon, and
it was possible to see the green group of five lines, but not the red
lines.   And with a jar and spark-gap, argon could just be detected.
   The rate of diffusion of this gas, which, stated as density, gives the
number 1*8, differs from the density determined by weighing, viz.,
2 08, or thereabouts.    This might be caused (1) by a lighter portion
passing over first during diffusion, leaving a heavier portion behind ;
or (2) by the hypothesis that the rate of diffusion of helium is ab
normal ; and helium has already shown such very remarkable pro
perties in relation to refractivity for light, and conductivity for
electricity, that the hypothesis is not unwarrantable.           The first
supposition,   however,  is the  more probable,  and  was  put to the test
in the following manner.
   A smaller apparatus was made for measuring the rate of diffusion
of 10 to 20 c.c. of gas ; and the rates of the sample of density 2*08,
and of the less diffusible residues from this sample were determined.
Both the hydrogen and the helium were carefully measured and
diffused under precisely similar conditions.    While the hydrogen took
181" to diffuse, the helium of density 2*08 took 246*6", implying a

214              Drs. W. Ramsay and      J. Norman Collie.
 density of 1-871 ; and the residue diffused in 266"6", which corre
sponds to a density of 2*187. In each of these experiments about
 half the helium passed through the porous plug.
    The denser portion of this gas was again diffused five times, lighter
portions being removed. This corresponds to a residue of 30 c.c.
from 400 c.c. of the original gas. The rate of diffusion of this sample
compared with that of hydrogen was almost identical with the last,
namely 208" to 143", and corresponds to a density of 2"133. The
gas is therefore not increased in density by this process.
    The lighter gas was submitted to a similar fractionation, and the
ratio of its diffusion-rate to that of hydrogen was 246 75" to 1810",
as a mean of several closely concordant experiments.           This corres
ponds to a density of T874.        We have accordingly : —
                                                      Density.

                     Light " portion                   1'874
    Not content with this, we pushed fractionation still further ; the
helium was divided into seven portions (by fractionation) and then
submitted to methodical fractional diffusion, in which the heavier
portions were transferred to the
                                        " denser " side, and the lighter
                    "        "
portions to the lighter side. This process was repeated four times,
and the end portions were each divided into two ; the lighter portion
of the " lighter " was collected separately, and its rate determined.
It took 258"5" to diffuse, compared with 189-5" for an equal volume of
hydrogen ; its density calculated from these rates was 1"876. It is
clear, therefore, that the limit has been reached in purifying the
lighter portion by diffusion.
    It should have been mentioned that the portion of 2-133 density as
well as that of 1 874 density had been sparked with oxygen in
presence of potash, and in a vacuum tube showed mere traces of
hydrogen, every other gas being absent.       The spectrum of hydrogen
is still visible, even when 0'01 per cent, of that gas is present.
    At various times during the attempt to separate helium, the spec
trum has been carefully examined.          The very first portions of the
lightest gas gave an identical spectrum, seen with a hand-spectro
scope, with the very last portions of the heaviest gas. Professor Ames,
of the Johns Hopkins University, has however kindly undertaken to
photograph the spectra using a dispersion-grating ; so that if any
difference can be detected, it will ere long bo made known.
    Lord Rayleigh was so kind as to measure the refractivity of these
extreme portions of the fractionated gas.          His process has been
                       '
 described in the Proceedings,' vol. 59, p. 202. For the sample of
 helium sent him in July, 1895, he found the number 0-146.             The
 lighter portion of the fractionated gas of density 1'876 had a refrac

                                 Conclusion.
   It  must be remarked that the rate of diffusion of helium is too
rapid for its density measured by weighing.       There can be no doubt,
we think, that the density of the lighter portion, instead of being
1874, would be, if actually weighed, 2 05 or 2-08. And the heavier
portion has doubtless a proportionately higher density.       But, assum
ing that the densities calculated from the diffusion-rates are correct,
the densities of the two gases, supposing that two exist, are 1-871.
and 2*133, respectively.
   Also, we must not omit to state that careful experiments were made
with the more rapidly diffusing gas to prove that the first portions
passing over did not diffuse at a more rapid rate than the later por
tions, no difference in diffusion rates, compared with those of hydrogen
under the same circumstances having been detected.
   That helium, then, consists of a mixture of two or more distinct
gases is one solution of the problem, probably the one which recom
mends itself at first sight.      But there is another, so revolutionary
in its character that much must be done before it can be regarded
as even worthy to be entertained.        So much has, however, been lost
to science by what may be termed scientific incredulity, that we
regard it as well worth putting to a rigorous proof.
   It is that a separation has been effected of light molecules from
heavy molecules ; that, in fact, a gas — in this case helium — is not
constituted entirely of molecules of the same weight, but that the
mixture of molecules which we term helium have weights which
average 2"18, or whatever the density of ordinary undiffused helium
may ultimately be found to be. The same supposition would, of
course, be applicable to oxygen, nitrogen, or any gas. In separating
Bnch molecules from each other a practical limit must necessarily be
 reached, and this limit appears to have been reached with helium.
   There is negative and positive probability in favour of this sug
gestion. First, no gas has been submitted to methodical diffusion
with a view to effect such a separation, argon excepted ; and here,
too, there is faint evidence of a similar kind.    It is proposed to carry
out similar experiments with gases of undoubted homogeneity
according to the usual views ; and till such experiments have been
made, it is impossible to decide the point definitely.
   Second, Mr. E. C. C. Baly's experiments on oxygen appear to

216        Prof. W. N. Hai-tley.            On the Spectrum     of  Cyanogen
point to a similar conclusion          ; although no great alteration in density
has been produced, yet there is a sign that a kind of separation is
being effected electrically.           There is also in favour of the supposi
tion the unlikelihood that two or more gases, so like one another as
the constituents of helium, should exist with densities so near each
other ; and the probability that some separation should have been
detected by aid of the spectroscope.
    Lastly, the refractivities of both gases, if there be two, appear
to be equally abnormal ; now, different gases have different refrac
tivities in no known relation to their densities, as, for example,
hydrogen Oo, oxygen nearly I.                 Bnt the refractivities of the dif
ferent portions of helium are proportional                   to their densities ; a
statement which is true of any one gas, inasmuch as refractivity is
directly proportional to pressure, i.e., mass in unit volume. The
refractivity of helium, also, is so small that it totally differs in this
respect, as, indeed, it does in most of its physical properties from
every other gas, and it is moreover a monatomic gas.                   Tt is therefore
permissible to seek for an explanation of its remarkable properties in
framing any hypothesis which admits of being put to the test.

     The Production of Cyanogen, in the Electric Arc. — The very careful
 and numerous experiments of Liveing and Dewar* have very
 generally been accepted as affording evidence sufficient to establish
 the existence of an emission spectrum of cyanogen as distinct from
 that of carbon in the electric arc. Kayser and Runge,f though at
 first disinclined to accept such a conclusion, obtained additional
 evidence by experimenting with the arc in air, and in carbon dioxide.
 They found that the ordinary carbon spectrum and that of cyanogen
 appeared with rapidity alternately in the arc in air, though there
 could be no difference in temperature sufficient to account for the
 production of two different carbon spectra. With the poles immersed
 in carbon dioxide no such changes were seen, the carbon spectrum
  alone being visible, which evidence led them to concur in the views
  of Liveing and Dewar.             The chief evidence of the existence of a
  cyanogen spectrum rests on the fact that this substance is actually
 synthesised in the arc when nitrogen is present, and because without

nitrogen, elementary carbon does not yield the same spectrum, no
matter what the temperature may be ; and lastly, that cyanogen gas
bams with a flame of which the banded spectrum is known as that
uf cyanogen by reason of the foregoing facts. Furthermore,                             I  have
found by recent experiments that when a condensed spark is passed
between electrodes of gold in an atmosphere of cyanogen, the same
spectrum is photographed.
    If  we admit that under conditions              favourable to synthesis from its
elements, cyanogen is capable of emitting a spectrum of its own, this
emission should occur only at the moment of its formation, but while
giving consideration to this view we are met by the difficulty that
the flame of cyanogen burning in oxygen would less probably emit
a spectrum of the compound substance itself, which is being burnt,
than a spectrum of the products of its combustion, or of the
separated elements of which it is composed, which are nitrogen and
carbon ; and for this reason, that the process it is passing through is
 not a synthetical but an analytical one.                   Indeed it has been shown
 by Liveing        and   Dewar*   that  when    cyanogen is exploded with oxygen
 it gives a bright continuous spectrum, but no cyanogen spectrum, or
 carbon bands, or carbon lines.

   By the combustion of ammonia in oxygen, water vapour lines are
produced, and new bands and groups of lines attributed by Eder and
Valenta to ammonia. Some of these are, however, due to a compound
other than ammonia.
   It will be observed that compounds during combustion as a rule
show the spectra of one or other of their constituents, or of both. In
the case of hydrogen compounds they show the product of the com
bustion of hydrogen, which is a substance of great stability, and can
therefore exist at a high temperature.
   In the nitric oxide and carbon disulphide spectrum, the sulphur
bands, which are very strong, probably obscure those of carboD.
There is a strong continuous band of rays which would likewise serve
to obscure them.
   C. Bohn* has examined the spectra seen in a Bunsen burner of the
form devised by Teclut (which is simply a modification of that
described by Smithells), and compared the spectra with that obtained
by Swan, and with the discharge in Geissler tubes containing various
hydrocarbon gases. He concludes that it is impossible to define a carbon
band spectrum, as the differences observed were greater than could
be accounted for by alterations in temperature and pressure.                       He
also states      that    sulphur, hydrogen,         and    carbon  disulphide,    also
carbon monoxide, were burnt, but that all these flames yielded con
tinuous spectra. This statement is incorrect, or at least inaccurate.                J
Bohn's observations were evidently made on too limited a region of
the spectrum, and without the aid of photography.                  On Bohn's paper
Eder has made some observations, quoting both his measurements
in the visible and ultra-violet spectrum, which he observes must have
been unknown to Bohn.§
   He describes in what manner and by what causes the edges of the
carbon bands are altered in position or in character.
   The observations of Eder on the spectra of hydrocarbon flames are
quite in agreement with those previously communicated by me to the
Royal Society on the oxyhydrogen flame spectrum and the oxy-coal
gas spectrum.

   Though      it is now     accepted   as a fact that the arc in air yields the

with those seen in the arc ; second, that these bands cannot be due to
the effect of an alteration in temperature, giving rise to a second
spectrum of carbon ; nevertheless, as I have elsewhere pointed out,*
cyanides in a condensed spark do not produce this spectrum, no
matter whether they are extremely stable cyanides, such as that of
potassium, or those of the most easily decomposable character, such
as mercuric cyanide.           This appeared to me to mark the inadequacy
of the facts derived solely from observations on the arc, to establish
the existence of a definite cyanogen spectrum.                 Moreover, it was
shown that lines somewhat resembling the edges of cyanogen bands
are seen when graphite poles are moistened with water and the
spark is passed through air ; these lines are intensified and developer!
into bands when the water contains ammonium chloride, calcium
chloride, or zinc chloride, and the bands become stronger as the solu
tion used -is more concentrated.
   If the lines observed are the edges of bands belonging to the
cyanogen spectrum, by what means do the chlorides give rise to their
production ? No one has yet supplied the answer to this question,
neither has it been proved that these lines in the spectrum of graphite
are the edges of cyanogen bands, though Ederf and Valenta state
that they are such because the wave-length measurements are
approximately the same.
   I believe that     I   am now able to offer an explanation of the action
of the concentrated solutions of chlorides, and to prove in addition,
that the bands and lines are really due to cyanogen and not to ele
mentary carbon.
   If hydrochloric or any other mineral acid be carefully tested, it is
found to contain ammonia.             The only ammonia- free acid is sulphur
ous acid freshly prepared by passing sulphur dioxide gas into water,
carefully freed from ammonia and from any possible contamination
with it. If from the usual samples of so-called pure mineral acids,
salts of calcium or zinc be prepared, the ammonia salt present is not
eliminated, but it goes into solntion and crystallises out with such
calcium or zinc compound, or, if the salt does not crystallise, it
remains in solution, and, as a consequence, the salt will show in its
solntion the effect of a larger proportion of ammonium salt, accord
ing to its degree of concentration. Hence if the bands, said to be
cyanogen bands, are due to the nitrogen of the ammonia present, the
spectrum of the graphite poles will exhibit the bands more strongly,
as there is less water in the solution.           But this does not account for

the fact tbat the spark does not show the cyanogen bands when
cyanides are submitted to its action. In this case it is possible that
the temperature is too high, and that the cyanogen is decomposed,
possibly by oxidation, for there can be no doubt that such condensed
sparks are at a higher temperature than that of the arc. We know,
too, that several metals are oxidised when volatilised in the spark, if
not entirely at least partially.*            But by using gold electrodes with
the cyanides we do not obtain even a carbon spectrum.
   Here again, possibly, the carbon is oxidised, and we know that
carbon dioxide in carbonates yields no spectrum of carbon, nor any
lines peculiar to carbon dioxide.
   I   have sought in every direction for a reasonable explanation of
that which, up to the present, has proved inexplicable, in order that
by working on some hypothesis one might devise a means of putting
the matter to experimental proof.               This has now been accomplished
in the following manner.
   An almost saturated solution of pure crystallised potassium
cyanide was put into a tube fitted with graphite electrodes in the
manner described in a previous communication.f
   The apparatus was fitted into a horizontal wooden tube with a
window of quartz at one end, and carbon dioxide was passed into the
tube until filled.       The spark was then passed for five minutes, and
again for ten minutes, a photograph being taken of the two spectra.
The instrument used gave a dispersion equal to four quartz prisms.
 A glass tube with a similar window of quartz was fitted with gold
electrodes and filled with cyanogen gas, and another spectrum was
photographed.         A fourth spectrum was then obtained by passing
cyanogen into the wooden tube containing the graphite electrodes ;
after the carbon dioxide had been expelled by air and replaced by
cyanogen, the      \J  -tube was filled up with the solution of potassium
cyanide.       In all four cases the principal group of the cyanogen
bands was obtained, but it was not very strong.                A flame of cyano
gen   was   then  photographed        with   exposures varying from one to two,
five, and ten minutes.          A beautiful series of spectra was obtained,
and the lines belonging to the edges of bands constituting the prin
cipal group were found to coincide exactly with those photographed
from the potassium cyanide solution when the spark was passed in an
atmosphere of carbon dioxide and in cyanogen, also when the spark
 was passed between gold electrodes in cyanogen.                  These appear to
be the bands referred to by Eder and Valenta, which were described
as carbon bands% when graphite electrodes were used with the spark

in air.   From the modification of their appearance, and the measure
ments originally made from them, their identity was not quite
apparent, although probable.
   It thus appears that, with the spark, the cyanogen spectrum is
nothing like so strongly marked, as is the case with the flame of the
gas, only one group of bands being represented, and that when the
spectrum is taken in air the cyanogen does not appear, because in
all probability the substance is oxidised.
   I  have already stated that the formation of cyanogen which yields
the characteristic  spectrum is a synthetical operation, that compound
substances, when burnt in flames, do not, as a rule, emit the spec
trum of the compound, but the spectrum of one or more of the
elements of which it is composed, or that of one or other of its
products of combustion.
   How then are we to account for the cyanogen spectrum in the
flame of burning cyanogen ?
   The conditions under which combustion takes place are these :
there is an excess of the gas, the temperature of the flame is exceed
ingly high, and the gas within it is not in contact with a solid sub
stance, heuce immediate decomposition does not occur, and the
gaseons compound is heated to incandescence.

   The following measurements were undertaken at the proposal of
Professor W. F. R. Weldon, and to him I am greatly indebted for
many suggestions, and for the kindly help he has always so readily
given me.
   The crabs were obtained from the Biological Station at Plymouth,
and sent at intervals during a period of about two years, dating from
the autumn of 1893.       Only males were measured.      Seven measure
ments were made on each individual, corresponding to those made by
Professor Weldon on the female of Carcinm moenas (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
vol. 54).

    The total number of crabs measured was 2300. The determina
tions were made with compasses and a 3-decimetre ivory scale divided
into half millimetres.         The measurements were recorded to the tenth
of a millimetre.        As a test of accuracy, fifty crabs were indiscrimi
nately taken out of a large number which had previously been
measured ; these were remeasured, and the results compared with
those before obtained. It was found that the mean difference between
any two measures of the same dimension was 0'107 mm.

 Continuous   outline represents a crab with carapace length AB = 28 5 mm. Dotted
            outline represents a crab with carapace length AB = 46 8 mm.
     Since the crabs were growing, and so varied much in size, it was
 necessary to reduce the measures to percentages of some standard
 dimension. The carapace length (AB) was selected, and all the
 measurements are expressed as thousandths of this dimension.
     The first point to ascertain is whether the mean of the different
 "           " varied as the crab increased in size.

 this, the crabs were sorted into groups, according to the length
 of their standard dimension, then the arithmetic mean was found
 for the remaining six dimensions.                 In each group the change
  in length of carapace was comparatively small, and had to be
 neglected.       The following table gives the results which were thus
 obtained : —

224                             Mr. E. Warren.
   As an example we may take the total breadth. Here the observed
range of variation is from 1370 to 1227 thousandths of the standard.
The unit of deviation employed is 0'004 of the carapace length ; thus,
with this unit the range of deviation in the total breadth is expressed
by the number 36. The crabs varied in absolute length of the
standard from 20"0 — 48*6 mm., and in the fourteen groups the
means are expressed in thousandths of carapace length, but the
errors of mean square and all the constants that will hereafter be
given are expressed in terms of the above unit of deviation.
    The length of the standard is taken as a criterion of age ; this
may, of course, be only roughly true, and it seems quite possible that
the somewhat large fluctuations which are observed in the means are
 due to the groups being in reality slightly heterogeneous by including
crabs of somewhat different ages.
    On glancing down the means of the several dimensions, it will be
seen that a state of equilibrium is nowhere reached except perhaps
in the case of the total breadth; thus, throughout life the crab is
gradually changing its shape.            This species, like the closely allied
 Garcinus moenas, is probably sexually mature when only some 20 —
;?0 mm. long ;* hence, when all its organs are in a rapid state of
change the crab can propagate its species.            Here is an argument, so
it would seem, against the transmission of acquired characters, for
otherwise the earlier broods would tend to have a somewhat different
shape to the later ones, and this is scarcely probable.           To illustrate
this change in shape fig. 1 was prepared.             The continuous outline
represents a crab with carapace length          =  28"5 mm. ; the broken out
line is the same crab when it has grown to 46-8 mm. ; the angle
CAC opens out by about a degree. This, of course, is only true on
the supposition that natural selection has not occnrred with respect to
these dimensions.       The error of mean square of each group is given
in the columns to the right of the means. This constant we take as
a measure of the variability of an organ, and in no case is there a
distinct tendency for it to diminish as we pass down to the groups
containing the older crabs, while in the dentary margins there is an
obvious increase.       Hence, at the present period iu the life of the
species we have no evidence of selective destruction with regard to
the dimensions here discussed. It is possible, however, that all the
dimensions are really more variable as the crab grows older, but that
this greater variability is concealed by the action of natural selection
in all cases except in the dentary margins.
    We will now treat each organ separately.
    Total Breadth. — On referring to the table, it will be seen that
groups 4— 14 have means which remain fairly steady, and show
   * This point is now being investigated.  Female Carcinus occurs in berry when
only some 20 mm. long.

Variation in Portunus depurator. 225
226                            Mr. E. Warren.
no marked tendency either to rise or fall. With these 1923 indi
viduals a cnrve of frequency was drawn (fig. 2). Its constants
were calculated by the method employed by Professor Karl Pearson
(' Phil. Trans.,' vol. 186). Range of variation = 1227—1370 thou
sandths of standard, unit of deviation is 0'004 of carapace length ;
therefore the observed range = 36 units, reckoning from 1227
upwards.
   Centroid vertical (= position of arithmetic mean) = 19-102964.
   The second moment about the centroid (/»,) = 26"400476.
   Standard deviation (error of mean square), a = y/fi, = 5138139.
   Third moment (^) = 0 681766.
   Fourth moment (/u) = 2203 762099.
   ft, which is          = 0-000025 ; ft = n,/^1 = 3161849.
   The critical function 2ft— 3ft— 6 = 0 323623 is positive, and so the
theoretical curve has an nnlimited range.
   Professor Pearson's measure of skewness for a curve of unlimited
range is given by the formula
                    1
                           r— 2
                       Vft r + 2 where  r _ e(ft-ft-i)
                                             2ft-3ft-6
Here   r=   40 0804] 4 and skewness    = 0 002262. It     is clear from the
values of the constants that the generalised probability curve would
not differ perceptibly from the symmetrical normal curve, where
ft = 0 and ft = 3.
   The areal deviation of the curve of observation from the normal
curve is only 5-l per cent, of the whole area.
   Frontal Breadth. — It will be seen from the table that throughout
the life of the crab the mean of this dimension falls steadily ; as the
crab grows the forehead becomes relatively shorter.         On this account
it is difficult to obtain a satisfactory idea of the distribution of devia
tions. The means of groups 6 — 7 do not differ widely, and so with
these the constants of variation were calculated. The observed range
throughout the whole series was 640 — 795 thousandths of standard,
and so .there are 39 of our units of deviation.      The range in groups
6 — 7 (including 460 crabs) was 648 — 747 thousandths, that is, 25
units.
            Centroid   =  13-791305.            ^ =   11-236156.
                    ff =   3-352036.            fit =   2800794.
                               f* = 442-572048.
                   ft =    0 005529.             ft =   3-505490.
                     r=   15084346.       Skewness =    0 02845.
Here again the critical function 2ft— 3ft— 6 =        0-994393    is positive

                        Variation in Portunus depurator.                               227
and so the generalised           probability curve would be one of unlimited
range.
  B. Antero-lateral. — The mean fluctuates considerably in the different
groups, but there is a slight tendency to fall.     Omitting the first
group as being too small, it will be seen the mean falls about one
unit in the whole series.
  Range of deviation = 732 — 831 thousandths of standard, giving
25 units of variation.   We select groups 6 — 12 (1432 individuals) for
forming a frequency curve. Here the range = 736 — 819 thousandths,
giving   21   units.                                                               <

228                            Mr. E. Warren.
   The critical function 2ft— 3ft— 6 =— 0'087561 is negative, and so
the theoretical cnrve has a limited range.         The calculated range was
71*313123 units, and the observed range 21 units          ; thus they differed
very widely.     The    range   on  the positive   side   of  the origin was
31*658658, and on the negative side 39-654465.               As the frequency
curve is very symmetrical, Professor Pearson's generalised curve with
limited range and symmetry was taken,
                             V  = 2/o(l-»7a!)"»
where        y0  = 186357143.                    a = 35-656561.
                               m = 66048343.
The distance of maximum ordinate from centroid vertical              is 0*0596,
and this could not be indicated on the scale of diagram.            Both this
and the normal curve are drawn over the curve of observation
(fig. 3). The generalised curve differs exceedingly little from the
normal one, the areal deviations in the two cases being 7*7 and 7*5
per cent, respectively.
   The flat top to the frequency curve made it at first seem prob
able that the curve was really the resultant of two normal ones.
It was attempted to resolve it into its constituents by means of Pro
fessor   Pearson's equation of the ninth degree (' Phil. Trans.,'
vol. 185). There were three real roots to the equation; two gave
quite inappropriate solutions; the third gave a negative group of
sixty crabs (with standard deviation = 1*450), having its maximum
ordinate situated at —1*337 from the centroid, and a positive group of
 1492 crabs (standard deviation = 3*012), with maximum ordinate at
 — 0*0540. The selection of crabs so close to the mean would scarcely
seem to correspond to any natural phenomenon, and the resultant
 curve, which was the difference of the two normal curves, fitted the
 curve of observation but very little better than the normal or skew
 curve in fig. 3, the areal deviation being 7*0 per cent.
    L. Antero-lateral. — Here the range of the mean is somewhat larger
 than on the right side, being about 1£ units. The range of deviation
 in the whole series is 720-1-823 thonsaudths. A frequency curve was
 drawn (fig. 4) with groups 6 — 12, where the range was 724 — 819
 thousandths, giving 24 units.

   The critical function 2fa—3fa — 6= —0 001426.    From this we
see that the theoretical curve has a limited range but this range          ;
would be enormous, and the curve would closely resemble a normal
curve.
   Correlation     the Organs. — Out of the six organs discussed, the
                  of
frequency curves of three of them (total breadth, frontal breadth, and
L. antero-lateral) give theoretical curves of unlimited range, while
the other three (R. antero-lateral, R. and L. dentary margins) give
curves of limited range. In every case the amount of skewness                                     is
small, and the diagrams show that the generalised probability curves
do not give very obviously better fits than the normal curve.        The
fact of the R. antero-lateral giving a strictly limited range while the
L. antero-lateral gives an unlimited one, demonstrates that little stress
can be placed upon the type of curve which a series of observations
may yield.
  In   thepresent case the curves would appear to be sufficiently
normal to allow us to find Galton's function (known as  for pairs of           r)
organs. For this purpose we shall employ the modified formula
                    r       =

  where     n  = number of individuals, and ak and <rB are the standard
 deviations of organs A and B respectively. This formula has recently
 been shown by Professor Pearson to be superior to the one formerly
 used (' Phil. Trans.,' vol. 187).
   The correlation surfaces are published as being of permanent value,
and it is believed that such material as this will be of use in the
future in elaborating or modifying the current theory of correlation.

Dotted line is the r line inclined to axis x at tan-1 0-80. The continuous line join
   ing the crosses is the line found on taking the R. antero-lat. as subject.    The
   circles indicate the points obtained    when   the R. dentary is the subject. The
   probable errors of the dimensions are represented by intervals, 1, 2, 3, &c, on
   both horizontal and vertical scales.
taking one dimension as the subject and the other as the relative, then
for every unit of deviation of the subject the mean of the associated
values    of the relative was found.         The values of the subject and the
associated mean values of the relative are expressed in terms of
their probable errors, and plotted along the axes of y and x respec
tively.     The points indicated by circles were obtained by reversing
the positions of subject and relative.
    It is clear that the crosses and circles do tend to lie along a line

inclined at tan-1 r to the axis of x. The ends of the lines are irre
gular on account of the impossibility of obtaining a satisfactoryjmean
to the relative at these points because of the paucity of individuals
near the limits of the range of deviation. One sees that, in these two
cases at least, the correlation      surfaces must closely approximate to the
symmetrical normal surface.

   In the above table the 2nd and 4th columns give the values of
Galton's functions which Professor Weldon found for two races of
female Carcinus moenas ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 54). The sixth
column gives the values of r obtained for Portunus.
   It is quite obvious that there is a marked similarity between the
three columns of figures. The probable errors of r were found by
                             1— i*
the formula 0'6745                  =, which Professor      Pearson    shows    will
give a close approximation (' Phil. Trans.,' vol. 187). These probable
errors were added to indicate bow far the differences in the values of
r are to be regarded as meaning actual deviations in the constants.
The values obtained for the two races of Carcinus differ from one
another nearly as much as they do from the constants of Portunus.
   We have thus proved that the mutual relationships of the organs
measured are almost as closely similar between the two genera Portu

                            Mr. E. Warren.
nus and Carcinus as between two not very sharply marked off races
of a single species.
   Of course a considerable number of such comparisons would be
necessary before any safe conclusions could be drawn, and the mean
ing of the differences observed could only be discovered by such a
comparative treatment of a large series of genera. It is probable
that the larger deviations do indicate real differences in the correla
tion constant, possibly such are associated with changes in habit or
environment.    For example, it is conceivable that a crab which
swims might require to be more symmetrical than one that only
crawls between the tide-marks.       Portunus does swim to a certain
extent, and one can see from the table that the correlation of the two
sides of the body is greater in this genus than in the essentially shore-
living Carcinus moenas.

                                  (Abstract.)
                                 Introduction.
    The following researches -were carried out in consequence of sug
gestions made to me by Professor Victor Horsley, F.R.S., -with the
view of throwing light upon the degree to which certain movements,
or, speaking more precisely, sensori-motor (kinesthetic) phenomena
are represented in any given segment of the lumbo-sacral region of
the mammalian spinal cord, and further of determining what relation
ship exists between the representation of one movement and that of
another.    Of methods suggesting themselves for this investigation
the one selected was direct excitation of the anterior or posterior
roots or of the spinal cord itself.
                          Historical Introduction.
   A series of laborious investigations has been carried out to deter
mine the localisation of certain movements and the physiological
relationship of various muscles in and to definite segments of the
spinal cord, by Ferrier and Yeo, Bert and Marcacci, Forgue, Sherring
ton, and Russell, the method of which was limited (controlled by
exclusion experiments) to stimulation of the motor roots.                  I   am
only aware of one antecedent localisation experiment (by Sherring
ton) carried out by stimulation of the posterior roots ; nor can           I find
any record of the direct excitation of the surface of the cord for in
vestigating the localisation of movement.
             Method of Investigation and Precautions Observed.
                             —
    (a) Species of Animal. The animals chiefly employed were the
 dog and monkey (Macacus sinicus and rhesus).
    (6) Anesthetic. — The narcotic agents used were morphia and ether
or, in the monkey, ether alone.

        of Movements in  the Lumbal- Region of the Spinal Cord.        245
                            Operative Procedure.
     Exposure of spinal cord.
    Division of cord and isolation of segments.
     The cord was exposed with due observation of well-known precau
 tions (Gotch and Horsley, ' Phil. Trans.,' vol. 182, B, 1891). In some
 cases the spinal cord and roots were stimulated at first in continuity.
 In   others,  before proceeding to experiment, the spinal cord was
 completely divided at from two to eight segments above the part
 experimented upon. The spinal roots were divided as detailed in the
 paper.
                          Method op Excitation.
                               I.  Electrical.
    Apparatus. — A single Daniell cell was used which supplied a Du
 Bois Reymond's inductorium of the usual type, the secondary coil
 being 20 cm. or more from the primary.         The electrodes attached to
 the secondary coil consisted of closely approximated (1 mm.) plati
 num points.     The duration of excitation was, as a rule, momentary,
 and never exceeded 1 — 2 seconds.
    (o) Excitation of Nerve Roots. — The nerve roots were raised in the
air and the electrodes usually applied, so that the direction of the
exciting current was transverse to the nerve fibres.
    (b) Excitation of the Spinal Cord. — The surface of the cord was
gently dabbed with small wool swabs, kept in warm saline solution
 and squeezed dry, before the electrodes were applied.       The duration
 of excitation was always brief, rarely exceeding one second.
    The value of the method may be estimated by considering the
 following facts. On stimulation of the surface of the spinal cord as
already mentioned, movement was always elicited in the leg on the
side stimulated, when the electrode was applied to the surface of the
posterior column, but never, as far as     I was able to see, could move
ment be obtained by the application of this strength or even con
siderably greater strength of stimulus to the lateral or anterior
columns, when adequate precautions (vide paper) were taken to
prevent the direct spread of the current to the neighbouring root
fibres.     The movement elicited from stimulating the posterior
columns was always marked and quite definite, and merely depended
in intensity upon the conditions stated below. For instance, apply
ing the electrodes to the surface of the postero-external column in
the fifth lumbar segment of the dog on the left side produced lateral
flexion of the spinal column to the same side, flexion and adduction of
the hip, flexion of the knee and toes, and movement in the tail
(flexion to the same side).     But the chief result was the very local
effect which could be obtained by varying the point stimulated ; thus,

246       Dr. W. P. May.        On the Segmental Representation
stimulation of a point     1   mm. centrally or laterally to a given point
often produced an entirely different resulting movement or no move
ment at all, which fact is clearly of much importance in showing
that, with the above strength of current, the restriction of the
stimulus to one point can be accurately attained.
                               II. .Mechanical.
   As  a means of   controlling the observations derived from electrical
excitation, mechanical stimulation was sometimes employed in ex
amining the nerve roots, and was obtained by pinching the tissues
with fine forceps. The results were precisely the same as those
gained by electrical stimulation.
   On the   Results of Direct Excitation of the Surface           op the
                        Spinal Cord in the Dog.
                            I.  Gross Localisation.
   (a) Area Excitable. — The excitable area of the surface of the cord
itself is the postero-external column. Stimulation of the column of
Goll produced no movement except in the lower lumbar region,
where that column is either very narrow or practically absent, and
where, presumably, the effect was due to the stimulus directly
affecting the fibres of the postero-external column.
   (6) TJnilaterality. — In the large majority (91"5 per cent.) of experi
ments on animals (dog, cat, monkey) the fact was strikingly evident
that the movements produced were limited to the side stimulated.
   (c) Vertical Extent of the Spinal Cord in the Dog from which move
ment in the Lower Limb can be obtained. — In the dog, movements in
the lower limb can be produced from stimulation              of Burdach's
column from the upper border of the 13th dorsal segment to the
lower border of the 1st sacral segment, and from the results obtained
it will be seen that the various areas in the postero-external column,
the stimulation of which on the surface of the cord produces move
ments in the limbs, anus, and tail, all overlap one another, but that
on the whole the hip area is a little nearer the cerebrum than that
tor the knee, the area for the knee more proximal than that for the
foot, and so on.
   (d) Effect of Transversely       Dividing the Cord above the Lumbar
Enlargement.   — The only effect observed to follow such separation of
the cord from the brain, upon the movements elicited as above
described, was one of increased excitability.         The limits described
were found to prevail precisely, and the cord was excitable quite up
to the level of the section.

        of Movements in the Lumbar Region of the Spinal Cord.         247
              II. Minute Localisation within the Excitable Area.
    Repeatedly it was found that with a minimal stimulus it was
  possible to evoke movement either in the tail (and auns) only, or in
  the hamstrings, or in the hip or in the side only, and whenever this
  was obtained it was an invariable rule that the point for producing
  movement in the tail was placed in the cord mesially of that point,
 stimulation of which gave movement in the hamstrings, and that
 this latter point was mesial of that for the hip, while most external
 of all was the point from which movement of the side of the trunk
 was elicited.    This lateral arrangement has been in part foreshadowed
 by the observations of Mott on the relation between the coccygeal
 nerves and Goll's column.
 Investigation into the Segmental Representation of the Cord by Com
       parison of the Results of Excitation of the Anterior and Posterior
       Roots.
    (a) Latency of Effect. — Of conrse, in accordance with all previous
 investigations, the delay in passing through the spinal cord was well
 marked.
                                                                       —
    (i>) Character of Movement Elicited from the Respective Roots.
 Stimulation of the peripheral end of an anterior root gave, on the
 whole, a quick powerful extension of the whole limb, the latency,' of
 conrse, being extremely short ; on the other hand, excitation of the
 corresponding posterior root resulted in a slower, though strong,
flexion of the whole limb with a well-marked latency.
    This remarkable functional distinction between the roots, viz.,
 anterior giving extension and posterior flexion, was quite constant, and
 was obtained in every animal in which the experiment was made.
 Of course, the movement which took place was a resultant effect, and
 was produced by the contraction of many muscles, each muscle con
 tracting in whole, or in part, in combination with other muscles to
 produce the extension or flexion respectively.
    The results with each root are given in the tables.
    Further, stimulation of a posterior root (say the 5th) produced
 flexion of a joint or joints even when all the neighbouring anterior
 roots but one were divided.       Hence this flexion can only be due to
 the stimulus passing from the posterior root through the spinal cord
 along a particular anterior root to the muscles (differentiation of
 function in the nerve centre of that root), yet stimulation of this
 same anterior root produces extension.
    And this agrees entirely with the results obtained in a different
 way by Dr. Risien Russell ('Phil. Trans.,' 1893).
    The above experiment also goes to show that stimulation of one
 posterior root causes impulses to pass out along many anterior     roots.

A further   important condition of the particular function with which
we are now concerned (sensori-motor reflex) is that, from the present
investigation, it seems certain that the path along which the im
pulses pass as evidenced by movement elicited in stimulating a
certain posterior root, is directed towards a point below the level of
that posterior root, and, not as we might suppose, chiefly in the same
segment, or even above the level at which the posterior root joins the
cord.
   The proof of this new conclusion is afforded by many facts given in
the paper, not the least interesting of which is, that on direct stimu
lation of the second or third anterior lumbar roots in the dog, no
movement results in the lower limb, yet stimulation of the third
posterior lumbar root gives distinct flexion and adduction of the hip
and flexion of the knee, and stimulation of the second posterior
lumbar root gives slight flexion of the hip and knee.          In this con
nexion also results obtained by Claude       Bernard,  Schultze, Ramon-y-
Cajal,  Kolliker,   Retzius,  and Golgi afford similar evidence.
  Influence of  the  Posterior Roots upon the Nerve Centres in the Spinal
                                     Cord.
   It was found that repeated excitation of the posterior roots de
cidedly increased the excitability of the posterior roots themselves,
of the spinal cord and of the anterior roots. The difference in the
excitability of the preparation before and after the previous stimula
tion may be represented by the fact that, whereas the minimal
stimulus before the application of the repeated stimulus was repre
sented by a distance of 50 cm. of the secondary from the primary coil
in the condition of heightened excitability, a minimal stimulus was
obtained at a distance of 70 cm.       On the other hand, by cooling the
posterior  roots  as  suggested by  Professor  Gad, a converse effect was
produced. The results of Belmonda and Oddi are also quoted in this
connexion.
       Results of Experiments upon    the  Spinal Cord in the Monkey.
   Method. — The same as above.
   The same general results were obtained by stimulation of the
spinal cord in the monkey as described in the case of the
dog.    The area found excitable was the postero-external column,
stimulation of which from the thirteenth dorsal segment to the
second sacral segment inclusive produced after a very short latent
period lateral flexion of the spinal column, flexion and adduction of
the hip, flexion of the knee, ankle, and toes, movement of the
tail and perinceum, and peristalsis (rumbling of the bowels), though
it depended on the position of the electrode and the strength

       of Movements in    t/ie Lumbar Region of   the  Spinal Cord.   249
of the stimulus whether only a part or the whole of these move
ments resulted.      Similarly, with regard to the lateral extent of
the areas    mentioned above, although, of course, a strong stimulus
caused movement in all parts named, yet in each case it was quite
definite that the area, stimulation of which produced movement in
the tail, was nearer the middle line than that for the hamstrings,
the area for the hamstrings nearer the middle line than that for
 flexion of the hip, and this median of that which caused lateral
flexion of the side. Hence these resnlts demonstrate from a func
tional standpoint tho anatomical arrangement which has been
described by various writers — Raraon-y-Cajal, Kolliker. Golgi, Ac.
    As in the dog, the knee jerks were found not only present, but
even exaggerated, after the cord had been completely divided.
    Also section of the cord caused increased excitability of the parts
below section, but abolished the movement produced by stimulation
of the first or second or third posterior roots below the level of the
section, and the more obliqne the position of the posterior root fibres
in contact with the cord, the greater the interval affected in this
 manner.
    On the Production of Movement by Stimulation of the Anterior and
                   Posterior Spinal Boots in the Monkey.
    The general results obtained by excitation of the spinal roots in
the monkey were the same as those in the dog.           As already known
 (Sherrington,   Risien Russell)  stimulation of the  third lumbar to the
first or second sacral anterior roots (inclusive) alone produces move
ment in the lower limb, yet, on stimulation of the posterior roots of
the twelfth dorsal to the second sacral inclusive, it was found that
movement resulted in the lower limb, and in the latter case the bulk
of the movement produced is that of flexion.
                         Summary and Conclusion.
    1. Relationship of Posterior Roots to Reflex Kinesthetic Centres. — It
appears from the foregoing experiments to be definitely established
that any reflex centre derives its chief afferent impulses fx-om a nerve
root which enters the cord, as a rule, about two segments higher,
i.e., on the cephalic side. This generalisation, established by the
method of excitation, is confirmed by anatomical and pathological
considerations.
    2. Lateral Arrangement of Fibres in Burdock's Column. — The fibres
of the postero-external column are arranged in a definite and constant
order from within out, the innermost fibres (i.e., those nearest the
middle line) representing the most distal portions of the tail and
lower limb and the outermost the proximal segments of the limbs.

250        Mr. W. H. Lang.       Preliminary Statement on the
   3. Whereas  direct excitation of the anterior roots in the dog pro-
daces, as a resultant movement, extension of the lower limb, the
resultant movement produced from the kinesthetic centres of excita
tion of the posterior roots is always flexion. In the monkey there is
not this apparent antagonism, because stimulation of the anterior
roots in that animal brings out a differentiation of flexion and exten
sion, although  excitation of the posterior root gives flexion alone.
"Preliminary Statement on the Development of Sporangia
      upon Fern Prothalli."       By William fl. Lang, M.B., B.Sc,
      Lecturer in Botany, Queen Margaret College, and Robert
      Donaldson Scholar, Glasgow University. Communicated
      by D. H. Scott, M.A., Ph.D., F.R.S., Honorary Keeper of
      the Jodrell Laboratory. Royal Gardens, Kew. Received
      September 14, 1896.
   The observations recorded in this paper were made in the course of
an investigation into the relation existing between variability in the
fern plant and apogamy in the prothallus.       This research was under
taken at the suggestion of Professor Bower, F.R.S., and has hitherto
been conducted in the Jodrell Laboratory, Royal Gardens, Kew.
To Dr. Bower and Dr. Scott I am indebted for valuable assistance
and advice.
   In two of the species investigated, Scolopendrium vulgare, L., and
Lastrcea dilatata, Presl., sporangia were borne upon the prothallus.
In the former they were sometimes associated with apogamous
development of the sporophyte, the details of which differ, however,
from previously recorded cases of apogamy. As a considerable
period must elapse before an amount of material sufficient for the
complete study of details of development can be obtained, it appeared
advisable to describe the results obtained from the material at
present available.    Cultures are about to be commenced in the
Glasgow Botanic Gardens for the further study of these abnormal
prothalli.
   The prothalli of the two species       investigated will first be de
scribed, and the theoretical bearing of the results briefly considered.
         Lasirma dilatata, Presl., var. cristata gracilis, Roberts.
   The spores from which the cultures of this fern were made were
obtained from a plant in the collection of Mr. C. T. Druery, F.L.S.,
who kindly supplied me with material.            This variety was found
wild in Carnarvon in 1870.        Spores were sown in the first week
of November, 1895, upon a carefully sterilised soil, consisting of

             Development       of Sporangia upon Fern Prot/ialli.               251
 a  mixture of vegetable mould and sand.                 The pot was kept con
 stantly covered with a glass plate, and the necessity of watering
 was avoided by standing the pot in a large saucer kept full of water.
 A close crop of well-formed prothalli, on which antheridia and arche-
 gonia were present, completely covered the surface of the soil. In
 April, 1896, a number of the prothalli bore normal embryos in an
 early stage of development.           Three months later numerous young
 plants were present, which were found on examination to be nor
 mally produced.
    The prothalli which had not been fertilised had lost the heart-
shaped outline and elongated considerably ; some of them reached a
length of 2 cm., and were 5 mm. in breadth.                 The archegonia were
very numerous, and were situated upon a distinct cushion, which was
continued in the larger prothalli as a well-marked midrib. They
were arranged in transverse rows ; their necks had opened in a
normal manner, and the canal showed the usual brown discoloration.
 Antheridia were present on some of the prothalli.
    In some of these prothalli the midrib was continued into a cylin
drical process of variable thickness.           This arose in some examples as
a direct continuation of        the apex, but    more frequently was attached
to the under surface, just behind the apex of the prothallus ; in one
instance it was found in a corresponding position on the upper sur
face.    The actual apex usually loses its meristematic appearance ; it
grows   out   as a narrow triangular lobe, which consists of colourless
cells, and contains tracheides.            This lobe closely resembles the
" middle lobe "* found in the apogamous prothalli of certain ferns,
and probably corresponds to it. In a few instances this middle
lobe is formed, but no cylindrical process arises ; in such cases
secondary prothalli are produced from the anterior mai'gin of the
thin lateral wings, and the whole closely resembles an aborting pro
thallus of Aspidium filix-mas or Pteris cretica. When the prothalli are
seen from above, the anterior edge can be traced across the base of
the cylindrical process.         As will be described below, the first spo
rangia formed on the prothallus are usually situated on this margin,
                       " middle lobe." The process is of the same
especially on the                                                              deep
green    colour   as  the   midrib.    Sexual    organs,    often in considerable
numbers, are borne upon it.             They are usually well formed ; the
archegonia open      in  the usual  manner,  and the spermatozoids are capable
of active movement when liberated. On other examples variously
malformed sexual organs occur. The abnormal archegonia are
seated upon small elevations composed of cells which contain chloro
phyll ; sometimes the neck is open, but other examples have the

252         Mr. W. H. Lang.            Preliminary   Statement on the
neck clo3ed and branched.             The central cell of the abnormal anthe-
ridia is arrested at a 'more or less early stage of development, while
the cells of the wall and the base take on active growth.
   The sporangia are either isolated or associated together in groups,
which bear a striking resemblance to sori. They are borne upon the
process or close behind it upon the true middle lobe, and are rarely
found upon prothalli which have not produced a cylindrical process.
 When this is the case, they are always isolated and situated on the
edge of a thin continuation of the prothallus arising from the apical
depression.
   Single sporangia occur frequently on the edge of the prothallus,
which, as described above, crosses the base of the process.                  In a
number of examples a single sporangium occupied a median posi
tion, and, from earlier stages observed, it is probable that it is to be
traced back to the original growing point of the prothallus.             In other
cases several sporangia were formed in this region.                Isolated spo
rangia   are  also  found  on  the   process,  but more   frequently  groups are
met with. They occupy the upper or lateral faces of the process,
and whenever sporangia in early stages of development are found,
they are situated on its apex. It is probable that the groups of
older sporangia had become displaced from this position by the fur
ther growth of the process.            The groups were at a considerable dis
tance from each other.
   The relative positions of sporangia and sexual organs is a point
of some interest, and was readily determined. Archegonia were
present close to the sporangia, and at the same level on the
process.    When the process, after producing sporangia, had con
tinued its growth, archegonia and antheridia were present on the
portion beyond the sporangia, as well as on the older part, and, in
cases in which more than one group of sporangia had developed, the
intervening region bore sexual organs. Rhizoids are also produced
abundantly from the shaded side of the process, and, so far as exter
 nal appearance is concerned, there is no reason to doubt the pro-
thallial nature of the region on which the sporangia are situated.
 The tissue underlying the sporangia, however, presents peculiarities
in structure which may modify this conclusion to some extent.
Beneath the single sporangia developed on the edge of the prothallus
a few tracheides, which agree in every respect with those present in
apogamous prothalli, were always to be found.                 Similar elements
 were always present      in  the  tissue  beneath  the  groups situated on the
 process.    It  is  possible   that   here,  as in the  case of the sporangia
 upon the prothallus edge, the first tracheides are developed before
 the young sporangium can be recognised.                All that can be stated
 with certainty is that they ai-e already present beneath very young
 sporangia.     The tracheides may become connected together into a

              Development     of Sporangia upon Fern Prothalli.              253
 band, resembling a rudimentary vascular bundle, and suggesting a
 comparison with the vascular supply of a soi'us.
    The development of the sporangium could not be followed in
 detail in the material obtained as yet, bat a sufficient number of
 stages have been found to .make it clear that there is no difference of
 importance from the well known course of development of th<* same
 member on the sporophyte. In the youngest stage Been the apex
 of the sporangium was occupied by a tetrahedral cell, the cells
 destined to form the lateral portions of the wall having already
 been cut off from a large, dome-shaped terminal cell, the limits
of which were clearly recognisable. This was borne upon a sUlk
cell.    A tetrahedral archesporium is formed, from which tapetal
cells are cut off. The tapetum subsequently becomes two-layered,
and the central cell developes into a group of sporogenous cells.
From these, in the most mature sporangia found, a number of dark
brown spores had developed, while the tapetum was represented by
numerous granules between             the spores.     The number of spores
appeared     to  be  the same  as was   contained  in a sporangium developed
on the sporophyte.          The sporangium wall was perfectly developed ;
the cells of the annulus showed the characteristic thickening of their
walls, which were, of a dark brown colour, and a well formed stomium
was present. When tested with dehydrating agents, the mechanism of
the annulus was found to be perfect. The stalk consisted of four rows
of cells.
   No sporangia have been found in which the spores were ripe, but in
view of the advanced stage of development in those observed, there is
every probability that some may be obtained.             It will be interesting
to ascertain if the spores are capable of germination, and if the
prothalli produced Rhow any peculiarities.            The spores seen already
possessed    a  thick  wall on which   indications  of sculpturing were appa
rent, and a single nucleus was present in each.
   When the unnatural conditions under which they developed are
borne in mind, it is not surprising that many imperfect sporangia
were found. Such sporangia were in fact the more numerous. Some
times the arrest of development had taken place before the tapetum
had originated from the archesporium, but more commonly the double
layer of tapetal cells was present surrounding a sporogenous cell
which had become highly refractive, tho nucleus being indistinguish
able.    The annnlus could be made out, but its cells were thin walled
and colourless, and the whole sporangium was pale and more flattened
than one of the same age in which sporogenous tissue had formed.
   No evideuce has yet been obtained of the production of sporo-
phytes, showing vegetative organs upon the cylindrical process, but
one example was seen in which a group of sporangia, situated on the
apex of the process, was surrounded by ramcuta.

254          Mr. W. H. Lang.         Preliminary Statement on         the
    Scolopendrium vulgare, L., var. ramulosissimum, Wall. — -The cultures
of this fern were made in the manner already described for Lastrma
dilatata.    The spores were obtained from a plant grown in the open
air in the Royal Gardens, Kew.
    Tho prothalli were at first heart-shaped, and on many of them
normally produced embryos developed. No further changes ensued
in those on which young plants were present, and they soon became
colourless and died. In those which had remained unfertilised, how
ever, the apex continued directly into a cylindrical process,* which
was of considerable thickness, and in some cases attained a length of
5 mm.       The lateral portions of the prothallus showed no further
growth,     and  became in time brown or colourless appendages to the
base of the cylindrical process.             On the process were numerous
archegonia, and its prothallial nature was still further shown by the
presence, in some instances, of thin lobes of tissue, which generally
bore antheridia.       Sections through the process in this stage show
that the archegonia are normally formed, and reach almost to the
apex, and that tracheides are absent from the tissue. The archegonia
are capable of fertilisation, for in some instances normally produced
embryos were found.
    After the process has in this manner attained- a greater or less
length, its tip becomes yellowish, contrasting with the deep green
colonr of the region behind. Near the apex ramenta develope, which
soon completely clothe the tip of the process and render it white and
conspicnous. Archegonia are present to just below the ramenta.
Iiongitndinal sections at this stage show that one or two small eleva
tions corresponding to the rudiments of the apex of the stem, and the
first leaf of the sporophyte have. been formed. Beneath the broad tip
a flat mass of small meristematic cells extends ; the meristematic
 tissue is continuous with that of the stem and leaf apices, but, on
 passing away from these, is separated by several layers of large, non-
 nieristematic cells from the surface. In a slightly older stage the
 stem apex has become conical, and a number of leaves' have formed
 which are circiuately curved, and form a bud clothed with ramenta.
 In the meristematic mass numerous tracheides have been developed.
  One large group is central in position, and extends to the limit
 between prothallial and sporophytic tissue, while others are found
  beneath the bases of the leaves, and are in continuity with their pro-
  cambial strands. The apex of the stem is occupied by an initial cell,
  the relation of which to tho initial cell or cells of the apex of the
  process has not yet been traced.            The young sporophyte appears to
  be a direct continuation      of the process.      It is possible that some of
     • Prothalli of Scolopendrium, which from the brief description given of them
  appear to have borne similar processes, are mentioned by E. J. Lowe, in the Ourd.
                                                                             '

               Development        of Sporangia upon Fern Prothalli.                   255
the cases of apogamy recorded by Stange* were of this nature, but in
Doodia caudala, R. Br., which is the only one of his species yet
investigated in detail,t the elevations, from which sporophytes de
veloped, were situated on the under surface of the prothallus.                       This
case appears to be intermediate in character between Scolopendrium
and the species investigated by De Bary.J
    Several prothalli were found bearing sporangia ; these were grouped
together in large nnmbers, usually upon the upper surface of the
cylindrical process, but sometimes both above and below. Arobegonia
were situated close to the groups of sporangia.                   In the region of the
prothallus, underlying            the   group,    a strand   of tracheides   was found ;
in one instance this was conneoted with a spherical mass of tracheides
developed to all appearance within the venter of an archegonium
whose neck had not opened.                    The tissue upon which the sporangia
are inserted is thin walled, and its cells have granular contents ; it
contrasts sharply with the cells of the prothallus which have a large
 vacuole and walls which stain much more deeply with haematoxylin.
    As in the case of Lastrcea dilataia, the stages seen render it prob
 able that the sporangia follow the usual course of development. Two
layers of tapetal cells are formed which surround a considerable mass
 of sporogenous tissue.              Many of the sporangia fail to attain full
 development; they           remain     colourless, and in time wither. A few
 have been found, however, with a well developed annulus of a dark
 colour ; these contained spores which have not, however, been
 examined in detail.
    In one case two ramenta overarching a group of sporangia wero
 seen. At first sight it seemed possible that they might correspond
 to an indusium, but, when taken in connexion with another example
 in which a cylindrical process, whioh bore sporangia laterally, termi
 nated in an apogamously produced hud, another explanation appears
 more probablo ; this will be referred to again below.
    It is worthy of note that another variety of this species has been
 found to produce young plants, the first fronds of which bore
 numerous        prothalli while still in connexion with the stem.§                    Tho
 prothalli on which these               plants    appeared had been subjected to
 repeated subdivision, a prooess which in other species[| has been
 found to induce apogamous development of the sporophyte. Unfor
 tunately nothing is known of the manner in which these peculiar
 plants of Scolopendrium were produced, but it is possible that they
  arose apogamously.            The case of Scalopendrivm would then be com-

parable to that of Trichomanes alatum* in which apogamy and
apospory co-exist. Prothalli have been found to arise directly from
the older fronds of another variety of Scolopendrium.f
    An attempt will now be made to bring the peculiar modification of
the life-history cycle of these ferns into relation with previously
recorded cases of apogamy, and to estimute its theoretical bearing.
A full consideration of these points must be deferred until more
extended observations have been made.
    There seems no reason to doubt the prothallial nature of the cylin
 drical process : its origin, the character of its cells, the presence of
functional sexual organs, the development of rhizoids, and the direct
 transition to an ordinary flat prothallns apex sometimes met with, are
sufficient grounds for this conclusion.             The distinction between its
 origin as a direct continuation of the prothallus, and the cases in
 which it arises behind the apex which has lost its meristematic cha
 racter, is not an essential one. Both forms occur in Lastrma dilatata;
in the latter case the process may be compared with the numerous
elevations which appear on the under side of old prothalli of Doodia
 caudaia,% and are capable of apogamous development.                  The forma
 tion of such processes by prothalli which have attained a considerable
 size without having been fertilised, appears to be of not infrequent
 occurrence, and is usually associated with apogamy. It is recorded
 in Todea pelhicida, Carm., T. rivularis, Sieh.,§ and Athyrium filix-
fcemina, Bernh,, || and the writer has found in Aspidium frondosum,
 Lowe, as many as six apogamous buds, formed from the tips of
 cylindrical prooesses,        which    arose  from the anterior    margin of     a
 prothallus.
     The term cylindrical process^ has been used to avoid confusion
 with the middle lobe developed in aborting prothalli of Pteris
 cretica and Aspidium filix- mas.         This, as De Bary has shown, may be
 regarded as corresponding to some extent with the first leaf of an
 apogamous sporophyte.**              A structure comparable with this middle
 lobe has     been  found   in   prothalli of Latfrma dilatata, which had also
 produced a cylindrical process ; usually one or more sporangia were
 borne upon it.
     Tracheides were always present in the tissue beneath sporangia,

and the question arises whether their occurrence is to be regarded us
of morphological significance. They have been found in the pro
thalli of a number of species of ferns, and, in every case investi
gated, were associated with apogamy.               In the case of Pteris cretica
the differentiation of the tracheides in the prothallns precedes the
origin of the bud.* This is the case also with the single sporangia
formed on the edge of the prothallus, and probably holds good for
the groups of sporangia borne on the process.               Bnt tracheides may
occur in the prothallus at a distance from the place of origin of
bnds or sporangia. Putting aside the case of the middle lobe, the
prothallial nature of which is open to doubt, a large bundle of tra
cheides was found in the substance of a fleshy prothallns of a variety
of Scolopendrium vulgare, which bore numerous archegonia on the
surfaces immediately above and below the tracheides.                  Elongated
cells, which resemble sclerenchyma fibres, occur in the midrib of cer
tain frondose liverworts.')' A still more instructive example is
afforded by the presence of tracheides in the massive endosperm of
certain eycads.J       This latter case shows clearly that such elements
may be formed in the gametophyte to meet a physiological need.                It
seems inadvisable, therefore, to lay stress on the presence of tra
cheides as a means of distinguishing' between the two generations,
and the moro so since their occurrence in a portion of the prothallus
which is about to bear a bud or sporangia can be recognised as a
physiological advantage. Such means of procuring a sufficient water
supply may be a necessary preliminary to the development of a young
sporophyte or a group of sporangia.
   Lastly, it remains to consider the view to be taken of the presence
of the characteristic reproductive organs of the asexual generation
upon the gametophyte, and to consider its bearing upon the nature
of alternation of generations in the archegoniata?. Since the dis
covery that in certain cases the one generation cuuld arise directly
from the other without the intervention of the proper reproductive
organs, such cases have been used in support of the view that the
alternation in the Archegoniatse was homologous. §                 On the other
hand, it has been maintained, both on grounds of the exceptional
nature of these cases of apospory and apogamy, and of comparative
phylogeny, that the distinction between the two generations was a
much deeper one ; that the alternation was not homologous, but anti
thetic. || So far no case has been recorded in which the proper
reproductive organs of the one generation were situated upon the

258        Mr. W. H. Lang.        Preliminary Statement on     the
other without the intervention of the vegetative organs. At first
sight such appears to be the case in the prothalli of the two species
described ; sporangia were present in close proximity to the sexual
organs, the vegetative organs of the sporophyte being, at most, repre
sented by a mass of cells underlying the group of sporangia, and
even this distinction may not be recognisable beneath the single
sporangia on the edge of the prothallus.
    Several reasons may be adduced, however, against regarding these
phenomena as evidence that the alternation of generations found in
the ferns is not antithetic. In the first place, it is to be noted that the
two forms in which sporangia have been observed upon the gameto-
phyte are highly variable species, and that the varieties studied wero
 well-marked crested forms. Further, the conditions under which the
prothalli existed were in several respects unnatural.         Among them
the fact that fertilisation was prevented by not watering the cultures
from above, and that a prolonged growth of the unfertilised prothalli
was thereby induced, is of special interest, for it appears that apogamy
is liable to occur under such conditions in ferns which, as a rule,
reproduce sexually.      While these considerations do not of themselves
preclude deductions being made from these peculiar forms of repro
duction, they necessitate especial caution in their use in the discussion
of broad morphological questions.
    Further, a number of reasons exist for considering the production
of sporangia on the prothallus         as a special case of apogamy.
In Sculopendrium vulgare a sporophyte may develope from the tip of
the cylindrical process.     This may happen after a group of sporangia
has been developed.      In one case two ramenta were present, one on
each side   of a group  of sporangia; they were in every respect similar
to the ramenta which develope on the tip of the process when it is
being transformed into the apex of a bud. Whenever a group of
 very young sporangia was seen it was situated upon the apex of the
lobe, and the sporangia wero in a more advanced stage of develop
ment the farther the group to which they belonged was removed
from the apex.        This has been most clearly seen in the case of
Lastraa dilatata in which no buds with vegetative organs have as
yet been seen, although in one case ramenta were associated with the
sporangia, but it also holds for Scolopendrium. The explanation of
these facts, which appears most probable, is that each group of
sporangia had occupied the apex of the process when very young,
and had become farther removed from this position as the process
continued to increase in length.     It is uncertain whether this growth
is by direct continuation of the original growing point of the process,
or whether the development of a group of sporaugia at the apex
necessitates the formation of a new growing point; possibly both
 forms occur.     If the latter be the case a process on which several

             Development     of Sporangia       upon Fern    Prothalli.   259
groups of sporangia are present must be looked upon as a sympodium.
 Some probability is lent to this view by the fact that the first
 appearance of the process in Lastrcea is usually as a sympodial con
 tinuation of the axis of a prothallus whose true apex has developed
 one or more sporangia.
    Since the group of sporangia and the tissue of peculiar character
 on which they are seated are developed in the place of an apoga-
 mously produced vegetative bud, they may be looked upon as con
 stituting a very reduced sporophyte.             The drain upon the resources
 of the prothallus entailed by the production of this reduced bud,
 which is incapable of further growth, is much less than when a
 vegetative bud is formed.            This explains why a number of such
 sporangial groups can be produced and supported by a single pro
 thallus.    The occurrence of a number of vegetative buds on a single
 prothallus is the exception, but may happen, as the case of Aspidium
frondosum, before mentioned, shows.
    It is probable that it is in the constitution of the nuclei that a
 means of distinction between cells of the oophyte and the sporophyte
 must be looked for in these cases in which the two generations are
in intimate connection with each other.*
    The complete life history of the fern is in these cases still further
 shortened than in the ordinary cases of apogamy ; not merely the
 formation of a zygote by the fusion of antherozoid and ovum, but the
 formation of an embryo, in which any differentiation of the vegeta
 tive organs can be detected, is omitted, and the sporophyte is reduced
 to a mass of tissue which may be compared to a placenta bearing
 sporangia.     The occurrence of single sporangia upon the edge of the
 prothallus may, in the light of the series of stages described, be con
 sidered as a still further case of reduction of an apogamous sporo
phyte.     While this does not altogether prevent the explanation of
 the presence of sporangia upon the prothallus from the point of view
 of the supporters of the homologous nature of the two generations,
 it brings the present case into line with other exceptions to the
 normal life-history cycle, whose bearing on the nature of alternation
 has been discussed by Bower, t The present case, although more
 striking in its appearance, seems, so far as it has been investigated,
to afford no sufficient reason for dissenting from the conclusion at
 which he arrived.
    It is of interest to note the additional evidence, were such needed,
 which these observations afford of the generalization made by
 Goebel,J that the sporangium is to be regarded as an organ sui
generis.

" The Reproduction and Metamorphosis of the Common Eel
        (Anguilla vulgaris)"      By G. B. GRASSI, Professor in Rome.
        Communicated by Professor E. Ray Lankester, F.R.S.
        Received October 19, 1896.        Read November 19, 1896.
    Four years of continual researches made by me in collaboration
with my pupil, Dr. Calandruccio, have been crowned at last by a
success    beyond my expectations, that is to say, have enabled me to

                   Metamorphosis   of the Common Eel.               261
dispel in the most important      points the great mystery    which  has
hitherto surrounded the reproduction and the development of the Com
mon Eel (Anguilla vulgaris).     When I reflect that this mystery has
occupied the attention of naturalists since the days of Aristotle, it
seems to me that a short extract of my work is perhaps not unworthy
to be presented to the Royal Society of London, leaving aside, how
ever, for the present, the morphological part of my results.
   The most salient fact discovered by me is that a fish, which
hitherto was known as Leptocephalus brevirostris, is the larva of the
Anguilla vulgaris.
   Before giving the proofs of this conclusion I must premise that
the other Mursenoids undergo a similar metamorphosis.           Thus, I
have been able to prove that the Leptocephalus stenops (Bellotti), for
the greatest part, and also the Leptocephalus morrisii and punctatus
belong to the cycle of evolution of Conger vulgaris ; that the Lepto
cephalus liceckeli, yarrelli, bibroni, gegenbauri, koUikeri, and many
others imperfectly described by Facciola, and a part of the above-
named Leptocephalus stenops of Bellotti, belong to the cycle of evolu
tion of Congromurcena mystax ; that the Leptocephalus taenia, in-
ornatus, and diaphanus belong to that of Congromurcena balearica;
that under the name of Leptocephalus kefersteini are confounded the
larvaB of various species of the genus Ophichthys ; that the Lepto
cephalus longirostris and the Hyoproriis messanensis are the larvee of
Neltastoma melanurum, and that the Leptocephalus oxyrhynchus and
other new forms are larvae of Saurenchelys cancrivora, and that finally
a new little Leptocephalus is the larva of Murcena helena.
   The form known as Tylurus belongs to Oxystoma, of which           wi^
unfortunately know nothing more than a figure by Raffinesqne.           I
have not been able to find the Leptocephalus of Myrus vulgarin, of
which I have had only a single young individual, in which the trans
formation was already far advanced. Neither have I found the Lepto
cephalus of Chlopsis bicolor, a very rare form, which is related to
Murcena and to Murcenichthys.      As the result of these observations,
the family of the Leptocephalidse has been definitely suppressed by
me ; the various forms of that family are, in fact, the normal larvK
of the various Mursenoids.
   In regard to the greater part of the above-named species, the con
trol has been threefold, namely : —
   Firstly, anatomical.    I have compared the various stages in all
their structures, and have made the due allowance for the changes
brought about by the metamorphosis at the close of larval life.
   Secondly, natural.    1 have found in nature all the required transi
tional stages.
   Thirdly, experimental.     I have followed, step by step, the meta
 morphosis in aquariums.

262           Prof.      B. Grassi.    The Reproduction and
   Therefore, the hypothesis of Giinther that the Leptocephali are
abnormal larvae, incapable of further development, must be rejected.
All this is related by myself at length, with all historical details
which concern the question, in a large memoir which is about to
appear in the Journal edited by Professor Todaro.
   Until now all these facts have been, unknown because normally
they cau only be observed in the abysses of the sea at a depth of at
least 500 metres. Fortunately, along a part of the coast of Sicily
strong currents occur, which must be ascribed to the tide, producing
very large displacements of the water in the narrow Strait of Mes
sina.   I  shall give further details concerning these currents in my
large memoir. In consequence of the strong currents, sometimes —            I
say sometimes, because there is no regularity, and one may have to
wait for a year without obtaining any material — not only many
deep-sea fishes, but also all stages of the development of the Murse-
noids are met with in the surface-water.          To these currents we owe
all the captures of Muratna Helena with ripe eggs, which is in accord
ance with what     I had already argued from other facts, namely, that
the reproduction     of the Mursenoids takes place at great depths of the
sea.
   Before   I proceed to speak of the Common Eel,        I must premise that
Dr. Raffaele has described certain pelagic eggs as belonging to an
undetermined species, putting forward the suggestion that these
eggs belong to some Muroanoid.         This matter has been investigated
by myself,    and  I  have  shown   that  the newly hatched larvsa (called
" prse-larvee " by
                     me) derived from these eggs have essentially the
character of Leptocephali.
   The life history of the Maraenoids, leaving aside for the present
the Common Eel, is as follows : — Females can only mature in very
profound depths of the sea, that is to say, at least a depth of 500
metres. This fact        I established by finding well-known        deep-sea
fishes together with Leptocephali, ripe Murasnn?, and quite ripe eels
(see below).     The females of those species which do not live at this
depth must therefore migrate to it.        The male, however, can matnre
at a smaller depth, and therefore they migrate into the greater depth
when they are already mature.            Fertilisation takes place at great
depths ; the eggs float in the water ; nevertheless they remain at a
great depth in the sea, and only exceptionally, for unknown reasons,
some of them mount to the surface.
   From the egg issues rapidly a pravlarva, which becomes a larva
(Leptocephalus) with the anus and the urinary opening near the tip
of the tail. The larva then becomes a hemi-larva, the two aper
tures just named moving their position towards the anterior part of
the body, which becomes thickened and nearly round.               By further
change   the   hemi-larva   assumes   the  definitive  or  adult form.   The

                        Metamorphosis       of the Common         Eel.                  263
    larva,   aa  well as the hemi-larva, shows a length of body much
    greater than that exhibited by the young Mursonoid of adult form
   into which they are transformed.            B3' keeping specimens in an aqua
   rium, I was able to establish a diminution of more than 4 cm. during
   the metamorphosis.          With regard to the greatest length which the
   larva can attain in a given species, and the amount of diminution
   which accompanies metamorphosis, there are great individual varia
  tions.
       The   history of the Common Eel, to which I am now about to
  refer, is   very similar to that given above for the other Muraanoids.
  The Common Eel (Anguilla vulgaris) undergoes a metamorphosis,
  and    before it assumes the definitive adult form it presents itself as
  a   Leptocephalns, which is known as Lcptocephalus brevirostris.                     This
  Leptocephalus was discovered in the Strait of Messina many years
  ago.     A specimen was also captured by the " Challenger," and
 another specimen was taken by the Zoological Station of Naples in
  the Strait of Messina.             This form is occasionally carried to the
 surface by currents.           By exception, in the month of March, in the
 year 1895, we captured several thousands of them in one day, but
 the best way to secure this Leptocephalus (and a very easy one) is to
 open the intestine of the Orthagoriscus mola, a fish which is common
 in the Strait of Messina, and in it one is certain to find a very
 large number of specimens.             It must be observed that Orthagoriscus
 mola is a deep-sea fish.           The specimens of Leptocephalus brevirostris
 found in the intestine of Orthagoriscus are more or less altered by
 digestion.        Those specimens of Leptocephalus brevirostris which are
 taken near the surface in the open sea are in a better state of preser
 vation, but, unfortunately, these also frequently have the epidermis
 injured so that they cannot maintain their life in an aquarium for
 more than a few days; they live long enough, however, to allow us
 to observe that it is their habit to conceal themselves in the sand or
in the mnd as the Common Eel (Anguilla) does.                           Hero it is to bo
noted that the various forms of Leptocephali                   have habits resembling
 those of the Mursenoids to which they belong, i.e., they dig into the
sand or abstain from doing so according as the adult form has or has
not this habit.
      I now pass on to the characters of Leptocephalus brevirostris.                 I give
 them here in the same order as           I  shall use in my larger memoir. The
length        varies  from    77 —  60  mm.,   the same extent of variation as
observed in other Muroanoids.                The caudal fin tends to assume the
form which it has in the Elver* or young Anguilla.                      It is to be noted
that in other Leptocephali the caudal fin also tends always to exhibit
the adult form.           The lower jaw projects sometimes more than the
     * The word " KlTer " is used in this         ir. its strict sense, viz., for the young

 2(54          Prof. G. B. Grassi.         The Reproduction       and
 upper jaw, as in Anguilla.         The margin of the mouth is wide, as in
 Anguilla. The tongue is free, as in Anguilla. On the other hand,
 the youngest elvers which I have observed, have smaller eyes than
 Leptocephalus hrevirostris, and this need not surprise us since we know
 that in other species of Murrenoids the diminution of the eyes occurs
 during the metamorphosis.             The nostrils are separated from one
another, the anterior tubes are relatively at a considerable distance
from the tip of the snout and from the rim of the mouth. They are
 in a position in which they are observed in many other Leptocephali,
which are destined to transform themselves into adult forms having
the anterior nostrils in nearly the same position as in the Common Eel.
The posterior nostrils, on the contrary, are not tube-like, and are in
the same position as those occupied in the adult Anguilla.               It is worth
remarking that in other Leptocephali also the posterior nostrils have
already assumed the adult position when the anterior ones are still
far removed from it. In L. hrevirostris               I find a larval dentition,
which resembles that of the other Leptocephali.                In correspondence
with the small size of Leptocephalus hrevirostris the number of larval
teeth is small.       Researches founded, firstly, on the enumeration of
the myomeres ; secondly, upon the enumeration of the dorsal and
ventral arches of the vertebra? of the caudal extremity (hypurals) ;
and, thirdly, upon the enumeration of the posterior spinal ganglia,
lead with great certainty to the conclusion that the Leptocephalus
brerirostris is the larva of a Mur»noid, the number of whose vertebra?
must lie between 112 and 117, most probably 114 or 115. Such a
Mnrrenoid is the Anguilla vulgaris.            The Muraenoid indicated cannot
be any other of those occurring in the Mediterranean, because tbey
all have a number of vertebra? higher than 124.* Counting the
myomeres in Leptocephalus hrevirostris one finds generally only 105
complete, five others incomplete, and all the others in a state of
transparency and incomplete formation.               These latter are fortunately
at the posterior extremity, where other criteria come to our assistance,
namely, the spinal ganglia and the vertebral arches. To show how I
arrive at the number of vertebrae which must be possessed by the
adult individual, corresponding to a given Leptocephalus hrevirostris,
I quote the following example : — I assume that three vertebra?
develop themselves in correspondence to the first four incomplete
myomeres, and that 105 must develop themselves in relation to the
105 complete myomeres, that is to say, between the fourth and fifth
myomeres, between the fifth and sixth, and so on, until we reach the
105th vertebra, lying between the 104th and 105th myomeres. I
   * Mvranetox taranna is said to haTe 109 vertebra?, but it is doubtful whether it
really occurs in the Mediterranean.     The position of its nostrils and the number
of its branchiostegal  rays render   its association with Leptocephalus breviroslris
impossible.

                       Metamorphosis      of the Common Eel.                   265
further conclude that seven other vertebrae are developed                  at the
caudal extremity, as indicated          by  the number   of  vertebral arches  and
 the spinal ganglia in that region.             We count, therefore, in all 115
vertebrae, and this is the number which can be easily seen in many
specimens of Anguilla vulgaris.
    Here    I   must particularly insist that        I have ascertained in an
absolute manner that during the metamorphosis of the Muraenoids,
the number neither of the myomeres nor of the vertebral arches, nor
of the spinal ganglia is subjected to any change.                 The hypurals of
Leptocephalns brevirostris are precisely the same as in the elver of
Anguilla vulgaris.        The last hypural which is fused with the urostyle
may present itself as a single piece, or may be more or less cleft.
These are variations which are met with also in the elver. Just as
in the elver, the last hypural but one is always extensively cleft, or,
if the expression is preferred, doubled. To the last hypural corre
spond five rays, whilst four correspond to the last but one, and one to
the last but two, the whole structure being identical with that found
in the elvers of Anguilla vulgaris.             Of these ten rays, the eighth,
seventh, and sixth are bifid, both in Leptocephalns brevirostris and in
the elvers of Anguilla vulgaris.           In the pectoral fin of Leptocephalns
brevirostris the definitive rays can be observed, and these are of the
same number as in the elvers of Anguilla vulgaris.                  Leptocephalns
brevirostris is transparent, and has colourless blood. The red cor
puscles are wanting, but there are present so-called
                                                                  " blood-plates "
                       " in                  similar to those of the inferior
(" Blutplattchen              German)
 vertebrates. The bile is also colourless.           This fact is observed in all
the other Leptocephali.           Leptocephalns brevirostris is, however, the
only   one    which  is free from    all pigmentation.      Correspondingly, the
Common Eel is the only species of Mnranoid which at the close of
 metamorphosis is devoid of all trace of larval pigmentation.               It was
 this observation which first led us to the discovery of the relations
 between Leptocephalns brevirostris and Anguilla vulgaris.
    In making transverse sections of Leptocephalns brevirostris,          I  found
 other characters which confirm the relation between it and the Com
  mon Eel ; for instance, the branch iostegal rays are ten to eleven in
  nnmber, as is also observed in the elvers of Anguilla vulgaris.           In the
  Common Eel the well-known lateral branch of the fifth pair of the
  cranial nerves exists.      It is also found in Leptocephalns brevirostris.
  This lateral branch could not be found by Dr. Calandrnccio in the
  other common Muramoids of Sicily, and is wanting also in the other
  Leptocephali.
     The mucous-canal-system         (sensory canals) in the head are already
  ¦developed,   partially, in Leptocephalns brevirostris, and are incom
  pletely developed in the elver.          As in the elver, so in Leptocephalns
  hrvoirostris, the  pyloric   cceca   are  wanting.    The blind extremity of

2fib"          Prof. G. B. Grassi.         The Reproduction     and
the stomach and the incompletely developed swim-bladder, which is
as yet free from contained gas, are present both in Leptocephalus
brevirostris and in the elver of Anguilla vulgaris.            The pronephros is
in active function as in the other Leptocephali.                The Malpigbian
glomerules of the kidney (mesonephros) are lobed as in the eel, and
their number corresponds with that observed in the Helmichthys
stage, of which       I  will speak further on. The genital gland, not yet
sexually    differentiated,      is almost identical with that of the same
stage.    In    short,    it  may be said that the whole organisation of
Leptocephalus       brevirostris corresponds with the organisation of the
Common Eel, if we make allowance for those changes, which are
observed in the matamorphosis of the other species of MnrsBnoids,
such as reduction of the pancreas and of the liver, disappearance of
the proto-skeleton, complication of the musculature, increase in size
of the cerebellum, loss of the larval teeth, development of the defini
tive teeth, &c.
    From the description of these Leptocephali           I  must pass on, briefly,
to frpeak of the stages nearer to the condition ot the elver.               I am,
however, obliged to leave a break in the series, which, however little
its significance, yet certainly will make some impression on the minds
                                                          I
of those who do not realise with what caution have formed my con
clusions.     I  must confess that since        I  have learnt how difficult it is
to procure an entire series of the development of a Mnraanoid,                   I
am more astonished at being able to recognise a single stage in the
development of a given species than at not finding the whole series.
I  must point out that the break in my series of the development of
Anguilla vulgaris would have been much smaller if                  I could have
persuaded myself to kill and preserve one of the hemi-larvsB which               I
happened to meet with at the end of the year 1892.                    They were
really transitional stages between Leptocephalus brevirostris and that
stage which       I  shall describe further on.       I published this fact in a
preliminary      note   in   the month  of May,   1893.   They were transparent
with almost colourless blood, without any trace of pigmentation
except at the eyes, and had lost all the larval teeth, whilst they
possessed already very few and very minute teeth of the definitive
series.    The body was thickened, and already showed the cylindrical
form.     They measured little less than 8 cm. In short, they were
 Leptocephalus brevirostris on the way to transformation into Anguilla
 vulgaris. As a matter of history they actually did transform them
 selves in my aquarium with the usual diminution in their dimen
 sions, and subsequeutly proceeded to increase in bulk.* The meta
 morphosis took place as usual without the animal taking in any
                     I
   * The fact that actually have obtained in an aquarium the transformation of
 L. bremroslris into Anguilla vulgarit is of prime importance. The time occupied
 was one month.

nourishment whatever.      The resumption of growth was accompanied
by a resumption    of feeding.   Unfortunately, I had no other indi
viduals of this stage.
   The stage which I now pass on to describe can be obtained during
the winter in the sea.  I have never found them at the mouths of
rivers.  The length varies from 54 to 73 mm. Most individuals
measured about 65 mm.      The body is relatively longer than in the
elver.  It is also relatively deeper, as in Leptocephalus. We are
reminded of Leptocephalus also by the pigment of the eye, the
vitreous transparency of the body, the swim-bladder being indis
tinguishable in the living animal, and the absence of all larval pig
mentation.   The blood is slightly coloured, and the bile is already
green. Slight pigmentation can be seen along the central nervous
system, and at the middle part of the caudal fin. This commence
ment of the definitive or adult pigmentation in the regions named
before it occurs in any other part is also seen in other Mureenoids.
The definitive teeth are very minute, and few in number. The
intestine contains no food.    After what   Ihad observed in the other
Muramoids, the simple observation of the barely indicated teeth,
and of the absence of aliment in the gut, would have been sufficient
to convince me that the stage now under notice must be preceded by
a Leptocephalus phase.     Indeed, if we did not admit such a preceding
history, we could not understand how this little fish could have
attained such a size without acquiring well developed teeth, and with
out nourishing itself.
   In conclusion, no one would hesitate, even not knowing Lepto
cephalus brevirostris, to refer the stage now under discussion to a
Mursenoid about to complete its Leptocephalus metamorphosis, were
it not for the fact that there has been so much question concerning
the reproduction of the Common Eel, and that so many capable
observers have failed in dealing with      it,
                                             that every new observation
is received with scepticism. The stage of which am now speaking,
                                                 I
in the hands of a pure systematist, would probably be described as a
Helmicthys, a genus established for certain forms of Leptocephali far
advanced in transformation.
    The next forms to which have to refer are captured in the course
                           I
of migration from the sea into fresh water.           When kept in an
aquarium they assume the characters of the     elver, diminishing more
or less  in volume, and without    nourishing themselves.    The elvers
of tbe Common Eel can present themselves in stages differing
little from that last described, as well as in a form which has
already developed the full pigmentation of the adult.       Eveu those
which most resemble the preceding stage always have a character
which distinguishes them easily, namely, the presence of definitive
pigment, more or less superficially placed on the head, and not to be

2(58          Prof.   (Jr. B. Grassi.    The Reproduction      and
confounded with the pigment round the posterior extremity of the
brain, which latter is already present in the preceding stage.               In
specimens taken at the months of rivers this more or less superficial
pigment was, so far as I could ascertain, always present.
    As the pigmentation develops itself, the little eel gradually under
goes a diminution in all its dimensions.         It results from my measure
ments, that the fully pigmented elver has an average length of
CI mm., while for the more or less colourless elver the average length
is 67 mm.     I found pigmented elvers which were reduced in length to
.51 mm., a size which        I never observed in those elvers in which the
development      of pigment had not taken place.
    The facts which        I  have stated demonstrate that the eel goes
through a metamorphosis, and that Leptocephalus brevirostris is its
larva.     Some further considerations remain to be given, although            I
believe that zoologists will not consider the question still an open
one after the record of facts given above- — facts, which anyone may
verify by examining the material which is preserved in my hands.
Many to whom         I  have related my discovery of the history of the
Common Eel have objected that eels are found almost everywhere,
 whilst Leptocephalus brevirostris is limited to Messina. In reply,            I
 must say that, first of all, it is not true that Leptocephalus brevirostris
 is limited to Messina ; secondly, that at Messina there are special
 currents, which tear up the deep-sea bottom which everywhere else is
 inaccessible ; thirdly, although it is time that on the coasts of many
 countries where Anguilla vulgaris is found, no one has ever seen a
 Leptoccphidus brevirostris ; it is also true that in no country, not even
 in those where eels are abundant, has anyone ever seen an eel of less
 than 5 cm. in length.       Since it has to be admitted that no one knows
 the eel before it arrives at the length of 5 cm., there is no greater
 difficulty in supposing that during this unknown period the eel
 passes through a Leptocephalus stage than in supposing that it does
 not do so. The critical study of the literature of this subject, and a
 great many continued observations, have occupied me for many
 years, and have been undertaken just in those places where young
 eels are to be found.         They enable me, from my own studies, to
 affirm with assurance that young eels with the definitive adult form
 do not exist of less than 5 cm. in length.
    From the study of the memoir of Raffaele on pelagic eggs, I have
 come to the conclusion that the eggs of his undetermined species
 No. 10, having a diameter of 2'7 mm. and differing from all the
 others in the absence of oil globules,* must belong to the Anguilla
   * Kcnewed researches have convinced me that this egg is that of Anguilla
 vnlgarit. There is, however, another egg belonging to an undetermined Muranoid
 which is devoid of oil-drops, and can easily be confused with the true eggs of
 Anguilla.

had only forty -four abdominal myomeres.            I endeavoured for two
years   in vain to  study  these eggs at  the Zoological Station of Naples.
 1 found only a few of them, and these died prematurely.
    In another point my researches have yielded a very interesting
result.    As a result of the observations of Petersen, we know now
that the Common Eel develops a bridal coloration or " mating
habit," which is chiefly characterised by the silver pigment without
trace of yellow, and by the more or less black colour of the pectoral
fin, and finally by the large eyes.         Petersen inferred that this was
the bridal coloration from the circumstance that the individuals
exhibiting it had the genital organs largely developed, had ceased to
take nourishment, and were migrating to the sea.            Here Petersen's
observations cease and mine begin.           The same currents at Messina
which bring us the Leptocephali bring us also many specimens of
the Common Eel, all of which exhibit the silver coloration.           Not a
tow of them present the characters described by Petersen in an
exaggerated condition, that is to say, the eyes are larger and nearly
round instead of elliptical, whilst the pectoral fins are of an intense
black. It is worth noting that in a certain number of them the
anterior margin of the gill slit is intensely black, a character which      I
have never observed in eels which had not yet migrated to the sea,
and which is wanting in the figures and in the originals sent to me by
Petersen himself.       Undoubtedly the most important of these changes
is that of the increase of the diameter of the eye, because it finds its
physiological explanation in the circumstance that the eel matures in
the depths of the sea.        That, as a matter of fact, eels dredged from
the bottom of the sea have larger eyes than one ever finds in fresh
water eels, I have proved by many comparative measurements, made
between eels dredged from the sea bottom and others which had not
yet passed into the deep waters of the sea.         Thus, for instance, in a
male eel taken from the Messina currents and having a total length
of 34^ cm., the eye had a diameter, both vertical and transversal, of
9 mm., and in another eel of 33^ cm., the same measurement was
recorded.      In a female eel, derived from the same source and
purchased' in the market, whose length was 48| cm., the vertical
diameter of the eye was 10 mm., and the transversal diameter rather
more than 10 mm.          These are not the greatest dimensions which       I
observed, and      I  conclude from these facts that the bridal habit
described by Petersen was not quite completed in his specimens, and
 that it becomes so only in the sea and at a great depth.        In relation
 to these observations    of mine stands the fact that the genital organs
 iu the eel taken in the Messina currents are sometimes more
developed than in eels which have not yet entered the deep water.
Thus it has happened that male individuals have occurred showing

270      The Reproduction    and Metamorphosis of the Common Eel.
in the testes here and there knots of spermatozoa.       These spermato
zoa are similar to those of the Conger vulgaris, and must be con
sidered as ripe. As is well known, so advanced a stage of sexual
maturity has never before been observed in the Common Eel.            This
appears to be due to the fact that the males hitherto examined had
not yet migrated into the deep water of the sea.
    Eels with big eyes taken from the depths of the sea were, before
the above facts were known, described as a distinct species under
the name of Anguilla bibroni (Kaup) and of Anguilla kieneri (Kaup),
not to be confounded with Anguilla kieneri (Giinther), which is a
synonym of Lycodes kieneri.
    In certain cloaca? of ancient Rome which to-day are disused and
contain pure water, remarkable eels are found of a length of from
20 — 30 cm. of a grey colour, without trace of yellow, of male and
female sex, with enormous eyes and with more or less rudimentary
genital organs. They are individuals which, confined in a place
without light, have acquired prematurely one of the characters of
the bridal habit without a corresponding development of the genital
organs. These individuals are probably incapable of ulterior de
velopment, as the condition of their genital organs seems to demon
 strate.
    Under the name Anguilla kieneri (Kaup) there have probably been
included some individuals which had acquired big eyes under con
ditions similar to those described for the eels of these Roman cloac«.
 From these and similar observations it clearly results that all the
 European eels must be included under a single species, and this is an
 important fact from another point of view, namely, that it destroys
 an objection which might be raised against my conclusion with
 regard to the development of Anguilla vulgaris from Leptocephalus
 brevirostris, namely, the objection that Leptocephalus        brevirostris
 belongs not to Anguilla vulgaris, bnt to Anguilla kieneri, or to
 Anguilla bibroni.
     To sum up, Anguilla vulgaris, the Common Eel, matures in the
 depths of the sea, where   it acquires larger eyes than are ever observed
 in individuals which have not yet migrated to deep water, with the
 exception of the eels of the Roman cloaca?. The abysses'of the sea
 are the spawning places of the Common Eel : its eggs float in the sea
 water.     In developing from the egg, it undergoes a metamorphosis,
 that is to say, passes through a larval form denominated Leptoce
 phalus brevirostris.   What length of time this development requires
  id very difficult to establish.    So far we have only the following
  data : — First, Anguilla vulgaris migrates to the sea from the month
  of October to the month of January ; second, the currents, such as
  those of Messiua, throw up, from the abysses of the sea, specimens
  which, from the commencement of November to the end of July,

 are observed to bo more advanced in development than at other times,
 but not yet arrived at total maturity ; third, eggs, which according
 to every probability belong to the Common Eel, are found in the sea
 from the month of August to that of January inclusive ; fourth,
 the Leptocephalus brevirostris abounds from February to September.
 As to the other months, we are in some uncertainty, because during
 them our only natural fisherman, the Orthagoriscus mola, appears
 very rarely; fifth, I am inclined to believe that the elvers ascending
 our rivers are already one year old, and      I have observed that in
 an aquarium specimens of L. brevirostris can transform themselves
 into young elvers in one month's time.

      (1) The term telegony has been used to cover cases in which a
 female A, after mating with a male B, bears to a male C offspring
having some resemblance to or some peculiar characteristic of A's
 first mate B. The instances of telegony usually cited aro (i) cases
 of thoroughbred bitches when covered by a thoroughbred                       dog,
 reverting    in  their litter to half-breds,     when they  have been previously
 crossed by dogs of other races.            Whether absolutely unimpeachable
 instances of this can be produced            is, perhaps, open to question, but
 the strong opinion         on the    subject     among dog-fanciers is at least
 remarkable ; (ii) the case of the quagga noted by Darwin (see
 '
    Origin of Species,' 4th edition, p. 193), and still more recently
                                                                         '

      In this latter case a very rare male malformation, which occurred
 in the male B, was found in the sou of his widow A, by a second
 husband C. Here, as in the other cases cited, a question may always
 be raised as to the possibly unobserved or unknown occurrence of the

characteristic iu the ancestry of either A or C, or again as to the
chance of the characteristic arising as a congenital sport, quite inde
pendently of any heredity.     It seems unlikely that the observation
of rare and isolated cases of asserted telegony will lead to any very
satisfactory conclusions, although a well-directed series of experi
ments might undoubtedly do so. On the other hand, it is not impos
sible than an extensive and careful system of family measurements
might bring to light something of the nature of a telegonic influence
in mankind.
   If such a telegonic influence really exists, it may be supposed to
act in at least two and, very possibly, more ways.
   (a) There may be in rare and isolated cases some remarkable
change produced in the female by mating with a particular male, or
some remarkable retention of the male element.
   (6) There may be a gradually increasing approximation of the
female to the male as cohabitation is continued, or as the female
bears more and more offspring to the male.
   It is extremely unlikely that any system of family measurements
would suffice to bring out evidence bearing on (a). On the other
hand, a closer correlation between younger children and the father,
and a lesser correlation between younger children and the mother, as
compared with the correlation between elder children and their
parents might, perhaps, indicate a steady influence like (J) at work
in mankind.      Shortly, such measurements might suffice to answer
the question as to whether younger children take more after their
father and less after their mother than elder children.        Without
hazarding any physiological explanation as to the mode in which
telegonic influence can or does take place, we may still hope to get, at
any rate, negative evidence as to a possible steady telegonic influence
by an investigation of suitable family measurements.
   (2) Unfortunately, the collection of family data is by no means
an easy task, and to procure those head-measurements, which,           I
think, would be most satisfactory for the problem of heredity, would
require a large staff of ready assistants, and could only be undertaken
on the necessary scale by the action of some scientific society or
public body. The data concerning 800 to 900 families which have been
recently collected for me deal only with stature, span, and arm-length,
which are measurable with more or less accuracy by the untrained
observer, and are only suitable for more or less rough appreciations of
hereditary influence.    The numbers in each family measured were
strictly limited,  in order  to remove the influence of reproductive
selection from the determination of the correlation between parents
and children, and the result of this limitation has been that compara
tively few couples of elder and younger brothers, and of elder and
younger sisters are available.     They were, indeed, collected in the

        Mathematical Contributions    to the Theory   of Evolution.    275
first place with a view to the problem of heredity in the direct line,
and with no thought of their throwing any light on the problem of
telegony.    That steady telegonic influence might be deduced from
such family data has only recently occurred to me, and I should now
hesitate to publish any conclusions on this subject, based on some
                                        I
what mixed and sparse returns, did not consider that it may be a
long time before more extensive returns are available, and that the
publication of this method of dealing with telegony may induce others
to undertake the collection of a wider range of material.
   My own 800 family data cards did not provide a sufficiently large
number of either brother-brother or sister-sister couples to give a
strong hope of a difference between the correlation coefficients
sufficiently large as compared with its probable error to base any
legitimate conclusion upon. I, therefore, again borrowed from Mr.
Galton his 200 family data returns, and from these 1,000 families
was able to select 38f> brother-brother pairs and 450 sister-sister
pairs.    In these statistics each individual is only included in one
pair, and the difference in age between the elder and younger mem
bers of each pair differs very widely from pair to pair. In some cases
there may be several years between the ages and several intervening
children ; in others the members of the pair may be successive
children following each other in successive years. In each case all
we can say is, that if there be a steady telegonic influence, the rela
tion of the elder member to the parent will weigh down the same
scale, and in the final result we ought to find a distinctly greater or
less correlation, as the case may be.     I think a more serious objection
to the data than the variation in the number of years between
fraternal pairs is the mixture      I  have made of data collected at
different periods and in somewhat different manners. My own data
are drawn,   I think, from a wider class of the community than Mr.
Galton's.                                                I
             They are not exclusive of his class, but, think, cover his
class, and go somewhat further down in the social scale.      They suffice
to show that the means and variations change considerably from one
social stratum to another, and what is still more important that the
Galton-Functions or coefficients of correlation for heredity are far
from being constant even within the same race, as we pass from one
rank of life to a second.     Thus, my means for stature in the case of
both fathers and mothers are upwards of £ in. less than Mr. Galton's,
but my means agree fairly well with his results in the case of both
sons and daughters.      There are also good agreements and somewhat
puzzling disagreements not only in the variations, but, above all, in
the coefficients of correlation for heredity.    I reserve for the present
the full discussion of my heredity data, but I wish it to be quite
 understood that my conclusions in this paper are based, not upon the
best possible data, e.g., measurements made on one class of the com-

 mtraity under one system, bat upon all the data -which, for some time
 to come, appear likely to be available.            These data are neither quan
 titatively nor qualitatively ideal, but, on the other hand, they must
 be given a reasonable amount of weight in considering whether, at
 any rate in the case of one organ — stature, — any steady telegouic
 influence can be traced in man.
     The reduction from the family measurement-cards, the formation
 of the eight correlation tables, and the calculation of both variation
 and correlation coefficients have been undertaken by Miss Alice Lee
 of Bedford College, — a task requiring much labour and persistency.
 I  have independently verified, and in some minor points corrected
 her calculations, as well as added the probable errors of the con
 stants determined.

    All  the quantities have here been calculated precisely as in my
third memoir on the mathematical theory of evolution (see 1 Phil.
Trans.,' A, vol. 187, pp. 270 — 271). In this case, however, no child is
included twice as a child, and parents are not weighted with their
offspring. Thus reproductive selection is not allowed to influence the
results.
    It will be seen that the probable errors of the means and standard
deviations are, as in the former paper, too large to allow of
absolutely definite conclusions when those conclusions are not sup
ported by a continuous change of values, or directly verified by the
nnmbers of the earlier memoir. But one or two such conclusions
                           I
may be drawn, and will note them before passing to correlation.
    (i) The law of sexual interchange referred to in my former paper
(p. 274) is confirmed with greater uniformity.                 Fathers of sons are
sensibly less variable than fathers of daughters, and mothers of
daughters are sensibly less variable than mothers of sous.                   In other

         Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution.               271
 words, to judge from stature, the exceptional parent tends to have
 offspring of the opposite sex.
     (ii) Younger sons are taller and more variable than elder sons,
 and elder sons are taller and more valuable than fathers.
    This conclusion, although less markedly, appears in the results on
 pp. 270 and 281, of my former paper.                  It might be accounted
 for by   :
    (a) A secular change going on in the stature of the population,
             and even noticeable in the difference between the stature of
                                           '
             younger and elder sons.
    (6)   A further   growth of sons, and an ultimate shrinkage, which
             will leave them at the age of their fathers with the same
             mean height and variation.
    (c)   Conditions   of nurture on the average less favourable, and on
             the whole less varied in the case of elder than in that of
             younger children.*
    (d)   Natural   selection.    The difference between younger and elder
            sons   and between elder sons and fathers represents the
            selective death rate in man due to causes correlated with
            stature in the years between youth and manhood, and man
            hood and age. The difference is thus to be accounted for
            by a periodic and not a secular change.
    Possibly (a), (6), (c), and (d), may all contribute to the observed"
results.    It cannot be denied that (d) has a special fascination of its
own for the student of evolution, but prolonged study of the laws of
growth must precede the assertion that wo have here, or in any
similar case, real evidence of an actual case of natural selection.
    (iii) Younger daughters are taller than elder daughters and elder
daughters than mothers.
    This is in complete agreement with the result for fathers and sons.
Further :
   Daughters, as a class are far more variable than mothers, but
while in the earlier memoir younger daughters were sensibly more
variable than elder daughters — and thus exactly corresponded with
sons — elder daughters are in this case more variable than younger.              I
have been unable to find any slip in the tables or calculations, which
might account for this divergence.               It exceeds considerably the
probable error of the observations, and is not in accordance with
the general law connecting the variation of parent and offspring evi
denced for both sexes in the earlier, and for sons in the present
memoir — e.g., the variation — -whether it be due to growth-change,
   * Mr. Francis Galton   suggests this as a possible cause.        I
                                                             It has, think, to be
taken in conjunction with a greater amount of parental experiment, not only in the
birth, but in the nurture of the elder children.
                                                                      T 2

   (4) The following are the coefficients of correlation             (r) and    the
coefficients of regression (R) for parents and sons :

            Mother and younger sons    . . . 0-4111±0-0264       0-4488
   If   we measure, as seems reasonable, the hereditary influence of
parentage by the magnitude of the coefficient of correlation between
parent and offspring, then several important conclusions may be
drawn from this table.
   (i) There is no sensible difference between the influences of the
father on younger and on elder sons, and no sensible difference
between the influences of the mother on younger and on elder sons.
   If we pay attention to such slight differences as exist, there would
appear, not to be an increase of paternal and a decrease of maternal
influence on younger children, but an extremely slight increase of
both. In other words, bo far as stature in sons is concerned, judged
by correlation : No steady telegonic influence exists.
    (ii) There is a very slight prepotency of the father over the
mother in the case of both younger and elder sons ; a prepotency
which will be slightly magnified when account is taken of the abso
lute stature of the two parents.
   But the great prepotency of paternal inheritance noticed in the
former memoir is not confirmed.              The co-efficients of maternal in
heritance have been increased by more than 30 per cent, (from 0*293
to 0410), while those of paternal inheritance (0'396 as compared
with 0-414) have remained almost stationary.               This result seems to
show the want of constancy of the Galton's functions for heredity
 within the same race.           An explanation on the ground that the
present statistics embrace a wider range of the community than the
earlier, and possibly a more closely correlated class,* fails, at any
rate in part, owing to the sensible constancy of the paternal correla
tion.     The main difference of course between the present and the
former statistics is the exclusion of the influence of reproductive
   *  I  have pointed out (loe. cit., p. 284) that working and lower middle class
families appear to be more closely correlated than those of the upper middle class.

         Mathematical     Contributions  to the Theory  of Evolution.    279
selection, but why should this be expected to influence only the
mother ? The father of many children remains equally influential,
but the mother's relation is weakened when we give weight to the
quantity not the relative ages of her children.        This is not a steady
telegonic influence, but a correlation between fertility and heredi
tary influence in mothers, which if it could be verified by further
observation,     would undoubtedly      be  of high significance.   I  would
accordingly suggest as a possible law of heredity, deserving careful
investigation, that : Hereditary influence in the female varies inversely
as  fertility.
    In                 "
        my paper on Reproductive Selection," (' Hoy. Soc. Proc.,' vol.
59, p. 301),   I  have pointed out the important evolutionary results
which flow from a correlation between fertility and any inheritable
characteristic.     If a law of the above character should be established
after further investigation, it is conceivable that it may act as an
automatic check on the extreme effects of reproductive selection.
    (iii) The above results give us for practicable purposes a quite
sufficiently close value of the correlation between parents and sons,
when the influence of reproductive selection is excluded.            Judging
from stature the correlation between sons and parents is very closely
given by
                                  (HI ±0-03.
The        adopted by Mr. Galton, may,      I think, safely be increased by
25 per cent., and further, the assumption that collateral heredity is
                                                I
twice as strong as direct heredity must, hold, be finally discarded,
for no determination of the former has given such a high value
as 0 82.
    (5) Hitherto we have regarded only the coefficients of correlation,
and considered them to measure the strength of the hereditary in
fluence, but it must be remembered that the means of elder and
younger sons are not the same, and that there is another way of
looking at the problem. We may ask : Do younger or elder sons
 differ most from the stature of their father, and is the order altered
 in the case of the mother ?
    If we neglect the influence of sexual selection (see " Contributions to
 Math. Theory of Evolution," HI, pp. 287—8) we have, if h/ and hm
 be deviations of father and mother from their means, and Me and
 My be mean heights of corresponding fraternities of elder and younger
 sons   in inches :
                     Me  = 69-1494 + 0-4281fc/+0-4374/im.
                     M, = 6T9-1948+0-4427V+0-4488^.
 Now the ratio of the mean heights of parents is G8-5740         : 63"3078 =

280                            Prof. Karl Pearson.
1  0832,* while the ratios of 0-4374 to 0 4281 and 0 4488 to 0 4427,
are  only 1'0219 and 1-0139 respectively, thus there is still a slight
prepotency of paternal influence on stature to be recorded.                    (See
§ (4)   (»))
    Confining onr attention to the differences in stature for fathers and
sons corresponding to all mothers whatsoever, we have, if De/ be the
difference in stature between father and corresponding fraternity of
older sons,         between father and fraternity of younger sons :
                             De/  = 05754 -05719/i/.
                             Dy = 0-6208-0-5573A/.
    Hence the difference betwen the father and fraternity of younger
sons will be greater than the difference between the father and the
corresponding fraternity of elder sons unless the father be 3110
inches less, or 1-059 more than the average.             But 3'11 is about 1'2
and 1'059 about 0'415 times the standard deviation of the stature of
fathers, or, fraternities of younger sons are nearer in stature to their
father than fraternities of elder sons in about 46 per cent, of cases.
    Similarly if Dm, DyM represent the differences of stature of mothers
and fraternities of elder and younger sons respectively, we have in
inches
                             D„. = 5-8416-0-5626^.
                             Dy,„  = 5-8870-0-5512/iM.
    Thus fraternities of yonnger sons are always more divergent than
fraternities of elder sons from the stature of their mothers, unless the
mother be 3'982 inches less, or 10'53 inches more than the average.
These are T6 and 4'24 times the standard deviation in stature of
mothers ; or, only in about 5'5 per cent, of cases are fraternities of
younger sons nearer in stature to their mothers than elder sons.
    Now, it is difficult to read into these results any evidence for a
steady telegonic influence.          It is true that the case of younger sons
being    more   like  their parents than elder sons occurs in eight times as
many cases with the father as with the mother, but the broad fact
remains that in more than half the cases, judged by difference of
stature, the elder son is more like the father than the younger son.
 In fact, examined in this way by difference of stature — not an un
natural manner of first approaching the problem — the true closeness
of parent and offspring appears to be quite obscured by some secular,
or, at any rate, periodic (see § 3) evolution in stature between
successive generations — an evolution which even makes itself felt in
the interval between younger and elder sons.

this fraction for the sexual ratio for stature.

     (6) Turning to the results for daughters, we have the following
 table for the coefficients of correlation and regression : —
             Table  III. — Inheritance  of Stature by Daughters.

         Mothers and younger daughters  . . .   0-4542 ±0-0230      0 -4763
    These results, more numerous than those for sons, are, for reasons
 which I am nnable to explain, much more divergent.               We may note
the following points : —
    (i) There   is a sensible difference between       the coefficients of corre
lation for either parents with younger and elder daughters. Thus,
the difference of the coefficients for fathers with elder and younger
 daughters is 0-0453, and the probable error of this only 0'032 ; while
for mothers the corresponding difference is 0'0589, and the probable
error of the difference only 0'0328.             The difference, however, is
in the opposite sense. We are thus face to face with an increasing
maternal      and a decreasing paternal influence on the stature of
daughters.      In other words, our statistics are entirely opposed to any
steady telegonic influence on the stature of daughters.                If snch a
thing    were  conceivable,  we should   be   confronted   with  the case   of the
mother influencing the father, the reverse of telegony.
    (ii) The mean correlation of fathers and daughters is very slightly
higher than that of mothers and daughters (0-4602 as compared with
0-4247).      Thus, to judge by the mean coefficients of correlation, the
father is slightly more prepotent than the mother in heredity.                The
mean coefficients of regression are for fathers 0'4244, and for mothers
0'4528, or in the ratio of 1 : 1'067, but the ratio of the paternal to
the maternal stature is 1*083, or this slight prepotency is still pre
served if we judge the matter by regression coefficients. Again, we
notice an immense increase (0-2841 to 0'4247) in the correlation
between mothers and daughters when we compare the present results
with those of my earlier memoir. As an explanation of this, have            I
already suggested the possibility of a law exhibiting a relation
between fertility and hereditary influence in mothers (§ 4 (ii) ).
   (iii) The   mean coefficient  of correlation in stature between either
parent and a daughter may be taken to be —
                                  0-44±0-02.

282      Mathematical       Contributions        to the Theory    of Evolution.
Thus, it does not differ very widely from the value suggested (0"41)
for sons, but is even further removed from the value (0'33) at first
determined by Mr. Galton.
   The greater correlation between sons and both parents noticed in
my first memoir is not borne out by the present statistics ; the
advantage is now — it is true to a much less extent — with daughters.
   On the whole,        I
                      am not well satisfied with these results for
daughters.       I
               can see no persistent source of error in the method of
collecting the observations, nor can I find any mistake in the calcu
lations.     I
            can only trust that more elaborate returns and measure
ments of other characteristics may some day throw light on what
now appear to be anomalies.
   (7) Finally, I may just notice what conclusions are to be drawn,
if we pay attention -to the absolute difference in stature between
parents and daughters.     Let cm and                ^
                                           be the differences in stature
between elder daughters and mothers, and younger daughters and
mothers respectively, then in inches we have for the corresponding
arrays
                                    -            -
         :
                             cm         0-7450       0-5707fe„.
                                    = 1-0406-0-5237AM.
Thus, arrays of younger daughters differ more from their mothers
in stature than arrays of elder daughters, if the mothers be more than
6'29 in. below the mean or more than T63 in. above the mean, or if
their deviations are not within the limits of about — 2'64 and 0'68
times the standard deviation of mothers. This gives us about 74 to
to 75 per cent., of elder Bisters nearer in stature to their mothers than
younger sisters.
  If B/t, Sfy be the stature differences for fathers and daughters, we
have :
                              Sfi   = 4-4100-O5472A/.
                             Sfy    = 4-1144-0-6039/i/.
   Here, so long as the father lies between 5"21 in. less and 7-41 in.
more than the average, the array of younger daughters will more
nearly approach him in stature than the array of elder daughters.
These limits correspond to 1"89 and 2'68 times the standard devia
tion of fathers. Accordingly, about 90 to 97 per cent, of younger
sisters are closer in stature to their fathers than elder sisters. Thus,
if we had started the discussion of the problem from a consideration
of the relative nearness in stature of daughter to father and mother,
we should have found that a great majority of younger sisters were
nearer to their fathers than their elder sisters, and a considerable
majority of elder sisters nearer to their mother than their younger
sisters.  We might then have concluded that there were substantial

     Magnetic Permeability       of Liquid    Oxygen and     Liquid Air.       283
grounds for inferring the existence of a telegonic influence. But it
is clear that if there be anything of the nature either of a periodic or
of a secular change in stature going on, then since men are taller than
women, any group of younger women will appear closer to their
fathers than to their mothers, when compared with a group of elder
sisters. Thus, no legitimate argument as to a telegonic influence can
be based on such a result.        I have purposely considered this method
of approaching the problem, because it is the method which first
occurred to me, as it probably may do to others.                    It can very
easily, however, lead to our mistaking for a real telegonic influence
an effect of periodic or secular evolution, or, indeed, of different con
ditions of nurture.
   (7) In conclusion, we may,           I think, sum up the statistics dis
cussed in this paper as follows —     :
    (i) So far as stature is concerned there is no evidence whatever of
             a steady telegonic    influence of the male upon the female
             among mankind.
    (ii)  It is improbable that the coefficients of correlation which
             measure the strength of heredity between parents and off
             spring are constant for all classes even of the same race.
   For stature in     the case of parents and offspring      of both sexes, the
value 0"42, or say 3/7, may be taken as a fair working value, until
more comprehensive measurements are made.                   This makes heredi
tary influence in the direct line stronger than has hitherto been
supposed.
    (iii)   The divergence between the results of this memoir and that
             of the former memoir on " Regression, Heredity, and Pan
             mixia " would be fairly well accounted for, if there be a
             hitherto unobserved correlation          between the hereditary
             influence and the fertility of woman.

"284          Profs.  J. A.   Fleming and     J. Dewar.       On the
 nnd were subsequently described to the Koyal Institution in a lecture
-delivered in 1892.* We bave for some time past directed our attention
 to the question of determining       the numerical values of the magnetic
 permeability and magnetic susceptibility of liquid oxygen, with tbe
 object of determining not only the magnitude of these physical con
 stants, but also whether they vary with the magnetic force nnder which
they are determined.
    Although a large number of determinations have been made by
 many observers of the magnetic susceptibility of different liquids
 taken at various temperatures, difficulties of a particular kind occur
 in dealing with liquid oxygen. One method adopted for determining
 the magnetic susceptibility of a liquid is to observe the increase of
 mutual induction of two conducting circuits suitably placed, first in
 air, and then when the air is replaced by the liquid in question, the
 susceptibility of which is to be determined. A second method con
 sists in determining the mechanical force acting on a known mass
of the liquid when placed in a non-uniform magnetic field. Owing
 to the difficulty of preventing        entirely the evaporation of liquid
oxygen, even when contained in a good vacuum vessel, and the
 impossibility of sealing it up in a bulb or tube, and having regard
 to the effect of the low temperature of the liquid in deforming by
 contraction and altering the conducting power of coils of wire placed
 in it, it was necessary to devise some method which should be indepen
 dent of the exact constancy in mass of tbe liquid gas operated upon,
 and independent also of slight changes in the form of any coils of
 wire which might be used in it. After many unsuccessful preliminary
 experiments the method which was finally adopted as best complying
 with the conditions introduced by the peculiar nature of the substance
  operated upon is as follows : —
     A small closed circuit transformer was constructed, the core of which
 could be made to consist either of liquid oxygen or else immediately
 changed to gaseous oxygen, having practically the same temperature.
  This transformer consisted of two coils, the primary coil was made of
 forty-seven turns of No. 12 S.W.G. wire, this wire was wound into
 a spiral, having a rectangular shape, the rectangular turns having a
 length of 8 cm. and a width of 1'8 cm. This rectangular-sectioned
 spiral, consisting of one layer of wire of forty-seven turns, was bent
 round a thin brass tube, 8 cm. long and 2| cm. in diameter, so that
 it formed a closed circular solenoid of one layer of wire. The wire
 was formed of high conductivity copper, doubly insulated with cotton,
 and each single turn or winding having a rectangular form.
     The turns of covered wire closely touched each other on the inner
 circumference of the toroid, but on the external circumference were

or leave the annular inner core.
   The nature of this transformer is shown in Fig.           1.

   The mean perimeter of this rectangular-sectioned endless solenoid
was 13| cm., and the solenoid had, therefore, very nearly 3"5 turnR
per cm. of mean perimeter.          When immersed in liquid oxygen a coil
of this kind will carry a current of 50 amperes.            When a current of
A amperes is sent through this coil the mean magnetising force in
the axis of this solenoid is, therefore, represented by 4'375 times the
current through the wire, hence it is clear that it is possible to produce
in the interior of this solenoid a mean magnetising force of over
200 C.G.S. units.      This primary coil had then wound over it, in two
sections, about 400 or 500 turns of No. 26 silk-covered copper wire to
 form a secondary coil. The primary and secondary coils were sepa
rated by layers of silk ribbon.          The exact number of turns was not
counted, and as      will  be seen from what follows       it was not necessary

            Profs.  J. A. Fleming and     J. Dewar.    On the
to know the number.       The coil so constructed constituted a small
induction coil or transformer, with a closed air-core circuit, but which
when immersed iD a liquid, by the penetration of the liquid into the
interior of the primary coil, became changed into a closed circuit
transformer, with a liquid core. The transformer so designed was
capable of being placed underneath liquid oxygen contained in a
large vacuum vessel, and when so placed formed a transformer of the
closed  circuit type, with a core of liquid oxygen.   The coefficient of
mutual induction of these two circuits, primary       and secondary, is
therefore altered by immersing the transformer in liquid oxygen,
but the whole of the induction produced in the interior of the
primary coil is always linked with the whole of the turns of the
secondary coil, and the only form-change that can be made is a small
change in the mean perimeter of the primary turns due to the con
traction of the coil as a whole.   In experiments with this transformer
the transformer was always lifted out of the liquid oxygen into the
cold gaseous oxygen lying on the surface of the liquid oxygen, and
which is at the same temperature.        On lifting out the transformer,
the liquid oxygen drains away from the interior of the primary coil,
and is replaced by gaseous oxygen of very nearly the same tem
perature.
   The vacuum vessel used had a depth of GO cm. outside and 53 cm.
inside, and an internal diameter of 7 cm. It held 2 litres of liquid
oxygen when full; but, as a matter of fact, 4 or 5 litres of liquid
oxygen were poured into it in the course of the experiment.
   Another induction coil was then constructed, consisting of a long-
cylindrical coil wound over the four layers of wire, and a secondary
circuit was constructed to this coil, consisting of a certain number of
turns wound round the outside of the primary coil, and a small
adjusting secondary coil, consisting of a thin rod of wood wound over
with very open spirals of wire. The secondary turns on the outside
of the primary coil were placed in series with the turns of the thin
adjusting coil, and the whole formed a secondary circuit, partly out
side and partly inside the long primary cylindrical coil, the coefficient
of mutual induction of this primary and secondary coil being capable
of being altered by very small amounts by sliding into or out of the
primary coil the small secondary coil. This last induction coil, which
will be spoken of as the balancing coil, was connected up to the small
transformer, as just described, as follows : —
   The primary coil of the small transformer was connected in series
 with the primary coil of the balancing induction coil, and the two
terminals of the series were connected through a reversing switch
 and ammeter with an electric supply circuit, so that a current of
 known strength could be reversed through the circuit, consisting of
 the two primary coils in series. The two secondary coils, the one on

     Magnetic Permeability    of Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Air.            287
the transformer and the one on the balancing induction coil, were con
nected in opposition to one another through a sensitive ballistic
galvanometer in such a manner that on reversing the primary
current the galvanometer was affected by the difference between the
electromotive forces set up in the two secondary coils, and a very fine
adjustment conld be made by moving in or out the adjusting coil of
the balancing induction coil.
    The arrangement of circuits is shown in fig. 2.

       Arrangement of the Circuits of the Transformer and Induction Coil.
    For the purpose of standardising           the   ballistic galvanometer
employed, the primary coil of the balancing induction coil could
be cut out of circuit, so that the inductive effect in the ballistic
galvanometer circuit was due to the primary current of the closed
circuit transformer alone. A resistance box was also included in the
circuit of the ballistic galvanometer.        The resistance of the ballistic
galvanometer was about 18 ohms, and the resistance of the whole
secondary circuit 30*36 ohms. The experiment then consisted in
first balancing the secondary electromotive forces in the two coils
exactly against one another, then immersing the transformer in liquid
oxygen, the result of which was to disturb the inductive balance, and
in consequence of the magnetic permeability of the liquid oxygen core
being greater than unity, a deflection of the ballistic galvanometer
was observed on reversing the same primary current.            The induction

288         Profs. J. A. Fleming and      J. Dewar.   On the
through the primary circuit of the small transformer is increased in
the same proportion that the permeability of the transformer core
is increased by the substitution of liquid oxygen for gaseous oxygen,
and hence the ballistic deflection measures at once the amount by
which the magnetic permeability of the liquid oxygen is in excess
over that of the air or gaseous oxygen forming the core of the trans
former when the transformer is lifted out of the liquid. As a matter
of fact it was never necessary to obtain the inductive balance pre
cisely. All that was necessary was to observe the throw of the bal
listic galvanometer, first when the transformer was wholly immersed
under the surface of liquid oxygen, and, secondly, when it was lifted
oat into the gaseous oxygen lying on the surface of the liquid, the
strength of the primary current reversed being in each case the
same.    In order to standardise the galvanometer and to interpret the
meaning of the ballistic throw, it was necessary to cut out of circuit
the primary coil of the balancing induction coil, and to reverse
through the primary circuit of the small transformer a known small
primary current, noting at the same time the ballistic throw pro
duced on the ballistic galvanometer, this being done when the
transformer was underneath the surface of liquid oxygen. It will
be seen, therefore, that this method requires no calculation of any
coefficient or mutual induction, neither does it involve any know
ledge of the number of secondary turns on the transformer, nor of
the resistance of the secondary circuit ; all thai is necessary for a
successful determination of the magnetic permeability of the liquid
oxygen is that the secondary circuit of the transformer should
remain practically of the same temperature during the time when
the throw of the ballistic galvanometer is being observed, both
with the transformer underneath the liquid oxygen and out of the
liquid oxygen. If then the result of reversing a current of A
amperes through the two primary coils in series when the secondary
coils are opposed is to give a ballistic throw, D, and if the result of
reversing a small current a amperes through the primary coil of the
transformer alone is to produce a ballistic throw, d, then if fi is the-
magnetic permeability of liquid oxygen, that of the gaseous oxygen
lying above the liquid and at th6 same temperature being taken as
unity, we have the following relation : —
which determines the value of fi.
   Deferring for a moment the correction to be applied to determine
the value of the magnetic permeability of liquid oxygen in terms of
that of a vacuum, the following are the results of observation : —

    The above table shows the results of the observations made                       with
the small transformer alternately placed underneath the surface of
liquid oxygen, and then lifted up into the cold gaseous oxygen lying
above the surface of the liquid oxygen.                It will be noticed that the
ballistic throws in each set of observHtions are not constant, but that
there is a tendency, usually, for the throw to increase if repeated,
whilst the transformer is still maintained in the same condition,
This is in all probability due to the fact that the continued passage
of the primary current heats the primary circuit of the balancing
induction coil, and hence heats, also, by radiation, the secondary coil
of the balancing induction coil, and, therefore, by enlarging the area
of the adjusting coil, continually breaks down the inductive balance.
It was found necessary, therefore, to take the observations in groups
at equal intervals of time. First, a group of three observations was
taken, the transformer being in liquid oxygen, the balance being, as
nearly as possible, obtained.          Then the transformer was lifted out of
the liquid oxygen, and the ballistic throws again taken, reversing the
same primary current ; next again immersed in liquid oxygen, and
finally once more taken out of the liquid oxygen. Taking the sets

of observations marked I, II,    III, IV,  the mean of the means of the
three observations in Set3    I   and  III, corrected for the variation in
the primary current, were taken as the result of the measurement in
liquid oxygen, and this result was then compared with the ballistic
throws in Set II.
    Again, the mean of the means of sets of observations        II  and IV,
properly corrected for variation of primary current, were compared
 with the mean of the observations in Set     III, and the result is to give
the data for calculating the permeability of the liquid oxygen for a
 primary current through the primary coil of the transformer of about
37 amperes, corresponding very nearly to a mean magnetising force
of 166 C.G.S. units. The sum or difference of these means of the
 throws, taken in the liquid oxygen and out of the liquid oxygen,
 depending on whether they aro on the opposite or the same side of
 the zero of the scale, gives us the value of the quantity denoted by
                  I
 D in the Table below, and in the formula for the value of /*.
    The above sets of observations, I, II, III, and IV, refer to a
 primary current of about 37 amperes ; but similar sets of observa
 tions were taken with a primary current of about 8 amperes, 28
 amperes, and 50 amperes respectively, and the results of all these
 observations, which are included in the sets of observations,     I  to XII,
 above given, have been reduced in Table         I below to show the mag
 netic permeability of the liquid oxygen corresponding to different
 megnetising currents.     The set of observations marked Experiment
 V and Experiment VI in the above table of results, gives the observa
 tions for standardising the ballistic galvanometer.       In the first case
 the primary coil of the balancing induction coil was cut out, and a
 primary current, having a value of 0-1145 ampere, was reversed
 through the primary coil of the transformer alone, and gave ballistic
 deflections as stated in the observations in Set V. These observations
 serve to standardise the galvanometer and interpret the meaning of
 the throw obtained when the large current is reversed through the
 primaries of the two induction coils, the secondaries of which are
 opposed. It will be noticed that one important advantage of the
 above-described method is that the quantity which we desired to
 know, viz., the amount by which the presence of the liquid oxygen
 increases the magnetic permeability of the core of the transformer, is
 the quantity which is measured directly, and that any error in the
 measurement of this quantity does not affect the permeability to
 anything like the same proportional extent. An error of about 10
 per cent, in the measurement of the ballistic throw would only affect
 the fourth place of decimals in the number representing the perme
 ability of the liquid oxygen.
     The results of all the above observations, when reduced, are com
  prised in the following table : —

    The values of the permeability given in the foregoing table are not
all of equal weight.
    The calculated value of fi — 1 depends apon the observed ballistic
throw, and this cannot be read to a high degree of accuracy when the
throw is as small as 4 millimetres.                  We consider that the best result
is   obtained     by taking      the  mean   of  the  values for the primary currents,
37 8, 36'8, and 50'5 amperes, and these values give p = T00287, with
a probable accuracy of + 0 0002.                    This value of the permeability of
the liquid oxygen corresponds                 to  a  magnetising force lying between
106 and 220 C.G.S. units.                It will be seen that this method is best
applicable to the determination of the permeability under large
magnetising forces ; and that these observations do not, in them
selves, allow us to state whether the permeability is a constant for
all forces, or is a function of the value of the force.
     In the next place the value is a relative one. The number 1-00287
is the ratio of the magnetic permeability of liquid oxygen to that of
the gaseous oxygen nearly at the same temperature resting upon the
surface of the liquid. We were not able by this method to detect the
difference between the permeability of the cold gaseous oxygen lying
on the surface of the liquid oxygen when in quiet ebullition, and which
has a temperature of about —182° C, but a density of at least three
times that of oxygen at 0° C, when compared with that of gaseous
oxygen at ordinary temperature, and under the normal pressure. In
a very valuable memoir on the determination of magnetic suscepti
bilities, M. P. Curie* has examined the susceptibility of gaseous

           Magnetic         Permeability of Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Air.                 293
 oxygen at  different temperatures, and shown that between the limits
 of 0° C. and 452° C. the magnetic susceptibility of oxygen (K) per
 uuit of mass is a function of the absolute temperature T, such that
                                                    10"   K   = 33700/T,
 and that the value of K (per gram) at 0° C. is, therefore, 123/10".
 The mass of   1 c.c. of oxygen gas at 0° C. and 760 mm. is 0 0014107
 gram, and, reciprocally, the volume of one gram is 708-9 c.c. at 0° C.
 and 760 mm.
      Hence the magnetic                       susceptibility of gaseous oxygen at 0° C. and
 760         unit of volume (one c.c.) would be 123 x 0 00141 x 10-6
           mm. per
 = 0173 x 10~c, which is not very different from that obtained by
other observers.*
      If then it could           that gaseous oxygen followed the
                                         be supposed
same law down to —182° C., and taking the gas in a condition when
the density is nearly  000423, the volume susceptibility       (It) at
—182° C. would be 1*6 X 10-', and hence the permeability (/<), where
                                                            fl =    1 4-    ivh,
should be          1    00002.
      Ithowever, certain that the susceptibility per unit of mass will
            is,
not continue to increase in accordance with the hyperbolic         law,
because this would imply that at the absolute zero of temperature
the susceptibility would be infinitely great, and hence the above
number     -00002 gives a superior limit for the permeability of the
              I
gaseous oxygen at —182° C. lying on the surface of the liquid oxygen.t
   The conclusion     that the correction to be applied to the above
                                    is
observed value of    for the liquid oxygen, viz., T00287, to refer

oxygen with far greater accuracy. This method consists in observing
the mechanical force which acts upon a vacuum bulb or mass of
matter of known and very low susceptibility when it is suspended
free from gravity in a vessel of liquid oxygen, and in a variable mag
netic field.   Under these conditions a vacuum bulb of very thin
glass would behave like a strongly diamagnetic body, and if the mag
netic susceptibility of the vacuum bulb or test mass is klt and that of
liquid oxygen is k% for equal volumes, then the apparent diamagnetic
susceptibility of the mass will be — (&a — k^), and the actual para
magnetic susceptibility of liquid oxygen may be deduced from a
knowledge of &i and — (k2 — ki~).      By this method we hope to be
able to determine whether the permeability of liquid oxygen is a
function of the magnetising force.      The latest experimental results
and measurements made with solutions of iron salts, such as those
made recently by Mr. J. S. Townsend,* appear to show that the
magnetic permeability of solutions of these iron salts is a constant
quantity at least for a range of magnetic forces varying from 1 to
9 C.G.S. units.
   The value, viz. 1'00287, as determined by us for the magnetic
permeability of liquid oxygen, shows that the magnetic susceptibility
 (k) per unit of volume is 228/10".       It is interesting to compare
this value with the value obtained by Mr. Townsend for an aqueous
 solution of ferric chloride, and which he states can be calculated by
the equation
                                10'k    = 916 w— 0          77,
where w is the weight of salt in grams per cubic centimetre, and k
the magnetic susceptibility.     Even in a saturated solution, w cannot
exceed 0 6, hence, from the above equation, we find the value of the
magnetic susceptibility of a saturated solution of one of the most para
magnetic iron salts, viz., ferric chloride, is 54/10" for magnetic forces
between 1 and 9.     This agrees fairly well with other determinations
of the same constant.      On the other hand, the magnetic suscepti
bility of liquid oxygen for the same volume is 228/10", or more than
four times as great. The unique position of liquid oxygen in respect
 of its magnetic susceptibility is thus strikingly shown. It       how                is,
 ever, interesting to note that its permeability lies far below that of
 certain solid iron alloys generally called non-magnetic.
    The 12 per cent, manganese steel of Mr. R. A. Hadfield       usually         is
 spoken of as non-magnetic, yet the magnetic permeability of this
 last substance has been shown to be l-3 or 1"4.
    We have applied the foregoing method also to the determination
 of the magnetic permeability of liquid air.     Since liquid air which

    At the time of  these observations the liquid air used had probably
become     almost entirely liquid oxygen by the evaporation of the
 nitrogen.     The figure, however, serves to check approximately that
of the liquid oxygen.
    In conclusion, we desire   to express our thanks to Mr. J.  E. Petavel
for   the assistance he has given to ns in the above work.       We hope
shortly to be able to    make   a further  contribution to this portion of
 the investigations on which we are engaged, on the electrical and
 magnetic constants of liquid oxygen, and which will include a deter
mination of the dielectric constant of liquid oxygen, made with the
 object of determining the extent to which this sabstance obeys
Maxwell's law connecting magnetic permeability, dielectric constant,
and optical refractivity.

                              President's Address.                        299
     Sir William Grove presented the rare spectacle of steady and dis
  tinguished devotion to science iu spite of the claims of an exacting
  profession. Grove was an eminent lawyer. Called to the bar in 1835,
  he was for some time kept from active work by ill health ; but he
  subsequently acquired a considerable practice, and becoming a Queen's
  Counsel in 1853, was for some years the leader of the South Wales
  Circuit. His practice was mainly in patent cases, and the reputation
  he obtained in that field led to his being appointed a member of the
  Royal Commission on the Patent Laws.             His work as an advocate
  was, however, by no means confined to such matters ; he was one of
 the counsel — Serjeant Shee and Dr. Kenealy being the others — who
 defended the Rugeley poisoner, William Palmer, and he was engaged
  in many other causes celebres.
     The eminent position to which he had risen at the bar led to his
 appointment in November, 1871, as a Judge of the old Court of
 Common Pleas, a post which in 1875 was converted by the Judica
 ture Act into that of a Judge of the High Court. This office he held
 until his retirement in 1887, when he became a member of tho Privy
Council.
     Throughout the greater part of his long and distinguished legal
career, Grove's love of science impelled him to devote a large share
 of his energies to its pursuit.      It is remarkable that his first paper,
which was communicated to the British Association in 1839, and
 which also appeared in the ' Comptes Rendus,' and in Poggendorff's
   Annalen,' contained a description of the " Grove's cell," which
 '
 was afterwards used in every physical laboratory in the world.          This
 was succeeded by a long series of memoirs, chiefly on electrical sub
jects, among which one of the best known is that on the gas battery.
 In 1842 he delivered, at the London Institution, an address which
 was, in the following year, developed into the celebrated series of
 lectures:
             " On the Correlation of Physical Forces."       In these he dis
cussed what we shonld now call the transformations of energy ; and,
                                     " Historical Sketch of the Science of
 thongh Professor Tait, in his
                                                  " attention to the
 Energy," * assigns precedence in calling                              gener
        of such  transformations
                                    " to Mrs. Somerville, there can be no
 ality
 doubt that Grove was an independent and very advanced thinker on
 that subject.
     For many years Sir William Grove took a very prominent part in
 the affairs of the Royal Society, and was one of the most active pro
  moters of the reform of its constitution, which took place in 1847,
  It is largely to his efforts that we owe our present system of electing
  only a specified number of Fellows in each year.          He was also one
  of the founders of the    " Philosophical Club."
     He was President of the British Association         in 1866, and, in the
                            " '

300                         A nniversary Meeting.
course of his address, observed:        "The Kew Observatory, the petted
child of the British Association, may possibly become an important
national establishment ; and, if so, while it will not, I trust, lose its
character of a home of untrammelled physical research, it will have
superadded some of the functions of the Meteorological Department
of the Board of Trade, with a staff of skilful and experienced
observers."*       Although the British Association long ago handed
over the care of its " petted child
                                         " to a Committee
                                                              appointed by the
 Royal Society, the Society and the Association have lately appointed
a joint Committee to urge the Government to supply the funds for
                                                   " national establishment "
converting the Kew Observatory into a
similar to the Reichsanstalt at Charlottenburg. We are thus striving
to realise to-day the suggestion thrown out, thirty years ago, by
Grove.
   In Sir Joseph Prestwich we have lost almost the last link that
remained which connected geologists of the present day with the
founders of the science in the first half of this century.            To him we
are  indebted,  not only for the first comprehensive classification of the
tertiary beds of this country — to several of which he assigned the
names by which they will henceforth be universally known — but,
also, for their correlation with the strata of the Paris Basin.              To
him, also, is due the credit of having been the first to establish the
authenticity of the remain* of human workmanship found in the
drift-deposits of the valley of the Somme, and of thus having laid
secure foundations on which arguments as to the extreme antiquity of
man upon the earth may be based.             In France his name was known
and respected as much as in England, and it would be hard to say
how much of the advance in geological knowledge during the last
sixty years was not due to his unintermitted labours, which extended
over the whole of that period.
    The earliest scientific investigation of Aimand Hippolyte Louis
Fizeau was on the use of bromine in photography, and was published
in 1841. He will always be remembered as the first who carried out-
experiments designed to measure the velocity of light produced by a
terrestrial source, and travelling through a comparatively small dis
tance near the surface of the earth. These observations, made in
1849, were very difficult; but the value ot the method employed is
attested by the fact that a quarter of a century afterwards it was
adopted by M. Cornu, and that with the improved apparatus employed
by him it gave results of the highest accuracy.
   A few years afterwards Fizeau performed another classical experi

    Ho also devised an extremely delicate method (based on the inter
ference of light) of determining the coefficients of thermal expansion
of small bodies, such as crystals.      The instrument he designed has
been carefully studied by the Bureau International          des Pi;ids et
Mesares, with very satisfactory results.
    On account of these and other researches, M. Fizeau has, for nearly
half a century, occupied a conspicuous position among European
physicists.     He was awarded the Rumford Medal in 1866, and
became a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1875.
    Our distinguished Foreign Member, Professor Hubert Anson
Newton, Senior Professor of Mathematics at the Yale University,
New Haven, died at his home in New Haven on the 12th of August
last.    He was born at Sherbourne, in the State of New York, in
1830 ; studied at Yale College, where he graduated in 1850, and was
called to the Chair of Mathematics in the University at the early
age of twenty-five.
    On the organisation of the Observatory of the University in 1882,
Professor Newton was appointed Director ; and though he resigned
this position in 1884, the whole policy and success of the Observatory
ever since, and, indeed, its very existence, are in no small measure
due to his warm interest and untiring efforts.
    Professor   Newton's name will ever remain associated with his
important researches on Meteor Astronomy, beginning as early as
1860, and with his inquiry into the possible capture of comets by
Jupiter and other planets. His historical investigations, and discus
 sions of the original accounts, showed that the phenomena of meteor
 showers are of a permanent character, and come within lhe range
 of Celestial Dynamics, and that predictions of returning meteoric
 displays are possible.
    Professor Newton was President of the American Association for
 the Advancement of Science in 1885, and was for many years an
 Associate Editor of the ' American Journal of Science.' He was a
 man of noble character, held in universal esteem, and greatly beloved
 by all those to whom he was personally known.
    The death of August Kekule will be felt as a severe loss to
 chemical science all over the world.      Not only did his great activity
 in original research enrich organic chemistry with many new and
 interesting compounds, but his announcement of the tetradic valency
 of carbon, and, especially, his theoretical conception of the benzene
 ring, gave an impulse to the study of structural chemistry which has
 introduced order into the vast array of organic compounds, both of
 the alcoholic and aromatic types, and has not, even yet, expended
 itself.   In recognition of his life-long work, the Council of the Royal
  Society awarded Professor Kekulc the Copley Medal in 1885.
    Another Foreign Member who lias passed away from us during

b02                       Anniversary Meeting.
the year is the distinguished mineralogist and geologist, M. Daubree.
After leaving the Ecole Polytechnique in 1832, he was sent on a
mission to investigate the modes of occurrence of tin-ore in Cornwall
and on the Continent.      His reports showed such ability that he was
appointed   Professor  of Mineralogy and Geology at Strasburg, at the
age of 25 ; afterwards (1861-2) he became Professor of Geology at
the Musee d'Histoire Naturelle at Paris, and at the same time Pro
fessor of Mineralogy at the Ecole des Mines ; in the same year he
succeeded to the Chair at the Institut vacated by M. Cordier.      From
1872 to 1884, when the rules of the Service made retirement by
reason of age compulsory, he acted as Director of the Ecole des
Mines.    M. Daubree was the leader in France in experiments for the
synthetic reproduction of minerals and rocks, and his laboratory
furnace was the first to yield crystals of oxide of tin having the
lustre, colour, and hardness of the mineral cassiterite ; his memoir
on the zeolites and other minerals, produced since Roman times
through the action of the hot springs of Plombieres on the bricks
and concrete, has been of general interest both to mineralogists and
geologists.    Other important experiments led him to infer that
circulating water, rather than heat or vapours, has been the essential
agent in all phenomena of rock transformation.          M. Daubree gave
much attention to the description and classification of meteorites,
and made numerous experiments relative to the reproduction of
material having similar characters.
   The Council was much occupied during the earlier part of the
session with the consideration of the proposed
                                                     " Standing Orders "
relating to the conduct of the meetings, and to the Publications of
the Society — a subject which has engaged the anxious attention of
previous Councils.    In framing these Standing Orders two principal
objects were kept in view.       Firstly, to increase the interest of the
meetings by giving greater      freedom    in the conduct of them, and
by enlarging the opportunities        for discussion ; and secondly, to
obtain a more secure, and, at the same time, more rapid judgment
as to the value of communications made to the Society ; so that,
                                                                      *
while the high standard of the ' Philosophical Transactions             is
retained, or even raised, greater rapidity in the publication of these
and of the ' Proceedings
                            '
                              may be attained.     To secure these latter
 objects, the Council has called to its aid, in the form of Sectional
Committees, a number of Fellows much greater than that of the
Council itself, to whom will be entrusted the task of reviewing the
communications to the Society, and of making to the Council such
recommendations with respect to them as may seem desirable.          It is
further probabie that by using the special knowledge of the several
 Sectional Committees in the detailed consideration of special questions,
the Council will have more time at its disposal than it has at present

                             President's Address.                      303
to    consider the matters of larger policy which are so frequently
brought before it.
     It soon became evident that no satisfactory Standing Orders
securing these advantages could be drawn up which would not be in
some way or other inconsistent with the Statutes at present in opera
tion.     It was accordingly resolved to modify the Statutes ; and this
has been done by giving to certain Statutes a more general form
than that in which they have for a long time appeared, so that such
alterations of detail as may from time to time seem desirable may
be effected     by changes in the Standing Orders only, without inter
fering with the Statutes.       I  gladly avail myself of this opportunity
of acknowledging the great help which the Council received from
Mr. A. B. Kempe, in respect to the many legal points which arose
in connection with the change of Statutes.         A copy of the Statutes,
as amended during the present session, as well as of the Standing
Orders adopted, will be found in the Year-book, which has been
 instituted by one of the new Standing Orders, and which will be pub
lished each year, as soon after the     Anniversary Meeting as possible.
     The International Conference called to consider the desirability
and possibility of compiling and publishing, by international co
operation, a Complete Catalogue of Scientific Literature, was duly
 held ; and the Society may be congratulated on the successful issue
of a meeting, to the preparations for which a special International
Catalogue Committee, appointed by, and acting under the authority
of, the Council, had devoted much time and labour.         The Conference
met in the apartments of the Society on July 14, 15, 16, and 17,
under the presidency of the Right Hon. Sir J. Gorst, Vice-President
of the Committee of Council on Education,              and was attended
by forty-one delegates, representing nearly all countries interested
 in science.     The Society was represented by the Seuior Secretary,
 Professor Armstrong (Chairman of the International Catalogue
 Committee), Mr. Norman Lockyer, Dr. L. Mond, and Professor
 Kiicker.     Pour other Fellows of the Society, General Strachey, Dr.
 D.    Gill, Professor Liversidge, and Mr. R. Trimen were among the
delegates appointed by the Indian and Colonial Governments.
     The Conference resolved that it was desirable to compile and
 publish a catalogue of the nature suggested in the original circular
  issued by the Royal Society, the administration     being carried out by
 a Central International Bureau, under the direction          of an Inter
  national Council, with an arrangement that each of such countries
 as were willing to do so, should, by some national organisation,
  collect and prepare for the Central Bureau all the entries belonging
  to the scientific literature of the country.     It was further resolved
  that the language of the catalogue should be English, and a proposal
   that the Central Bureau should be placed in Loudon       was carried by

304                        A nnivermty Meeting.
acclamation.     The Conference finding itself unable to accept any of
the systems of classification proposed, requested the Royal Society to
form a committee which should consider this and other matters which
were left undecided by the Conference.        The Council are already
taking steps to perform the duties thus entrusted to them by the
Conference.
    The delegates of the Society reported that the whole proceedings
of the Conference were carried on with remarkable good feeling,
and even unanimity, and that the confidence felt and expressed by the
various delegates in the fitness of the Royal Society to complete the
work begun by the Conference was most gratifying.
    In connection with the fact that the proposed International Cata
logue is to be in part arranged according to subject matter1, it may be
stated that the Council, acting upon a resolution of the International
Catalogue Committee, have taken steps towards the practice of append
ing subject indices to the papers published by the Society, and have
recommended the same practice to other Societies.
    The work connected with the Society's own Catalogue is progressing.
Vol. XI, the last of the decade 1874-83, has been published, and the
preparation of the Supplement, which has been fonnd necessary for
this and preceding decades, is beiDg pushed on.
    For the Subject Index to the Catalogue, slips have been prepared,
and the Catalogue Committee will soon have to advise the Council
as to the system of classification to be adopted.
    The Grant of £1000 in aid of publications, which My Lords of the
Treasury promised last summer to place upon the Estimates of this
year, has been sanctioned by Parliament, and a moiety of it has
already been paid to the Society.    The Council have already felt the
great advantage of having this money at their disposal, and have
framed Regulations for its administration which they trust will be
 found to work satisfactorily.
    The Council have made some small changes (which have been
approved by My Lords of the Treasury) in the Regulations for the
administration of the Government Grant of £4000 in aid of Scientific
 Inquiries, directed chiefly towards more effectually securing that
 Grants made should be expended for the purpose for which they were
 given, and that objects of permanent interest obtained by Grants
 should be properly disposed of.      The only two Grants made this
 year which call for special mention are that of £1000 to the Joint
 Permanent Eclipse Committee of the Royal and Royal Astronomical
  Societies, for observations of the Solar Eclipse of August, and that
 of £800 for boring a coral reef in the Pacific Ocean, administered by
 the Committee appointed by the Royal Society, both drawn from the
 Reserve Fund.
     The Expedition to bore the Coral Reef received valuable assistance

 from  My Lords of the Admiralty, who directed H.M.S.
 to carry the observers from Sydney, N.S.W., to Funafuti, the seat of
 the boring, and to render the Expedition all possible help during the
 whole of the operations.         I desire to express on behalf of the Society
our recognition of this renewed token of the willingness of My Lords
of the Admiralty to further scientific inquiry.              Though the full
Report of the Expedition has not yet reached the Council, informa
tion has been received to the effect that the boring operations bad to
be suspended when a depth of only 75 feet had been reached ; a
layer of sand and boulders presenting obstacles which the experts
employed were unable to overcome.              It is much to be regretted that
an undertaking which promised scientific results of very great value
has thus so      far failed.
    The appeals of the Council to H.M. Minister for Foreign Affairs
and to My LordB of the Admiralty for assistance to the Eclipse
Expeditions met with most cordial and effective response, for which
we would express our gratitude.            We also desire to acknowledge the
courtesy shown and help afforded to the observing parties in
Norway and Japan by the respective Governments of those countries,
and to record our high appreciation of the enthusiastic and effective
aid given to those under the direction of Mr. Norman Lockyer, at
Vadso, by Captain King Hall and the Officers and crew of H.M.S.
"           " to Dr. Common,
   Volage      ;                     also in Norway, by Commodore Atkin
son, of H.M.S.

by   the  Officers   of  H.M.S. " Humber," " Pique," and " Linnet," kindly
detached by Admiral Sir A. Buller to convey the various members of
the expedition to and from Yezo, and to aid them during the observa
tions.
    Both in Norway and in Japan unfavourable weather rendered to a
large extent nugatory the elaborate preparations which had been
made for observing            the eclipse.      But British astronomy was
splendidly saved from failure on this important occasion by the
munificence and public spirit of Sir George Baden Powell, who fitted
up, at his own expense, and accompanied an expedition in his yacht
"Otaria'' to Novaya Zemlya. The instruments employed were pro
vided by our Fellows, Mr. Lockyer and Mr. Stone, of the RadclifFe
Observatory, Oxford ; and the observations were entrusted to
Mr. Shackleton, one of the computers employed by the Solar Physics
Committee.          In brilliant weather photographic observations were
made, which promise to yield novel results of a highly important
character.
    At  the request of the President of the Board of Trade the Council
 nominated, in March, Professors Kennedy and Roberts-Austen                 as
 two members of a Committee to investigate the loss of strength in
 steel rails.     So far as I am aware, the Committee has not yet made

30H                       A nniversary Meeting.
its report.     More recently, in July, the Council, at the request of
H.M. Secretary for Colonial Affairs, appointed a Committee to con
sider, and if necessary to investigate, in conjunction with Surgeon-
Major Bruce, who has made important researches in the matter, the
disease caused in cattle in Africa by the Tsetse Fly.    The Committee
is  still engaged on the inquiry.
    We believe that the Council, in cordially responding to requests
 like the above, and in freely placing at the disposal of H.M. Govern
 ment its scientific knowledge and its acquaintance with scientific
men, is performing       ono of its most important     functions.   The
Council     of the  Royal Society is again and again called upon to
approach H.M. Government on behalf of the interests of science, and
 when it does so always meets with a cordial reception and a respect
 ful hearing, even on occasions when public necessities prevent a
 favourable reply being given to its requests. In return, the Council
believes it to be its duty (when called upou to do so), not only to
 place, its own time and labour ungrudgingly at the service of H.M.
 Government, but also to ask for the co-operation of other Fellows of
 the Society, or even other scientific men not Fellows of the Society,
feeling confident that whenever the matter in hand has practical
bearings beyond the simple advancement of Natural Knowledge, the
 value of a scientific man's time and energy will be duly considered.
    Some correspondence has taken place with the War Office relative
 to resumiug the borings in the Delta of the Nile, which were carried
on for a time some years ago, and which, though not completed,
yielded valuable results.    The Expedition to the Soudan has, how
 ever, prevented anything being done.         The Council learn with
 pleasure that the old borings, undertaken for a purely scientic object,
 have indirectly been a valuable means of supplying certain districts
 of the Delta with sweet w ater.
    If anything had been needed to justify the meetings for discussion
 recently established, it would have been supplied by the brilliant
 success of that held during the present session on Colour Photo
 graphy.      On that occasion, M. Lippmann gave us a demonstration
of results of unprecedented beauty, obtained by extremely simple
 means, though based on profound mathematical reasoning.          Such
 meetings can only prove fruitful when they are held in consequence
 of some theme needing such a discussion as is afforded by a special
 meeting ; and their occurrence must therefore be uncertain and
 irregular.    The purpose for which they were instituted would be
 frustrated if they were held at times fixed in any formal way, irre
 spective of whether they were needed or no.
    Three of the informal gatherings recently instituted, limited to
 Fellows of the Society, have been held during the session, and were
 judged to be very successful.

                          Presidents Address.                          307
   The Council has had occasion during the past session to present
an address of condolence to Her Majesty, the Patron of the Society,
on the lamented death of Prince Henry of Battenberg,               and to
the Royal Academy on the occasion of the death of their President,
Lord Leighton. In the absence of Council, during the recess, I sent
another message of sympathy on the death of Sir J. Millais.
   I had the privilege of presenting on behalf of the Council, an
address of congratulation to onr late President, Lord Kelvin, on the
occasion of his Jubilee, nobly celebrated in Glasgow last summer, by
a very remarkable concourse of scientific men from all parts of the
world, assembled to do him honour.
   Addresses were also sent to our Foreign Member, Professor Can-
nizzaro, on the celebration of his seventieth birthday, and to the
University of Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.A., on the occasion of its
Sesquicentenary Anniversary.
   Under the guidance of the Scientific Relief Committee, the Council
has during the year granted £100 to assist scientific persons or their
relatives in distress. The Council desires to call the attention of the
Fellows to the fact that, during the year, as during past years, the
income of the fund has exceeded its expenditure, and that more aid
could bo given than has been given. With the view of increasing
the usefulness of the fund, the Council has added to the list of those
who can make representations to the Council concerning relief
the Presidents of the Mathematical, Physical, and Entomological
Societies.
                                                                I
   I cannot but give expression to my deep regret, shared, am sure,
by every Fellow, that Lord Rayleigh, whose tenure of office as
Secretary has been marked as much by faithful devotion to the in
terests of the Society as by scientific brilliancy, has thought it right,
in consequence of increasing pressure of other engagements, to
retire.       I
         But rejoice that the Council can submit to your suffrages a
man well qualified to wear the mantle laid down by Lord Rayleigh.
   The Fellows will be pleased to learn that Mr. Rix, who was com
pelled by the condition of his health a year ago, to resign the
position which he had held for many years with such great advantage
to the Society, has much improved under the lighter labour of the
 Clerkship to the Government Grant Committee.
   As his successor in the office of Assistant- Secretary, the Council,
out of eighty-four candidates, unanimously          selected Mr. Robert
Harrison, who entered upon his duties on      the 24th  of April last.
   The scientific work of the Society during the past year has been
full of deep and varied interest. Early in the session the announce
ment of Roentgen's great discovery burst upon the world.          Its won
derful applications to medicine and surgery attracted universal
attention to it ; and physicists everywhere have since been engaged

 ;-so8                    . 1 nniversary    Meeting.
in investigating the nature of the new rays. Perhaps no outcome
of such inquiries has been more remarkable than the fact observed
by our Fellow Professor J. J. Thomson, that the rays have the power
of discharging electricity, both positive and negative, from a, body
surrounded by a non-conductor; a mass of paraffin wax, for example,
behaving in their path for the time being like a conductor of elec
tricity.
    It appeai-3 that Lenard had before observed the discharge of both
 kinds of electricity through air by the rays with which he worked.
  Lenard's rays, however, differ from Rontgen's in being deflectable by a
 magnet, implying, in the opinion of most British physicists, that they
 are emanations of highly electrified particles of ponderable matter,
 while Rontgen's are regarded as vibrations in the ether. The question
 naturally arises whether Lenard, in the observations referred to, may
 not have been working with a mixture of Rontgen's rays and his
 own. While points like these are still under discussion by experts,
 we cannot but feel that the letter X, the symbol of an unknown
 quantity, employed originally by Rontgen to designate his rays, is
 still not inappropriate.
    I have before referred to Lippmann's beautiful demonstration
 and discussion of colour photography in one of our meetings.
    Very important researches have been made both by Lord Rayleigh
 and by Professor Ramsay into the physical properties of the new
 substance, helinm, discovered by Ramsay in the previous session.
 Among their most striking results is the fact ascertained by Rayleigh
 that the refractivity of helium is very much less than any previously
 known, being only 0"14G ; between three and four times less than that
of hydrogen, the lowest that had before been observed, although
helium has more than twice the density of hydrogen.           And equally
surprising is Ramsay's observation of the extraordinary distance
through which electric sparks will strike through helium, viz.,
250 or 300 mm. at atmospheric pressure, as compared with 23 mm.
tor oxygen and 39 for hydrogen.          Such properties appear to indicate
that    in  helium  we   have to   do    with an exceedingly remarkable
substance.
    The density of helium appears to be really slightly different
according to the mineral source from which it is obtained ; and this
circumstance seems to give countenance to the opinion arrived at by
Lockyer and also by Runge and Paschen, from spectroscopic investi
gation, that helium is not a perfectly pure gas.       But whatever other
gas or gases may be mixed with
                                      it,they must be as inert chemically
as the     main  constituent
                           ;   for   all  Ramsay's elaborate attempts to
induce it, or any part of       it, to combine with other bodies have
entirely failed.
    Professor Roberts- Austen, in the Bakerian lecture, brought before

                                 President s A ddress.
us astonishing evidence that metals are capable of diffusing into each
other, not only when one of them is in the state of fnsiou, but
when both are solid. We learned that if clean surfaces of lead and
gold are held together in vacuo at a temperature of only 40° for
four days, they will unite firmly and can only be separated by a force
equal to one-third of the breaking strain of lead itself.      And gold
placed at the bottom of a cylinder of lead 70 mm. long thus united
with  it, will have diffused to the top in notable quantities at the end
of three days.      Such facts tend to modify our views concerning
the mutual relations of the liquid and solid states of matter.
   Such are a few samples of the many highly interesting communica
tions we have had in physics and chemistry.       On the biological side
also, there has been no lack of important work.      Of this   may refer
                                                               I
 to one or two instances.
    Professor Schiifer has given us an account of the well devised
experiments by which he has conclusively established that the spleen
is  on the one hand capable, like the heart, of independent rhythmical
 contractions, and, on the other hand, has those contractions controlled
 by the   central nervous system acting through an extraordinary
number of efferent channels.
   Professor Farmer and Mr. Lloyd-Williams made a very beautiful
contribution to biology in the account they gave of their elaborate
investigations on the fertilisation and segmentation of the spore in
Fucus.    Especial interest attached to this communication, from the
fact that   it described in a vegetable form exactly what had been
established by Oscar Hertwig in Echinodermata, viz., that out of the
multitude of fertilising elements that surround the female cell, one
only enters     and becomes blended with its nucleus.
                it
   Lastly, may mention the very remarkable investigation into the
            I
development of the Common Eel, which was desci-ibed to us               a
 fortnight ago by Professor Grassi, to which      shall have occasion
                                                         I
to refer in some detail when speaking of his claims to one of the
 Society's medals.
    These, as   Ihave before said, are but samples of what we have had
 before us  ; but   think they are in themselves sufficient to justify the
                     I
 statement that, in point of scientific interest, the past year has been
 in no degree inferior to its predecessors.

 of Anatomy in Heidelberg, in recognition of his pre-eminence in the
 science of Comparative Anatomy or Animal Morphology.      Professor

  310                     Anniversary Meeting.
  Gegenbaur was born in 1826, and a few weeks ago his 70th birthday
  was celebrated by his pupils (who comprise almost all the leading
  comparative anatomists of Germany, Holland, and Scandinavia) by
                                             "
  the presentation to him of a " Festschrift in three volumes. Gegen
  baur is everywhere recognised as the anatomist who has laid the
  foundations of modern comparative anatomy on the lines of the
  theory of descent, and has to a very large extent raised the building
  by his own work.     His ' Grundziige der vergleichenden Anatomie '
  was first published in 1853, when he "was 33 years old. In the second
  edition, published in 1870., he remodelled the whole work, making
  the theory of descent the guiding principle of his treatment of the
  subject.   Since then he has produced a somewhat condensed edition
                                                        '
  of the same work under the title of ' Grundriss (translated into
  English and French), and now, in his 71st year, he is about to
 pnblish what will probably be the last edition of this masterly
 treatise, revising the whole mass of facts and speculations accumu
 lated through his own unceasing industry and the researches of his
 numerous pupils during the past quarter of a century.
     Gegenbaur may be considered as occupying a position in morph
 ology parallel to that occupied by Ludwig in Physiology. Both were
 pupils of Jahannes Miiller, and have provided Europe with a body of
 teachers and investigators, carrying forward in a third generation
 the methods and aims of the great Berlin professor.        Gegenbaur's
 first independent contribution to science was published in 1853. It
 was the outcome of a sojourn at Messina in 1852, in company with
 two other pupils of Johannes Miiller, namely Albert Kolliker (still
 professor in Wurzburg) and Heinrich Miiller, who died not long
 afterwards.    These young morphologists published the results of
 their researches in common. Gegenbaur wrote on Medusa?, on the
 development of Eohinoderms, and on Pteropod larvse.          A long list
 of papers on the structure and development of Hydrozoa, Mollusca,
 and various invertebrata followed this first publication.  The greatest
 interest, however, was excited among anatomists by his researches on
the vertebrate skeleton (commenced already in 1849 with a research,
in common with Friedreich, on the skull of axolotl).       In a series of
beautifully illustrated memoirs he dealt with aud added immensely
to our knowledge of the vertebral column, the skull, and the limb-
girdles and limbs of Vertebrata, basing his theoretical views as to
the gradual evolution of these structures in the ascending series of
vertebrate forms upon the study of the cartilaginous skeleton of
Elasmobranch fishes, and on the embryological characters of the
cartilaginous skeleton and its^gradnal replacement by bone in higher
forms. His method and point of view were essentially similar to
those of Huxley, who independently and contemporaneously was
engaged on the same line of work.

     For many years Gegenbaur was professor in Jena, where be was
  the close friend and associate         of Ernst Haeckel, but in 1875 be
  accepted     the invitation  to the Chair of Anatomy in Heidelberg, and
  in view of the increased importance of his duties as a teacher of
 medical students, and therefore of human anatomy, though still con
 tinuing his researches          on vertebrate morphology, he produced a
 large  treatise    on  that  subject, which has ran through two editions.
  In this work he made the first attempt to bring, as far as possible,
 the nomenclature and treatment of human anatomy into thorough
 agreement with that of comparative anatomy, and to a very large
 extent the changes introduced by him have influenced the teaching
 of human anatomy throughout Europe and America.
    There is probably no comparative anatomist or embryologist in
 any responsible position at the present day who would not agree in
assigning to Gegenbaur the very first place in his science as the
 greatest master and teacher who is still living amongst us.           He is
not only watching in his old age the developments of his own early
 teachings and the successful labours of his very numerous disciples,
but is still exhibiting his own extraordinary industry in research, his
keenness of intellectual vision, and his unrivalled knowledge and
critical judgment.
                                   Royal Medal.
                           Sir Archibald Geikie, F.R.S.
    One of the     Royal Medals is conferred on Sir Archibald Geikie, on
the  ground that of all British geologists he is the most distinguished,
not  only as regards the number and the importance of the geological
papers which he has published as an original investigator, but as one
whose educational         works on geology have had a most material
influence upon the advancement of scientific knowledge.
    His original papers range over many of the main branches of
geological science.       His memoir upon the ' Glacial Drift of Scotland '
(1863) is one of the classics in British geology.          His work on the
'Scenery       of  Scotland,   viewed   in   connection with  the Physical
            '
Geology        (1865) was the first successful attempt made to explain
the scenery of that country upon scientific principles, and is still
without a rival.       His papers on the " Old Red Sandstone of Western
          "
Europe        (1878-79) gave for the first time a clear and convincing
picture of the great lake period of British geology, founded upon
pergonal observation in the field.
    His many original contributions to the Volcanic History of the.
British Isles form a succession of connected papers, crowded with
important observations and discoveries, and brilliant and fertile
generalizations      respecting the abundant relics of former volcanic

activity in the British Isles from the earliest geological ages to
Middle Tertiary times.
    In the first series of these papers — commencing with the " Chrono
logy of the Trap Rocks of Scotland" (1861), and ending with the
"                                                       "
   Tertiary Volcanic Rocks of the British Isles            (1869), abundant
original proofs were advanced of the activity of volcanic action in the
Western Isles of Scotland, and of its long duration in geological
time. The second series (1871-88) was especially distinguished by
the publication of his remarkable         paper  on the " Carboniferous Vol
canic Rocks in the Basin of the Firth of Forth," our earliest, and, as
yet, our only monograph on a British volcanic area belonging to a
pre- Tertiary geological system.         The third series (begun in 1888)
commenced with his memoir on the " History of Volcanic Action
during the Tertiary Period in the British Isles," a paper which is by
far the most detailed and masterly contribution yet made to the
subject, and for which the Brisbane Medal was awarded him by the
Royal Society of Edinburgh; and this succession of papers has been
followed by the publication of others of almost equal importance.
     Sir Archibald Geikie has also written many papers and memoirs
bearing upon geological processes and their effects, which have become
permanent parts of our scientific literature.
    While carrying out this highly important original work in Geology,
 Sir Archibald ha3 most materially contributed to the advancement
 and diffusion of scientific knowledge by his many educational works
 upon Geology and Physical Geography.              His ' Elementary Lessons
on Physical Geography' has passed through several English and

                               Professor C. V. Boys.
     The other Royal Medal is awarded to Professor Boys, who lias
 given to physical research a method of measuring minute forces far
 exceeding in exactness any hitherto used, by his invention of the
 mode of drawing quartz fibres, and by his discovery of their remark
 able property of perfect elastic recovery.
     Professor Boys has himself made several very important researches
 in which he has employed these fibres to measure small forces. Using a
 combination of a thermo-j unction with a suspended coil iu a galvano
 meter of the usual D'Arsonval type, a combination first devised by
 D'Arsonval himself, Professor Boys developed the idea in the micro

 radiometer, an instrument rivalling the bolometer in the measurement
of small amounts of radiation. Its sensitiveness and accumcy were ob
 tained in part by the use of a quartz fibre to suspend the coil, in part
 by the admirable design of every portion of the instrument. Professor
 Boys was the first to show its value in an investigation into the
 radiation received from the moon and stars.
    In his great research on the value of the Newtonian constant of
attraction, Professor Boys used quartz fibres to measure the gravitation
forces between small bodies by the Michell-Cavendish torsion method.
He redesigned the whole of the apparatus, and, calculating what
should be the dimensions and arrangements to give the best results,
he was led to the remarkable conclusion that accuracy was to be
gained by a very great reduction in the size of the apparatus.        This
conclusion he justified by a determination of the value of the New
tonian constant, which is now accepted as the standard.
    Professor Boys has also made some remarkable studies by a photo
graphic method of the motion of projectiles, and of the air through
which they pass.
   All his work is characterised       by the admirable adjustment of
the different parts of the apparatus he uses to give the best results.
His instruments, are, indeed, models of beauty of design.
                              Romford Medal.
         Professor Philip P. Lenard and Professor W. C.    Hontgen.
   In th .i case of the   Rumford Medal, the Council have adopted a
course, for which there are precedents in the awards of the Dav}T
Medal, but which is, as far as the Rumford Medal itself is concerned,
a  new departure.     They have decided to award the Medal in dupli
cate.    It has often happened in the history of science that the same
discovery has been made almost simultaneously and quite indepen
dently by two observers, but the joint recipients of the Rumford
Medal do not stand in this relation to each other. Each of them may
fairly claim that his work has special merits and characteristics of
its own.      To day, however, we have to deal, not with points of
difference, but with points of similarity. There can be no question
that a great addition has recently been made to our knowledge
of the phenomena whicli occur outside a highly exhausted tube
through which an electrical discharge is passing.
   Many physicists have studied the luminous and other effects which
take place within the tube ; but the extension of the field of inquiry
to the external spacs around it is novel and most important.        There
can be no doubt

   The discussion which took place at the recent meeting of the
British Association at Liverpool proved that experts still differ as to
the exact meaning and causes of the facts these gentlemen have dis
covered. No one, I believe, disputes the theoretical interest which
attaches to the researches of both ; or the practical benefits which the
Rontgen rays may confer upon mankind as* aids to medical and
surgical diagnosis.    But whatever the final verdict upon such points
may be, the two investigators whom we honour to-day have been
toilers in a common field, they have both reaped a rich harvest,
and it    therefore, fitting that the Royal Society should bestow upon
          is,
both of them the Medal which testifies to its appreciation of their
work.
                             Davy Medal.
                       Professor Henri Moissan.
   The Davy medal is given to Professor Henri Moissan.
   Notwithstanding the abundant occurrence of fluorine in nature, the
chemical history of this element and its compounds has until recently
been scanty in the extreme, and, as far as the element in the free
state   concerned, an entire blank.
        is                           And yet from its peculiar posi
tion in the system of elements, the acquisition of    more extended
                                                       a
knowledge of its chemical properties has always been     desideratum
                                                         a
of the greatest scientific interest.
   The frequent attempts which have been made from time to time to
clear up its chemical history have been constantly baffled by the
extraordinary difficulties with which the investigation of this element
is   beset.
   Thanks to the arduous and continuous labours of M. Moissan, this
void has been filled up.   He has effected the isolation of fluorine in a
state of purity, and prepared new and important compounds, the
study of which has placed our knowledge of the chemical and
physical properties of this element on a level with that of its imme
diate allies.
   During the last few years M. Moissan has turned his attention to
the study of chemical energy at extremely high temperatures, and by
the aid of the electric furnace, which he has contrived, he has
succeeded in obtaining   a  large number of substances whose very
existence was hitherto undreamt of. It    is impossible to set bounds
to the new field of research which has thus been opened out. The
electric furnace of M. Moissan has now become the most powerful
synthetical and analytical engine in the laboratory of the chemist.
   On studying the accounts which Moissan has given of his re
searches, we cannot fail to be struck with the originality, care, perse
verance and fertility of resource with which they have been carried

merits and achievements as an investigator.
                              Darwin Medal.
                  Professor Giovanni Battista Qrassi.
    The Darwin Medal for 1896 is awarded to Professor Grassi, of
Rome (late of Catania), for his researches on the constitution of the
colonies of the Termites, or White Ants, and for his discoveries in
regard to the normal development of the Congers, MursenK, and
Common Eels from Leptocephalus larva3.
    From a detailed examination of the nature and origin of the colo
nies of the two species of Termites which occur in the neighbour
hood of Catania, viz., Termes lucifugus and Callotermes flavicollis, he
was able to determine certain important facts which have a tunda-
mental value in the explanation of the origin of these aud similar
polymorphic colonies of insects, and are of first-rate significance in
the consideration of the question of the share which heredity plays in
the development of the remarkable instincts of " neuters," or arrested
males and females, in these colonies.       Professor Grassi has, in fact,
shown that the food which is administered by the members of a
colony to the young larvaa determines, at more than one stage of their
development, their transformation into kings or queens, or soldiers or
workers as the case may be, and the value of these researches is
increased by the observations which he has made on the instincts
of the different forms, showing that they do not in early life differ
from one another in this respect, and are all equally endowed with
the potentiality of the same instincts.      These do not, however, all
become developed and cultivated in all alike, but become specialised,
as does the physical structure in the full-grown forms.
    A very different piece of work, but having a no less important
bearing on the theory of organic evolution, is that on the Lepto-
cephali. These strange, colourless, transparent, thin-bodied creatures,
with blood destitute of red corpuscles, had been regarded as a special
family of fishes, but have been proved by Grassi's patient and long-
continued labours to be larval forms of the various Murffinoids.      The
 most astonishing case is that of the Common Eel, Anguilla vulgaris,
the development of which had been a mystery since the days of
Aristotle. It had been long known that large eels pass from rivers
 into the sea at certain seasons, and that diminutive young eels, called
 in this country Elvers, ascend the rivevs in enormous numbers. But,
 although the species is very widely distributed, no one in any country
 had been able to discover how the elvers were produced.       Grassi has
 shown that, large as the eels are that pass into the sea, they are not
  perfectly developed fish, but only attain maturity in the depths of the

                           A unirerzcu-i/ Meethin.
ocean.    There they in due time breed, and from their eggs are
hatched the young Leptocephali, which, after attaining a certain
size, cease to feed, and assume the very different form of the elver.
The possibility of establishing these remarkable facts depended on
the powerful oceanic currents that prevail about the Straits of
Messina, bringing up occasionally to the surface the inhabitants of
the depths of the sea.       Grassi was thus able to obtain from time
to time both adult eels with fully developed sexual organs and their
larval progeny, and he actually observed in an aquarium the develop
ment of a Leptocephalus brevirostris into an elver.
   Such highly meritorious contributions to evolution are fitly recog
nised by the award ot the Darwin Medal.

 330            Mr. G.   J. Burch.        On Professor Hermann's
 Muskels," in which he discusses the analyses of certain electrometer
 curves of muscle variation described by Professor Burdon Sanderson.*
     His first statement demands an explanation on my part. He says,
 " Bevor ich auf Sanderson's Versuche und Schliisse                          mochte
                                                                  eingehe,
 ich zeigen dass der von Bnrch und von Einthoven aufgestellte, das
 Capillar-Electrometer       betreffende Satz, welcher der Construction ca
 Grunde liegt, anch aus meiner Theorie des Instruments unmittelbar
 folgt, was beide Autoren, obwohl sie meine Arbeit erwahnen, nicht
 bemerkt haben.        Da beide ihren Satz empirisch gewonnen haben, so
 kann derselbe als eine schone Bestatigung meiner Theorie betrachtet
 werdeu."
    As a matter of fact,     I  did not know of Professor Hermann's paper
 until after    I  had formed my own theory.           In my second paperf on
the subject I mentioned that it had also been treated by him, "mainly
from a mathematical standpoint," and implied that, in my opinion,
his data were insufficient.          I  still think so, and cannot admit that
my experimental results prove the correctness of his views.
    That a mathematical formula, based upon a certain hypothesis,
should agree with observed facts may be strong evidence in its
favour, but is not necessarily a proof of the soundness of the hypo
thesis.
    For instance, the equation
                                     p = E     . e~rl
may represent the discharge of a Leyden jar through a circuit of no
inductance, or the swing of a pendulum in treacle. That it happens
to be also the expression for the time-relations of the capillary
electrometer does not of itself imply that the same causes are at work
in all three cases, but simply that the forces concerned are so related
that the movement is dead-beat. Professor Hermann, starting from
Lippmann's polarisation theory, assumes the simplest conceivable
relation between the rate of polarisation and the acting P.D., namely,
that they are proportional to one another. Putting t = the intensity
of the current, and p = the amount of polarisation at the time t, he
gets
                                     dp/dt    = hi,
in which h is an instrumental constant.
    Writing E for an electromotive force, which may be constant or
variable, and to for the resistance of the circuit, he arrives at the
differential equation
                                  $=      ~  (B-p).

                      Theory     of   the Capillary Electrometer.                        331
   My position in relation to              the   problem was very different.               I
wanted to make a capillary electrometer from the description given
in Lippmann's Theses. In order to get better results,                        I  determined
by  actnal      experiment    what     were  the   conditions      of sensitiveness and
rapidity, and in doing this found out so much about the instrument
that the "einfachste denkbare Annahme," referred to by Hermann,
would not have commended itself to me.
   My paper on the " Time-Relations of the Capillary Electrometer"
•was a condensed account of a small portion of the work done by me.
For various reasons           I   did not then enter into my views as to the
theory of the instrument, and will confine myself here to a statement
of them, which must be regarded as preliminary.
   Professor Hermann speaks of my theory having been empirically
obtained.        I demur to that expression as open to misconstruction.
My working formula may rightly be called empirical, since it neglects
certain terms of the complete expression, which                       I   have found to
neutralise each other in a suitably selected instrument, but my theory
of the time relations of the capillary electrometer was founded upon
first principles and verified by experiments.
   My starting point was the fundamental fact that in the capillary
electrometer a mechanical effect is produced by an electrical cause.
But there are several links between the cause and the effect, and
a strong probability that each of them involves a time-function.
   They are shown in the following scheme : —
             I.                    II.                  III.                     IV.

        produces                                                          friction in the

   Poiseuille showed in 1846 that the flow of a liquid through a
capillary tube varies directly as the pressure. Of this                           I was not
aware till later, but it leads to precisely the same differential equa
tion as that adopted by Hermann.
   Writing Q for the quantity of electricity, C for the constant of
capillarity, P for polarisation, and W for the work done, the sym
bolical expression of the problem is —
                                /(Q/, 0h Pi) = 0(W|).

332        Mr. G.   J.    Burch.    On Professor Hermann's
Hermann has passed over C, and omitted to take W into account,
confining himself to the theoretical relation between Q( and P*.
   But we know very little about polarisation, save in the case of
solid electrodes. The term polarisation, as frequently used, includes
two phenomena, which ought to be kept distinct, viz. : —
   (a) That condition of the interface between two conductors, of
which one at least is an electrolyte, in which the molecules are under
a stress not greater than they are capable of supporting without
chemical change.
   (b) A deposit upon the surface of a solid, or in the contiguous
liquid, of the products of actual electrolysis.
   If one of the conductors is a solid, the inevitable local differences
of condition or of composition enable actual electrolysis to take
place, even with a P.D. smaller than that proper to the chemical
change implied.
   But if both conductors are liquid and perfectly pure, the stress is
so far equalised that no electrolysis is possible until the E.M.F.
reaches a certain value, more sharply denned in proportion as the
materials are pure.
   I hold that with differences of potential which do not reach this
limit, the electromotive force is transmuted without electrolysis into
mechanical force, and manifests itself as kinetic energy, until by the
motion of the meniscus it becomes transformed into potential energy.
   The locus of transformation from electrical to mechanical force must
clearly be the two interfaces mercury-acid and acid-mercury, and it
is upon these that the stress acts.  The resistance is distributed along
the tube, and is partly electrical, but to a far larger extent mecha
nical.
   Is it reasonable, therefore, to assume that the sole cause of delay
                                          "
is the " Polarisations-geschwindigkeit of the meniscus ?
  I  believe that in the case of an interface between two liquids, the
rate of polarisation is to be measured in terms of the vibration-period
of a molecule, rather than in decimals of a second.
   Actual electrolysis is another matter, and        I
                                                     hold that it does not
take place in   a  properly working   electrometer.   We do not assume
electrolysis when two pith balls repel each other after receiving a
charge, nor when a closed coil is slipped over a magnet. But the
coil cannot be got off again, nor can the balls fall together without
the generation somewhere of a current.       Icannot see why we should
assume electrolysis in the case of the capillary electrometer.         The
marvellous rapidity   of  the  action to  which  I  have not  yet found a
limit, is against it, as is also the fact that the substitution for the
acid, or the addition to    it,
                             of any substance which can be electrolysed
by a smaller electromotive force, reduces the range of potential dif
ference for which   it   can be used.

                           Theory of the Capillary Electrometer.                               333
   The presence of even a trace of impurity is soon manifested by the
blocking of the capillary, and if this block is removed by electrolysis,
the instrument behaves for some time in an abnormal way. It shows
signs of a residual charge, like that of a Leyden jar, the mercury
rising again after the short-circuiting key is opened, instead of simply
ceasing to fall.
   This I ascribe to polarisation of the kind met with between solids
and   electrolytes,and to this the term " Polarisations-geschwindig-
      "
keit would be applicable.       But no good electrometer will show                               it,
except   with  electromotive forces greater than ought to be employed.
I  have held from the first that the capillary electrometer acts by
transforming electrical into mechanical energy without any chemical
interchange, and that this          possible because at the interface
                                             is
between two liquids which do not diffuse into each other the stress                              is
so evenly distributed that no one molecule can be strained to a degree
sufficient to detach any part of     until the stress
                                              it        intense enough   is
to break down all similar molecules simultaneously.
   But  if by polarisation   meant this condition of the interface, then
                                      is
I maintain that      must precede the movement, and must be deve
                           it
loped with almost inconceivable rapidity.
   In order to investigate the form of curve produced by recording
the motion of the meniscus when the electrometer          acted upon by   is
an electromotive force varying with the time according to some
known law, e.g., the pulsating or alternating current of a dynamo,
Professor Hermann puts his equation into a somewhat different form,
namely     :
                                    dpjdt + rp — rc    f(t) =   0,
where and are constants, and e f(t) =
        r          c                            the electromotive force
                                                           E    is
represented as a function of the time.
  But this      simply my own formnla for the estimation of the
                 is
E.M.F. expressed as a differential equation.

              Mr. G.   J. Burch.       On Professor Hermann's
    Professor Hermann finds the complete primitive of this differential
 equation, and then, introducing various values of r and the function
 E =           draws, by a process which is indeed laborious, the curves
 of the corresponding excursions.         My own method gives a good deal
 of the information so obtained in a much simpler manner.
                                                     /
    Adopting the letters used by him, when vanishes we have
                                dpjdt + rp =      0,
that is to say, whenever the E.M.F. falls to zero the reduced values
of the subnormal and the radius vector are equal, but of opposite sign,
and the curve, therefore, can never come back to the zero line under
the action of a current which pulsates but does not alternate (see
figs. 2 and 4 in Hermann's paper). When the meniscus crosses the zero
line, rp — 0, and dpjdt = re/(<), i.e., the impressed E.M.F. is then
directly proportional to the subnormal. This involves the further
fact that the crossing of the zero line by the meniscus must always
lag behind the change of sign of the E.M.F.
   If dpjdt vanishes, as it does at the apex of a spike or the bottom of
a notch, the instantaneous value of the impressed E.M.F. is directly
proportional to the distance of the meniscus from zero.
   The curves drawn by Professor Hermann are for the most part, so
far as the eye can judge, similar to those obtainable under like condi
tions with the capillary electrometer.               I  have photographed and
analysed many such, using rheotomes and dynamos of various kinds,
both alternating and direct current, as sources of E.M.F.                  I have
proposed,   in   a paper  which     has   been  in    the publisher's  hands since
last November, that this method should be used to determine the
characteristic current curves of dynamos.*
   All the confusing influence of the lag vanishes when such curves
are analysed — there is no need to trouble about the equation to the
curve, since each several term of its differential equation at any given
point is found at once by my mode of analysis.                       I
                                                                 But must point
out that an error has crept into Professor Hermann's rendering of
the curve given in fig. 6 — or, rather, as it only pretends to be an
approximation, that it is not equally accurate throughout.               The por
tion c'd', which corresponds to a diminishing negative (below zero)
potential is represented as rising with increasing velocity instead of
falling more slowly, as it should do. Yet, when this negative poten
tial ceases, the curve commences to fall from d' to e' along the
logarithmic curve of discharge.          This is impossible. When e/(<) is
negative, the algebraic sura of dpjdt and rp must be negative also if
the fundamental equation holds good.            Probably the straight line cd
has been placed too far to the right.

   Professor Hermann questions the accuracy of my method of
analysis when applied to steep curves.
   My answer is that         I   do not employ it in such cases, preferring to
take photographs of sndden changes upon plates moving with suffi
cient rapidity to suitably develope the curves.
   Thus in Professor Burdon Sanderson's paper,* figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4,
on Plate 1, and figs. 3, 4, and 5, on Plate 3, were intended to show-
within the limits of a page the entire course of certain phenomena.
I did not analyse them, but simply measured the times of the maxima
and minima.     The remaining curves, viz., figs. 5 and 6, Plate 1, figs.
1 —  7 on Plate 2, and figs.          1 and 2 on Plate 3, are all suitable for
analysis,  with  the     exception of the first phase of fig. 1, which is
almost too steep.      I   have done some thirty or forty of this kind.
   As regards the further criticisms, so far as the physical interpre
tation of the curves is concerned,          I can only say that coses did occur
in which the maximum E.M.F. of the second (positive) phase
exceeded the maximum E.M.F. of the first (negative) phase of the
same response.     With respect to curves, like those in figs. 3 and 4,
Plate II, the part referred to by Professor Burdon Sanderson as
      "
the     hump," is not merely the curve of discharge.                    The actual
negatives   which   I    measured       show  a  rise  of   the  meniscus after its
rapid downward movement has ceased, and while it is still above the
zero line, and a similar rise is plainly visible to the eye after every
                         "
one of the "spikes          in figs. 1, 2, and 4, Plate 1, which were photo
graphed with the machine moving more slowly.
   It is impossible for the mercury, under these conditions, after
approaching the zero line, to recede from, without crossing it, except
under the influence of a negative Acting P.D. That is to say, the
Impressed E.M.F. must be of the same sign as the charge already
in the instrument, but most be of higher potential difference. In
some negatives this second rise in followed by a descent more rapid
than that of the curve of discharge, and therefore indicating a small
positive Acting P.D.           I  first noticed and called attention to it in
connection with the curves illustrating my paperf on the " Time
Relations of the Capillary Electrometer," but refrained from discus
sing its physiological       significance.

                                 (Abstract.)
   The wave-length of sound in gaseous and in liquid ethyl oxide
(sulphuric ether) has been determined by the two first-mentioned of the
authors, by means of Kundt's method, between limits of temperature
ranging from 100° C. to 200° C, and of pressure ranging from
4000 mm. to 31,000 mm. of mercury, and of volume ranging from
2'6 c.c. per gram to 71 c.c. per gram.      Making use of the same appa
ratus throughout, the results obtained arc to be regarded as com
parative, and, by careful determination of the pitch of the tone
transmitted through the gas, it is probable they arc approximately
absolute.
    The sections of the complete memoir deal with (I) a description of
the apparatus employed, (II) the method of ascertaining the weights
of ether used in each series of experiments, (III) determinations of
the frequency of the vibrating rod, (IV) the calculations of the
adiabatic elasticity and tables of the experimental results, and (V) a
mathematical discussion of the results.         The last section is due to
Mr. Rose-Innes.
    As the theoretical results are of interest, a brief outline of them
may be given here.
    It will be remembered that one of the authors, in conjunction with
 Dr. Sydney Young, showed that for ether, and for some other liquids,
a linear relation subsists between pressure and temperature, volume
being kept constant, so that
                                 p —   IT-a.
    It has been found that a similar relation obtains between adiabatic
elfisticity and temperature, volume, as before, being kept constant;
so that, within limits of experimental error, where E stands for
 adiabatic elasticity,
                                 E=gT-h,
y and h being functions       of the volume only. Between these two
 equations, we may eliminate T, and so express E as a linear function
 of p, volume being kept constant.         The coefficient of p in such an
 equation   would   be gib, and   this fraction, on being calculated from
 the data available, proves to be nearly constant.       For working pur
 poses it is assumed that gjb may be treated as strictly constant, and

        Reactions     of certain  Sunthesised Proteid-like Substances.                337
 it is shown that this assumption does not introduce any serious error
 within the limits of volume considered. We then find it possible to
 integrate the resulting differential equation, and the complete primi
 tive enables us to draw a set of adiabatic curves. We believe that
 this is the first time adiabatic curves have been obtained for any
 substance except perfect gases.
    A mathematical discussion is added as to what extent the equations
                                    E =   gl-h
and                               yjb — constant,
 can be considered as       strictly true, and not merely approximate.
    The experimental results for liquid ether form an appendix to the
paper.

    The experiments of Professor Grimaux,* made more than ten
years ago, have until recently attracted but little attention amongst
English physiologists, although that investigator has synthesised a
series of colloidal substances which, in their chemical characteristics,
show striking similarities to proteids.

338     Dr.  J. W, Pickering.        The Chemical and Phy3wli»gkal
of the Norway bare (Levus variabilis), during its albino condition,
these substances fail to induce intravascular coagulation of the blood,
although they hasten the coagulation of the blood when drawn from
the carotids, in a precisely similar manner to nucleo-proteids.
   Taking these facts as the basis of my investigations, I have en
deavoured to synthesise substances which will approach more nearly
in their chemical and physiological reactions to proteids than those
briefly described above ; and to further investigate the properties of
Grimaux's colloids.
                  I. General Description of Experiments.
   I  have up to the present synthesised seven different colloidal sub
stances,    by the interaction of either phosphorus pentachloride or
pentoxide on certain well-known derivatives of proteids, and the
details of their preparation, physical properties, chemical and physio
logical reactions are described below.
   Colloid a. — Prepared by the interaction of equal parts of meta-
amido-benzoic acid, biuret, and three times its weight of phosphorus
pentoxide at 125° C. in a sealed tube. The best results are obtained
by continuing the heating for about six hours, although a similar
substance is obtained by heating for half an hour at 130° C. The
product of the reaction is a pinkish-grey friable powder, which is
insoluble in cold water, and almost insoluble in boiling water.
This substance should be repeatedly washed until all traces of
phosphoric acid are removed. When heated with Millon's reagent
it fails to give the reaction characteristic of tyrosine and proteids;
it also does not give the well-known colour reactions with the
salts of copper, nickel, cobalt, and caustic potash. It gives the
typical blue reaction associated with the name of Frohde* when
heated with sulphuric and molybdic acids, as well as the xantho
proteic reaction.
   If the amount of biuret exceeds the amount of meta-amido-benzoic
acid, then the excess of biuret left over gives its typical colour
reaction with copper sulphate and potash.
   The pinkish-grcy powder, obtained by the reaction described
above, should be dissolved in ammonium hydrate, and the resulting
solution evaporated down at the temperature of the atmosphere in
vacuo, when the resulting product appears as a number of translucent
yellowish plates, which are tasteless and inodorous, and closely
resemble in appearance both Grimaux's " collo'ides amido-benzoique
and aspartique" and dried serum-albumen.                 These plates are with
difficulty "soluble in cold water, but readily pass into solution on
warming.      The solution obtained does not coagulate on heating, but
                * FrSlide, 1

          Reactions      of certain      Synthesized Protcid-like Substances.           339
if   a trace of a soluble              salt of either barium, strontium, calcium,
magnesium, or sodium be added, a pronounced coagulum is obtained
on heating.           This point will be returned to you in a subsequent
section, but the similarity to dialysed serum-albumen may be pointed
out, as that substance is stated not to coagulate when heated.*
     The solution does not coagulate spontaneously on standing,
neither will the addition of "fibrin ferment (i.e., a nncleoproteidf)
induce coagulation.                It gives a typical xanthoproteic reaction, a
violet with copper sulphate and potash, a dark heliotrope-purple
with cobalt sulphate and potash, and a faint yellow with nickel
sulphate and potash. It also gives Frohde's sulpho-molybdic reaction ;
I  may, however, remark that I found that several substances chemi
cally allied to proteids yield this reaction, which is therefore not
diagnostic of proteids alone.                 An alcoholic solution of alloxan gives
with the solid plates a brilliant red coloration (Krasser'sJ reaction)
similar to that produced with plates of serum-albumen.                            Negative
results were obtained with the reactions associated with the names of
Liebermann,§ Adamkiewicz,|| and Millon.1T
     The solution is neutral and loevorotatory (aD = —52), and if treated
with pepsin and a 0'2 per cent, hydrochloric acid, or by an alkaline
solution of trypsin, for several days at 38° C. it does not peptonise.
     Qualitative analysis shows that this substance does not contain
phosphorus in its molecule.
     It is precipitated from solution by mercuric chloride, silver nitrate,
 and lead acetate.           These precipitates yield the same colour reactions
 as the original substance.
     The precipitate formed by the addition of lead acetate, like that
obtained by the addition of this substance to a proteid solution,
redissolves on the passage of a current of sulphuretted hydrogen
through the solution in which it is suspended, and judging by
chemical tests alone, the nature of the substance is unchanged by the
processes of precipitation and redissolving.                       Its physiological action
 is,   however,      markedly changed,          as  will   be   shown  later on.
     The original solution is readily precipitated by trichloracetic,
 phosphotungstic, phosphomolybdic acids, and by acetic acid and
 potassium ferrocyanide, as well as by salicylsulphonic acid ; the pre
 cipitate formed by this last substance is coagulated by heating in a
 manner similar to the coagulation produced by heating the pre
 cipitate resulting from the addition of this substance to a proteid

340     Dr. J. W. Pickevir.g.     The Chemical and Physiological
solution.   I  may here mention that salicylsulphonic    acid does not
precipitate disintegration products of proteids like leucine, tyrosine,
xanthine, or hypoxanthine.
   All the precipitates cited above give the colour reactions charac
teristic of the original substance.
   If the original solution is saturated with either magnesium sul
phate, ammonium sulphate, or sodium chloride, the whole of the
colloid rises to the surface of the liquid, and may be skimmed off.
On placing this scum in an excess of distilled water, it rapidly
redissolves, forming a pale yellow opalescent solution, which gives
all the chemical reactions characteristic of the original substance.
If  the amount of neutral salt be insufficient to produce precipita
tion, the passage through the liquid of a current of carbon dioxide
or of sulphur dioxide will effect the same result. Neither of these
gases will, however, cause precipitation in the entire absence of salts.
   Tho following experiments illustrate the resnlts produced by the
intravenous injection of this substance into dogs, rabbits, and cats.
The procedure adopted was identical with that described in the
previous papers published by Professor Halliburton and myself,* on
the intravascular injection of Grimaux's colloids.     In all cases the
animal was anffisthetised by a mixture of chloroform and ether, an
excess of the latter substance being used when the subjects were dogs.
   Experiment 1. — Fox terrier (weight 27 lbs. 10 oz.) ; 25 c.c. of a
0-75 per cent, solution of the colloid a. was injected, and proved
fatal. Pronounced exophthalmos and dilatation of the pupils, and
typical stretching movements were observed.
   Post-mortem examination made immediately after death revealed
pronounced clots in the jugular vein, inferior vena cava, and portal
vein, and a slight clot in the left ventricle and in the pnlmonary
artery.
   Experiment 2. — Large black cat (weight 9 lbs. 6 oz.) ; 40 c.c. of the
colloid proved fatal, with similar symptoms as above.        Immediate
post-vwrtem examination showed pronounced clots in the left ventricle,
right auricle, inferior vena cava, portal, and jugular veins. The
remainder of the blood was fluid, but coagulated very rapidly after
withdrawal.
   Expet^iment 3.
                  — Black rabbit ; 38 c.c. of the same substance pro
duced a similar result.
   Experiment 4. — Albino rabbit ; 42 c.c. proved fatal. Death was
accompanied by pronounced exophthalmos and dilatation of the
pupils and stretching movements of the limbs. Post-mortem exami
nation showed the blood throughout the vessels to be fluid. It, how
ever, rapidly coagulated after withdrawal from the vessels, and the

the injection of the colloid was also hastened; thus after 20 c.c. of
the colloid had been injected, the time of complete coagulation of
blood withdrawn from the carotids was hastened by 2 minutes,
after 30 c.c. by 3| minutes, and after 35 c.c. by 4 minutes.
    It will   he evident that the results recorded above are  similar    to, if  not
indistinguishable from,      those produced  by the intravenous    injection of a
nucleoproteid.
     When slowly introduced          into the circulation of dogs, and to a
 much lesser degree of rabbits, in minute quantities, the effect pro
duced on the coagulability of the blood is the converse of that
resulting from the introduction of larger quantities.              This effect is
 more pronounced than that obtained by the intravenous injection of
 Grimaux's colloids, and more resembles Wooldridge's* " negative
 phase," which is characteristic of a nucleoproteid, but is not so pro
 nounced as the result obtained with that substance.
     This result is illustrated by the following experiment : —
     Experiment 5. — Large black mongrel.             Anaesthetic, ether and
 morphia (weight, 60 lbs.) ; 1 c.c. of a 0-025 per cent, solution colloid a
 was injected very slowly, the injection being distributed over half an
 hour, at the end of which time the retardation of the time of coagu
 lation of blood withdrawn from the animal's carotid was found to be
 8 minutes 30 seconds.         A second dose of 1 c.c. of the same solution
 injected     and  distributed  over 20 minutes caused a further retardation
 in the time of coagulation of the carotid blood of 2 minutes ; but
 a third injection distributed over a similar period of time hastened
 the coagulability of the blood that had been previously retarded, so
  that the retardation, as compared with the time of coagulation before
  the injection of the colloid, was only 1 minute 30 seconds.              After a
  still further injection of the colloid, the blood coagulated more
  rapidly than in the normal condition, and finally, when the dose was
  pushed, intravascular coagulation of the animal's blood occurred,
  and death resulted.
     If the colloid is separated from the solution by saturation with
  magnesium sulphate, sodium chloride, or ammonium sulphate, as before
  described, and the scum redissolved in distilled water, the opalescent
  solution obtained will, when intravenously injected into pigmented
  rabbits, produce typical intravascular coagulation.          Repetition of the
  process      of precipitation and redissolving however, destroys the
  physiological activity in a manner similar to the result produced
  with both nucleo-proteids and Grimaux's synthesised colloids.

  hydrogen over the precipitate formed by the addition of lead acetate
   to the colloid is injected intravenously        into pigmented rabbits or

This result shows that the chemical reactions used for " testing
proteids are not sufficiently delicate to indicate the chemical changes
which are demonstrable by physiological methods. The following
experiment illustrates this result : —
   Experiment G. — Black rabbit (weight 7 lbs. 9 oz*.) ; ansesthetie,
chloroform and ether; 120 c.c. of rcdissolved solution injected pro
duced dyspnoea, exophthalmos, dilatation of pupils.     A further injec
tion of 10 c.c. of this substance was immediately fatal.    Post-mortem
examination failed to reveal any clots in the animal's vessels.   Blood
withdrawn from the carotids during the injection showed only one
minute's decrease in the time taken to complete coagulation.
   Experiment 7. — In another experiment, where minute quantities of
this substance were very slowly injected, there was no retardation of
the time of coagulation, like that produced by the original substance
or by a nncleo-proteid.
   Colloid — This substance

                                                 is
biuret, and phosphorus pentachloride in the ratio of equal weights of
the two former substances, with twice the weight of the latter, for six
hours at 125° to 130° C. in sealed tubes. The product of this reaction
is a grey powder insoluble in cold water, and very sparingly soluble
on heating.    This substance gives the xantho-proteic and Frohde's
reaction, but fails to give typical colour reactions with the other re
agents commonly used in testing proteids.       It should be repeatedly
washed until    all traces  of the  contaminating phosphoric acid are
removed, and then dried in vacuo at about 30° C. It readily dis
solves in concentrated ammonium hydrate, and the solution is
opalescent and lrevorotatory (aD = —48), and in appearance indis
tinguishable from that of the other colloids produced. It gives the
following distinctive reactions as classified in the annexed table, but
does not digest when subjected to the action of either pepsin and
02   per cent, hydrochloric acid for three days at 38° C, or of an
alkaline solution of trypsin, kept at the same temperature for a
similar time. It yields the following distinctive reactions: —

  It  gives negative results with the reactions of Liebermann and
Adamkiewiez, but gives the typical red coloration when the solid
plates are heated with an alcoholic solution of alloxan (Krasser's
reaction).   It is separated from solntion by neutral salts in a
manner similar to the colloid a and Grimaux's colloids.      The scum
also redissolves in distilled water giving an opalescent straw,
coloured solution.  It is precipitated by silver nitrate, lead acetate,
and mercuric chloride, as well as by phosphotnngstic, phospho-
molybdic, and trichloracetic acids, and by acetic acid and potassium
ferrocyanide.
   In the entire absence of salts it is not coagulated on boiling, but,
on the addition of a trace of a soluble salt of either sodium, magne
sium, barium, strontium, or calcium, a coagulum is obtained on
heating to 74° C.
    The fractional heat coagulation of this substance will be dealt with
in a subsequent section.
   The effect produced by the intravascular injection of various
quantities of this body is illustrated by the following expeiiment: —
   Experiment 8. — Brown mongrel (weight 27 lbs. 7 oz.) ; anaesthe
tised, with ether and morphia.      The jugular vein on the one side,
and the carotid artery on the other, were exposed, and cannulas
inserted into them. The colloid y3 was injected into the jugular vein,
and' samples of blood withdrawn from the artery.         The following
table shows the l-ate of clotting of the various samples : —
  (1) Before injection of the colloid, the blood clotted in 10 minutes
            30 seconds.
  (2)    5 c.c. of 0"75 per cent, solution of colloid dissolved in 0-75 per
            cent, saline injected.    A firm clot formed in 17 minutes
            8 seconds.
  (3) 10 c.c. more injected. Loose clot in 22 minutes.
  (4) 10 c.c. more injected. Firm clot in 31 minutes.
  (5) 10 c.c. more injected. Firm clot in 13 minutes.
  (6) After interval of 5 minutes a second sample of carotid blood
         formed a firm clot in 7 minutes 30 seconds.
  (7) 7 c.c. more injected. Firm clot in 7 minutes 30 seconds.
  (8) 10 c.c. more injected.  Firm clot in 6 minutes.
  (9) 15 c.c. more injected.  Firm  clot in 3 minutes.
 (10) 10 c.c. more injected and proved fatal.
  Immediate post-mortem examination revealed loose clots in vena

and right ventricle.

sealed lubes, for three hours equal weights of alloxan and metaniido-
benzoic acid, with twice their weight of phosphorus pentoxide.                   The
product of the reaction is a white powder, very slightly soluble in
cold water, and sparing soluble in warm water. It should be washed
in ice-cold water till the excess of phosphoric acid is removed, and
the remaining substance dissolved in concentrated ammonia. The
resulting solution is opalescent and straw-coloured, and should be
evaporated down at the temperature of the laboratory in vacuo, when
a number of translucent, yellowish plates, closely resembling the
previously described colloids are formed.               These plates are soluble
in warm water, and the solution is pale straw-coloured, opalescent,
and lsevorotatory (aD = — 41) and shows the following reactions: —

    It  is separated from solution by saturation with either magnesium

the colloid rising to the surface of the liquid as a white scum, which
redissolves, forming an opalescent solution when thrown into dis
tilled water. It is precipitated by silver nitrate, lead acetate, and
mercuric chloride.        If the precipitate formed by the addition of lead
acetate is suspended in distilled water, and a current of sulphuretted
hydrogen is passed through the liquid, the precipitated colloid again
passes into solution.
    When heated in the presence of a trace of a neutral salt, fractional
heat-coagulation is obtained, which will bo detailed in a subsequent
section.
    If the colloid 7 is injected into the circulation of dogs or pigmented
 rabbits, even in large quantities, it does not produce intravascular
 coagulation, although it somewhat hastens the coagulability of blood
 withdrawn from the carotid.
     The colloid 7, although yielding many of the chemical reactions that
 have been used as distinctive tests for proteids, and also behaving in a
 very   similar manner    to the   previously described proteid-like colloids,   does

not, like them, produce intravascular coagulation ichen intravenously

duced into'the circulation of dogs, very slowly and in minute quan
tities, produce a retardation of the coagulation of blood withdrawn
from the carotids.
    Colloid o. — The colloid c is formed by heating at 125° C. in sealed
tubes for three hours, equal weights of para-amidobenzoic acid and
phosphorus pentachloride.          The resulting product, a grey friable
powder, insoluble in cold water, was, after washing to remove the
contaminating phosphoric acid, dissolved in concentrated ammonia,
and evaporated down at a low temperatnre in vacuo. The resulting
substance appears as a number of translucent yellowish plates,
apparently similar to those previously described. They are soluble
in warm water, forming an opalescent straw-coloured solution, which
is Itevorotatory (aD = — 42). This solution gives the xantho-proteic
and Frohde's reaction, but fails to give the typical colour reactions of
proteid-like snbstances with salts of copper, cobalt, or nickel and
caustic potash ; neither does it give the reactions of Millon, Lieber-
mann, or Adamkiewicz.          It is not precipitated by salicylsulphonic
acid, but it is precipitated by salts of the heavy metals. Neutral
salts separate it from solution like the preceding substances.         When
freed from salts, it does not coagulate on heating, but if a trace of
sodium chloride or of another neutral salt be present, it coagulates
on heating to 75° C. When intravenously injected into pigmented
rabbits, it fails to produce intravascular coagulation, neither does it
hasten the coagulability of blood withdrawn from the carotids.              It
                                      "
fails to  induce  a  "negative phase     in the coagulation  of  dogs' blood.
 This series of results lends additional support to the view that the
coagulation of the blood resulting from intravenous injection of tho
colloid, is due to the interaction of the colloid with the constituents of
the plasma, and not to the heavy nature of colloid molecule.
    Colloid e. — The colloid c is prepared by heating together equal
weights of tyrosine and xanthine with twice their weight of phos
phorus pentachloride at 125° C. for three hoars.            The product of
the reaction is a yellowish powder slightly soluble in warm water.
After repeated washing in cold water, it is dissolved in concentrated
ammonia, and the resulting solution evaporated down in vacuo at a
low temperature. The resulting substance consists of a number of
translucent yellowish plates like those previously described. It is
readily soluble in warm water, forming a yellowish opalescent solu
tion, which is leavorotatory (aD = —38).
    This solution gives a typical red when heated with Millon's reagent,
which is not due to an excess of tyrosine, since the intermediate pro
duct in the preparation of the substance fails to give this reaction.
It does not give any other of the distinctive proteid colour reactions,
                                                                2 d 2

cause     intravascular coagulation of the blood when intravenously
 injected into dogs or pigmented rabbits, neither will the very slow
injection of minute quantities into the circulation of dogs induce a

 reaction, and negative results with the other tests characteristic of
proteids.
    It also behaves with neutral salts and salts of the heavy metals in
a similar manner to the previously                   described substances. When
intravenously injected into the circulation of dogs or pigmented
rabbits, it fails to induce intravascular coagulation, neither will it
cause coagulation when added to extravascular 1 per cent, sodium

    Colloid rj. — The colloid t) is prepared by the interaction of tyrosine
and phosphorus pentoxide for three honrs at 130° C. in sealed
tubes.      The product of this reaction is a pinkish friable powder,
sparingly soluble in cold water and soluble on boiling.                        This sub
stance does not yield Millon's reaction.               After washing in cold water
to remove the contaminating phosphoric acid, the powder is dissolved
in concentrated ammonia, and a straw-coloured opalescent solution is
obtained.       This is evaporated down in vacuo, and the resulting sub
stance appears as a number of plates, similar in appearance to those
of the previously described colloids, and which are soluble in warm
water, giving an opalescent solution.              This solution is precipitated by
salicylsulphonic acid and the precipitate coagulates on heating. It is
also precipitated by salts of the heavy metals, and separated from
solution by neutral salts. It does not yield any of the distinctive
colour reactions of proteids, and fails to produce intravascular coagu
lation when intravenously injected into rabbits.
        II.  The   Fractional Heat Coagulation of Synthesized Colloids.
    The method of differentiating the members of a mixture of proteids
by fractional heat coagulation was introduced by Halliburton,* and
employed by him more especially in the examination of the proteids
of serum. This method was subsequently used by Corin and Berardf
in separating the albumins of the white of egg, and by Chittenden
      * Halliburton,  '

rendered more accnrate by    Hewlett, t who substituted a bath of cod-
liver oil for the water bath usually employed as the heating medium,
and exhaustively dealt with the adverse criticisms made by Haycraf t
and Duggan.J
  I  have applied this method, using an oil bath, in the examination
of the proteid like colloids synthesised by Professor Grimaux and
myself. As pointed out in a previous section, in the entire absence
of salts these substances do not coagulate, even when boiled. For
the sake oF comparison the following experiments were performed,
so as to satisfy the following conditions : — (a) A 2 per cent, solution
of the substance under examination was always used. (6) The
diluent fluid always consisted of a 0'75 per cent, solution of sodium
chloride,    (c) In each experiment 10 c.c of the fluid under examina
tion was used, and the test-tubes were of uniform internal diameter.
By this means the mass to be heated remained constant. (<i) The
thermometer wa3 placed in the middle of the test-tube containing the
fluid under examination.

coagulation temperature of 70° to 71° C.
   The colloid B (of Grimaux) which is prepared from the same
reagents as the colloid A, but the temperature at which the reaction
of synthesis is conducted is allowed to rise to 130° C, shows on
heating one faint appearance of flocculi at 56° to 58° C, and a
second more pronounced coagulum at 70° to 72° C.

   The colloid a, if care has been taken to keep the temperature of

1543      Reactions    of certain        Synthesised Proteid-like Substances.
     The colloid »/ coagnlates only
                                      at 52° C.
    Adopting    the   conclusion  of   Halliburton that the precipitates ob
 tained bj the fractional heat coagulation of a proteid substance,
 correspond with various constituents of that substance, we may
 possibly conclude that those synthesised colloids which yield frac-
 tional heat-coagula are mixtures of different colloidal substances.
    Thus the colloid B would consist of two substances which might
 be designated B, and B2, and the colloid y3 of three substances,
 designated colloids fa, fa, and fa respectively, and the colloid £ of
two substances, ci and J52.              I
                                    have endeavoured to ascertain in the
cases of the colloids Bi and B, and of the colloids fa, fa, and fa
whether each of these substances will equally induce intravascular
coagulation of the blood, when intravenously injected into pigmented
rabbits and dogs.
    The method of procedure adopted was briefly as follows : — The
activity of a solution of the colloid was tested by a control experi
ment.      One of the constituents was removed by fractional heat-
coagnlation and the effect, if any, produced by the intravascular in
jection of the remaining colloid in solution was tested.* The follow
ing is the record of some of the results obtained : —
    Colloid B, after a removal of colloid Bi will, if intravenously
injected, induce intravascular coagulation in pigmented rabbits, and
if slowly injected in minute doses a "negative phase" in dogs.
    Colloids fa and fa will still, after the removal of colloid fa, induce
intravascular coagulation in pigmented rabbits, although a much
larger dose is required after the removal of fa and fa than if the
mixture of the three substances is injected, if only fa is removed the
activity of the mixture is not impaired.                               I
                                                   From this conclude that

allied chemical constitution are heated together in sealed tabes with
an excess of either phosphorus pentachloride or pentoxide, a series of
colloidal substances are formed which, when freed from the con
taminating phosphoric acid, and dissolved in concentrated ammonia,
give opalescent solutions that, on evaporating down in vacuo, yield
substances closely resembling in physical, chemical, and physiolo
gical properties certain proteids.
     These colloidal substances, although they differ from one another
in minor details, are usually distinguished by the following charac
teristics : —
      1. They are soluble in warm water, forming opalescent lasvorota-
tory solutions.
     2. The resulting solutions yield the principal colour reactions
hitherto deemed diagnostic of proteids.
     3. In the absence of salts, solutions of these colloids do not coagu
 late on heating.        In the presence of a trace of a neutral salt they
 coagulate on heating at temperatures very similar to proteid solu
 tions.
      4. Fractional heat-coagulation shows the colloidal solutions are a
 mixture of different substances.
      5. The different constituents     of the colloidal solution exhibit
 different physiological action.
      6. In the presence of an excess of neutral salts, or of salts of the
  heavy metals, the colloidal solutions behave in a manner similar to
  proteid solutions.
      7. When introduced into the circulation of pigmented rabbits, dogs,
  and cats, certain of these substances (viz., the colloids designated
  A, B, C, a and /3) produce intravascular coagulation of the blood in a
  manner similar to a nucleo-proteid.        They also hasten the coagul
  ability    of  the  blood  withdrawn  from  the carotid, and will, when
  slowly injected intravenously in minute quantities into dogs, produce
  a retardation of the coagulability of the intravascular blood, e.g., a
  " negative phase."
       8. Apparently these colloidal substances are, owing to both their
  physical and chemical properties and their physiological behaviour,
   the nearest synthesised bodies at present known to proteids.

      An Experimental Examination into the Growth of the
          Blastoderm of the Chick." By Richard Assheton, M.A.
           Comrminicated by Adam Sedgwick, F.R.S.                Received
           November 12, — Read December 10, 189b".
        In making an experimental study of the growth of the blastoderm
    of the chick, I had two chief objects in view :

350        Mr, R. Assheton.          An Experimental Examination
     (1) To test by actual experiment Duval's* theory of the formation
            of the primitive streak.
     (2) To try and determine experimentally whether the whole or
            only part of the actual embryo is developed by the activity
            of the primitive streak. And further, if only a part, to
            determine its limits.
    With regard     to the first question     it may   be remarked that    Duval's
 account is generally accepted, although perhaps greater stress is laid
 upon it by foreign and American writers than by embryologists in
this country.
    According to Duval's acconnt, there is in the freshly laid and nnin-
cubated egg a groove wliich separates the blastoderm from tho yolk.
 The groove, he says, is broader and more conspicuous at the posterior
margin than at any other point.              This he compares to the anus of
Rusconi or blastopore of the segmenting frog's egg.
    During the first few hours of incubation the edge of the blastoderm
is said to advance over the yolk at every point except at this most
posterior margin bounding the groove, which he regards as equiva
lent to the frog's blastopore.          At this spot there is no advance. The
portions    of the   edge   of   the    blastoderm    adjoining this part swing
round to meet each other in the middle line, and eventually fuse
and form what Duval calls the " plaque axiale."
    This structure is in reality the primitive streak, and, according to
Duval, it becomes visible as such during about the tenth to fifteenth
hours of incubation by reason of the subsequent hollowing out of
the subjacent yolk by the extension backwards of the sub-germinal
cavity.
    Such a mode of growth would be very extraordinary and interest
ing if true, and would be veiy acceptable to those who believe that
the growth in length of the vertebrate embryo is caused by a concre
scence of two at first separated germinal rims.
    Naturally this account of the formation of the primitive streak as
given by Duval is frequently quoted by the many adherents to the
concrescence    theory.
    During the last few years experimental methods have been intro
duced much more freely into investigations of animal development.
Foremost amongst the workers upon these lines is Dr. Wilhelm Roux,
who experimented by destroying certain cells of the segmenting eggs
of frogs, and noting the result after some days of development. He
has been followed in similar work by Morgan and Ume Tsuda and
others.
    The eggs of frogs have been the object of experiment of a different
   •  " De la Formation du Blastoderme        dans l'CEuf  d'Oiseau," '
                                                                        Annales des
Sciences Naturclles, Zoologie,' vol. 18.

           into the Growth    of the Blastoderm  of the Chicle.      351
kind, such as that of Professor Oscar Hertwig, who studied the
various monstrosities obtained by mechanical compressions, by super-
maturation of the ovum, and addition of various salts to water in
which the eggs were developing.        Similar work has been done upon
sea-urchin's eggs by several biologists (Pouchet and Chabry, Herbst,
Ac).
   There are other most valuable records of the results obtained by
separating the several spheres of the early stages of segmentation of
eggs of Ctenophores, Echinoderms and Amphioxus by Chun, Driesch,
Wilson, and others.
   Kastschencko, by injuring portions of the germ ring of Elasmo-
branch embryos, has produced very valuable evidence in connexion
with the concrescence theory, and Morgan has by similar methods
examined the development of Teleosteans.
   As far as I know, an experimental study of the development of the
avian blastoderm has not hitherto been made.
   The method adopted, which is very simple, was as follows. The
egg was first of all opened at one side, and a bristle inserted into the
j-olk at some distance away from the blastoderm, to mark its anterior
and posterior axis.
   The yolk, with its surrounding albumen, was then turned out into
a glass vessel having a rather greater capacity than that of an ordinary
egg shell.
   The yolk was arranged so that the blastoderm floated uppermost,
and a wire or celluloid ring was placed over it to prevent the yolk
from floating to the surface.
   A fine sable hair was then inserted in the blastoderm, and its posi
tion measured by a micrometer eye-piece and recorded in tenths of a
millimetre. The vessel was filled up with albumen and covered
with a glass lid, and placed in the incubator at a temperature of
104°  F.
   Under these     conditions, although development was slower than
under normal conditions, many embryos reached, after about forty-
eight hours, an age equivalent to a normal thirty to thirty-six
hours' chick with nine or ten pairs of mesoblastic somites.
   To come now to the results of the experiments, it is clear that if
Duval's theory is correct a hair inserted in the areaopaca at the point
a (fig. A (i)) ought to appear, in a specimen in which the primitive
streak is formed, somewhere in front of the primitive streak. It,
however, does not; it appears in the area opaca behind the primitive
streak at a, fig. A (ii).
   So again if the primitive streak is formed by the concrescence of
the posterior margin, the sables inserted at the posterior edge at XX
should either appear in the primitive streak or else prevent its
formation.

   On the contrary, they are found far behind the primitive streak in
the area opaea.
   These facts seem to show that the primitive streak     not formed  is
from the posterior edge of the blastoderm  as Duval maintains.
    As   rule, in the unincubated blastoderm the area opaca and area
         a
pellucida are very fairly well defined.
   If, when this       the case, a sable hair
                          is                        inserted just within

distinction, the sable      inserted about one quarter the distance from
                               is
P  to A, the sable hair       found, after the development of the primi
                                is
tive streak, piercing the posterior end of the primitive streak —
whereas, according to Duval's account,          ought to be somewhere in
                                                    it
front of the primitive streak.
   If a hair inserted in the median line rather further towards the
                    is
centre of the blastoderm,          found near the middle of the primitive
                                     it   is
streak, or, if placed about half way between the inner edge of the
posterior part of the area opaca and the centre of the blastoderm (as
at c),   it   found in the anterior part of the primitive streak; and,
              is
when the sable       inserted at the centre of the blastoderm,
                         is                                       appears  it
at the front end, or just in front of the primitive streak (fig. A, d).
   The foregoing proves,         think, conclusively, that the primitive
                                    I
streak      developed from that portion of the unincubated blastoderm
             is
which lies between the centre of the blastoderm and the posterior

 margin of the area pellucida.           The area opaca takes no part at all in
 the formation thereof.
     I may add that from a careful examination of surface views of
 living and preserved specimens, and from sections,                 I  find it just as
 difficult to corroborate Duval's account of the formation of the
 primitive streak as       I  do from the experimental study              I have just
described.
    I  come now to the second part of the inquiry ; namely, what part
of the actual embryo does the primitive streak give rise to ?
    A sable hair inserted at the centre of the blastoderm appears at the
anterior end of the primitive streak.
    If such a specimen is allowed to develop for some hours longer,
until the medullary plate and medullary groove are clearly formed,
these structures are found to be in front of the sable hair ; that is to
say, the sable hair is still at the front end of the primitive streak
 (fig. B). If a specimen, in which the sable hair has been inserted at
the same spot — that is to say, at the- centre of the unincnbated
blastoderm — is left until several pairs of mesoblastic somites have
appeared, the hair is found at the level of the most anterior pair of
somites (fig.  B (iii)).
    From these specimens it seems clear that all those parts in front of
the first pair of mesoblastic somites (that is to say, the heart, the
brain, and medulla         oblongata,      the olfactory,    optic    and    auditory

354          Mr. R. Assheton.      A n Experimental Examination
organs and fore gut) are developed from that portion of the unincu-
bated blastoderm which lies anterior to the centre of the blastoderm,
and that all the rest of the embryo is formed by the activity of the
primitive streak area.
    I    have found it very difficult to determine, exactly, the anterior
limits of the embryo in the unincubated blastoderm. This, no doubt,
is due to the fact that, for the production of the anterior end of the
embryo, very complicated foldings of the blastoderm are called into
play, and the insertion of a bristle or the infliction of any injury to
the delicate parts of the blastoderm involved in the process, almost
entirely prevents anything like a normal course of development.
     However, such little success as       I  have had gives the following
 results : — A hair inserted at the most anterior border of the area
 pellucida is found far in front of the primitive streak.
     A hair inserted only slightly in front of the centre of the blasto
 derm appears (in a specimen in which the medullary folds are just
becoming visible) in the medullary plate in front of the primitive
 streak.      In older specimens, after the head-fold has been formed,
 the embryos are extremely abnormal when the sable has been inserted
 in the region under discussion.
     Indeed, very few will develop as far as the formation of the head-
 fold.
     The only facts    I can derive from    the insertion   of sable hairs in
 this area are : —
      ( 1) That it interferes very seriously with the course of develop
              ment.
      (2) That the bristle appears inside the two anterior horns of the
               area vasculosa.
      (3) That if placed some little way anterior to the centre it is found
               apparently in front of the embryo, but it interferes so greatly
               with the head-fold that it is difficult to say whether it has,
               or has not, perforated the anterior part of the embryo.
      I   havo shown that a hair inserted between the centre of the
 blastoderm and the hinder margin of the area pellucida is found after
 about twenty honrs of incubation in the primitive streak.            When a
 specimen in which the sable has been similarly placed is allowed
  to develop until several mesoblastic somites have been formed, it is
  found to be posterior to the first formed mesoblastic somites.
      For instance, in the specimen with me, the blastoderm measured
  4'3 mm. in diameter.         The sable was inserted 1"3 mm. from the
  posterior edge of the blastoderm.        After forty-one hours of incuba
  tion seven pairs of mesoblastic somites had been formed, and the
  sable hair was a short distance posterior to the 7th pair of somites.
       From such specimens as these we are,      I  think, bound to conclude

that the primitive streak is converted directly into a pari of the
embryo, that is to say, the part of the embryo posterior to, and in
cluding the first pair of mesoblastic somites.
   With regard to the         area vasculosa, my experiments         seem to indi
cate that the part       of the blastoderm which becomes area vascnlosa
is that part which lies on the inner edge of the posterior part of
the area opaca of the unincubated blastoderm.                    It is along this
edge where, according to Koller,* a white crescent is always visible.
   Koller, further, asserts that this white crescent is grooved. From
this crescent and groove Koller derives the primitive streak and
primitive groove by the conversion of the transverse crescent and
groove into a longitudinal streak and groove.
   I think that all recent authors are agreed that it is not grooved,
and most admit that it has nothing to do with the primitive streak.
   It is, however, quite true that a crescentic whiter area is sometimes
visible here, but in, I think, the majority of cases there is nothing of

marked off from the underlying yolk-mass, can be detected.                         This

   The exceedingly high insulating properties of liquid oxygen and
liquid air indicate that these bodies are dielectrics, and possess a
dielectric constant or specific inductive capacity which it is necessary
to determine.    We have, therefore, lately made some measurements
which have enabled us to assign a number representing, in all
probability, a close approximation to these constants.
   The remarkable non-conducting quality of these liquid gases for
electricity enabled us to employ a method which, generally speaking,
is not applicable to liquids other than those of very high specific
resistance, or insulating power.
   The method used by us in these experiments consists in the
employment of a small condenser composed of metal plates which
can be plunged beneath the surface of the liqnid gas, and the
capacity of this condenser measured when the dielectric between
the plates is first gaseous air at ordinary temperature and pres
sure, and is next replaced by the liquid oxygen or liquid air.
In order to determine the capacity of this condenser, which is
necessarily small and of the order of O'OOl microfarad, we adopted
the well-known device of charging the small condenser with a
high potential (100 volts) and then discharging it into a much
larger, well insulated mica condenser, having a capacity of about
0"5 microfarad.    This process was repeated ten times, and the larger
condenser was then discharged through a standardised ballistic
galvanometer. A specially constructed and highly insulated key was
employed to charge the small condenser by means of a battery of fifty
small lithanode secondary cells ; and then to discharge it into the
larger condenser. The success of this method depends entirely on
the absence of sensible leakage in the condensers, and it is essential
to show that the small condenser loses no sensible portion of its
charge by leakage or conduction during the interval which elapses
between disconnecting it from the battery and connecting it to the
large condenser, which acts as a reservoir.
   In these experiments the small condenser consisted of seventeen
plates of carefully flattened aluminium, about 1 mm. in thickness;
each plate being 5 cm. wide by 15 cm. long.        In order to separate
the plates, small distance pieces of crown glass were employed,

         Dielectric Constant of Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Air.     359
each fragment    being about 3 mm. square and 1 mm. thick.       Four
of these fragments were affixed to each metal plate with a touch
of shellac at the four corners and one fixed in the middle. The
seventeen plates were then piled one on the other, the glass frag
ments acting as separators, and the alternate plates were connected
together by wires soldered to each series.    A metal clamp kept all
the plates in position.  The condenser so formed consisted of seven
teen plates, eight being the positive, and nine the negative surfaces.
The glass distance pieces had a total surface of very nearly 1 per
cent, of the total opposed surface of the plates.    The condenser so
formed had a capacity of 0-001031 of a microfarad when gaseous air
at 15° C. and normal pressure formed the dielectric.
   If such a condenser having a capacity C is charged to a potential
V and then discharged n times in succession into a larger reservoir
condenser of capacity C, it is easy to show that at the end of the
n successive charges the quantity Q contained in the large condenser
is given by the series
                      Q =       CV^tm'+m1           m"),
where
                                m=C+C''
Hence we have               Q   = C'V   m-(l-m»).
   The capacity   C   of the small aluminium condenser may be con
sidered to be made up of two parts ; a part which is changed when
liquid oxygen is substituted for gaseous oxygen or air on immersing
the condenser, and which thereby becomes increased.        If K is the
dielectric constant of liquid oxygen, referred to that of gaseous
oxygen at —182° C. as unity; and if r- is the capacity of this variable
part of the condenser when the dielectric is gaseous oxygen, then
Kc is its capacity when liquid oxygen is substituted for the gaseous
oxygen at the same temperature.
   In the next place there is a small part of the whole capacity due to
the glass separators.     These, as a whole, have a surface very nearly
equal to 1 per  cent,  of the whole surface of the metal plates, and a
dielectric constant,  as shown below, when cooled to —182° C, of 5'0.
Hence it follows that that part of the whole capacity of the con
denser which is due to the glass separators, may be represented very
nearly by 5c/100.
  This part of the capacity remains practically constant whether the
condenser is lifted out of the liquid oxygen into the cold gaseous
oxygen lying above    it,
                       and which     at nearly the same temperature,
                                        is
or put into it, as long as the condenser      very nearly at the same
                                              is
temperature in the two conditions.

   We know, however, that the ratio of M/M' cannot be very far from
unity.   A rough experiment had shown that K was number in the                    a
neighbourhood of 1*5, and a calculation shows that when ten dis
charges of the small condenser are made in each case into the large
condenser, and   if the large condenser has a capacity of 0'5 micro
farad, and the small one a capacity of nearly O'OOl microfarad, that
the ratio M/M' = 1030/1019 nearly.         Hence M/M' comes in as a cor
recting  factor of about    per  cent,
                                   1   in value.
   Before relying on the above method,        was necessary to prove that
                                                              it
the loss of charge of the small condenser was negligible during the
time elapsing between the end of the charge and the end of the dis
charge of the small condenser.

          Dielectric Constant of Liquid Oxygen and Liquid Air.                      361
    We found on trial that although the small condenser had a capacity
-of only 0'001031 microfarad, it held its charge when charged with
  100 volts, and placed beneath the surface of liquid air in the most
 extraordinary way. The test for insulation was as follows : —
    The small condenser was charged with 100 volts, and discharged
 through the galvanometer instantly. The galvanometer throw was
 95 scale divisions.
    The small condenser was then charged and allowed to stand ten
 minutes insulated.        It was then discharged through the galvanometer,
 and the throw was 90 scale divisions.            In like manner it was charged
 and insulated for forty-seven minutes, and the throw was then 80 scale
 divisions.
    The above figures show that the charge of the small insulated con
 denser decreased only by about 15 per cent, in three-quarters of an
 hour when placed beneath liquid air, and hence the loss of charge in
 one-tenth of a second was quite inappreciable.*
    The same remarkable insulation is found when the small condenser
 is held in the cold gaseous oxygen lying above the liquid oxygen.
 The low temperature of — 182° C. prevents any sensible leakuge
 across the glass distance pieces, and also increases the specific resist
 ance of the glass itself.
    As a further instance of the very high insulating power of liquid air,
 we may mention that we charged the small condenser when immersed
 in liquid air with a Wimshurst electrical machine, and, after insu
 lating the condenser and waiting a few moments, closed the terminal's
of the condenser by a wire.            A small spark was seen at the contacts.
 We thus constructed a little Leyden jar, the dielectric of which was
 liquid air, and the coatings the aluminium plates.                       This liquid
 Leyden jar held its charge perfectly.
    Having satisfied ourselves in this manner that the condenser when
immersed in liquid air would lose no sensible portion of its charge
during the fraction (about one-tenth) of a second in which the charge
and discharge key was moving between its contacts, we proceeded to
experiment in the following manner. The condenser was placed in a
very large vacuum vessel, holding about two litres of liquid oxygen,
and it was charged as described, and discharged into a very good mica
condenser, made by Dr. Muirhead, which had an exceedingly high
insulation.      The process of charging and discharging ten times occu
pied, perhaps, two seconds.
   * These figures do not of course measure the electrical resistance of the liquid
oxygen alone.     They show, however, that the immersion of the condenser in liquid
oxygen enormously decreased or entirely destroyed any surface leakage over the
small glass separators, and, as we have found by an independent examination,
increased the resistivity of the glass itself. The specific resistance of liquid oxygen
itself is exceedingly high.

      The resultant charge having been measured on the ballistic gal
 vanometer,        the condenser was lifted out into the cold gaseons oxygen

   It will be seen that the mean galvanometer throw, when the con
denser was immersed in liquid oxygen, was 10'903 centims., and the
mean throw, when raised into the gaseous oxygen, was 7-146 centims.
   One matter which we felt it important to examine, was whether
thero was any correction needed for the change in the dielectric con
stant of the glass separators with temperature.
    Since these glass separators had a total surface of nearly 1 per
cent, of the area of the metal plates, the condenser may be regarded
as consisting of two condensers joined in parallel, one consisting of a
glass dielectric condenser having an effective surface of 1, and the
other a condenser having a liquid or gaseous oxygen dielectric
having an effective area of 99.            In the course of these experiment*
we have therefore examined the effect of low temperature upon the
dielectric constants of glass, paraffined paper, and mica. Wo find
that on cooling these bodies to —182° C. they experience a marked
reduction in dielectric constant.           The dielectric constant of a cortain
specimen of crown glass was reduced by 21,4 per cent, by cooling to
the temperature of liquid air or to — 185° C. .The dielectric con
stant of paraffined paper was reduced by 28-4 per cent, under the
same circumstances.*           We are engaged in a systematic examination
of the influence of very low temperatures on the dielectric constants
and specific resistances of the principal dielectric bodies.           The crown
glass used as separators in the construction of our small condenser
had a specific inductive capacity of about 6"0 at ordinary tempera
ture, and this at the low temperature would be reduced to nearly 5'0.
Hence in estimating the capacity of the condenser, as constructed,
there comes in as we have seen a correction from the presence of the
glass. We selected glass in the first instance rather than ebonite or
sulphur, as we thought it probable we should use the same con
denser in determining other dielectric constants, and we wished to
construct the separators of a material which was very rigid and not
easily acted upon by oils or other liquids.
    Taking the formula above given, we can deduce from the observed
results the required constant, for, we have                                     J

only 3'01 per cent, in dielectric constant.

  364          Profs.   J. A.  Fleming and      J.  Dewar.     On   the
  as the dielectric      constant of liquid oxygen referred to that of the
  overlying gaseous oxygen at — 182° C. as unity.              Since the alumi
 nium condenser is at the same temperature when the two measure
  ments are made, no correction         is necessary for any change of form
 of. the condenser.
    To determine the dielectric constant of liquid oxygen in terms of
 that of a vacuum taken as unity, we require to know the dielectric
 constant of the gaseous oxygen lying on the surface of the liquid
 oxygen referred to the same unit.
    Boltzmann and Klemencic havo both shown that the true dielectric
 constant of air at a temperature of 0° C. and 760 mm. is P00059.
 That of oxygen gas at the same temperature and pressure is not
 very different.       If  the value of K — 1 for gases varies directly as
 the pressure, and if temperature per se makes no difference, then the
 dielectric constant of the gaseous oxygen lying on the surface of the
 liquid oxygen, and which has a temperature of —182° C. nearly, and
 a density about three times that of the gas at 15° C, is not far
 from 1'002.      Hence the correcting factor to be applied to the above
 value of the dielectric constant of the liquid is at the most P002,
 and the true dielectric constant of liquid oxygen at — 182° C. and
 under a pressure of 760 mm. is not far from P493.
    We intend to examine this correction more closely.
    As a matter of fact, we were not able to detect any difference
 between the capacity of the small condenser when held in air at
 ordinary temperature (15° C.) and pressure, and in the cold gaseous
 oxygen at —182° C. lying on the surface of the liquid oxygen.
    Until we are able to make a better determination we may take the
 above number, P491, therefore, as representing in all probability a
 close approximation to the dielectric constant of liquid oxygen.
    The interesting question then arises how far does liquid oxygen
 obey llaxwoll's law, by which the product of the dielectric con
 stant and the magnetic permeability                 should be equal to the
 square of the refractive index for waves of infinite wave-length 'r
 The materials are at hand for making this comparison, as we have
 ourselves just determined the magnetic permeability                     of liquid
 oxygen,   and  find  it  to be  1 '00287,* and the refractive index of liquid
 oxygen has been determined by Professors Liveing and Dewar for
 several different wave-lengths.f

    They state that they consider the best results are given by the first
two observations.         Taking these wave-lengths 4416 and 6438, and
the refractive indices corresponding to them, we have calculated from
them, by the formula

 as  follows: —

    The square of this number is 1-4837, and this, therefore, is the value
 of the square of the refractive index for waves of infinite wave-length
in liquid oxygen.
    Taking the product of the dielectric constant, K = 1*491, as above
 determined, and that of the magnetic permeability, p = 1-00287, as
 previously obtained by us, we find that this product Kp is 1-495, and
 hence that there is therefore a very fairly close agreement between
 the number representing the square of the refractive index for waves
 of infinite wave-length and the above product. The difference
 amounts to about two-thirds of one per cent.              Hence liquid oxygen
 is a substance which very closely obeys Maxwell's law.
    Wo have applied the same apparatus to the determination of the
 dielectric constant of liquid air obtained in exactly the same manner,
 and Table II below gives the results of the observations taken in
 liquid air. The observed results, when corrected as above described,
 give for the dielectric constant of liquid air the number 1*495, which
 is slightly more than that of the liquid oxygen.            As, however, by the
 time the experiment was complete the liquid air had practically
 become liquid oxygen owing to the nearly complete evaporation of
 the nitrogen, the coincidence of the two results is only what was to
 be expected.

   With regard to the above-determined dielectric constants for liquid
oxygen and liquid air, it may be remarked that these numbers are
smaller than those which have been obtained for almost any other solid
or liquid substance of which we have been able to find the measured
results. It has been already pointed out that large dielectric constant
generally accompanies small specific resistance in a dielectric, and
vice versa.      Hence, as the specific resistance of the liquid oxygen is
very large — it being a very fine insulator— it is not surprising to find
the dielectric constant very small. As above mentioned, at a very
low temperature, the dielectric constant of some other solid dielectrics
has been found by us to be very much reduced, and hence an interest
ing field of research is opened out for the examination of the change
produced by low temperatures on the dielectric constants of other well-
known solid insulators, such as paraffin, ebonite, gatta-percha, mica,
sulphur, spermaceti, and various frozen liquid insulators, such as the
 numerous hydrocarbon oils, carbon disulphide, ice, &c* We hope to

insulators by heating   them.    As far as we can see, our   initial results at low tempera
tures for glass and paraffin are consistent with his.         It will be interesting to see

 be   in a position shortly to furnish farther information on this point,
  and, also, if possible, to say whether the fall in dielectric constant is
 accompanied by a reduction in the refractive index ; that is to say,
 whether Maxwell's law is obeyed at low temperatures.
     We may add that we have already devised a method by which it
 will be possible to construct a condenser without the above-described
 distance pieces, and hence to free the resulting measurement from the
 small uncertainty — amounting, perhaps, to about 1 per cent. — which
 may affect the above-given numerical results, and which comes in in
 consequence of the doubt existing as to the exact area of the separa
 tors, and also the exact dielectric constant of the glass at the low
 temperature.
     It is interesting to observe that the numbers which we have found
 above for the dielectric constant of liquid oxygen and liquid air are
 not very different in order, though somewhat smaller than the dielec
 tric constant as already determined for some other liquid gases,* such
 as nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide.
     In conclusion, we may add that we have been again much indebted
 to Mr. J. E. Petavel for his kind assistance in making the above-
 described observations and measurements.
                          Note added December 15.
    In connection with the above investigation, it is interesting to note
one remarkable difference between the magnetic susceptibility of
oxygen in the liquid and in the gaseous state.               The mass of 1 c.c. of
gaseous oxygen, taken at 15° C. and 760 mm., is 0'00134 gramme.
 The mass of 1 c.c. of liquid oxygen, taken at — 182° C. and 760 mm.,
as determined by one of us (J. Dewar), is T1375 gramme.                      Hence
the ratio of the density of liquid oxygen to that of gaseous oxygen is
849 to 1.
    The magnetic susceptibility of gaseous oxygen at 15° C. and 760 mm.,
as obtained from the figures given by Faraday and E. Becquerel, is
0143x 10-6 per unit of volume, whilst the magnetic susceptibility in
the liqnid state is, as we nave shown,t 228 X 10'"'. Hence the ratio of
the magnetic susceptibility of liquid oxygen to that of gaseous
oxygen for equal volumes is 1594 to 1.
    In other words, the magnetic susceptibility of liquid oxygen is nearly
twice as great as that of gaseous oxygen for equal masses.                      The
inference is that magnetic susceptibility is not merely a property of
the molecule per se, but is a function of the state of aggregation.

                        Note added December      18.
    In addition to   the arrangements   above described for determining
 the capacity of the small condenser, we have also employed the well-
 known method of charging and discharging the small condenser
through a galvanometer by means of a contact-maker driven at a
speed of sixty contacts per second by an electrically          controlled
tuning-fork. By this means a steady deflectipn of the galvanometer
is obtained due to the passage of the rapidly recurring discharges
 through it. Preliminary observations with this apparatus have con
firmed the above-given value for the dielectric constant of liquid
 oxygen, and by a modification of it we hope shortly to make a very
careful re-determination    of the constant.
" On Subjective Colour Phenomena attending sudden Changes
      of Illumination."       By SHELFORD BlDWELL, M.A., LL.B.,
      F.R.S.    Received December 10,— Read December 17, 1896.
    The investigation which forms the subject of this paper originated
in an attempt to account satisfactorily for the colour phenomena
exhibited by Mr. C. E. Benham's " Artificial Spectrum Top," which,
when it was brought before the public, about two years ago, excited
considerable interest.
    The top consists of a disk of cardboard about 4^ in. (10'8 cm.) in
diameter, mounted upon a spindle.       One half of the disk is painted
black ; upon the white ground of the other half are drawn four suc
cessive groups of three black lines, having the form of concentric
arcs of 45°, which are at different distances from the centre, as shown
in the annexed figure ; the thickness of the lines is about -£s in.
(1 mm.). When the disk rotates, each group of black lines generally
appears to assume a different colour.
    The nature of the colours thus developed depends upon the speed
of the rotation, and upon the quality and intensity of the illumination.
After several trials,   I found that no better results, on the whole,
could be obtained than when the disk was illuminated by a 16-candle
power incandescent lamp, with a ground glass bulb, at a distance of
about 6 in. (15 cm.), and was caused to turn about five times in a
second.    These, therefore, were adopted as the standard conditions
for my experiments, the disk being mounted upon a horizontal axis,
driven by an electro-motor, and the speed regulated by comparison
with the ticks of an ordinary watch.
    When the disk rotates under the specified conditions and in the
direction indicated by the arrow in the figure, the inner group of

lines appears, to my vision, to become bright red, the next group
pinkish-brown, the next a dilute olive-green, and the outer group
dark blue.     If  the direction of rotation is reversed, the order of the
colours is also reversed.
   By far the most striking of these several hues is the first named ;
hardly any one has the slightest hesitation in pronouncing it to be
bright red. As to the blue, thero is very rarely any difference of
opinion,    though it has sometimes been called bluish-green.          The
hues of the two intermediate groups are much more undecided and
 difficult to specify, especially when they are seen separately.
                                          I
   The only serious attempts that know of to explain the origin of
 the colours shown by the top are those of Professor Liveing and of
 Captain Abney.* Professor Liveing's explanation is based upon the
 two hypotheses that the eye perceives certain of the coloured con
stituents of white light more quickly than others, red being the first
to show itself, and that the duration of the impressions due to the
different constituents also differs, blue being the last to disappear.
Captain Abney thinks that the results would be sufficiently accounted
for if the order of persistence of the three colour sensations were
violet, green, and red.
    Several objections might be urged against these explanations, but
 the adequacy of either of them seems to be conclusively negatived by

370       Mr. S. Bid well.     On Subjective Colour Phenomena
the fact that  if the thickness of the lines on the disk is much greater
than   1 mm., or, more accurately, if it subtends at the eye a greater
angle than about one-fifth of a degree, the red and some of the other
colours appear only upon the borders of the lines, their inner portions
remaining black or grey.
    The true solution, at least as regards the red and the blue, is,     I
think, to be looked for in certain phenomena attending sudden
changes of illumination, which, so far as   I have been able to ascertain,
have not hitherto been observed.
    The following are a few out of a large number of experiments that
have been made during the last four months. They are described,
as far as possible, in logical and not in chronological order.    Persons
unaccustomed to visual observations will not easily perceive some of
the effects mentioned.
                               Experiment  I.
   A circular aperture in. (l-3 cm.) in diameter was made in a sheet
of blackened zinc and was covered with thin white writing paper.
Diametrically across the aperture a strip of tinfoil ?V in. (1 mm.)
wide was attached to the paper.          The aperture was closed by a
shutter,   which  could  be  very rapidly opened by means of a strong
spring.    The sheet of metal was placed over a window in one side of
alight-tight box, inside which at a distance of 1 ft. (30 cm.) from the
aperture was an incandescent lamp of 8-candle power with a ground
glass bulb.    The observations were made at a distance of about 1 ft.
from the box, the room being in darkness.
   When the shutter was suddenly opened, several curious phe
nomena appeared simultaneously.        The period of their duration was
difficult to estimate ; it was probably more than one-twentieth of a
second and less than one-tenth.
    (1) Immediately after it was revealed, the small luminous disk
first increased in size with extreme rapidity, and afterwards became
somewhat smaller, being in its final condition still larger than at the
moment of exposure. This effect was more easily seen when the tin
foil strip was looked at : it seemed to become at first much thinner,
then thicker again.
    (2) At the moment when the disk was uncovered, a luminous
halo, like a broad ring, appeared to start from its margin and spread
outwards through a distance of more than an inch (2'5 cm.) in every
direction ; then it rapidly contracted and disappeared. The halo was
blue or blue-violet in colonr, and seemed more sharply defined upon
its inner than upon its outer border.
    (3) Contemporaneously with the existence of the halo, the disk
 was surrounded by a bright red corona, which, like the halo,
 expanded outwards, and then contracted.         There was not, however,

                  attending sudden Changes      of Illumination.                371
at any stage a dark interval between the corona and tbe disk ; more
probably the inner edge of the corona was slightly within the appa
rent permanent boundary of the disk.                The red corona was very
narrow; its greatest width appeared to be rather less than 1 mm., or
about one-fifth of a degree.           The effect was best seen when the
attention was directed upon the tinfoil strip, which for a moment,
after the exposure, became bright red, the coronas, or red borders, of
the adjoining semi-disks meeting or perhaps overlapping one another.
The apparent temporary excess of the area of the disk above its final
area, as mentioned in (1), was probably due to the evanescent red
border.*
    It is remarkable that repeated experiments had been made with
this and similar apparatus for several weeks before the existence of
the red border was detected, even though something of the kind was
looked for.       The dilliculty is, not to see it, but to know that one sees
it ; when once it has been perceived it becomes very conspicuous.
The phenomenon is beyond doubt constantly met with, and habitu
ally ignored, in daily life.        Since my first observation of it have    I
many times noticed flashes of red upon the black letters of a book or
upon the edges of the page ; bright metallic or polished objects often
show it when they pass across tho field of vision in consequence of a
movement of the eyes, and it was an accidental observation of this
kind that suggested the following experiment.
                                  Experiment   II.
    (1) The zinc plate of the last experiment was taken from the box,
and the apertnre in the plate was covered with thin paper.                         A
ground glass lamp of 8-eandle power, attached to a flexible cord, was
put behind it, and the whole was moved rather quickly either back
wards and forwards or round and round in a small circle at a
distance of a foot or so from the eyes.          The edges of the straight or
circular streak of light thus formed were bordered with red.
    (2) A 16-candle power lamp was substituted for the other. The
red border then appeared to have a greenish-blue band inside it,
slightly encroaching upon the streak of light ; probably, however, it
was only the apparent or irradiation boundary that was thus affected,
not the true geometrical boundary.
    (3) The paper was removed, and the 8-candle power ground-glass
lamp was again placed behind the aperture.                  The red could now
 no longer be seen, but the greenish-bine border remained.
    (4) When the 16-candle power lamp was used in the same way
    * The effect may be seen without the use of the spring shutter, if a black screen
be  held before the eyes and suddenly removed, but it is more difficult to hit upon
 the exact position of the disk.

 372        Mr. S. Bidwell.         On Subjective Colour Phenomena
 without any intervening paper, no coloured border could be seen,
owing, as it seemed, to the glare.
                                    Experiment   III.
    The aperture in the metal plate was again covered with white
paper, having a strip of tinfoil across it, and the plate was fixed
before the window in the box, as in Experiment I ; a 16-candle power
lamp was placed immediately behind it.                    When the lamp was
switched on, the red border was distinctly seen to be backed with
greenish-blue, the red itself being much less evident than when the
 lamp was 18 in. (45 cm.) behind the aperture.
    I  have hitherto failed to detect any greenish-blue near the border
when the disk was suddenly illuminated by the shutter method of
 Experiment I, instead of by switching on the lamp.*
                                    Experiment   IV.
"   The object of this experiment was to ascertain whether the red
border could be produced by the sudden accession of light which
contained no red constituent.             Ten different coloured glasses were
 successively interposed between the lamp and the aperture with the
shutter.      In every case when the spectroscope showed that the glass
 transmitted red light, the tinfoil strip became red, but never other
 wise. For example, it reddened with a dark blue cobalt glass, but
not with a blue glass which transmitted much more light, but inter
cepted the red end of the spectrum.
                                    Experiment V.
    The momentary redness around the edge of the suddenly illumi
nated disk and along the tinfoil strip, as described in the account of
the previous experiments, can only be seen by a practised observer.
By a different method, however, it can be made quite .evident to
almost any person whose vision is normal.
    The paper-covered aperture in the box was arranged as before, but
the shutter was not used.             An incandescent lamp was placed inside
the box, and a second lamp outside, at a distance of a few inches
from the aperture, the observer's eyes being shaded from it by a
screen.      The tinfoil strip was on the intorior side of the paper, and
nothing     was  seen of it from outside, except when the lamp in the box
was alight.
   A rotating commutator was constructed, by means of which
   *  [Since this waa written, I  have found that the greenish-blue may be shown by
the shutter method without difficulty if the distance of the lamp from the aperture
is suitably adjusted. — Deo. 19.]

current could bo supplied to the two electric lamps in the following
manner : — During half a turn of the commutator, no current to
either lamp ; during the succeeding one-sixth of a turn, current to
the interior lamp only ; during the remaining one-tbird of a complete
turn, current to the exterior lamp only.
   Starting with darkness, and turning the commutator quickly
through 180°, the observer saw, as soon as the interior lamp was
lighted, the shadow of the tinfoil, which was, as usual at the initial
stage, of a bright red hue ; but a small fraction of a second later,
before it had time to lose its redness and become black, the image
was obliterated by a flood of light from the exterior lamp, while at
the same moment the other lamp was extinguished.
   When the commutator was caused to make four or five turns per
second, the image of the tinfoil was almost continuous, and was at
once recognised by inexperienced observers to be red.*
   This experiment was repeated in another form, the arrangement
being such that the light of two lamps was interrupted by screening,
instead of by breaking the current ; the changes in the illumination
could thus be made more rapidly.
   Two black cardboard disks, from each of which a Rector of 60° had
been cut out, were mounted 3^ in. (9 cm.) apart at the ends of a
horizontal axle, being so fixed that the posterior edge of the opening
in one of the disks was exactly opposite to the anterior edge of that
in the other. Between the disks, and in a parallel plane, was sus
pended a sheet of white paper, across the middle of which a narrow
strip of tinfoil was gummed. Two clear glass electric lamps were
placed near the outer faces of the disks at the same height as the
axis, the incandescent filaments being directed horizontally.               To an
observer looking at the plain side of the paper across the edge of one
of the disks, while they were rotating slowly in the proper direction,
the paper first appeared dark all over, then it was illuminated from
behind by one of the lamps, the dark strip becoming visible ; finally,
it was illuminated from the front by the other lamp, and the strip
could no longer be seen. When the angular velocity was sufficiently
increased, the strip was seen continuously, or nearly so, and its colour
 was, as before, bright red.
                                Experiment     VI.
   From a disk of white cardboard         G in. (15 cm.) in diameter a sector
of 60° was cut out    ; the remainder of the disk was divided into two
   * The lamps   used in this experiment were made to my order.        They are of
8-candle power and have very thin filaments, the efficiency being 2-5 watts per c.p.
They were worked at a pressure of 6 per cent, above their marked Toltage, and the
incandescence responded very quickly to the current.

  equal parts by a straight line from the centre to the circumference,
  and one of these parts was painted black.         The disk was attached to
  a horizontal spindle, turned by a motor at the rate of five or six
  revolutions per second, while its front was illuminated by a lamp of
  16-candle power.       A white card, upon which was a black line, or a
  design composed    of black lines, was supported behind the disk, and
  viewed intermittently through the open sector. When the rotation
  was such that the open sector succeeded the black portion of the
  disk and was succeeded by the white portion, the black lines became
  red.
     This experiment is identical with the last, except that the white
  ground is illuminated entirely by reflected light. In conjunction
  with the others, it indicates with certainty the origin of the remark
  able red colour shown by Benham's top.
     The disk with the open sector affords a much more convenient
  means than the top of exhibiting the colour phenomena.           If a disk
 with an open sector of 45° or 60° is made of white cardboard, and a
 movable black half disk is mounted in front of it upon the same axis,
 we may, by suitably adjusting the position of the black half disk
  with regard to the opening, produce in a fixed object all the            ts
 shown by the top,    as  well  as intermediate ones ; and the object  itself
 may   be  easily changed  to  suit  the conditions of an experiment.
                                Experiment   VII.
    If  the commutator of Experiment V, or the disk with the open
 sector of Experiment VI, be turned in the reverse direction, the
 strips of tinfoil or the black lines appear to become blue (instead of
 red), like the outer group of lines in Benham's top when it spins in
 the direction indicated by the arrow in the figure. This appearance
 is partly, if not altogether, illusory. It is the bright ground in the
 immediate neighbourhood of the black lines that becomes blue ; the
 lines themselves (except possibly just within their extreme edges)
 become a neutral grey, owing to the alternations of light and dark
ness or of white and black.
    A card with some black lines 1 mm. thick drawn upon it was
placed behind the disk with the open sector of Experiment VI, which
was turned in the direction such that the open sector was pre
ceded by white and followed by black.               The lines presented the
appearance     of having   been    drawn  with   blue ink upon imperfectly
sized paper, a blue stain having apparently spread for a short dis
tance on both sides of the lines.
    Lines of gradually increased thickness were successively employed
until at last they had the form of bands -J-in. wide ; and even in this
latter case it was not easy to see that the bands themselves did not
become blue, but only their outlying borders.

                attending sudden Changes    of Illumination.             37o
     When, however; a visiting card which had been blackened over its
 whole snrface was placed behind the rotating disk, it merely turned a
 lighter black, or rather grey, in which it was impossible to imagine
 the slightest tinge of blue.
    A small piece of white paper which was subsequently attached to
the middle of the card became blue around its edges when the disk
 was turned, but the blue did not encroach at all (or if at all, only to
a very small extent) upon the black ground.
    When these observations have been made it becomes possible to
recognise that the apparently blue lines in the top are themselves
really grey, and only bordered externally with blue.
                              Experiment VIII.
    The natural conclusion from the observations described above is
that if a black disk were suddenly formed upon a bright ground, the
disk would for a moment appear to be surrounded by a blue border.
I   was not successful in devising a satisfactory arrangement for
suddenly creating a black disk, but the effect is sufficiently shown in
the following manner.
    An aperture    lj in. (3 cm.) in diameter was cut in one side of a
wooden box and was covered with white paper ; one half of the
aperture could be suddenly covered by a sliding metal shutter which
was actuated by a spring : a lamp was placed inside the box.          When
the shutter was operated, a blue band 1 or 2 mm. wide appeared on
the bright ground just beyond and adjoining the edge of the shutter
when at rest.     Its duration was thought to be slightly longer than
that of the red border of other experiments, and it appearently dis
appeared by retreating into the black edge of the shutter.
    When the shutter was moved by hand across the field at a slower
speed, its edge was seen to be preceded by a thin blue border, which,
when the shutter reached its limiting stop, appeared to reverse the
direction of its motion and return into the shutter.
    The blue border is much less conspicuous and more difficult of
observation than the red one. In order to see it plainly careful
adjustment of the light is necessary. An examination of the effect
through coloured glasses was attended by uncertain results.
                        Remarks on the Experiments.
    The phenomenon which in the account of Experiment           I  has been
spoken of as a blue halo may be due either to a momentary sympathetic
excitement of the nerve fibres of the retina in the neighbourhood of
those directly acted upon by the light, or, as     I think, less probably,
to light scattered by the imperfectly transparent media of the eye.
In the latter case its rapid disappearance might be accounted for

376            Mr. S. Bidwell.        On Subjective Colour Phenomena
partly by the diminished sensibility of the retina after ths firat
moment and partly by the contraction of the iris. The dark in
terior of the halo, which begins to appear soon after its formation,
is probably connected with a class of visual sensations which have
been specially studied by M. Aug. Charpentier.*         The sensation of
luminosity is followed very shortly after its first excitment by a brief,
    dark reaction, and it is perhaps the momentary revival of the
    luminosity after this reaction that gives the halo the appearance of
    retreating into the bright disk.
       But whatever the cause of the halo, there can hardly be any doubt
    that the corona or narrow red border is dae to sympathetic excitation.
    When the red nerve-fibres of the Young- Helmholtz theory are
    affected by light the intensity of which does not exceed a certain
    limit, the immediately surrounding red nerve-fibres are for a short
     period sympathetically affected, while the violet and green are not
    so, or in a much less degree.
      It must be confessed that it is more difficult to offer a reasonably
    simple explanation of what happens when the intensity of the light
    exceeds the limit above indicated, and the band of greenish-blue con
    sequently appears in addition to, or in place of, the red border.    It
    is,perhups, preferable to refrain at present from any speculation   on
    the subject.

    dently the development of this colour that makes the red so much
    less conspicuous when the top         illuminated by daylight than when
                                             is
    artificial light  isemployed.
1
       The obvious method of accounting for the formation of the blue
    border around     a   patch in a bright field from which light has sud-
    denly been cut off, is to suppose a brief sympathetic reaction in the
    nerve-fibres adjacent to those from which the exciting stimulus has
    been withdrawn, this reaction being more marked in the red fibres
    than in the green and violet, or perhaps occurring in the red fibres
    only, at least when the light         of the usual intensity.
                                           is                      If the red
    fibres just outside the darkened patch ceased for a moment to
    respond to the luminous stimulus, in sympathy with those inside
    the patch, the appearance of       blue border would be produced.

Effect of Pressure on Temperature of Crater of Electric Arc.           377
strong illumination therefore the sympathetic dark reaction would
seem to be least in the case of the red fibres.
   Subjective colours of the same class as those shown by Benham's
top, but not nearly so conspicuous, have long been known.           Helm-
holtz* mentions that if a rotating disk with black and white sectors
is looked at fixedly, each white sector appears to be reddish along its
leading border and bluish along its rear border. He also remarks
that these colours are more easily seen upon a disk covered with two
spiral bands, black and white, of equal breadth. From these and
other observations, Helmholtz concludes that when a point of the
retina is exposed to rapid alternations of white light and of darkness,
causing successive states of increasing and decreasing excitation, the
moment of maximum excitation is not the same for all colours. It
has, however, been shown above that in analogous cases the red
originates in a portion of the retina which has not been exposed to
the direct action of light, while the blue originates in a portion
where light has not ceased to act.       Helmholtz's supposition therefore
does not apply — at least to the class of colours at present under con
sideration.
   1 have not     made any attempt to account for the more feeble
colours exhibited by the two intermediate groups of lines in
Benham's top, nor for the changes which occur when the speed of
rotation is increased. These effects no doubt result, at least in part,
from modifications of the phenomena already discussed. But for the
present   I  am compelled to discontinue the experiments on account of
the disagreeable and probably injurious effects which they produce
upon the eyes.
   On the Effect of Pressure in the Surrounding Gas on the
4;
      Temperature of the Crater of an Electric Arc. Correction
      of Results in former Paper." By W. E. VVlLSON, F.R.S.,
      and G. F. Fitzgerald, F.R.S.                Received November 30,
      —Read December 17, 1896.
   In May,    1895, a preliminary paper by one of the authors was read
at the Royal Society, in which is described the apparatus used for
these experiments, and the results which were then obtained.
   The primary object of this research was to determine, if possible,
whether the temperature of the crater in the positive carbon varies
when the pressure in the surrounding gas is changed.
   It has been suggested that the temperature of the crater is that of

boiling carbon.         The most modern determinations                 give this tem
perature of the crater as         about 3300 — 3500 C*
    If this is the true boiling point of carbon, it is then clear that
solar physicists must find some other substance than solid carbon
particles to form the photospheric clouds in the sun, as the tempera
ture of this layer is most probably not below 8000 C.,f unless, indeed,
the pressure in the solar atmosphere is sufficient to raise the boiling
point of carbon to about this temperature (see p. 381).                        It is in
order to throw some light on this subject that these experiments
were undertaken.
    The gas used in our first experiments was nitrogen, and we found
 that the radiation from the crater fell off in a most remarkable
 manner whenever the pressure was raised in the box surrounding
the arc.       This falling off was not due to any very large extent to
visible cloud or smoke, and the crater seemed so much reduced in
temperature as to glow with only a red heat This seemed to show
that the temperature of the crater depends on how much it is cooled
by the sui-rounding gas, and not on its being the temperature at
which the vapour of carbon has the same pressure as the surrounding
atmosphere.
    It was found that we were limited to pressures not exceeding about
 20 atmos., as at this pressure we could not withdraw the negative
carbon sufficiently to see into the crater without the arc breaking.
We were then only able to obtain a current from a battery of accu
mulators which had an E.M.F. of 110 volts.                  Since then we obtained
a Crompton dynamo             which  could give 300 volts and 15 amperes, and
which was driven by a turbine.
    From the great difficulty of obtaining a sufficient quantity of pure
 nitrogen under pressure, we obtained a 20 ft. cyliuder of air com
pressed to 120 atmos.           With this we tried a series of experiments,
 and these at first seemed to corroborate our former ones, in which we
 used nitrogen, but we found that at any rate some of the radiation,
 and possibly a great deal of it, was cut off by the formation of what
 appeared to be red fumes of N02. We found no absorption from
 this cause so long as the pressure was nearly atmospheric, but at
 about 100 lbs. pressure this gas was formed with great rapidity, and
 undoubtedly cut off a great deal of the radiation.                    We easily con-
 tinned our belief in the presence of this gas by its well known
 absorption spectrum.
     Lest heat dissociation might cause an apparent increase in the
 amount of NOa, we tried heating some of this gas in a flask. We
 observed that when hot the brown fumes became golden yellow, and

  the absorption bands nearly disappeared, so that the heating conld
  not have been the cause     of the apparently enormous production of
  NOj at high pressure.
     We next tried whether oxygen blown into the arc would burn up
  the carbons, but found it did not do so to any serious extent, and so
  tried the arc in a compressed atmosphere of this gas.
     The arc burned very nicely indeed in the oxygen, the carbons
  keeping a good shape, and a very steady crater. The oxygen was,
  however, so contaminated with nitrogen that at high pressure enor
  mous quantities of NOa were again formed, so that we could not
  proceed further with the radiation experiments.       The arc was a
 bright blue bead, about the size of a pea, and the spectrum was a
 beautiful banded one.
     From these results we concluded that the reduction of radiation,
 and red-hot appearance of the crater in the former experiments in
 nitrogen, were due to its being contaminated with oxygen and to the
 large quantities of NO,, which were formed by the arc when under
 pressure.
     We next tried the arc in hydrogen. The gas was obtained as pure,
 but contained hydrocarbons as an impurity, possibly from having been
 compressed into a cylinder which had previously been charged with
 coal-gas.
     The arc in hydrogen at atmospheric pressures was a long, thin
 flame, that moved as far up the carbons as possible ; especially on the
 negative carbon it walked up a cm. along the cone.       It went so far
that it fuzed the copper ring that held the negative carbon, and we
 had to replace it by an iron wire lashing.   It was very unsteady, and
trees of soot and a deposit of hard graphitic carbon formed on this
positive carbon as if there were electrolysis of the hydrocarbon, and
carbon were electro-negative compared with hydrogen. This growth
took place all round the crater, while there was no tendency for any
thing to grow on the negative carbon.
    The arc was only 5 — 6 mm. wide, and sometimes over 2 cm. long.
There was a green outer flame, with a bright red line not a mm. wide
down the middle of it. Where it impinged on the negative carbon
there was a bright red flame from the middle of the bright spot on
the carbon.    The outer greenish part seemed to give much the same
spectrum as the green cone in a Bunsen burner, while the red flame
and line was undoubtedly glowing hydrogen. As we saw the C and F
hydrogen lines very distinctly, the red C line being dazzlingly bright
and not nearly so wide as in a coil spark at atmospheric pressure
whenever the image of the red part of the arc was thrown on the
slit of the spectroscope, the appearance was quite like that of a solar
prominence.
    The end of the positive carbon was pitted into a number of cratei*

as the arc was very unsteady, and when the pressure was raised         it
was almost impossible to keep an arc going, partly because the arc
broke when it was elongated, the least bit, and partly because a com
plete lantern of soot trees grew all round the crater, and seemed to
short-circuit the arc from time to time.
   The arc being very unsteady, no satisfactory reading of the voltage
and current was possible. At from 60 to 80 lbs. pressure the voltage
varied from 60 — 80, and the amperes kept continually varying from
15—20. At 40 lbs. with 20 amperes the volts varied from 50—60. The
crater was not well developed, so that the radiation observation, even
at low pressures, was not very satisfactory, while at high pressures
the arc was too short to see into the crater at all, and the lantern of
soot trees hid a considerable length, 3 or 4 mm. of the negative carbon
besides.   The radiomicrometer gave 440 divisions with a good arc in
air, and 380 with the moderately good crater in hydrogen.       But this
difference is no greater     than  would  often occur with  a good and
moderately good crater, so that there is not any proof of a difference
of temperature due to cooling power of hydrogen.          These experi
ments showed us that it was quite hopeless to get any measures of
radiation under pressure with hydrogen.
   We finally tried an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. We used a
cylinder of liquid COa, which was connected to our arc box by a
copper tube and stop valve. The arc burned fairly well in this gas,
and, except for the difficulty of getting a sufficiently long arc at
pressures above 150 lbs., some pretty satisfactory measures of radiation
were obtained.     We found that whenever the pressure was suddenly
reduced, there was a fog formed in the box, which cut off the light
enormously.     Also by looking down the steel tube, which is closed at
its end by a lens, we could see powerful convection currents in the
gas which scattered a lot of light. At high pressure the refraction due
to these currents prevented any sort of an image of the crater being
formed while the pressure was varying. While the pressure was steady
 a good image could be formed.      This tube is nearly 3 ft. in length,
and only £ in. in bore, and it would naturally take time for the gas
 to settle down throughout its length.    We propose to have this tube
 removed, and the aperture in the box closed by a strong piece of plain
 glass, and to form an image of the carbons by a lens placed at a suit
able distance outside.     This we expect will remove the difficulty
arising from these convection cnrrents.
    The result of all these experiments so far is that it would require
 more evidence than we have been able to get, to affirm that either
 the temperature of the crater of the arc is raised or lowered by
 pressure. We got some very concordant observations, which showed
     temperature to be lowered with pressure, and in which at the time
     could see no evidence of absorption by fog, but then, at other

Effect of Pressure on Temperature of Crater of Electric Arc.               381
times, there was undoubtedly absorption from this cause.                   We
certainly got     no   evidence   that there    is any appreciable    increase
of temperature.       When the arc was started in the gas at a low
pressuro and then the pressure was raised, the radiation at the low
pressure was greater than at a high pressure ; but when the arc was
started first in the gas at high pressure, and then the pressure
reduced, the radiation was rather higher in the gas at high pressure.
From all this we concluded that the greater part of the differences
we were observing were due to the absorption of the light in the long
tube already mentioned, which increased the longer the arc was
kept burning, and was probably greater at high than at low pressures.
The best observations were made with variations of pressure from 15
up to 100 lbs. per sq. in., and there seems very little evidence of much
change of radiation with this change of from I up to between 6 and
7 atmos.
   The whole question is surrounded with great difficulty.              If the
carbon be really in equilibrium with its own vapour at the tempera
ture of the crater and at the pressure of the surrounding atmosphere,
some relation must exist between the change in pressure and change
in temperature of the crater. If we knew the latent heat of volati
lisation of carbon, we should be able to calculate the change of tem
perature from the well-known thermodynamic formula
                                  «T   At'   .
   Av can certainly be approximately determined on the supposition
that the absolute temperature of the crater is fifteen times the abso
lute temperature of the freezing point, i.e., 3800.           We thus get for
gaseous carbon         = 10*, q.p., at this temperature. For 1 atmos. Sp
=   106, q.p., so that

Hence, unless the latent heat of carbon be enormously great com
pared with that of other substances, eT/T will be considerable.            If \
be as great as the latent heat of vaporisation of carbon given by
Trouton's law, i.e., about 4000 calories, or 168 x 10'" ergs.. £T/T
would be about 3V, and cT would be nearly 220° C. for each atmo
sphere, and a change of pressure of about 18 atmos. would raise the
temperature of the crater to that estimated for the sun.           The corre
sponding    increase   of radiation  would  be   very great, for the radiation
varies, at least approximately, as the fourth power of the absolute
temperature. This would lead one to expect that the radiation would
be nearly doubled for each 4 atmos. added.              Such an increase as
this certainly does not take place, so that we may conclude that
either the temperature of the crater is not that of boiling carbou,

382     Effect of Pressure on Temperature of Crater of Electric Arc.
or else that the latent heat of volatilisation of carbon is very con
siderably greater than that calculated from Trouton's law.         Even
though this latent heat were as great as the heat of combustion of C to
C04, i.e., 7770, there would be an increase of about 70 per cent, in the
radiation for an increased pressure of 6 attnos.      Such an enormous
latent heat is unprecedented, and yet our experiments would, almost
certainly, have shown such an increased radiation as this. So far,
therefore, the experiments throw considerable doubt on the probability
that it is the boiling point of carbon that determines the tempera
ture of the crater.    It might be questioned whether there is energy
enough in the current to do all this work, but upon an extravagant
estimate of the amount of carbon volatilised in the crater, it appears
that there is more than a hundred times as much energy supplied by
the current as would be required for volatilising the carbon, even
though ita latent heat were as great as the heat of combustion of C
into COj.
   There is another considerable difficulty in the theory of the tem
perature of the crater being that of boiling carbon arising from the
slowness of evaporation.     The crater on mercury is dark, but then it
volatilises with immense rapidity and the supply of energy by the
current being more than 100 times that required merely for evapora
tion, there seems very little reason why even a considerable difference
in latent heat Rhould make any sensible difference in the rate of
evaporation of mercury and carbon, especially as, at the same tem
perature, the diffusion of carbon vapour is nearly three times as fast
as that of mercury vapour and the temperature immensely higher.
   We would, in conclusion, call attention to a cause of opacity in
the solar atmosphere that is illustrated by the effect of convection
currents in the long tube we were observing at high pressures ; these
convection currents behaved just like snow, or any other finely divided
transparent body immersed in another of different refractive index.
Light trying to get through is reflected backwards and forwards in
every direction, until most of it gets back by the way it came. The con
sequence was that even the electric arc light was unable to penetrate
the tube at high pressure, when these convection currents were active.
The only light that came out of the tube was the feeble light outside,
which was returned to us by reflection at the surfaces of these con
vection currents.    In a similar manner we conceive that any part of
the solar atmosphere which is at a high pressure, and where convec
tion currents, or currents of different kinds of materials, are active,
would reflect back to the sun any radiations coming from below, and
reflect to us only the feeble radiations coming from interplanetary
space.    In his paper on " The Physical Constitution of the Sun and
        "
Stars (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' No. 105, 1868), Dr. Stoney called attention
to an action of this kind that might be due to clouds of transparent

material, like clouds of water on the earth, but in view of the high
solar temperature it seems improbable that any body, except, perhaps,
carbon, could exist in any condition other than the gaseous state in
the solar atmosphere ; so that it seems more probable that sun-spots
are due, at least partly, to reflection by convection streams of gas,
rather than by clouds of transparent solid or liquid particles.

    The effects      of a rise of temperature             upon electrotonic     currents
may be briefly stated as follows             : —
     1. The ordinary        electrotonic currents, A and K, are temporarily
diminished or abolished at about 40°.
    2. At about 30° of a rising temperature the K current is increased
without notable alteration or with actual diminution of the A current.
    3. On returning from 40° towards the normal (15° + 2°) tempera
ture, the A and K currents reappear.                        K is increased and A is
diminished, so that the previous normal inequality A > K is
diminished, or actually reversed to A < K. In all cases the quotient
A/K is diminished ; in some cases it actually falls below unity.
     [The negative variation is temporarily abolished at about 40° ; a
positive gives place to a negative variation in consequence of a
raised temperature to 40°.]
     The above three statements are illustrated by Experiments 2366,
2322, and, from the examination of their records, it will be clear
that there is here no question of the effects being due to alterations
of resistance. A and K are tested for alternately, and the deflection
by O001 volt is taken at intervals of about ten minutes.                          [Other

 12 mm., serving as leading-in electrodes to the polarising current and leading-out
electrodes to the electrotonic     current.    On the galvanometer records, the anelectro-
 tonic deflection  A  reads upwards, the katelectrotonic deflection K reads downwards ;
 after-anelectrotonic and after-katelectrotonic deflections A' and K' read respectively
downwards and upwards (there being under the conditions of experiment no

  After heating to 40° the A current is diminished, the K current is increased, and
a well-marked    A' after-current has developed. The quotient A K is diminished.

38<5        Dr. A. D. Waller.     Influence  of Alterations of
   Electrotonic after-currents,  A' and  K', when present to any marked
degree, are opposed to the previous      electrotonic  currents A and K.
Designating A and K respectively as positive and negative, the
after-currents A' and K' are respectively negative and positive. Such
after-currents are in general modified by previous rise of tempera
ture, which gives rise to an evident A' (negative) in a nerve which
previously gave no marked A', and abolishes a K' (positive) that
may previously have been present.         Experiment 2366 exhibits the
development of an evident negative A' subsequent to heating of the
nerve.    Experiment 2322 exhibits the abolition of a positive K',
evident previous to heating of the nerve.
   A fall of temperature causes an increase of the A current and,
in less degree, of the K current ; by reason of the diminution of
resistance that takes place with lowered temperature, the increase of
A is more marked than is apparent upon the record, and the smaller
increase of K is quite masked by the diminution of resistance. The
quotient A/K is augmented. At a temperature of — 4° to — 6° both
currents are somewhat suddenly abolished ; this abolition may be
complete and final, no recovery taking place, or it may be temporary,
being succeeded by imperfect recovery as the nerve temperature
returns towards normal.     It is noteworthy that the A and K currents
are not abolished at 0° suddenly, and all but finally abolished at —4°

                Temperature upon Electrotonic Currents.          387
to — 6°, probably by reason of the nerve having been frozen at this
temperature and thus cut to pieces.
  It is evident that little stress is to be laid upon an apparent
decrease of K with falling temperature (2417) and increase of K
with rising temperature (2366).      On the other hand, a diminished
A with rising temperature (2366) and an increased A with falling
temperature (2417) are not open to doubt.

the K effect apparently diminishes, but actually increases a little, the increase
being masked by increased resistance.     The A/K quotient is obviously increased.

clearly that such standard deflection gives measure not only of the
electrical resistance, but also — due reservation being made of the
effect of drying in the course of a prolonged observation at raised
temperature — is itself available in measure of the alteration of tem

be increase of A, no increase, or a relatively smaller increase, of K,

       College of Science, Dublin. Received December 2, — Read
       December 17, 18%.
    In the mouth of April of this year, we had the honour                to submit
 to the Royal Society*       a  preliminary notice of the evidence we had
obtained of the existence of gallium in the Yorkshire ironstone
smelted at Middlesbrough -on-Tees.
    We propose now to give a concise but detailed account of the
methods of analysis carried out on the metal and the ore, and the
determination of tho quantity of gallium present.
                   Examination of      the  Blast Furnace Metal.
    Method of Analysis. — The very large proportion of iron rendered
the application of some special method of analysis necessary for the
separation of metals present in minute proportions, and for the quali
tative and quantitative examinations of the separated substances.
We have successfully employed fractional precipitations and the
spectrograph ic analysis of the precipitates, supplemented by gravi
metric determinations of the purified gallium sesquioxide.
    The sample of metal first received consisted of two small ingots,
 each weighing about 230 grams ; small pieces, broken with difficulty

from tbeeo and heated in the oxyhydrogen flame, gave the gallium
line \4171'6. The ingots were exceedingly hard, and practically
resisted all attempts to reduce them to small pieces.                  One ingot,
weighing 210 grams, was boiled with hydrochloric acid, until its
solvent action on the metal had nearly ceased, when the liquid was
decanted, and fresh acid poured on. The process was very slow, and,
after 80 grams had been dissolved, the remaining piece of metal was
scraped, to remove an adhering layer of carbonaceous matter, and
the analysis of the products proceeded with. The liquid was filtered,
and the black residue A washed.                The filtrate was evaporated, to
expel   the  excess of   hydrochloric    acid,  water was added, and the solu
tion, not being clear, was filtered. The residue B thns obtained had,
when dry, a dark greyish colour. Residues A and Ii.
    In the clear filtrate two rods of zinc were immersed, and during a
period of one hour and three-quarters hydrogen was evolved, and
metals were deposited on the zinc. The deposit was scraped off, and
separated from the liquid by filtration.            Metallic deposit G. To the
filtered solution were added about 4 c.c. of lead acetate solution, and
two rods of zinc were placed in the liquid, according to the method
of Lecocq de Boisbaudran,* by which, as the lead is precipitated,
traces of other metals, such as copper, silver, indium, thallium, &c,
are collected by the lead.        Metallic precipitate F.
    Fractional Precipitation by Ammonium Acetate. — The filtrate, in
volume about 2 litres, was boiled, but as no precipitate formed, 15 c.c.
or thereabouts of a solution of ammonium acetate were slowly added,
and the solution boiled ; the iron, being in the ferrous state, was
retained in solution, whilst it was expected that the gallium would
be precipitated as phosphate.         After boiling for about twenty minutes,
the substances precipitated were collected on a filter and washed.
Residue D.
    The filtrate was again boiled with about 10 c.c. of ammonium
acetate, and the precipitate collected on a filter.          Residue E.
    Further Precipitation of Basic Acetates.        —   The filtrate from E was
again   boiled   with  ammonium      acetate,   the  resulting precipitate being
filtered off.    It was much darker in colour than those previously
obtained. Sesquioxide metals 0.
    The filtrate was evaporated until it became a saturated solution of
ferrous chloride.       It was allowed to cool and crystallise, and the
operation was repeated upon the mother liquor.                 The two crops of
crystals    were  mixed    with    others,   which   were   obtained   as follows.
The solution from the remaining portion of the 210 grams of
metal was filtered, and the filtrate evaporated.             It was then allowed
to cool and crystallise.        The mother liquor was concentrated, and
again allowed to cool and crystallise, the different crops of crystals

            On the Occurrence   of Gallium in Clay-ironstone.          395
 being collected.   The mother liquor from the last crop of crystals
 was evaporated almost to dryness to expel acid, and, after addition
of water, rods of zinc were immersed in the solution, which was
then left undisturbed for forty-eight hours. The zinc was found to
have been almost all dissolved. The precipitated metals and the
residue of zinc were washed and dried. Residue H. The filtrate,
after three precipitations with ammonium acetate, was mixed with
 the mother liquor of the ferrous chloride crystals from the first
 portion, so that the liquid then represented the whole of the ingot.
Tt was diluted, mixed with an excess of ammonia and ammonium
sulphide, to precipitate all the iron and metals of that group still in
 the solution, and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness and
gently ignited to expel ammonium salts.        A residue was left, which
contained the alkaline earths and alkaline metals.
   The Spectrographs Analysis   of  the Residues and of the Precipitates.
    From the foregoing description it will be observed that by partial
solution the metals precipitablc by iron may be looked for along with
 carbon, and, probably, some phosphides of iron and other metals.
 Such phosphides yield the flame spectra of the metals only, and not
of the phosphorus combined with them. Precipitation with zinc in
an acid solution was expected to give a deposit (F and H) which
 would yield the spectra of copper, silver, bismuth, lead, thallium, and
 tin in the oxy hydrogen flame, if these metals were not already pre
 cipitated by the iron, and present in the residues A and B; while
 D, E, and G are compounds which fall under the category of sesqui-
 oxide metals, including beryllium, aluminium, indium, gallium, and
chromium.      Of these, aluminium and beryllium were expected to
show no spectra in the oxy hydrogen flame, and for these it was
intended to use spark spectra.
    The residue A, when dried in the water oven and gently heated,
gave off fumes which indicated that an oil was present, and extrac
tion with ether and subsequent evaporation did, indeed, yield a
quantity of a brown oil.
   The oxyhydrogen flame spectra of the substances separated were
photographed, and the following are particulars regarding their
spectra.
   The insoluble residue A contained iron, manganese, copper, gallium,
sodium, chromium, silver, and nickel.
   The lines which served to identify the metals had the following

   This contained iron, chromium, lead, gallium, potassioru, ami

   The Residue left by Zinc, H. — This was heated with aqua regia,
when all but a very small quantity of silica with a trace of a metallic
oxide dissolved.      The liquid was filtered and the filtrate evaporated
with excess of hydrochloric acid to remove nitric acid. It was
diluted with water, when it showed a green colour.
    It was saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen and filtered to
separate the precipitate.      The precipitate was partially soluble in
sodium hydrogen sulphide, yielding a sherry-coloured solution ; the
constituent cansing this colour was not identified, the quantity
present being very small.           The residue, insoluble in alkaline
sulphide, contained copper and a trace of lead, but no mercury,
bismuth, or cadmium.
   The filtrate from zinc and precipitated metals I, was diluted and
heated to boiling.      It gave a precipitate, and therefore ammonium
acetate was added to the hot liquid, and after boiling for several
minutes it was filtered.     The filtrate became turbid immediately ; it
was then boiled and more ammonium acetate added and then altered ;
the filtrate again became turbid.
   This precipitate was filtered off and heated in the oxyhydrogen
flame.                                                         ,
   It coutained no gallium, but the spectrum gave lines of iroD,
copper, sodium, potassium, and a trace of lead.
   It is evident that all the gallium was extracted by the ropeated
additions of ammonium acetate solution and boiling.

   The various precipitates of basic acetates were mixed, with the
exception of that from 7, which contained no gallium.               In order to
separate phosphoric acid,         the  precipitates   were   fused  with  abont
three times their weight of mixed carbonates.                  Some potassium
nitrate was added towards the end of the fusion, to convert chromium
into chromates. The heavy metals were left as oxides or carbonates,
the phosphoric acid going into solution.            After extraction with hot
water, the solution was filtered.

                                           added.    The precipitate was fil
                                           tered off, dissolved in HC1, and
                                           sparked to observe its spectrum.
 ¦ These gallium spectra showed that there were still traces of
chromium in the gallium chloride, and from this the gallium was
purified completely by precipitation in a strongly acid solution with
potassium ferrocyanide and subsequent removal of the iron by treat
ment with sodium hydrate, according to the method of Lecocq de
Boisbaudran.*
   The foregoing description of the analytical details proves the
presence of gallium in the metal, and gives a clear indication of how
it may be separated by a simple        process.
   In subsequent operations on          the blast-furnace    metal, the ferrous
chloride was mixed with calcium carbonate, and the gallium was
found to be all precipitated and capable of easy separation from the
calcium salt.f    Latterly it was found to be more convenient to boil
the acid solution containing gallium with an excess of tbe iron under
examination, and thus the gallium is concentrated in the residue
Tfhich remains undissolved.      J
   It became necessary to consider what was the source of the gallium
contained in the iron. Was the gallium concentrated in the metal ?
Or did it pass into the slag of the converter?          Was it originally con
tained in the ore, the lime, or the fuel ? Was it easily volatilised, so
as to pass off with fume or with flue dust P

             On the Occurrence        of Gallium in Clay-ironatone.            399
   On February 10th we received from Mr. C. R. Ridsdale, the
 Chemist at the North Eastern Co.'s Steel Works, at Middlesbrough,
samples of the following materials : —
            1.
                 " Mixer metal," i.e., mixed blast-furnace         metal.
            2. Roasted Cleveland iron ore.

            4. Tap cinder.
            5.   Manganese ore.
            6.   Lime.
   On February 12th, photographs of the oxyhydrogen flame spectra
of these substances were obtained.
   The following are the particulars of this examination : —
   1.  The roasted Cleveland ore contained iron, sodium, potassium,
        manganese, chromium, nickel, copper, gallium, lead, and
         calcium.
   2. The blast-furnace         metal contained iron, sodium, potassium,
         manganese, nickel, copper, gallium, and lead.
   3.  Flue     dust contained iron, sodium, potassium, manganese,
        chromium, nickel, copper, silver, gallium (doubtful), lead
         (strong), calcium, and rubidium.                Rubidium was identified
        by   the   lines  4202  and 4216.      (Thalen.) Calcium by line 4226,
        in the blue.
   It is evident now that gallium is contained, in the ore and is con
centrated in the metal.
   1. The manganese ore (a             15   per cent. Spanish ore) contained
        iron, sodium, potassium, manganese,                  copper, silver, lead,
        indium, and calcium.           The lines by which the indium and the
        silver were identified are as follows : —
                      Indium              4510-2            4101-3

   The occurrence of indium is remarkable, as hitherto it has been
found only in ziuc blendes.
  2.  Tap      cinder    contained     iron,   sodinm,     potassium, manganese,
        copper, and lead.
   3. Lime contained calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium,
        a trace of iron, and a trace of manganese.
   The lime showed the following bands, characteristic of lime* : —

     On these bands were seen ten iron lines, six in the first principal
 group and four in the second, all very faint, but with apparently the
following wave-lengths, which correspond with the lines seen in
oxyhydrogen flame spectrum of ferric oxide. They are also closely

    Roasted Cleveland  Iron Ore.    Process  for the Extraction of Gallium.
     This ore is a complex substance, and contains elements which
 render the complete extraction of the gallium very difficult. It is in
 great part soluble in strong hydrochloric acid, but the iron goes into
 solutions as a ferric salt, and difficulties arise in attempting to reduce
 it to the ferrous state. Zinc and iron are both liable to contain
 gallium, and, without a very careful examination of a quantity of
  the metal, it would be wrong to use them as reducing agents, seeing
  that the quantity of metal required in the process is large in com
 parison with the sample treated. Sulphurous acid and kindred sub
  stances yield sulphates which cause a quantity of the alkaline earths
 to separate as sulphates, and, as these precipitate in faintly acid solu
  tions, there is a risk of basic gallium sulphate being carried down
 with them.
     Dilute hydrochloric acid yields a solution poor in iron, but the dis
  solved matter is richer in gallium than the original ore.          A largo
  proportion of silicic acid is, however, contained in the solution.
     Experiments were made on quantities of 50 grams of the ore, and
  the spectra from the sesquioxide metals were carefnlly compared
  with the spectra from the similar products from the metal, and we
  find that, as in the comparison of the original samples of ore and

            On the Occurrence   of Gallium in Clay-ironstone.           401
 metal, the gallium lines are decidedly stronger in the spectra of
 the substances extracted from the metal.
    One kilo, of finely powdered ore was mixed with dilute hydro
 chloric acid of double normal strength, measuring about 1250 c.c.
 Some carbon dioxide was disengaged and an insoluble residue left
.which was removed by filtration.      The filtrate was then heated when
 a gelatinous separation of silica occurred.          After evaporation to
 dryness,  a further  addition of  hydrochloric    acid  yielded a solution
 which was not highly coloured, and, presumably, did not contain
 much iron.    The silica rendered insoluble was removed by filtration,
 and to the filtrate ammonium chloride and ammonia were added.
 The precipitate thus formed was dissolved in hydrochloric acid,
 reduced with sulphur dioxide, nearly neutralised, and boiled with
 sodium thiosulphate.     The precipitate was dissolved in hydrochloric
 acid and again precipitated by ammonia.
    This precipitate was examined for gallium.        The insoluble residue
 was also examined, and a comparison of the two spectra showed that
 a larger quantity of gallium remained in the insoluble residue than
 was extracted by the acid. It was found that gallium could be
 extracted from this by fusion with caustic soda and lixiviation with
 water, and that the residue, after such treatment, contained no
 gallium. Operations on this particular ore were suspended until
 other samples had been examined.
    The following ores from the collection in the Royal College of
 Science, Dublin, were examined: —
    1. Yorkshire clay ironstone from near Middlesbrough.
    2. Clay ironstone from Grosmont, Whitby, Yorkshire.         •
    3. Northamptonshire    ore (clay ironstone).
    4. Black  band ore, Mount Melville mine, St. Andrews.
    One kilo, of each was reduced to fino powder, and 100 grams of
 Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and 500 grams of No. 4 were extracted with dilute
 hydrochloric acid as in the previous case. In each sample gallium
 was found, but the proportion was very small in the Northampton
 shire ore, and still more minute in the black band. Without operat
 ing on several hundred grams it would have been scarcely possible to
 detect the gallium in the Mount Melville ore.           These ores had not
 been roasted, and in this they differed from the sample received from
 the North Eastern Steel Works.       The effect of roasting is the same
 as increasing the proportion of gallium in the ore.
 Estimation of Gallium in the Blast Furnace Metal from. Middlesbrough.
    The sample weighing 575 grams consisted of 155 grams of fine
  powder and 420 grams of coarse powder.            The latter portion was
 heated with hydrochloric acid until the acid was nearly neutralised,
  when the liquid was decanted and filtered.

    Residue A.      Solution B.

quantity of nitric acid was added from time to time ; the eolation was
diluted and filtered.

The lines of gallium, chromium, nickel, and iron are strong, and lines
of sodium, manganese, potassium, copper, and silver are also present.
    Solution B. — Boiled for two hours with part of the finely powdered
sample added gradually to neutralise all the free acid,, so that the
gallium in the solution might be precipitated as a basic salt.* The
solution was decanted and filtered.                The residue was boiled with
solution    D, to which the remainder of the finely powdered sample
was slowly added ; after boiling for several hours the solution was
filtered, and the residue J*' washed with water. The filtrate was
mixed with that from solution B, the mixture forming solution Q,
which should be free from gallium.                 This solution was boiled with
freshly precipitated copper hydrate, t and the precipitate examined
spectrographically for gallium.             It contained none.

filtered, and washed,        Residue II. Filtrate I.
     Residue B. — Dried, powdered, and mixed with residue C.                   Gently
heated, the mixture decomposes and expels hydrocarbons, causing
the mass to ignite and evolve some white fumes. The substance
was thus seen to be very inflammable, and the temperature was
reduced as quickly as possible. When cold, it was covered with
aqua regia and heated on the water bath for several hours, then
diluted and filtered.           Filtrate added to J, forming solution K.

was heated in a porcelain basin until it gave off white fumes ; the

about three hours ; white fumes being emitted during the whole time.

reduce the iron to tho ferrous state. This operation was unsuccessful,
a quantity of iron remaining in tbe ferric state.          The solution N
 was, therefore, added and tbe mixture evaporated that the more
 volatile acids might be expelled by the 3ulphuric acid. On adding
 water to the residue a small quantity of matter remains undissolved ;
 it was removed by filtration.     Residue Afs.
    . Up  to this stage no reagent had been used which was likely to
 contain gallium, and we had to consider which of the processes
 known to separate gallium would be suitable under the conditions of
our analysis. The simplest would have been to boil with iron or zinc,
but gallium is found associated with both of these metals, and it was
 decided not to use them. Precipitation by barium carbonate would
have been easily effected if sulphuric acid had not been present in
 such quantity. But, to avoid inaccuracy, the best— although more
 troublesome process — seemed to be the precipitation of the phos
 phates of the sesquioxide metals in an acetic acid solution, there
 being phosphoric acid already in the liquid. The. precipitates. should
 contain all the gallium, chromium, and aluminium as phosphates and
 some phosphate of iron.        Tbe gallium is easily separated from
 chromium and iron by fnsion with caustic soda, and from phosphoric
acid, aluminium, and chromium by precipitation with potassium
ferrocyanide.
      The iron was first reduced by passing sulphur dioxide into the
solution until it became strongly charged, and heating to boiling,
 with addition of ammonia, to neutralise the excess of free acid. The
 addition of ammonia was continued until the white precipitate which
 formed remained undissolved after boiling for two or three minutes.
 Boiling water was then added to make the volume of the solution
about four litres; this dilution caused a large quantity of light
coloured precipitate to form. Ammonium acetate was added, and
 the liquid, after boiling for several minutes, filtered,.
     Residue 0. — The filtrate was boiled and ammonium carbonate
 added until a quantity of pale, greenish-coloured precipitate was
deposited. More ammonium acetate was added, and the liquid,
still acid with acetic acid, was filtered. Residue P.
  •
     The process just described was repeated with the filtrate, the pre
cipitate R being slightly darker than P, Filtrate Q.
•    Small quantities of the three residues, 0, P, R, were examined
 spectrographically.     The gallium lines, are strongest in R. The*
filtrate Q was again boiled with addition of ammonium carbonate to
 neutralise some of the excess of acid, and the precipitate S, small in
quantity and of a dark green colour, was removed by filtration.         It
contained    only a trace of gallium.
     The precipitates 0 and S, containing a much larger proportion of
iron than P and R, were dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and the

gallium, Ac., precipitated, after reducing the iron to the ferrous
state.    First precipitate, U. The second contained some gallium ;
the third, very dark in colour, was free from that metal.
    The precipitates P, R, and U were dissolved in hydrochloric acid,
and the solutions filtered to remove a small quantity of insoluble
matter which was added to residue M.         Two drops of violet-coloured
filtrate were tested with potassium ferrocyanide, and so marked was
the reaction that it was decided to repeat the process of reduction and
precipitation to remove as much iron as possible. The first precipitate
 W contained nearly all the gallium ; the second contained a small
 quantity, and the third contained none.
    The first and second precipitations U, whose spectra are seen in
 134" and 1343, contain a small quantity of gallium.     They were redis-
 solved, reduced, and boiled with excess of ammonium acetate, and the
precipitate collected. A second precipitate was free from gallium.
The former was fused with caustic soda, extracted with water and
filtered. The filtrate was acidified with hydrochloric acid, and boiled
 with ammonia for somo time, and the gallium phosphate thus pre
cipitated was collected. This precipitate was added to W.
    Residue W, fyc. — This contained principally gallium and chromium
phosphate with some iron phosphate. It was dissolved in hydro
chloric acid, and the solution made to contain about one-fourth its
volume of strong hydrochloric acid.          Potassiuui ferrocyanide was
added, but not an excess, and the bulky precipitate collected. An
excess of the reagent was added to the filtrate, which, after standing
twenty-four hours, was filtered. Very small quantities of the two
precipitates were examined spectrographically ; the second is decidedly
richer in gallium than the first.
    Residues M and M- with the small Residues added to them as
 described. — Ignited at a red heat to burn combustible matter.        The
 mass became grey and weighed, when cold, 8 grams.            It was very
 bulky, and consisted largely of silica. Fusion with fusion mixtures
converted the silica into alkaline silicates, which were removed by
 solution in water, leaving a black residue. This was fused with
 caustic soda and sufficient nitre to oxidise the graphite, Ac. Water
 dissolved all of this, excepting a small qnantity of red oxide of iron,
 part of which was examined for gallium. None present.
    The filtrate was acidified with hydrochloric acid, evaporated to
 dryness, and dried at 120° C. to dehydrate silicic acid.
    The dry residue was digested with strong hydrochloric acid, and
 water added.      It was then filtered to removo somo silica, which was
 found to have retained only a trace of gallium.
     The filtrate was mixed with a small excess of ammonia, and boiled
 for some time ; the gallium being precipitated probably as phosphate.
 The filtrate in this and in all similar cases was again boiled, after

              On the Occurrence   of Gallium in  Clay-ironstone.        405
adding a few drops of ammonia ; if any precipitate was produced it
was collected and added to the other precipitate.        The precipitate in
this case was added to ferrocyanide precipitates obtained from the
residue W.       The paper, after being scraped to remove the residue as
far as possible, was burnt in the oxyhydrogen name.            The gallium
lines are strong.
    The ferrocyanide precipitates     with others rich in gallium were
ignited    at low redness to decompose the cyanides, and then fnsed
with pure caustic soda.      The produce was extracted with water and
filtered.
    Residue from Fusion, — Dissolved in hydrochloric acid, expelled the
excess of acid, added water, reduced the ferric salt, and filtered.
Residue remaining contained only a trace of gallium.
    Filtrate.— Boiled with an excess of ammonium acetate and filtered
off the precipitate. The filtrate was mixed with sodium phosphate and
boiled, thus yielding a second precipitate.     The filtrate from this was
again    boiled,  and ammonium   carbonate added until a third precipitate
was produced.        Very small portions of these three precipitates were
burnt in the oxyhydrogen flame. The first two were rich in gallium,
while the third contained only a trace. Ignited the first and second
precipitates, heated the residue in a platinum crucible with hydro
chloric and sulphuric acids, expelled the former acid by heating until
the white fumes of sulphuric acid were evolved, and then fused the
residue with canstic soda. Extracted with water and filtered. After a
second fusion the residue was practically free from gallium.            The
alkaline filtrates were acidified with hydrochloric acid, and the
gallium precipitated      by boiling with ammonia until the excess of
ammonia was expelled.        Filtered and tested the filtrate by repeating
the process of boiling with ammonia until no further precipitate
resulted.
    The precipitates of gallium hydrate and phosphate, obtained as
described, were dissolved in hydrochloric acid and, after adding one-
fourth the volume of the solution of strong hydrochloric acid, an
excess of potassium ferrocyanide was added.        After standing for one
day the precipitate was collected, washed, and ignited.          It weighed
0-0670 gram.
    This residue was dissolved by heating with strong sulphuric acid
in a platinum crucible, some water being added, after heating strongly,
and then an excess of caustic soda prepared from sodium.                The
crucible was then heated until the water was expelled, and the residue
retained in the fused caustic soda.      The process was repeated on the
residue which remained after adding water and filtering. The second
residue was practically free from gallium.
    The filtrates were collected in a platinum basin, made faintly acid
with hydrochloric acid, and saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen.

A   brownish coloured precipitate was removed by filtration.         It con
tained copper, lead, and silver, but no gallium.           The filtrate was
boiled to expel sulphuretted hydrogen, and the gallium precipitated
with Hmmonia as described above. The precipitate was collected and
 ignited.    It  weighed 0'0288 gram.
   This residue possessed a very light yellow colour. One milligram
 was burnt in the oxyhydrogen flame j its spectrum shows the two
gallium lines very strongly. Lines of sodium, potassium, iron, calcium,
and lead are present, but those of the last three are exceedingly weak.
   The remaining 0"0278 gram of residue was fused with hydrogen
potassium sulphate ; water and sulphuric acid were added, and the
crucible heated until fumes of sulphuric acid were evolved. Water
was again added, and a small residue removed by filtration. This
residue weighed 0'0040 gram.
   The gallium was separated from the iron by two extractions with
caustic soda solution.      The ferric hydrate was dissolved in hydro
chloric acid, and reprecipitated by ammonia. The ferric oxide
 weighed 0 0022 gram.
   The gallium in the filtrate was then reprecipitated and weighed as
oxide.     It weighed 0'0213 gram.
   A few drops of Bodium phosphate were added to the filtrate, and
.sufficient ammonia to make it turn red litmus paper blue.             After
boiling for a few minutes the liquid was filtered, the paper being
dried and bnrnt in the oxyhydrogen flame.           The gallium lines are
present in its spectrum, but are very weak.
   The oxide of gallium now possessed a scarcely perceptible, faint
yellow colour. It does not represent the whole of the gallium present
in the sample, as a small quantity was removed and lost in testing
the precipitations and residues. We are able, however, to estimate
this quantity by comparing the lines in the different spectra with
lines and spectra obtained by heating weighed quantities of gallium
oxide. Iu this way we estimate the total quantity of gallium to be
as follows   : —

   An estimation of the gallium in the " mixer metal " had       been at
tempted in the spring of this year, but the separation was not as
complete as in the process just described.        The figure obtained,
however, is so closely in accord with the above that we will briefly
describe the process and record the result.
   The sample, weighing 340 grams, was boiled with hydrochloric acid
until the latter was nearly neutralised ; the solution was then
decanted, and fresh acid added to the residue. When the acid
ceased to have any marked action the whole liquid was filtered, and
the residue A washed, dried, and treated separately for the separation
of gallium.
   Filtrate B. — From this filtrate gallium was precipitated by calcium
carbonate, but phosphates         and sesquioxide      metals, including
chromium, rendered the precipitate a too complex mixture, and we
had recourse to the ferrocyanide method.
   The gallium was separated from the iron by pure sodium hydrate,
and finally precipitated as hydrate and ignited.      The oxide weighed
0'0149 gram,    and  this amount    corresponds to 0'0033 per cent, of
gallium in the sample or one part in 30,000 of the iron.
   We know, by the spectrographic examination of the residues, &c,
that the whole of the gallium was not obtained, and that the oxide
weighed was not quite pure gallium oxide, but with the experience
gained in this estimation we were able to make the more exact
analysis already described.
   In conclusion, we may state that this blast furnace metal contains
more gallium than the richest source of that element hitherto known.
The mineral referred to is a zinc blende from Bensburg on the Rhine,
about eight miles from Cologne ; it is found in the Franzisca adit of
the Liideiich mine.      MM. Lecocq de Boisbaudran and Jungfleisch
extracted 62 grams of crude gallium from 4300 kilograms, or nearly
A\ tons of the ore ; this is in the proportion of 1 in 72,000, but they
believed the actual quantity present to be about 1 part of gallium in
50,000 of the ore.
   We have recently discovered other sources of gallium, but cannot
include the details of our later work in the present communication.

                                    (Abstract.)
   This paper is in continuation of one brought bsfore the Society in
1892, and published in 'Phil. Trans.,' B, vol. 181.           In that commu
nication the peripheral distribution of the sensory nerve-roots of the
sacro-lumbar and the thoracic regions was examined.             In the present
the examination is extended to the cervical and brachial sensory

    Distribution of Fibres of Posterior Roots of SpinaV Nerves.            409
roots, and to the skin distribution of the cranial nerves. The com
munication is divided into four sections.        In Section    I  the field of
peripheral distribution of each root    is described from  the   Vth   cervical
to the lower end of the brachial region.           The description given is
taken in each case from one particular experiment, which has proved
a typical one for the root in question, and then deviations from this
type are appended to it in the form of annotations.                 Particular
attention was paid to the question of the skin-fields of the several
divisions, ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular of the cranial Vth,
in order to see if the fields possessed the characters of segmental
skin-fields, or those of peripheral nerve-trnnk skin-fields.              They
were found to conform with the latter, not with the former. A
curious relation of the posterior edge of the field of the Vth to the
external ear is found to exist, indicating that the position of the
 visceral cleft is still adhered to as a boundary line for the field of the
 trigeminus.     The sense of taste as well as of touch is found to be
 destroyed in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue after intracranial
 section of the Vth ; this makes it extremely doubtful whether the corda
 tympani can have gustatory functions in the monkey, as has been
 believed in some cases in man. No loss of eye-movements, or inter
 ference with them, has been found to result from intracranial section
 of the Vth.
    The results obtained on the various successive nerve-roots cannot
 well be abstracted. The glossopharyngeal field on the tongue has
 been successfully delimited.
     After cranial Vth and all the upper cervical posterior roots have
 been severed, there still persists a small field of sentient skin, which
 includes the external auditory meatus and a part of the pinna.            This
 field, although not corresponding to the situation given by anthro-
 potomists to the distribution of the auricular branch of the vagus, comes
 either from it or the glossopharyngeal.       It presents interest as being
 the only field representing the whole cutaneous distribution of an entire
 nerve, which does not conform with the rules of zonal distribution
 holding good in the case of each of the other nerve-roots examined,
 and these now include the whole series.         The posterior root of the
 1st cervical nerve has a skin-field in the cat which includes the
 pinna. The posterior root of the same nerve in Hacacus has no
 skin-field at all, its skin-field having apparently been included in the
 Ilnd cervical of Macacus, not in the cranial Vth. The root fields con
 tributing to the surface of the brachial limb are Illrd, IVth, Vth,
 Vlth, Vllth, and VHIth cervical, and 1st, Ilnd, and Illrd thoracic.
 Of these, the VHIth cervical is the only one which includes the
 whole of the surface of the free apex of the limb ; its distribution in
 this respect closely resembles that of the Vlth lumbar sensory root
  in the pelvic limb.

410     Distribution of Fibres of Posterior Roots of Spinal Nerves.
   The Ilnd section of the communication deals with the degree of
conformity between the distribution of the spinal ganglion fibres in
the skin and their distribution in the underlying deep tissues of the
limb.    It is shown that, although the skin fields of the ganglia are
in the middle of the limb region dislocated from the median line of
the body, the distribution of the fibres of the root ganglion is never
theless, when its deep distribution is taken into account, to a com
plete ray of tissue extending in an unbroken fashion from the median
plane of the body oat along the limb to (in the case of the nerves,
extending farthest into the limb) the very apex of it. This distribu
tion conforms, therefore, with that shown in a previous paper to be
typical of the distribution of the ventral (motor) root. The distinc
tion is not, therefore, as between afferent and efferent, but as between
cutaneous and muscular. A detailed analysis of the distribution of the
deep sensory fibres is in this paper carried out for the Vlth lumbar
spinal ganglion of Macacus rhesus ; this ganglion was chosen because
its skin-field, occupying the free apex of the lower limb, is one as far
dislocated from the median line of the body as any in the whole
spinal series, and presents, therefore, the greatest apparent discrepancy
between the distribution of its afferent and efferent roots.       A com
parison of the distribution of the afferent and efferent roots in this
(Vlth lumbar) nerve was made by means of the Wallerian method ;
the results show the peripheral distribution of the two to be minutely
similar. From this, and from other observations given, the rule is
put forward as a definitely established one that the sensory nerves of
a skeletal muscle in all cases derive from the spinal ganglion (or
ganglia) corresponding segmentally with that (or those) containing
the motor cells, whence issue motor nerve-fibres to the muscle.        The
reflex arc, in which the afferent and efferent nerve-cells innervating
a muscle are components, need not, therefore, as far as anatomical
composition is concerned, involve irradiation through more than a
single spinal segment.
   Section   III deals with general features of arrangement recognisable
in the distribution of the roots ; for instance, the determination of
the position of the primary dorsal and ventral lines of the limbs,
the examination of the asserted rotation of the limbs and of the
asserted torsion of the limbs, and of the asserted homologies between
muscles, &c, of the brachial and pelvic limbs respectively, by the
criteria for re-examination of such questions provided by the facts
elicited in the course of the work ; the cross-lapping of the skin-
fields across the median line of the body, the overlapping of com
 ponent parts of a single field, the serial overlapping of adjacent fields,
the degree of overlapping in different regions of the body, the degree
of overlapping in peripheral nerve-trunk fields, the amount of over
lapping of spinal ganglion-fields compared with that of peripheral

nerve-trunks, the comparison       of sensory overlapping with motor
overlapping, the relation of overlapping to acnteness of sensation ;
individual variation, its extent and frequency, as far as can be judged
from the skin-fields. Comparison between the human brachial plexus
and that of Macacus is made, and it is pointed out that the human
plexus is slightly prefixed, as compared with that of Macacus.
    Finally, in Section IV, " shock," and various spinal reactions are
examined, especially with reference to their effects upon the size and
other features of the areas of the root-fields, &c, and the results
collated and discussed.

    A  phenomenon came under my observation in the course of experi
 ments upon monkeys at the commencement of the present year
 which seems sufficiently interesting to merit record here.    Its occur
 rence, so long as certain conditions of experiment are maintained,
 appears regular and predictable.
    Although the character of the movements executed by the skeletal
 muscles when excited reflexly through the medium of the isolated
 spinal cord is variable, one feature common to them is their compara
 tive brevity of duration.   Many of them are, as pointed out by Fick
 and by Wundt years ago, hardly distinguishable in several particu
 lars from the simple twitches elicitable from an excised muscle, so
 brief and local and inco-ordinate do they appear to be. Others are
 more prolonged, and, as I have described in a paper recently com
 municated to the Society, exhibit various forms of sequence or
 "march" (Hughlings Jackson). Without recapitulating the con
 clusions there drawn from the data given in that paper,     I wish here
 to merely point out that of movements due to purely spinal reflex
 action, although some are fairly extensive, most are quite short-
 lasting, and not so prolonged as the longer of those that can be
 elicited under appropriate conditions from the cortex cerebri ; also
 that if prolonged they, like the final phase of prolonged movements
 initiated from the cortex, tend to become clonic, or to exhibit that
 kind of action which in the paper referred to above       I  have desig
 nated "alternating."
     The reflex movements, the subject proper of this note, are, on the
 contrary, of extremely prolonged duration, and absolutely devoid of
  clonic character and of alternating character. If the cerebral hemi
                                                             2  i 2

spheres    be carefully removed, e.g., from a monkey, with avoidance of
haemorrhage       and of fall of body temperature, and if sufficient time
be  allowed    to   elap.se for subsidence in the animal of what may be
called immediate shock, movements can be evoked remarkably
different from those         I  have ever seen elicitable as purely spinal
or as cerebral reactions.            If a finger of one of the monkey's
hands bo stimulated, for instance, by dipping it into a cup of
hot water, there results an extensive reflex reaction involving
movement of the whole upper limb.              The wrist is extended, the
elbow flexed, the shoulder protracted, the upper arm being drawn
forward and somewhat across the chest. The movement occurs after
a variable and usually prolonged period of latent excitation.             The
movement, although it may he fairly rapid, strikes the observer each
time as perfectly deliberate ; it is of curiously steady and " smooth
                                                                             "
performance.         Sometimes it is carried out quite slowly, and then, as
a rule, the extent of it is less ample.       The most striking feature of
the   reflex  is,  however,    that  when the  actual movement has been
accomplished the contraction of the muscles employed in it does not cease
or become superseded by the action of another group, but is continued
even for ten and twenty minutes at a time.       The new attitude assumed
by the limb is maintained, and that too without clonus or even tremor.
In the instance cited, namely, that of the fore limb, the posture
assumed suggests the taking of a forward step in quadrupedal pro
gression, and in that posture the animal will remain for a quarter of
an hour at a time.
   The degree of, for instance, flexion assumed in the new posture
seems much dependent on the intensity and duration of the stimulus
applied.     If the degree is extreme, the attitude of the limb may not
be maintained to its full extent for the time mentioned ; thns, the
elbow, at first fully flexed, will in the course of a minute or so be
found to have opened somewhat. This opening can be often seen to
occur per saltum, as it were, but the steps are quite small, and recur
rent at unequal intervals of between perhaps a quarter of a minute
and a minute. After some relaxation from the extreme phase of the
posture has taken place, the less pronounced attitude, e.g., semiflexion
at the elbow, may persist without alteration obvious to inspection for
ten minutes or more.         Apart from the occasional step-like relaxations,
the contraction of the muscles is so steady as to give an even line
when registered by the myograph.             A renewed stimulation of the
finger excites further flexion, which is maintained as before in the
way above described.           The posture can be set aside without diffi
culty by    taking     hold of  the limb and unbending it; the resistance
felt in the process of so doing is slight ; the posture thus broken down
is not reassutned when the limb is then released.
   Analogous results are obtainable on the hind limb.             Hot water

                                                  I
applied to a toe evokes always, so far as have seen, flexion of ankle
and knee ; usually of hip also.          This movement is " deliberately "
executed, and always institutes a maintained posture.
    If finger (or toe) of both right and left limb be placed together in
the hot water, there results symmetrical reflex movement of both the
right and the left fore limbs (or hind limbs), leading to assumption
of a fairly symmetrical posture by the right and left limbs respec
tively, the posture being similar to but duplicate of that evoked in
the one limb only on excitation of that limb.               This may appear a
self-evident sequel to the observation given earlier, but is not so
when an observation immediately to be mentioned is taken into con
sideration.
    Not the least interesting part of tho reflexes under consideration
is a remarkable glimpse which they allow into the scope of reflex
inhibition as regards the co-ordinate of movements of the limbs.
Although the posture taken up by the right fore limb consequent
upon excitation of a finger is symmetrically duplicated by the left
limb when both hands are simultaneously stimulated, tho effect of
excitation of the two hands does not lead to symmetrical posture if
the excitation be not synchronous but successive.             If when the right
arm    has already  assumed   its  posture  in  response    to  an excitation of
the right hand, the left hand be stimulated, there results, while the'
left arm in obedience to the excitation is lifted and placed in the
flexed posture, an immediate and, if the stimulus be at all more than
slight, complete relaxation of the right arm. The right arm drops
flaccid while the left is raised and maintained in the raised attitude.
 Similarly, excitation of the right foot breaks down the posture
assumed by the right arm, and conversely, and even more easily,
stimulation of the right hand breaks down a posture assumed by the
right leg. Again, a nip of the right pinna causes relinquishment of
a posture assumed by the right arm or by the right leg.             If the right
pinna is pinched    wheu  both    arms  are  in this  cataleptoid posture, com
plete inhibition can be readily exerted on the right arm, but usually
only partial relinquishment can be induced in the left arm. To exert
complete inhibition upon the posture of the left arm, the pinna
pinched must be that of the left side.           Similarly the posture reflexly
evoked by appropriate stimulation              of   either hind limb can be
inhibited by excitation of either pinna or of either fore limb, but
predominantly by pinna and fore limb of the same side as the limb
to be inhibited.     The inhibition of the hind limb is much more easily
 elicited from the opposite hind limb than from the opposite fore limb
or opposite ear.   I  have never yet seen it obtained diagonally upon the
 fore limb  from  the  opposite hind limb.
     The movements obtained in the limbs by exciting the limbs them
 selves are only cited above as examples to illustrate the general

414                          Prof. C. S. Sherrington.
characters of the condition.    The details of the results will be given
in a fuller paper dealing with the subject. I was prevented from
inquiring thoroughly into the phenomenon when it was first met
with ; but in the course of the present summer and autumn the
investigation has been systematically undertaken.        I will conclude
this preliminary note by adding that throughout the observations the
animal's respiration remains apparently unaffected by the Btimuli
effective to produce the various reflexes and inhibitions such as above
described.    The respiration is tranquil, rather deep, regular, and
often somewhat frequent. The animal in all my experiments has been
completely blind, but a sharp conjunctival reflex exists. The knee
jerks are elicitable but are not exaggerated. The tonus of the sphinc
ters appears about normal.       The pulse is full, regular, and fairly
frequent.
     I                               in evoking the cataleptoid reflex
         have not at present succeeded
by simply placing the limb in the desired posture.
  In applying the term cataleptoid to these reflexes,     do so because      I
the reflexes recall, iu some respects, strikingly certain phases of
hypnotic condition, by some writers distinguished as cataleptic, and
because the strict significance of the prefix implies a steady main
tenance of possession subsequent to seizure, and is therefore peculiarly
applicable here, whether these reflexes bo or be not allied to hypnotic
catalepsy.

            On Reciprocal Innervation  of Antagonistic  Muscles.     415
to the muscles of antagonistic position acting about certain joints of
the limbs.
    If  transection of the neural axis be carried out at the level of the
crnra cerebri in, e.g., the cat, there usually ensues after a somewhat
variable interval of time a tonic rigidity in certain groups of skeletal
muscles, especially fn those of the dorsal aspect of the neck and tail
and of the extensor surfaces of the limbs. The details of this condi
tion, although of some interest, it is unnecessary to describe here and
now, except in so far as the extensors of the elbow and the knee are
concerned. These latter affect tho present subject. The extensors of
the elbow and the knee are generally in strong contraction, but alto
gether without tremor and with no marked relaxations or exacerba
tions.     On taking hold of the limbs and attempting to forcibly flex
the elbow or knee a very considerable degree indeed of resistance is
experienced, the triceps brachii and quadriceps extensor cruris
become, under the stretch which the more or less effectual flexion puts
 upon them, still tenser than before, and on releasing the limb the
joints spring back forthwith to their previous attitude of full exten
sion. Despite, however, this powerful extensor rigidity, flexion of
the elbow may be at once obtained with perfect facility by simply
stimulating the toes or pad of the fore foot. When this is done the
triceps enters into relaxation and the biceps passes into contraction.
 If, when the reflex is evolved, the condition of the triceps muscle is
carefully examined, its contraction is found to undergo inhibition, and
its tenseness to be broken down synchronously with and indeed very
often accurately at the very moment of onset of reflex contraction in
the opponent prebrachial muscles.         The guidance of the flexion
movement of the forearm may therefore be likened to that used in
driving a pair of horses under harness. The reaction can be initiated
in more wave than one, electrical excitation of a digital nerve or
mechanical excitation of the sensory root of any of the upper cervical
nerves may be employed ;     I  have seen on one occasion a rubbing of
 the skin of the cheek of the same side effective.
    Similarly in the case of the hind limb.     The extensor muscles of
the knee exhibit strong steady non-tremulent contraction under the
appropriate conditions of experiment.       Passive flexion of the knee
can only be performed with use of very considerable force, the quad
riceps becoming tight as a stretched string.     The application of hot
 water to the hind foot then elicits, nevertheless, an immediate flexion
at knee and hip, during which not only are the flexors of those joints
 thrown into contraction, but the extensors of the knee joint are
 simultaneously relaxed.     Electric excitation of a digital nerve or of
 the internal saphenous nerve anywhere along its course will also
 initiate the reflex.
    The same relaxation of existing contraction in the extensors can

be obtained by electrical excitation of the tract in the crura cerebri,
when, as sometimes happens, that excitation evokes flexion at elbow
or at knee.     This and the previous fact which evidences that the
result is obtainable after complete removal of the whole cerebrum
bear out the view arrived at in my former paper that for this
reciprocal and, as I believe, elementary co-ordination, it is not essen
tial that " high level " centres (Hughlings Jackson) be employed.
I  incline to think, however, that this kind of co-ordination at elbow
and knee is probably largely made use of iu movements initiated via
the cerebral hemispheres as well as in the lower reflexes, on the
observation of which the present Note is based.         This conclusion is
indicated by its occurring iu response to excitation of the pyramidal
fibres in the crura.      In the case of the reciprocal innervation of
antagonistic ocular muscles I was able to prove that it took place
even in " willed movements."         It seems, in view of what has been
shown above, legitimate to extend that result to the additional examples
afforded by elbow-joint and knee.
    Regarding the innervation of the triceps brachii and quadriceps
extensor cruris, it is interesting to note that these muscles, which ara
of all among the limb muscles particularly difficult to provoke to
action by local spinal reflexes, are the very ones which, when the level
of the transection is pontial or prepontial, exhibit tonic contraction the
most markedly.       The well-known and oft-corroborated Sanders-Ezn
phenomenon of inaccessibility of the extensors of the knee to spinal
reflex action has, as   I  have recently shown, certain limitations, but
 at the same time so long as the transection is spinal — even when
carried out so as to isolate not merely a portion of, bnt the whole,
 fcpinal cord entire from bulb to filum terrainale — does apply very
strictly to excitations arising in its own local region proper. And
the spinal reflex relations of the triceps brachii in this respect, as
pointed out elsewhere, somewhat resemble those of the distal portion
of the quadriceps extensor of the leg. Alteration of the site of tran
section from infrabulbar to suprabulbar levels works a curious change
in this. The Sanders-Ezn phenomenon then becomes subject to strik
ing contravention.    I  have, after the higher transection, several times
seen excitation of the hind foot itself provoke unilateral ideolateral
extension of knee, a result incompatible with the Sanders-Ezn rule
even under the limitations of ideolaterality, &c, which         I consider
must be attached to it. And similarly with the triceps at the elbow.
    The difference between the accessibility of the quadriceps to reflex
action after infrabulbar and after suprabulbar transection may, how
ever, be less abrupt than it appears at first sight, and a superficial
rather than a fundamental distinction.         When extensor rigidity has
ensued at elbow and knee after suprabulbar transection, the reflex
 excitability of triceps brachii and quadriceps cruris seems in a man

            [On Chelrostrobus, a new Type          of Fossil   Cone.         417
ner as difficult as in the presence of exclusively spinal mechanisms.
The reflex inhibitions the subject of this Note show, however, that the
accessibility is not really greatly or even at all altered ; the nexus is
maintained, but the conduction across it is signalised by a different
sign, minus instead of plus.      The former, to find expression, ^must
predicate an already existent quantity of contraction — tonus, to take
effect upon. It seems likely enough that even when the transection is
infrabulbar and merely spinal mechanisms remain in force, the samo
nexus obtains, but that then that background of tonic contraction
is lacking, and that lacking the play of inhibitions remains invisible,
never coming within the field of any ordinary method of observation.
   Under the conditions adopted in my experiments, various other
reflex actions, that seem probably examples of this same kind of co
ordination, can be studied, for instance, a sudden depression and
curving downward of the stiffly elevated and tonically up-curved tail
which can be elicited by a touch upon the perineum. But with these
and also with other details regarding the reflexes at elbow and knee
I hope to deal more fully in a paper to which the experiments re
corded here are contributory.

me on to the track of the new cone,              it may be well shortly to describe
its chief characteristics, reserving all details for a future paper.
    The specimen, which is about 7 mm. in diameter, bears the bases
only of somewhat crowded leaves, the arrangement of which, though
not quite clear, was most probably verticillate, with from nine to

central cylinder, subdivide in both planes on their way through the
cortex, to supply the lobes and segments of the leaf.
    The central cylinder is polyarch, the strand of wood having from
nine to twelve prominent angles, with phloem occupying the furrows
between them. With the exception of the spiral protoxylem-elements
at the angles, the tracheaB have multiseriate bordered pits, thus differ
ing conspicuously from the scalariform tracheae of the Lepidodendrea?.
 The interior of the stele is occupied by tracheal intermingled with
conjunctive pai^enchyma.                There is a well-marked formation of
secondary tissues by means of a normal cambium.*
                                      The Strobilus.
    Mr. R. Kidston, F.G.S., kindly informed me that be had in his
 possession sections of a fossil cone from Burntisland having certain
 points in common with the Williamson specimen. On inspecting
 these sections with Mr. Kidston I was soon convinced that this unda-
scribed cone really belonged to the same pl«nt as the fragment of stem
 in the Williamson collection, and that the latter might well be the
 peduncle of the former.            At the same time, I satisfied myself, and
 Mr. Kidston agreed with me, that the whole organisation of his cone
 is fundamentally different from that of any Lepidostrobiis, the deci
sive point being th»t the new cone has compound branched sporo-
    * The general structure of this axis, including the course of the bundles and the
 subdivision of the bracts, is correctly described by Williamson, loc. ext., p. 297. As
                                       "
 regards the latter point, he says        peripherally the bark breaks up into main or
 primary bracts, which again     subdivide,  as in the transverse section, into secondary
 ones, demonstrating that each primary bract does not merely dichotomize, but sub
 divides, both horizontally and vertically, into a cluster of bracts — a condition corre
sponding with what T have already observed in the smaller strobili described."
These smaller    strobili are those of the Burntisland Lepidottrobus, to which, by a
 strange coincidence, Williamson, loc. cit., p. 295, erroneously attributed the same
 character, as regards subdivision of the bracts, which actually exists in the new cone.
 The only explanation appears to be, that Williamson interpreted the structure of
 the Lepidostrobus in the light of that of the peduncle, whicb, as we shall see, really
  belonged to a totally different fructification.

            of Fossil Cone  from the Calciferous  Sandstone.         41 9
pbylls, each of which bears a number of sporangia.            It became
evident that this cone must be placed in a new genus, and the con
clusion arrived at from the study of the peduncle was thus confirmed.
   Mr. Kidston most generously handed over his sections to me for
examination and description, and also obtained for me from the
owner the remains of the original block, from which        I have had a
number of additional sections prepared.
   Only a single specimen of the cone is at present known.        Before
cutting sections, the piece, which includes the base but not the apex
of the strobilus, was about 2 inches long. It was found at Pettycur,
near Burntisland, in 1883, by Mr. James Bennie of Edinburgh. The
specimen is calcified, and its preservation is remarkably perfect, so
that the whole structure is well shown, though the complexity of its
organisation renders the interpretation in some respects difficult.
   The cone in its present somewhat flattened condition measures
about 5 cm. by 2-3 cm. in diameter. The diameter in its natural state
would have been at least 3"5 cm. That of the axis is about 7 mm.,
exactly the same as that of Williamson's peduncle. Thus the extreme
length of the sporophylls, which have on the whole an approxi
mately horizontal course, is about 1*4 cm.
   The sporophylls are arranged in somewhat crowded verticils,
fourteen of which were counted in a length of an inch, 2'5 cm. There
are twelve leaves in each whorl, and the members of successive
 whorls are accurately superposed, a fact which is shown with the
greatest clearness in tangential sections of the cone.       This is evi
dently a point of great significance in considering the affinities of the
fossil.
   The sporophylls themselves have a remarkably complex form. Each
sporophyll at its insertion on the axis, consists of a short basal
portion or phyllopodium ; the bases of the sporophylls belonging to
the same verticil are coherent. The sporophyll branches immediately
above its base, dividing into a superior and an inferior lobe, which lie
directly one above the other in the same radial plane. Almost at the
 same point, each of the lobes subdivides in a palmate manner into
 three segments, which assume a horizontal course, whereas the com
mon phyllopodium has an upward inclination.          It is probable that
 sometimes,   especially at the base of the cone, there may be two
instead of three segments to each lobe.        As a rule, however, each
sporophyll consists of six segments, of which three belong to the
 superior (ventral or posterior) and three to the inferior (dorsal or
anterior) lobe.
   The segments are of two kinds — sterile and fertile. Both alike
 consist of a long, straight, slender pedicel, running out horizontally,
and terminating at the distal end in a thick laminar expansion.      The
 sterile segments are the longer, and in each the lamina bears an

420        Dr. D. H. Scott.         On Cheirostrobus, a new Type
upturned foliaceous scale as "well as a shorter and stouter downward
prolongation.
   Each of the fertile segments ends in a fleshy lamimir enlargement
not unlike the peltate scale of an Equisetum or a Calamostachys.
These fertile laminae, which are protected on the exterior by the
overlapping ends of the sterile segments, bear the sporangia.                   Four,
perhaps in some cases five, sporangia are attached, by Iheir ends
remote from the axis, to the inner surface of the peltate fertile lamina.
Each sporangium is connected with the lamina by a somewhat narrow
neck of tissue into which a vascular bundle enters.                Tho sporangia
are of great length, and extend back along the pedicels until they
nearly or quite reach the axis.
   The sterile and fertile segments alternate regularly, one above the
other, in the same vertical series.         So much is cvid?nt, but the ques
tion which segments are fertile and which sterile, has presented great
difficulties, owing to the fact, that the same segment can scarcely ever
be traced continuously throughout the whole of its long course, and
that the pedicels of sterile and fertile segments present no constant
distinctive characters.        For reasons, however, which will be fully
given in a subsequent paper,          I think it highly probable that in each
sporophyll     the   segments    of  the  lower lobe are sterile, and those of
the upper lobe fertile, constituting the sporangiophores.
   Tho sporangia and pedicels are all packed closely together so as to
form a continuous mass.          The external surface of the cone was com
pletely protected by its double investiture of fertile and sterile
lamina?.
   The spores are well preserved in various parts of the cone, and, so
far as this specimen shows, are all of one kind, their average dia
meter being 0 065 mm. At the base of the cone, where macrospores,
if they existed, might naturally be looked for, the spores are of the
 same size as elsswhere.        So far, then, there is no evidence of hetcro-
spory.      The    spores are considerably larger than the microspores
of the Lepidostrobi.         Those of the Burntisland Lepidostrobtts,              for
example, are barely 0-02 mm. in diameter. The spores of our plant
approach in size those of Sphenophyllum Dawsoni, or the microspores
of Calamostachys Caskeana.
   The sporangial wall, as preserved, ii only one cell in thickness ; it
bears no resemblance to the palisade-like layer which forms the wall
of the sporangium in Lepidostrobus, but has the same structure as
 that of a Calamostachys.*           The sporangial wall of Splienophyllum
Dawsoni is similar.
   The anatomy of the axis of the cone agrees closely with that of

the peduncle above described, except for the absence of any secondary-
tissues. Tho wood has twelve prominent angles, at which the spiral
trachere are situated, so its development was, no doubt, centripetal.
The inner trachea have pitted walls, and are intermixed with scat
tered parenchymatous cells, imperfectly preserved.           The phloem has
entirely perished.
    The most interesting anatomical feature is the course of the leaf-
trace bundles, which can be followed with the greatest exactness on
comparing sections in the three directions.
    A single vascular bundle -starts from each angle of the stele for
each sporophyll, and passes obliquely upwards.               When less than
half way through the cortex, the trace divides into three bundles,
one median and two lateral.         The lateral strands are not always both
given    off exactly at the same  point.    A little further out, the median
bundle divides into two, which in this case lie in the same radial
plane, so that one is anterior, and the other posterior.         The median
posterior    bundle  is the larger,  and  before   leaving the cortex this, in
its turn, divides into three. There are now six branches of the
original leaf-trace, three anterior, and three posterior, which respec
tively supply the lower and upper lobes of the sporophyll. The three
segments of the lower lobe are supplied by the two lateral bundles
first given off, and by the anterior median bundle, while the upper
segments receive the posterior median bundle and its two lateral
branches.       In the base of the sporophyll, all six bundles can be
clearly seen, in tangential sections of the cone, three above and three
 below. As the segments become free, one bundle passes into each,
 and runs right through the pedicel to the lamina.             In the fertile
 lamina the bundle subdivides, a branch diverging to the point of
insertion of each sporangium.
    One of the longitudinal sections passes through the base of the
cone, so as to show part of the peduncle in connection with it.             In
this peduncle secondary wood is present, just as in the separate
specimen belonging to the Williamson collection.               Higher up in
the axis of the cone, where         the  sporophylls begin    to appear, the
secondary wood dies out. This evidence materially confirms the
conclusion that the Williamson peduncle really belongs to our
strobilus.
                                  Diagnosis.
   It  is evidently necessary to establish a new genus for the reception
of this fossil ; the generic name which I propose is Cheirostrobus,
intended     to suggest the palmate division of the sporophyll-lobes
(x«'/>, hand).     The species maybe appropriately named Feltycurensis,
from the locality where the important deposit occurs, which has
yielded this strobilus and so many other valuable specimens of

422        Dr. D. H. Scott.      On Cheirostrobus, a new Type
palaeozoic    vegetation.    The diagnosis      may  provisionally run  as
follows : —
    Cheirostrobus, gen. nov.
    Cone consisting of a cylindrical axis, bearing numerous compound
sporophylls, arranged in crowded many-membered verticils.
    Sporophylls of successive verticils superposed.
    Each sporophyll divided, nearly to its base, into an inferior and a
superior lobe ; lobes palmately subdivided into long segments, of
which some (probably the inferior) are sterile, and others (probably
the superior) fertile, each segment consisting of an elongated stalk
bearing a terminal lamina.
    Laminae of sterile segments foliaceous ; those of fertile segments
(or sporangiophores) peltate.
    Sporangia large, attached by their ends remote from the axis, to
the peltate laminae of the sporangiophores.
    Sporangia on each sporangiophore, usually four.
    Spores very numerous in each sporangium.
    Wood of axis polyarch.
    C. Pettycurensis, sp. nov.
    Cone, 3 — 4 cm. in diameter, seated on a distinct peduncle.     Sporo
phylls,   twelve  in each verticil.
    Each sporophyll usually sexpartite, three segments belonging to
the inferior, and three to the superior, lobe.
    Sporangia densely crowded.
    Spores about 0 065 mm. in diameter.
    Horizon : Calciferous Sandstone Series.
    Locality : Pettycnr, near Burntisland, Scotland.        Found by Mr.
James Bennie, of Edinburgh.
    Both generic and specific characters are manifestly subject to alter
ation, if other similar fossils should be discovered. In the mean time
the above diagnoses are given, in order to facilitate identification.
                                    Affinities.
    Any full discussion of affinities must be reserved for the detailed
momoir, which I hope to lay before the Royal Society in a short time.
 At present only a few suggestions will be offered.
    The idea of a near relationship to Lepidostrobus — so specions at
 first sight — is negatived by ascurate investigation.     There may have
been a certain      resemblance in external habit, as there is in the
naked-eye appearance of the sections, but this means nothing more
than that the specimen is a large cone, with crowded sporophylls
and radially elongated sporangia.            The only real resemblance to
Lepidostrobus is in the polyarch strand of primary wood, but even
 here the details, as, for example, the structure of the tracheae, do not

                of Fossil    Cone from   the Calciferous      Sandstone.            423
agree.       In  other respects the differences from any Lepidodendroid
fructification are as great as they can be.
    I   do not doubt that the genus with which Clieirostrofais has most
in common is Sphenophyllum. The chief points of agreement are as
follows.
    1.    Tho superposed foliar whorls.         This certainly agrees with the
vegetative parts of Sphenophyllum, and, according to Count Solms-
 Laubach, the superposition holds good for the bracts of the strobili
also.*
     2. The deeply divided palmatifid sporophylls                agreeing with the
leaves of various species of Sphenophyllum, e.g., S. tenerrimum.
     3. The division of the sporophyll into a superior or ventral, and
 an inferior or dorsal, lobe, agreeing with the arrangement                            in
 Sphenophyllum        Dawsoni,    or S.  cuneifolium, according       to  M.   Zeiller's
 interpretation^
     4. The differentiation         of the sporophyll into sterile segments
 (bracts)      and   fertile  segments    (sporangiophores).        The comparison
 with Sphenophyllum is much strengthened if, as                  I believe to be the
  case, the segments of         the  inferior lobe   in   Cheirostrobus    are sterile,
 and those of the superior lobe fertile.
     5. The repeated subdivision of the leaf-trace vascular bundles, in
 passing through the cortex of the axis,                  J  as in Sphenophyllum
  Slephanense.
     6. The attachment of the sporangia to a laminar expansion at the
  distal end of the sporangiophore.           As regards this point, comparison
  should be made with the Bowmanites Eomeri of Count Solms-Lau-
  bach (loc. cit.).
     7. The structure of the sporangial wall.
      I think that the sum of these characters, to which others might be
 added, justifies the suggestion that Cheirostrobus may be provisionally
  placed in the same phylum, or main division, of Pteridophyta, with
  Sphenophyllum, though indications of possible affinities in other
  directions are not wanting, and will be discussed on another occa
 sion.
      Cheirostrobus,     even more than Sphenophyllum itself, appears to
  combine Calamarian with Lycopodiaceous characters, and might
  reasonably be regarded as a highly specialised representative of an
  ancient group of plants which lay at the common base of these two
  series.
      It appears likely that in Cheirostrobus one of those additional forms

                                      (Abstract.)
   The major portion of the experiments described in the paper
have been made on window glass and ice.                It is shown that for long
times residual charge diminishes with rise of temperature in the
case of glass, but for short time3 it increases both for glass and fee.
The capacity of glass when measured for ordinary durations of time,
such as l/100th to l/10th second, increases much with rise of tem
perature, but when measured for short periods, such as 1/10° second,
it does not sensibly increase. The difference is shown to be due to
the residual charge, which comes out between l/50,000th second and
1/lOOth second.          The capacity of ice when measured for periods of
l/100th to l/10th second increases both with rise of temperature,
and with increase of time, its value is of the order of 80, but when
measured for periods such as 1/106 second, its value is less than 3.
The difference again is due to residual charge coming out during
short times. In the case of glass, conductivity has been observed at
fairly high temperatures and after short times of electrification; it is
found that the conductivity after 1 /50,000th second electrification is
much greater than after l/10,000th, but for longer times is sensibly
constant. Thus a continuity is shown between the conduction in
dielectrics which, exhibit residual charge and deviation from Max
well's law and ordinary electrolytes.

426        Profs.   J. Dewar    and   J.   A. Fleming.   On the
observations, and completed them, as far as possible, by making
measurements of the electrical resistance of a wire of pure bismuth,
placed transversely to the direction of the field of an electromagnet,
and at the same time subjected to the low temperature obtained by
the use of liquid air.
   Sir David Salomons was so kind as to lend us for some time his
large electromagnet, which, in addition to giving a powerful field, is
provided with the means of easily altering the interpolar distance of
the pole pieces, and also for changing from one form of pole piece to
another.
   The form of the pole piece most frequently used was that of a
truncated cone.     The magnet was always excited by a constant
current obtained from a constant potential circuit.       To save the
considerable labour of determining again and again the strength of
the interpolar field, this was determined once for all, corresponding
to various interpolar distances and a given exciting current.      The
field was measured by suddenly removing from it a small exploring
coil of wire of known area, the same being connected to a standardised
ballistic galvanometer.
   By this means a curve was constructed which showed at once the
axial interpolar field at the central point in terms of the interpolar
distances, the magnetising current being kept constant.    This curve
proved, as was to be expected, to be nearly a rectangular hyperbola.
   This being done the bismuth wire to be examined was formed into
a narrow loop of a single turn, about 3 or 4 cm. in length, and the
ends soldered to leading-in wires of copper. The loop was placed in
a small glass vacuum vessel, with the plane of the loop perpendicular
to the direction of the axial magnetic field of the magnot.    The loop
was placed at equal distances from the two pole pieces, and in a
nearly uniform field of known strength.
   The vacuum vessel was then filled up with either liquid air, a
solution of solid carbonic acid in ether, or else simply with paraffin
oil. In a fourth case the vacuum vessel was closed, and liquid air
having been placed in     it, this liquid was caused to boil under a
reduced pressure of 25 mm., thus giving a temperature falling as low
as —203° C.     In another experiment the vacuum vessel was dispensed
with, the bismuth wire was simply wrapped in cotton wool, placed
between two pieces of thin mica between the pole pieces, and by
pouring upon the wrapping         acopious libation of liquid air, the
temperature of the bismuth wire was reduced to —185° C.
   In all cases great care was taken to avoid thermo-electric complica
tions, by providing that the soldered junctions by which the bismuth
wire  is  connected to the copper leading-in wire were at exactly the
same temperature, and to secure this the junctions were always kept
well covered with the refrigerating solution.

              Electrical Resistivity of Electrolytic Bismuth.            427
    The bismuth employed was electrolytic bismuth pressed into wire
 0"5245 mm. in diameter, and its purity was confirmed by spectro
scopic examination.
    These arrangements being made, the observations consisted in
measuring the electrical resistance of the bismuth at one tempera
ture, but when the transverse magnetic field had values varying from
zero to nearly 22,000 C.G.S. units.
    In the following tables the results are collected. The electrical
resistivity of the bismuth is stated for each temperature, and for the
various transverse fields employed.
   As the specimens of the bismuth wire used in the various experi
ments had different lengths, the actual figures of observation are not
given, but they have been reduced so as to give the volume resistivity
of the bismuth, corresponding to a certain temperature and magnetic
field strength.
   In the case of the experiment in liquid air boiling under a reduced
pressure, on account of the size of the vacuum vessel necessary to
contain the required initial volume of liquid air, the pole pieces of
the magnets could not be brought very near together, and hence the
field could not be raised to a very high value.

   It will be seen that the observations lead to the following conclu
sions. If the transverse field is zero, then cooling the bismuth always
reduces its resistance. If then the bismuth is transversely magnetised,
the resistance is increased, and for every temperature below the
normal one (about 20° C), there is some particular strength of trans
verse field, which just annuls the effect of the cooling, and brings the
resistance of the bismuth back again to the same value it had -when
not cooled, and not in any magnetic field. Hence the curves showing
the resistance at any temperature lower than the normal one (20° C.)
as a function of the transverse field, cross the curve showing the
resistance as a function of the field when taken at the normal tem
perature.       These crossing points are, however, not identical for

different resistance-temperature-field      curves. The lower the tem
perature the less is the strength of field which will bring the bismuth
back to its original resistance when not cooled and not in the field.
   The observations have been set out graphically in the diagrams in
figs. 1, 2, and 3, and it will be seen that there are in fig. 1 four curves.
Each of these curves corresponds to a different temperature, viz., that
of liquid air (—185° C), liquefying carbonic acid in ether ( — 79° C),
ordinary temperatures (20° C), and a fourth shorter curve, which
corresponds to a very low temperature of —203° C, obtained by

remarkably the resistance is affected by such magnetisation.           The
curve of resistance taken in liquid air, shows that by a transverse
magnetising field having a strength of 22,000 C.G.S. units, the
resistance of the bismuth is made 150 times greater than the resist
ance of the same wire in a zero field, but at the same temperature.
   The lower the temperature to which the bismuth is reduced the
greater is the multiplying power of a given transverse field upon its
electrical resistivity.
  Hence a still lower temperature than we have been able to apply
would doubtless render the bismuth still more sensitive to transverse
magnetisation.
  We have already shown that pure bismuth is no exception to the
generally observed fact that all pure metals continuously lose their
electrical resistivity as they approach in temperature the absolute

               Electrical Resistivity of Electrolytic Bismuth.               431
 zero. Hence at this last temperature it should be converted into a
 non-conductor      by a sufficiently strong transverse magnetisation.
 This result will have to be taken into consideration in framing any
theory of electrical conduction.
    In this respect bismuth is a remarkable exception to other metals.
Wo have tried the effect of transverse magnetisation at low tem
 peratures on zinc, iron, and nickel, but find no effect sensibly
 greater at low than at ordinary temperatures, although these metals
 have their resistance affected by magnetisation to a small degree.
    Bismuth has an exceptional position amongst other metals, both
 in respect of its large coefficient of the Hall effect, and also in
the degree to which its resistance is thus affected by transverse
magnetisation, and in addition, as above shown, in the degree to
which cooling to low temperatures affects this ability to be so changed
 by magnetisation.
    Very small amounts of impurity in the metal reduce these remark
 able qualities considerably.
    We may mention here that we have repeated the experiments we
made some time ago* on certain specimens of chemically prepared
bismuth, and for which we found the electrical resistance had a
minimum value for a certain temperature. We have again verified
this fact, both for the same and for a similar specimen. In the former
 experiments the bismuth wire used was embedded in paraffin wax
 during the cooling, and the suspicion had arisen that strains
might thus have been produced which had affected the results.
In the repetition of the experiments, we suspended the bismuth
wire freely in liquid air, so that no strains could be produced;
and, in addition, we tried the effect of mechanical stress on the
resistance directly. We satisfied ourselves that the cause of the
anomaly in the behaviour of the chemically prepared bismuth in
respect of electrical resistance at low temperatures was not to be
found in any effect due to strain.
    In fig. 3 a series of curves have been drawn showing the variation
in resistivity of the electrolytic bismuth for certain constant trans
verse magnetic fields and varying temperatures.             These curves were
obtained by taking sections of the curves in figs. 1 and 2. The
curves in fig. 3 are practically the continuation from 19° C. down to
 — 186° C. of curves which have been given by Mr. J. B. Henderson,f
for a range of temperature lying above 0° C.
   They show that if a wire of electrolytic bismuth is placed trans
versely in a certain magnetic field, there is, for a wide range of field,

         "
            (' Electrician,' 27th December, 1895),     I have given accounts
of the polarising property of various substances. Amongst the most
efficient polarisers may be mentioned nemalite and chrysotile. Nemalite
is a fibrous variety of brucite.         In its chemical composition it is a
hydrate of magnesia, with a small quantity of protoxide of iron and
carbonic       acid.   This substance is found to absorb very strongly
electric vibrations parallel to its length, and transmit those that are
perpendicular to the length.         I  shall distinguish the two directions
as the directions        of absorption and transmission.       Chrysotile is a
fibrous variety of serpentine.       In chemical composition it is a hydrous
 silicate of magnesia. Like nemalite, it also exhibits selective absorp
tion, though not to the same extent.          The transmitted vibrations are
perpendicular, and those absorbed parallel to the length.            Different
varieties of these substances exhibit the above property to a greater
or less extent.      I  have recently obtained a specimen of chrysotile with
a thickness of only 2-5 cm. ; this piece completely polarises the trans
 mitted electric ray by selective absorption.
     The action of these substances on the electric ray is thus similar to
 that of tourmaline on light.                                         I
                                     It may be mentioned here that found
tourmaline to be an inefficient polariser of the electric ray ; it does
 transmit the ordinary and the extraordinary rays with unequal
 intensities, but even a considerable thickness of it does not completely
 absorb one of the two rays.
     In Hertz's polarising gratings, electric vibrations are transmitted
 perpendicular to the wires, the vibrations parallel to the wires being
 reflected or absorbed.         Such gratings would be found to exhibit
 electric anisotropy, the conductivity in the direction of the wires
 being very much greater than the conductivity across the wires.
 The vibrations transmitted through the gratings are thus perpen
 dicular to the direction of maximum conductivity — or parallel to the
 direction of greatest resistance. The vibration absorbed is parallel
 to the direction of maximum conductivity.
     As the nemalite and chrysotile polarised the electric ray by unequal
 absorption in the two directions,         I was led to investigate whether

 434          Prof.  J. C.  Bose.   On the Selective   Conductivity
 they, too, exhibited unequal conductivities in the two directions of
 absorption and transmission.
    Nemalite, unfortunately, is difficult to obtain, and the specimens I
 could get here were too small to make the necessary measurements.
 I  have, however, in my possession two specimens which            I brought
 from India ; of these, one is a perfect specimen of a fair size, and        I
 obtained with it strong polarisation effects.       The second piece is not
 as good as the first, and rather small in size.       I  cut from this latter
piece a square of uniform thickness, the adjacent sides of the square
 being parallel to the directions of transmission and absorption respec
tively. The resistances of equal lengths in the two directions (with
 the same cross section) were now measured.
     The first specimen    I gave to Messrs. Elliott Brothers for measure
ment. They informed me, on the 13th of October last, that the
resistance in the direction of transmission was found to be 35,000
 megohms, and that in the direction of absorption, only 14,000 meg
ohms.
    It will thus be seen that the direction of absorption is also the
direction of greatest conductivity, and the direction of transmission
is the direction of least conductivity.
    My anticipations being thus verified,     I  proceeded to make further
 measurements with other specimens. From the perfect specimen of
 nemalite in my possession,      I cut two square pieces, A and B. The
 size of piece A is 2"56x2-56 cm., with a thickness of 1-1 cm.            B is
276 x 2-76x1-2 cm.
    For the determination of resistances     I used  a sensitive  Kelvin gal
vanometer, having a resistance of 7000 ohms.          With three Leclanche
cells, 1'4 volt each, and an interposed resistance equivalent to
55,524 megohms, a deflection of 1 division in the scale reading was
obtained.      The following table (p. 435) gives the results of the
                          I
measurements which carried out.
    The results given clearly show how the difference of absorption
in the two directions is related to the corresponding difference in
conductivity.
    I  then proceeded to make measurements with chrysotile.               The
specimens     I  could obtain were not very good.       I  cut two from the
same piece, and a third specimen was obtained from a different
variety.     The ratios of conductivities found in the three specimens
were 1 : 10, 1 : 9, and 1 : 4 respectively.     In every case the direction
of absorption was found to be the direction of maximum conductivity.
    [A  fibrous variety of gypsum (CaSO*), popularly known as Satin-
spar, also exhibits double absorption ; and in this case, too, the con
ductivity in the direction of absorption is found to be very much
greater than in that of transmission.

    One of the strongest polarising substances have come across is
the crystal epidote. The crystal is very small in size, and                     I  could
not get with it complete absorption of one of the two rays. But it
exhibits very strong depolarisation effect, even with a thickness as
small as 0 7 cm. This is, undoubtedly, due to strong selective absorp
tion in one direction.        I cut a square from this crystal 0'7 x0-7 cm.
with a thickness of 0-4 cm. Using an E.M.F. of 14 volts the deflections
obtained (proportional to the two conductivities) were 105 and 20
divisions respectively.         The conductivities in the two directions are,
therefore, in the ratio of 52 : 1. With an E.M.F. of 100 volts and a
diminished sensibility of the galvanometer, the deflections were 205
and 40, the ratio of the conductivities being as 5'1 : 1. — January 28,
1897.]
    It would thus appear that substances like nemalite which polarise by
double absorption, also exhibit double conductivity.                 It is probable
that, owing to this difference of conductivity in the two directions,
each thin layer unequally absorbs the incident electric vibrations ;
and that by the cumulative effect of many such layers, the vibrations
which are perpendicular to the direction of maximum conductivity
are alone transmitted, the emergent beam being thus completely
polarised.
    [Owing to the great difficulty in obtaining suitable specimens,                     I
have not been able to make a more extended series of determina
tions.    The relation found, in the cases described above, between
double absorption and double conductivity is, however, suggestive.

436     On the Selective  Conductivity  of Polarising   Substances.
   It should, however, be borne in mind that the selective absorption
exhibited by a substance depends, also, on the vibration frequency of
the incident radiation.     I have drawn attention to the peculiarity of
tourmaline which does     not  exhibit double absorption of the electric
ray to a very great extent. The specimen         I experimented with is,
however, one of a black variety of tourmaline, and not of the semi-
transparent kind generally used for optical work.
   Though the experiments already described are not sufficiently nume
rous for drawing a general conclusion as to the connection between
double absorption attended with polarisation, and double conductivity,
there is, however, a large number of experiments      I  have carried ont
which seem to show that a double-conducting structure does, as a rule,
exhibit double absorption and consequent polarisation.       Out of these
experiments    I  shall here mention one which may prove interesting.
Observing that an ordinary book is unequally conducting in the two
                                                 I
directions — parallel to and across the pages — interposed it, with its
edge at 45°, between the crossed polariser and analyzer of an electro-
polariscope.     The extinguished field of radiation was immediately
restored.   I then arranged both the polariser and the analyzer vertical
and parallel, and interposed the book with its edge parallel to the
direction of electric vibration. The radiation was found completely
absorbed by the book, and there was not the slightest action on the
receiver. On holding the book with its edge at right angles to the
electric vibration, the electric ray was found copiously transmitted.
An ordinary book would thus serve as a perfect polariser of, the
electric ray.    The vibrations parallel to the pages are completely
absorbed, and those at right angles transmitted in a perfectly polar
ised condition. — January 28, 1897.]

    In     1858   Dr. W. Marcel* announced to this Society the discovery
that hile possesses the remarkable property of dissolving to a clear
solution large amounts of fatty acids, and mixtures of these, when
heated above their melting points, and that, on cooling, these bodies
are again thrown out as a fine precipitate or emulsion.
    We have repeated these experiments, and are able to confirm                    the
accuracy of Marcet's observation. Thus we found that 6 c.c. of dog's
bile at 62° C. dissolved completely 1*5 grams of the mixed fatty
acidsf of beef suet, and similar solubilities were found in other
cases.
    No other observations than these have, so far as we are aware,
been made on the effect of temperature on the solubility of fatty
acids in bile ; although different writers have mentioned that fatty
acids are soluble in bile, no measurements have been made of the
extent of their solubility. AltmannJ has recently surmised that
fats are absorbed from the intestine as fatty acids, dissolved in the
 intestine by the agency of the bile, but has made no quantitative
 experiments on the solubilities of the fatty acids in bile. The for
gotten experiments of Marcet, mentioned above, led us to think that
 the fatty acids might possess, at the temperature of the body, a fair
amount of solubility in bile, and as the solubility at this temperature
 is that of most physiological interest, we have made a series of deter
 minations of the solubilities of oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids, and
of natural mixtures of these in the proportions in which they occur
 in lard, beef suet, and mutton suet, in the bile of the ox, pig, and
dog.
     Different methods were used in the determination                   of these solu
 bilities :   —
     1. To a measured amount of the bile under experiment, kept at a
temperature of 39° C, small weighed quantities of the fatty acid
under experiment were added, until no more dissolved.
    2. A quantity of bile was saturated at 39° C, with excess of the
 fatty acid, and filtered from the excess of undissolved acid through a

    The fatty acids are not dissolved as soaps, but probably as fatty
acids, for the solution becomes strongly acid ; moreover, the material
thrown out on cooling dissolves easily in ether, and, when recovered,
saponifies at once with sodium carbonate.                       The solution is not
entirely due to the bile salts, for mere removal of the " bile mucin

    Palmitic and stearic acids are very feebly soluble in bile at 39° C,
and in mixtures are probably dissolved by the aid of the admixed
oleic acid.
                  Action of Filtered Intestinal Contents on Fats.
    The filtered intestinal contents contain both pancreatic juice and
bile, and hence should both decompose and dissolve fats at body
temperature if these are absorbed as dissolved fatty acids ; this
was experimentally found to be the case with filtered intestinal con
tents of the dog, which in different cases possessed a very variable

The Eolation becomes viscid, semi-fluid, or completely solid on cooling,
and rcdissolves on warming again.              With the filtered contents of the
intestine of the pig and rabbit similar results were not obtained, bat
the fat became altered, being in part converted into fatty acids, and
in part giving rise to a voluminous precipitate.
                Simultaneous Action of Pancreas and Bile           on  Fats.
     Finely minced, fresh dog's pancreas (1 gram) was added to bile
 CIO   c.c), and then the fat of beef suet (0*25 gram) ; the fat com
pletely dissolved in three hours at 40° C. ; on cooling, the solution
became turbid, and finally semi-solid.                 In a control experiment,
pancreas alone decomposed fat into fatty acids, but did not dissolve it.
     The solubilities stated above are quite sufficient to account for the
removal of all the fat of the food from the intestine as dissolved fatty
acid, since they exceed the concentrations found in the intestine of
other materials, such as sugars and albumoses, which are removed
in solution.         Other experiments, however, on the reaction of the
intestine during fat absorption, lead us to think that all the fat is not
removed as dissolved fatty acids, but that these are replaced to a
variable extent (in some animals, to a very large extent or completely)
by dissolved soaps.
             lleaction of Intestinal Contents during Fat Absorption.
    We have determined the reaction of the contents of the dog's
small intestine during fat absorption, from pylorns to csecum, to
various indicators, litmus, methyl-orange, and phenolphthalein, and
cannot agree with the statement of some other experimenters, that it
is acid throughout.*          In sixteen experiments on this animal we only
once found the reaction acid to litmus up to the crecum, and this was
an obviously poor experiment, in which the intestine was almost
empty.         The reaction to litmus at the pylorus is neutral, faintly acid,
or faintly alkaline ; from here onwards the acidity increases, reaches
;t maximum          about the middle of the small intestine, and then
becomes less acid, to change to alkaline at a point situate two-thirds
to three-fourths of the way along the intestine ; from this point on
to the csecum the alkalinity increases.             f    The reaction to methyl-
 orange and phenolphthalein explains this ; the intestine is alkaline to
methyl-orange all the way from pylorus to caecum, and equally com-

    t  There is usually a reversion to an acid reaction in the large intestine, in which
ciase  the contents of the ciecum are almost neutral.

        Condition in which Fats are absorbed from the Intestine.                  441
pletely acid to phenolphthalein,         showing that   the acid reaction   to litmus
in the upper part is due to weak organic adds, while the alkaline reaction
in the lower is due to fixed alkali, accompanied by dissolved carbonic
acid.   The alkaline reaction to methyl-orange in the upper part, where
it is acid to litmus and phenolphthaleln, shows that in that part there
is an excess of bases, above that quantity necessary to combine with all
the inorganic acids, which are combined with very weak organic acids
 (probably fatty acids), for methyl-orange is a stable indicator, and
does not react to such acids, while litmus, and, still more so, phenol-
phthalei'n, are indicators which are affected by these acids. In the
lower third or thereabouts, where the reaction is alkaline to litmus,
there cannot be any fatty acids present in solution.
   Any fat absorbed as free fatty acid in solution must, therefore, be
taken up from the upper two-thirds or three-fpurths of the intestine
 where the reaction is acid to litmus, but even here a considerable part
is probably being absorbed in solution as soaps, as is shown by the
 reaction being at the same time alkaline to methyl-orange.                    In the
 lower part all the fat absorbed must be taken up as soaps.
    During fat absorption in the white rat,^ , the reaction of the con
tents of the small intestine is commonly .alkaline to litmns from
pylorus to crecum, and is never acid for a greater distance than 2 or
3 in. below the pylorus ; in. this animal, therefore, nearly all the fat
must be absorbed in solution as soaps.
    We have not investigated the reaction of the intestinal contents
 in other animals during fat absorption, but in the rabbit, during
 carbohydrate absorption, it is strongly alkaline all the way, from
 pylorus to ciecuin, and in the pig the mixed contents during the
absorption of a mixed meal (meal and oats) had a strong alkaline
reaction. As already stated, the filtered contents in these animals do
not perfectly dissolve fat, and the portion dissolved must be in the
form of soap, because the reaction remains alkaline to litmus after
solution.     In such animals it is probable that the greater part of
the fat must be absorbed as soaps.
    The main objections which have been urged' against absorption of
fats as soaps are, first, absorption in presence of an acid reaction in
the dog, in which case it was supposed impossible that soaps could
 be present simultaneously           in solution,t and, secondly, that the
   * In this animal  the intestinal contents are usually semi-solid.   Care was taken
to mix them so as not to obtain the alkaline surface reaction sometimes described.
On thorough mixing an alkaline reaction was obtained.
   f The acid reaction is also commonly supposed to preclude the possibility of the
formation of an emulsion, and Cash ('Arch. f. Anat. u. Physiol.,' 1881, p. 386), in
experiments chiefly made to determine this point, failed-to find any emulsion within
the dog's intestine.   In ten out of sixteen experiments we obtained more or less
emulsion, and in fire of these, in almost the entire length, a perfect emulsion, con
taining immense numbers of minutest fat globules, and possessing a marked acid
                                                                       2  l  2

 442           Prof*. Ramsay and Mr. Travers.             The Gaseous
 amount of alkali required in the intestine for the absorption of all
  the fats of a fatty meal, as soaps, is out of all proportion to the
  amount actually present, being about twice the total alkalinity of the
 body.*      The first objection has already been discussed ; it has been
  shown that the acid reaction is due to weak organic acids, and that
 an alkaline reaction can be obtained by the use of a proper indicator,
 due to a compound of these weak acids with bases ; in other words,
  to soaps.
      The second objection may be met by the supposition that the same
 quantity of alkali acts cyclically as a carrier in conveying quantity
 after quantity of fatty radicle, as soap, from the intestine.                   The
  soaps   are,  it is known,   broken up    in  the  intestinal  cells, and formed
  into fats by the action of the cell ; in such a reaction alkali is set free,
 and there is no obvious reason why it should not be returned to the
 intestine and serve to carry a fresh portion of fatty radicle dissolved
 as soap into the epithelial cells.        Such an action takes place in the
 acid secreting cell of the gastric gland, where sodium chloride is
 taken up from the blood, split into acid and alkali, and the alkali
 returned to the blood while the acid passes into the gland lumen ; it
 is not, therefore, unreasonable to suppose that a similar action can
 take place in the intestinal absorbing cell.
      We conclude that in certain animals, such as the dog, fats are absorbed
partially as dissolved fatty acids, and partially as dissolved soaps ; while
 in other animals, such as the white rat, fats are chiefly, if not entirely,
 absorbed as dissolved soaps.
" The Gaseous Constituents of certain Mineral Substances and

     It is still nncertain whether helium is a single elementary gas or a
mixture of two or more gases.            If a mixture, it is probable that they
should occur independently, and that the proportion of the con
stituent gases should vary in samples from different sources. During
the past year the gases obtained from a large number of minerals and
natural waters have been examined with a view to investigate this
point, and, also, to determine whether any new gaseous element could
be discovered.        In every instance the results have been negative; no
reaction to litmus.    Although fats are not absorbed in the form of an emulsion, it
is evident that the formation of an emulsion in the intestine must enormously
increase the surface exposed to the action of the intestinal fluids, and proportion
ately increase the rate at which the fats are decomposed and dissolved.

             Method of Examination of the Mineral Substance.
    The mineral was ground to fine powder in an agate mortar, and
then mixed with about twice its weight of acid potassium sulphate.
This mixture was placed in a hard glass tube, which was connected
with a Topler pump, and, after exhaustion, heated to a red heat by
means of a large Bunsen burner.          The gases evolved were pumped
off and collected over mercury in        a   tube containing a little caustic
potash solution.     In some instances, however, the mineral was heated
alone ; the same result was obtained, but the evolution of gas takes
place rather more slowly.        In order to diminish any chance of leak
age of air into the apparatus, the hard glass tube was connected with
the pump in the manner shown in fig. 1.                The tube was drawn
out to a neck    at the  point  A.   A  piece  of thick-walled  rubber tube
was fitted over the end of the tube B connected with the pump, and
it was then forced tightly into the neck of the hard glass tube. By
pouring a little mercury into the cup C the joint could be made
absolutely air-tight.
                    Examination of Minerals and Rocks.
    Several samples of fergusonite, monazite, and samarskite were
first examined, and were found to give quantities of helium up to
 1*5 c.c. per gram.
    Columbite (a variety of tantalite), an isomorphous mixture of
niobate and tantalate of iron and manganese, gave 1"3 c.c. of gas con
sisting chiefly of helium.
    Pitchblende, containing zirconium, obtained by Dr. Hillebrand from
 Colorado, gave 0 36 c.c. of gas per gram, of which 0-3 c.c. was
helium.     Another sample gave 0 27 c.c. of helium per gram.

444         Prof. Ramsay and Mr. Travers.               The Gaseous
    Malacone, ZrS04, from Hitteroe in Norway, was the only mineral
 in which argon was found. Five grams of the mineral gave 12 c.c.
 of gas nnabsorhed by caustic soda. After explosion with oxygen,
 and absorption of the residual oxygen with phosphorus, about 0*1 c.c.
 of gas remained.      The residue was introduced into a tube with
 aluminium electrodes which was sealed off from the pump and
 attached to a coil giving a discharge sufficiently powerful to heat
the electrodes to a red heat. The nitrogen was quickly absorbed by
the red-hot electrodes, and, as soon as the banded spectrum had dis
appeared, the lines of helium and argon became visible.              The green
line of the helium spectrum was very strong, and the glow in the
tube was distinctly green.
   The argon present was in too large quantity to be attributed to
accidental leakage of air into the apparatus ; but, in order to confirm
this exceptional result, and also to determine whether the green effect
in the tube was due entirely to the low pressure of the helium, the
experiment was repeated with a larger quantity of the mineral.
With 10 grams of the mineral a quantity of gas was obtained,
which, after removal of nitrogen, gave a yellow glow in the vacuum-
tube ; argon was again present, and its second spectrum could be
brought out very strongly by means of a jar and a spark-gap in the
secondary circuit. The experiment was repeated a third time with
the same result.     This proved conclusively that malacone contains
both argon and helium.

     The gases from these meteorites were exploded with oxygen, and
 were found to contain no trace either of argon or helium, or of
 nitrogen.     The carbon compounds present were possibly produced
 by the decomposition of the oil, &c, with which the shavings of
 meteoric iron had become contaminated.

446          Prof. Ramsay and Mr. Travers.         The Gaseous
at Cauterets, which he has found to contain a considerable quantity
of a mixture of argon and helium.       He appears to have made a rough
spectroscopic examination of the gases, and has stated in his paper
that some of the lines in the red end of the spectrum do not belong
to the spectrum either of argon or of helium. The author, a medical
man, has dealt with the matter from a purely clinical standpoint, and
his paper contains no data with regard to the supposed new lines.
   To obtain samples of these gases, it was necessary to make a journey
to Cauterets, and to visit the wells personally.      Taking advantage of
the Easter holidays, we left England provided with twelve tin cylin
ders, each with a capacity of 2 litres, for the purpose of collecting
samples of gas from as many of the wells as we could obtain admis
sion to. The management of the baths and wells granted us permis
sion to visit the actual sources from which the baths, &c, are supplied,
and courteously gave us every assistance, placing at our disposal the
services of men connected with the different establishments.                  We
were able to obtain samples of gas from four of the springs close to
the town, but, on account of the deep snow, some of the more distant
" sources " were quite inaccessible. The " sources " are for the most
part situated at the end of tunnels driven for some distance into the
hill-side. The water rises from below into tanks beneath the floor of
the tunnels, and is conducted through pipes to the baths. Circular
holes, about 9 inches diameter, in the floor formed the only means of
inspecting the interior of the tanks.        The gas appeared to rise with
the water from natural springs in the bottom of the tanks ; it was
this gas that we collected for our investigation.            The apparatus
employed is shown in the accompanying figure.             A piece of rubber
tube B is fitted on to the lower tap of the cylinder A, which was
then sucked full of water.       The taps were then closed, and the cylin
der fixed in a vertical position, the rubber tube hanging down into
the tank. A second piece of rubber tube, C, was fitted on to the
funnel D, which was lowered into the tank. Water was then drawn
up into the rubber tube, which was immediately slipped over the
nozzle of the upper tap on the tin cylinder.           The taps were then
opened,     and  the funnel   brought  over  some point   on the floor of the
tank, from which gas was escaping. The gas rising iuto the funnel
 rapidly replaced the water in the cylinder which escaped back into
 the tank by the lower tube. In some of the wells a largo quantity of
 gas could be collected in a short time, but in others the bubbles rose
 only very slowly.

   We proceeded with the examination of the gases immediately on
our return to London.       The gases were transferred to a glass gas
holder containing potash solution, and circulated over red-hot mag
nesium and copper oxide. The residual gas was pumped out of the
circulating apparatus, and sparked with oxygen over potash to
remove final traces of nitrogen.

   Espagnol. — Argon, with helium ; the yellow and green helium lines
very distinct, with jar and spark-gap.
   Ctesar. — Argon, with a little helium.
   The tubes were carefully compared with normal argon and helium
 tubes, but no new lines could be detected.
    An attempt was made to separate the gas into its constituents by
 taking advantage of their relative solubilities.   A measured quantity

    The residue showed the helium lines rather more strongly.
    The Des CEufs gas was submitted to fractional diffusion by the
method described in the following paper.
    The gas was divided into two portions by diffusion through a
porons plug.     These two fractions were then diffused separately, the
 light fraction of the heavy gas, and the heavy fraction of the light
gas forming an intermediate fraction.        This was again separated by
diffusion into a heavy and a light portion, which were mixed with the
heavy and light fraction obtained in the second stage.         The process
was repeated four times, and the resulting fractions, after sparking
with a little oxygen, were rediffused so as to obtain the lightest sixth
 of the light fraction, and the heaviest sixth of the heavy fraction.
    In a Pliicker tube, the helium line, D3, appeared somewhat stronger
in the light gas, but the difference was not so marked as might have
been expected.      Neither of the tubes showed any lines other than
those of the argon or helium spectrum.
    The other samples of gas were not submitted to the diffusion pro
 cess, as it did not seem probable that any results of value would be
obtained.
    In another paper it is shown that separation of helium from argon
can be effected by taking advantage of the absorption of that gas by
 the platinum splashed on to the walls of the tube during the passage
 of the discharge.      The gas is made to circulate at about 3 mm.
 pressure through a vacuum-tube with platinum electrodes, and kept
 cool by a water-jacket.    The helium, together with any nitrogen or
carbon compounds that may be present, is absorbed by the platinum,
 and may be liberated by heating the tube with a Bnnsen's burner.
 The heavier fraction of the Des CEufs gas, and some of the gas from
 the Raillere were treated by this process, and the gas liberated from
 the platinum on heating was in each case introduced into a vacuum-
 tube with aluminium electrodes. The tube showed a banded spectrum
 which disappeared as the nitrogen was absorbed by the heated
 aluminium, leaving only normal helium at low pressure and a trace
 of argon. If any other gas, other than argon and helium, be present
 in the residue from the gas evolved from these various springs, after
 removal of the nitrogen, the methods employed have totally failed to
 bring it to light so far.      It certainly cannot be present in any
 measurable quantity.

 "  Some Experiments on Helium."                   By MORRIS W. Travers,
       B.Sc.     Communicated by Professor W. Ramsay, F.R.S.
       Received December 30, 1896,— Read February 4, 1897.
    In July  of last year Professors      Runge and Paschen (' Phil Mag.,'
 1895, [ii], vol. 40, pp. 297 — 302)      announced their discovery that the
spectrum of the gas from cleveite         indicated the presence of two ele
ments.     They also stated that by      means of a single diffusion through
an asbestos plug, they had been able to effect a partial separation of
the lighter constituent, which was characterised by the green glow
which it gave under the influence of the electric discharge in a
vacuum-tube, and which was represented in the spectrum by the
series containing the green line, X = 5015"6.            Subsequently, at the
meeting of the British Association at Ipswich, Professor Runge
exhibited a tube containing the so-called green constituent; the
colour of the glow differed strongly from that of an ordinary helium
tube, but the gas contained in it was evidently at very low pressure,
as phosphorescence was just commencing.                Professor Runge has
since acknowledged that the green effect in the helium tube may be
produced by a change of pressure alone (' Astrophysical Journal,'
January, 1896).
   During an exhibition of the spectrum of helium at the soiree of
the Royal Society on May 9, 1895, it was noticed that one of the
Plucker tubes which had been running for nearly three hours, had
become strongly phosphorescent.            The tube was fitted with platinum
electrodes, and the helium had apparently been absorbed by the
platinum sparked on to the walls of the tube. We observed the same
phenomena to take place on several subsequent occasions, but only in
the case of tubes with platinum electrodes.*
   Now, if helium is not a single gas, it must consist of a mixture of
two or more monatomic gases, capable of mechanical separation, and
it is possible that one of its constituents might be absorbed by the
platinum faster than the other. At the end of September, 1895,              I
commenced some experimental work on this subject, with the view
of separating the two or more possible constituents from one another.
The results were negative.
   I  employed in these experiments a piece of apparatus figured
below (fig. 1).
   A large Plucker tube, bent into a U"snaPe> nas *wo side-tubes, A
and B. The electrodes are of platinum, and project far into the
tube ; the straight parts, which are of thick wire, and about 30 mm.
   * So far as I know, this phenomenon was first recorded by Professor Norman
Lockyer ('Roy. Soc. Proc.,' 1895, vol. 58, p. 193).

450                        Mr. W. Travers.
                                 Fio. l.
long, are protected by a sheath of thin glass tube, the spirals at their
ends being of thin platinum wire.     The side-tube A is connected, by
means of a tube containing pentoxide of phosphorus, with an appa
ratus for the introduction of gases into vacuum-tubes (' Trans. Chem.
Soc.,' 1895, p. 686). The tube B is connected with a tap on the Top-
ler's pump.     The apparatus was first thoroughly exhausted and
heated by a Bunsen's flame, and then, after closing the tap on B,
helium was introduced at about 3 mm. pressure. The electrodes
were connected with the secondary terminal of a coil, and the cur
rent was turned on, making a the cathode. A deposit of platinum
quickly appeared on the walls of the tube round a, and the following
changes took place in the colour of the glow : —
   1. Yellow, with slight tinge of red.
   2. Bright yellow.
   3. Yellowish-green.
   4. Green ; green line very strong.
   5. Green, with phosphorescence.
   6. Phosphorescent   vacuum  ; spark passed between electrodes out
        side the tube.
The tube was then connected with the pump by opening the tap on
B, but, as might have been expected, no trace of gas could be re
moved. The tap was again closed, and the tube was warmed care
fully with a Bunsen's burner.     The gas was slowly given off from
the platinum, and on passing the discharge, colour- changes were
 observed to take place in the glow, from green to yellow.
   From this experiment, it was obvious that the whole of the helium
would be absorbed by the platinum splashed off, but it yet remained

                      Some  Experiments on Helium.                   451
to be proved that the change in colour in the glow was not due to
the absorption of the yellow constituent more quickly than the green
one.
    The vacuum-tube used in the last experiment was again filled with
helium to about 3 mm. pressure, and the discharge was passed till
the glow had become green, and the green line had reached its maxi
mum intensity.      Now, if any separation had taken place, the gas
which had been absorbed by the platinum should contain a large pro
portion of the yellow constituent of helium, and should give a yellow
glow in a vacuum-tube, even at low pressure. The remaining gas in
the tube was, therefore, removed by pumping, and after closing the
tap on B, the gas was driven off from the platinum, by warming with
a Bnnsen's flame. The current was then turned on, and a glow
appeared of the green colour invariably shown by helium at low
pressure.    The change of colour in the tube during absorption of the
 helium is, therefore, to be entirely attributed to the lowering of the
 pressure.   In describing these experiments      I  have used the term
 absorption  in its general sense, as it is impossible to say at present
 whether we are dealing with a case of simple occlusion or not. The
platinum, when it is deposited, is black and non-metallic in appear
 ance, but, on heating, it assumes the colour and general character of
 ordinary platinum, and sometimes breaks away from the tube in thin
 scales. The change is probably the same as that which takes place
 when platinum-black is heated.
    In a few of my experiments,     I used helium containing traces of
 hydrogen, nitrogen,   and  carbon  compounds.    In these cases I fonnd
 that not only was the helium absorbed, but also the other gases, to a
 greater or less extent. Hydrogen is readily absorbed, and next in
 order come carbon compounds and nitrogen.        Argon is taken up only
 in very small quantity ; in fact, this process serves as a method of
 separation of helium froin argon, oven when the helium is present to
 the amount of only 2 per cent.
    To carry out this separation, the gas is made to circulate at about
 3 mm. pressure, through a vacuum-tube of the type used in the last
 experiment. To effect this, the Topler's pump is replaced by a Spren-
 gel's pump, arranged as shown in fig 2, to deliver the gas removed
 from the vacuum-tube back into the tube C. To regulate the supply
 of gas entering the apparatus, the tap F was carefully turned, till the
 gas bubbled slowly through the mercury contained in the small tube
D. The tap E served as a by-pass during the preliminary pnmping-
out of the apparatus, and was closed daring the experiment.           By
 carefully regulating the quantity of gas which entered the apparatus,
 and the rate of flow of mercury in the Sprengel's pump, it was
 possible to maintain a constant pressure in the apparatus for a long
 time.

                                Fig.  2.
   To facilitate the absorption of the gases during the experiment,
the vacuum-tube was kept cool by a water-jacket, G, closed at the
bottom by a cork fitting tightly round the tube.         When it was
necessary to heat  the vacuum-tube,  the jacket could be loosened from
the cork, and slipped up the side-tube B, which was bent round, and
extended vertically for about 10 inches in a straight line with the
vacuum-tube.
   The gas was made to circulate for about six hours, and at the end
of that time the tap F was closed, the tap E was opened, and the
apparatus thoroughly exhausted. The jacket G was then raised, and
the gas expelled from the platinum by heat was pumped off. From
mixtures containing very little helium, a small quantity of that gas
was separated, mixed with a trace of argon.

       On the Gases enclosed in Crystalline Rocks and Minerals.                          453
    Kayser and Friedlander (' Chem. Zeitung,' vol. 9, p. 1529) have
stated that in a vacuum-tube fitted with platinum electrodes, and.
containing atmospheric argon, the argon became absorbed by the
 deposited platinum, and the tube then showed certain of the helium
lines.    I  have never been able to absorb argon to more than the very
                                     I
 slightest extent, and though have often had argon-tubes, which have
 become black, owing to the deposition of platinum, through which a
 powerful discharge has passed for many hours,                      I have never noticed
any marked absorption.
    A specimen of argon, the lightest fraction obtained from Professor
 Ramsay's diffusion experiments, was treated in the manner just
 described. After several hours' circulation it was found that the gas
 absorbed by the platinum consisted only of argon, and no trace of
 helium could be detected. This process has also been applied to the
analysis of the gases from certain mineral springs ; the results of
 these experiments form the subject of another paper.
 "On the Gases enclosed in Crystalline Rocks and Minerals."
       By W. A. Tilden, D.Sc, F.R.S. Received December 19,
       1896,— Read February 4, 1897.
    It has long been     known* that many crystallised minerals contain gas
enclosed     in    cavities  in which drops of liquid are also frequently
visible.     The liquid often consists of water and aqueous solutions,
occasionally of hydrocarbons, and not unfrequently of carbon dioxide,
the latter being recognisable by the peculiarities of its behaviour
 under the application of heat. The liquid supposed to be carbon
dioxide has been found in some cases to pass from the liquid to the
gaseous state, and therefore to disappear, and to return from gas to
liquid at temperatures lower by two or three degrees than the critical
point of carbon dioxide. This seems to indicate the presence of some
incondensable gas, and as H. Davy found nitrogen in the fluid cavities
of quartz, it seemed probable that the alteration of the critical point
was due to that gas.
    My attention was drawn to this subject by the observation that
Peterhead granite, when heated in a vacuum, gives off several times
its volume of gas, consisting, to the extent of three-fourths                          of its
volume, of hydrogen (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 59, p. 218).

454           Dr. W. A. Tilden.       On the Gases enclosed
   Since  this observation, I find that the presence of hydrogen in
crystalline rocks has been recognised by other observers, notably by
A. W. Wright (' Amer. J. Sci.,' Ser. 3, vol. 12, p. 171). In the coarse
of a study of the gases from meteorites, Wright obtained from a
certain " trap
                " rock, the origin and character of which is not stated,
at a low red-heat, " about three-fourths of its volume of mixed
gases, which were found to contain about 13 per cent, of carbon
dioxide, the residue being chiefly hydrogen.       Another specimen of
trap containing small nodules of aDorthite was examined at the
request of Mr. G. W. Hawes, who had observed gas cavities in a
thin section of the mineral prepared for microscopic examination.
This gave off somewhat more than its own volume of gas, which was
found to contain some 24 per cent, of carbon dioxide."
   Professor Dewar and Mr. Ansdell have also examined one or two
rocks in the course of their researches on meteorites (' Boy. Inst. Proc.,'
1886). They found that both gneiss and felspar, containing graphite,
yield gas, which, upon analysis, was found to have the composition
stated below.

   Dewar and Ansdell remark that " the small quantity of marsh gas,
no doubt, comes from the disseminated graphite, but the presence of
the hydrogen is more difficnlt to explain, and requires further inves
tigation."
   I  have lately been following up this question, and have obtained
results which present some points of considerable interest.            For
materials   I have been indebted chiefly to my colleague, Professor
Judd, who has also supplied information as to the probable geological
age of the specimens of rocks and minerals tested. All that         I have
examined yield permanent gas when heated in a vacuum.            This gas
varies in amount from a volume about equal to that of the rock or
mineral to about eighteen times that volume. It usually consists of
 hydrogen in mnch larger proportion than that found by the observers
just quoted, together with carbon dioxide and smaller quantities of
 carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons.            Every specimen has been
 examined by the spectroscope for helium, but in no case could Ds be
 recognised, or any other line which would lead to a suspicion of the
 presence of this substance.      The gas is very frequently, but not
 always, accompanied by water in notable quantities.
    The gas is apparently wholly enclosed in cavities which are visible
 in thin sections of the rock when viewed nnder the microscope, but
 as they are extremely minute, very little gaB is lost when the rock is

                     in Crystalline Rocks and Minerals.                     455
reduced to coarse powder, and as a result of experiment in one or two
cases,  I  find that practically the same amount of gas is evolved on
heating the rock whether it is used in small lumps or in powder.
In the first series of experiments undertaken with the object of a
rapid survey of the materials, the gases were not completely analysed.
They were collected, measured, the carbon dioxide removed hy potash,
and the residue examined by the spectroscope.         When ignited in the
air it always burned with a pale flame resembling that of hydrogen.
   The table (p. 456) shows the results of these experiments.
   A selection of these was then subjected to more carefnl and exact
analysis. For this purpose fresh masses of the rock were taken,
and the gas extracted in the usual way. The following are the
results : —

   To account for the large proportion of hydrogen and carbonic oxide
in these gases, it is only necessary to suppose that the rock enclosing
them was crystallised in an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide and
steam which had been, or were at the same time, in contact with
some easily oxidisable substance, at a moderately high temperature.
Of the substances capable of so acting, carbon, a metal, or a
protoxide of a metal, present themselves as the most probable.
   The reduction of carbon dioxide or of water vapour by carbon
gives rise to the formation of carbon monoxide, and if carbon had
been the agent the proportion of this gas in the mixture must have
been greater than is found to be the case.            It is, of course, well
known that carbon dioxide and water vapour are both dissociated at
moderately high temperatures, but the greater part of the liberated
oxygen recombines at lower temperatures, though a small portion
may remain free in the presence of a large quantity of an indifferent
gas or vapour.        No free oxygen has been found in any of the gases
analysed.
   Direct experiments, made with ferrous oxide (obtained by gently
heating pure chalybite) and with magnetic oxide of iron, show that
while the former, at a red-heat, decomposes both steam and carbon
dioxide quite freely, liberating hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and
 becoming    itself oxidised into magnetic oxide ; the latter has no action

                                             it
the reactions indicated in the equations just given are reversible, and
therefore the presence of metallic iron along with the magnetic oxide
in such rocks cannot be taken by itself as final proof that the oxide
and the associated gases, hydrogen and carbonic oxide, are the pro
ducts of the action of steam and carbon dioxide upon metallic iron.
The presence of marsh gas in these rocks and the production of large
quantities of hydroearbonous gases, as well as liquid petroleum, in
many parts of the earth's surface, tend to support the view, which       is
apparently gaining ground, that in the interior of the earth's crust
there are large masses, not only of metal but of compounds of metals,
such as iron and manganese, with carbon. Assuming the existence of
such material,     it easy to conceive how, by the action of water at an
                        is
elevated temperature,      may give rise to metallic oxides and mixtures
                             it
of hydrogen with paraftinoid and other hydrocarbons.       This view was
put forward some years ago by MendelejefF          Principles of Chemis

arc unquestionably the most complete ever constructed for an earth
quake-disturbed country.
    The discussion is really a working out of certain lines suggested in
a paper on " Earthquake Frequency," communicated by me in May,
1885, to the Seismological Society of Japan, and published in vol. 9
of the ' Transactions of that Society.
                        '
                                                              I
                                              In that paper pointed out
the importance of subjecting earthquake statistics to some strict
form of mathematical analysis, and gave a simple arithmetical
process for separating the annual and semi-annual periods in earth
quake frequency.       The results then obtained have been fully corro
borated by Dr. C. Davison in his paper " On the Annual and Semi
                            "
annual Seismic Periods        (' Phil. Trans.,' vol. 184, 1893) ; and my
suggestion that the annual period is connected with barometric
pressure is also strongly supported by Dr. Ferd. Seidl in his pam
        '
phlet Die Beziehungen zwischen Erdbeben und Atmospharischen
                '
Bewegungen (Laibach, 1895). The semi-annual period, which was
first clearly brought into evidence in my earlier paper, does not
admit of a very ready explanation.
   In my paper of 1885 I also considered in some detail the various
tidal actions which might reasonably be supposed to have a determin
ing influence on earthquake frequency. From lack of material it
was not possible at that time to make a satisfactory search for
lunar periodicities ; but the remarkable fulness of information con
tained in Professor Milne's latest catalogues tempted me to under
take the labour involved in (first) tabulating the statistics in terms
of lunar periods, and (second) analysing harmonically the tables so
 prepared.
    2. The  Lunar Daily and Half-daily Periods — In one of the cata
logues the earthquakes are classed according to district.          Districts
1 to 6 lie on the N.E. and E. coasts of Japan, reckoning          from the
north; districts 6 to 11 on the S. coast; and 12 to 15 on the W.
coast.    Districts 6 and 7 are the most important, the former being
the region including Tokyo and Yokohama, and the latter the region
including Nagoya, which was the scene of the destructive earthquake
of October 28, 1891. The investigation into a possible lunar daily
period is conveniently based upon this classification into districts.
Had that not been done by Professor Milne the labour involved in
taking into account differences in local time would have been
enormous ; for, to compare the time of occurrence of a recorded
earthquake with the immediately preceding meridian passage of the
moon, it was necessary to apply corrections for longitude and local
 time.
    The statistics for each district were, in the first instance, separated
out and tabulated according to time of occurrence, estimated in hours
after the immediately preceding passage of the moon. The method

 is explained in full in the paper. To lighten in some measure the
 labour of the harmonic analysis, certain districts were thrown
 together to form a district gronp.            Table    I  contains the number of
earthquakes      in  each district    or    district    group, which formed the
 material for discussion.

    Of the tabulated numbers for each district or district group, over
lapping means of every successive five were taken, and these were
divided by the mean of all. The numbers so obtained represent
relative frequencies throughout the lunar day, and are given in
Table II, which also contains a like series for all the earthquakes,
taken in combination.
    The most important are the frequencies for districts 6 and 7, and
also for all combined. They are shown graphically in the figure
 (p. 461).
    Each series of numbers was then discussed by harmonic analysis in
accordance with the Fourier expansion

where x is 1000 times the relative frequency at time t, estimated
in hours after the meridian passage of the moon, and where the
amplitude c* and the phase a* are to be calculated.                     The amplitudes
and phases   for   the first four  harmonics       are  given in Table IV.
   There is a tendency for the second harmonic amplitude to be
greater than the first, while in half the number it is the greatest of
all.   As regards the times of occurrence of the maxima for the
different harmonics, there is no regularity except perhaps in the case
of the second harmonic.           In four (1, 6, 7, 8) the maximum of the
second harmonic falls within two hours of the half time between the
upper and lower meridian passage of the moon.                   In the others it falls
within two hours of the times of upper and lower meridian passage.

   A   comparison of these times with the times of high water in the
various districts failed to establish any relation.               We are forced to
the conclusion that if there be any lunar-diurnal periodicity imposed
npon earthquake frequency, it is the result of tidal stresses acting
directly on the approximately rigid crust of the earth, and not
indirectly through the loading due to the ocean tides.
    Because of the comparatively great number of earthquakes the
results for districts 6 and 7 are the most important.                 During the
eight years under discussion, the shocks in district 6 occurred with
normal frequency.         All were comparatively small ; none were disas
trous.      On the other hand, the case of district 7 is altogether
peculiar. In general, this is a comparatively quiet district ; but the
great disaster of October 28, 1891, was followed by a vast number of
after-shocks.      These show distinct daily and half-daily periodicities,
the latter having the greater amplitude.              Thus, from district. 6, with
its 1432 earthquakes        distributed     with    fair  uniformity over eight
years    of normal   activity,   and   from     district  7 with its 3(532 earth
quakes, almost wholly included in a short fierce interval of fourteen
months, we obtain very similar evidence as to the existence of a
lunar half-daily period in earthquake frequency.
   The resnlts for
                      " All " depend, in the main, upon the statistics for
districts 6 and 7. The curious way in which the comparatively
prominent 1st harmonics of these two districts tend to cancel one
another, is a warning of the danger of lumping together statistics of
different countries or different seismic areas in the search for possible
periodicities.
   3. The   Lunar Monthly and Fortnightly Periodicities. — There are five
distinct kinds of months recognised by astronomers, namely             : —

           On  Lunar Periodicities in Earthquake Frequency.             463
                 (1) The anomalistic month (27-545 days).
                 (2) The tropical month (27"322 days).
                 (3) The synodic month (29-531 days).
                 (4) The sidereal month (27 3228 days).
                 (5) The nodical month (27-212 days).
   Of   these,   the  last   two   cannot   be  regarded as having any
inflaence on earthquake frequency, for the only conceivable effect
is a tidal one, and the sidereal and nodical months have no necessary
tidal relations. At the same time the periods of the sidereal and tropical
months are so nearly the same that they can hardly be discriminated
in the lapse of eight years. On the other hand, the anomalistic
month may show itself in earthquake frequency, since the moon in
perigee has a greater tidal action than when it is in apogee.
Again, because of the moon's variation in declination, being now
north of the Equator, now south, we may reasonably search for a
tropical monthly periodicity.       And, finally, the synodic or common
month may make itself apparent, there being possibly a gi'eater tidal
stress when the moon is in syzygy (as in ordinary spring tides)
than when the moon is in quadrature (as in neap tides).
   The earthquakes were accordingly tabulated according to these
four months, whose periods differ appreciably ; the nodical month
being also included.       For, by analysing the statistics in terms of
both the tropical and nodical months, we may be the better able to
draw conclusions as to the real existence of one or other periodicity.
The relative daily frequencies, as finally reduced, are given in
Table VI, and the curves are shown in the figure.
   As in the case of Table II, each of the tabulated numbers is the
mean of five successive numbers, and is regarded as belonging to the
time of the middle one of these five.
   It should be mentioned — and the remark applies also to the former
cases — that the number of earthquakes which really occurred during
the last time interval was increased in the proper ratio ; so that the
frequency during this last interval was made comparable with the
frequencies of the other intervals.       It was interesting to find how
admirably    the  number   so obtained harmonised    with its neighbours of
the first and penultimate interval.
   In all cases the obvious aftershocks of any earthquake occurring
on the same day were neglected.        The 3000 aftershocks of the great
disaster of October 28, 1891, were also left out.
   The earthquakes on which the discussion is based numbered
from 4725 to 4741, the number varying slightly for each monthly
period, since, at the beginning and end of the eight years' interval,
there were always a few, differing for the different months, which did
not make up a complete period, and were, consequently, neglected.
   Each series of numbers was analysed harmonically as far as the

            On  Lunar Periodtcitie^Cn Earthquake Frequency.           465
The most important of these is the faofc Aha* -"the nodical month,
which has no direct connexion with tidal stress periodicity, is
characterised by harmonic amplitudes greater, on the average, than
those corresponding to the other months.             This is particularly
evident in the graphs.
     There are, however, other features which favour the hypothesis of
seismic tidal stress, such as the occurrence in the vicinity of perigee
of the Anomalistic 1st Harmonic amplitude ; the lagging, by one
day, behind full and new moon of the Synodic 2nd Harmonic maxima ;
the distinctly greater amplitude of the Synodic 2nd Harmonic as
compared with those of the other harmonics — a fact which is in
accord with the fortnightly succession of spring tides.
   It is, certainly, a striking fact that the same statistics which, when
grouped according to an approximately twenty-eight days' period, give
a prominent 1st harmonic should, when grouped according to an
approximately thirty days' period, give a comparatively small 1st
harmonic but a prominent 2nd harmonic.
   4. General Conclusions. — The conclusions are summarised under
eight heads.
   (a) There is evidence that the earthquake frequency in Japan is
           subject to a periodicity associated with the lunar day.
   (6) The lunar half-daily period is particularly in evidence, both by
           reason of its relative prominence and the regularity with
           which, in each of two groups of the several seismic districts,
           its phase falls in relation to the time of meridian passage of
            the moon.
   (c) There is no certain evidence that the loading and unloading
           due to the flow and ebb of ocean tides have any effect on
           seismic frequency.
   (if) Hence we must look to the direct tidal stress of the moon, in
           its daily change, as the most probable cause of a range in
           frequency which does not exceed 6 per cent, of the average
           frequency.
   (e)  There    is distinct  evidence, both   as regards amplitude and
           phase, of a fortnightly periodicity associated with the times
           of conjunction and opposition of the sun and moon.
   (/)   No definite conclusion can bo drawn from the apparent
           monthly and fortnightly periodicities which seem to be
           associated with the periodic changes in the moon's distance
           and declination, for the simple reason that fully as pro
           minent harmonic components exist when the statistics are
           analysed according to the periodic change in the moon's
            position relative to the ecliptic, and with this particular
            period no tidal stresses can be directly associated.

 466                  Proceedings and  List of Papers   read.
     (<?)  Nevertheless, the value of the phase lends some support to the
              view that there is a real connexion between the change in
              the moon's distance and earthquake frequency, since the
              maximum frequency falls near the time of perigee.
    (h)    These   conclusions have, in comparison with previous similar
              investigations, a peculiar value, inasmuch as they are based
              upon accurate statistics of fully 7000 earthquakes occurring
              within eight years in a limited part of the earth's crust,
              throughout which the seismic conditions may be assumed to
              be fairly similar from point to point.

        Received February 3, — Read February 11, 1897.
    Nautilus macromphalus is the species of nautilus characteristic of
 the New Caledonian Archipelago, which comprises the islands of
 New Caledonia, the Isle of Pines, and the Loyalty Group. I took up
 my residence on the shores of Sandal Bay, Lifu, in August, 1896.
 Having collected a number of Nautilus, I placed them in captivity in
 a large native fish-trap, specially fitted up, fed them twice or three
 times a week with fish, land-crabs, Palinurus, and Scyllarus, and on
 December 5, 1896, commenced to obtain the fertilised ova.
    It is not necessary at present to describe the details of manipula
            I
 tion, and therefore proceed at once to give a brief account of the
 more obvious features of the eggs as illustrated by the accompanying
 figures. The eggs are laid singly and at night, in concealed situations,
 and are firmly attached by a sponge-like reticulate area of attachment
 placed towards their hinder inflated extremity, usually on one-
 face of the egg-case, but sometimes quite posteriorly, to a suitable
 surface.    I supplied the latter to the Nautilus by fixing pieces of old
 sacking to the walls of the fish-basket, leaving loose, overhanging
 folds, beneath which the eggs could be well concealed.         The fibres
 of the sacking were deftly employed by the Nautilus in cementing
 their eggs.
    The ovum is enclosed within a double casing, an inner closed cap
sule, and an outer capsule moie or less freely open in front.         The
material of which the capsules consist is of a bright milk-white
colour, and of firm cartilaginoid consistency. The capsules do not
collapse, but retain their shape when allowed to dry.
    For convenience of description, the      exposed  surface of the egg
may be spoken of as the dorsal or upper side, while the attached side
may be referred to as the lower or ventral side.     The outer capsule is
separate from the inner capsule below and for about two-thirds of the
upper side, bnt is fused with it in the postero-dorsal region.     Where
the two capsules are f nsed together the covering of the ovum is much
thickened.
    The egg with outer covering complete is of remarkably large size,
attaining a length of 45 mm., everything included, with a width of
16 mm., and a maximum height of 16"25 mm.            The length and the
width are fairly constant     in  normally shaped eggs, but the height
varies somewhat, some eggs being a good deal flatter than others.

  In    fig.an egg is represented as seen in its usual natural attached
               1
position.   The depressed or "anterior" end of the egg        as a rule,is,
directed vertically upwards.    The outer capsule    continued in front
                                                             is
into two  thin, translucent, terminal processes.   For  nearly half the
length of the egg on the upper side the two halves of the outer cap-
snleare separated by a narrow slit from one another and join together
behind the centre of the egg.      The dorsal ridge or suture of the
inner capsule can be seen through this slit in the outer capsule.    On
the lower side of the egg the two halves of the outer capsule are con
tinuous across the middle line throughout the length of the egg,
except at the extreme anterior end.
   The surface of the egg in the posterior inflated region      smooth,       is
with a few slight folds like the folds of drapery, giving     a gracefulit

       capsule were unequal, the larger of them having the form of     a  thin flattened

appearance.       The anterior depressed region is characterised by the
presence of a number of pectinate ridges and of fenestrations in the
wall of the outer capsule (figs. 1 — 3). Sometimes, however, the pec
tinations are obscure and the fenestrations may be absent.
   Hardly will any two eggs present an exactly similar appearance.
Sometimes there are Rhred-like processes from the surface of the
outer capsule, lending a more or less tattered appearance to the egg.
    In fig. 4 another egg is shown with the above-described slit in the
upper wall of the outer capsule, widened out so as to disclose the
inner capsule to view.
    The inner capsule has a regular oval shape with anterior pointed
extremity and a generally smooth surface. Its wall has a finely
striated structure, the striae having a watery appearance. There are
three distinct seams or sutures, representing lines of least resistance,
in the wall of the inner capsule, namely, a median suture on the
upper side (i.e., the side directed away from the attached side of the
egg), and two lateral sutures placed towards the lower surface of the
capsule (figs. 4 — 6).
    The dorsal suture is marked by a prominent ridge which is pro
duced in front beyond the anterior extremity of the main body of
the inner capsule into a slender terminal appendix.
    The lateral sutures are marked by less prominent ridges, and are
continued       into one another anteriorly, immediately behind the
 anterior extremity of the inner capsule. In consequence of the con
 tinuity of the lateral sutures, the lower side of the egg can be raised
 up like a cap or an operculum.            The inner capsule is often easily

" On the Regeneration of Nerves."                   By Robert Kennedy,

       McKendrick, F.R.S. Received January 7, — Read February
       11, 1897.
                                     (Abstract.)
    The author treats the subject under the following heads : —
    I. A short historical and critical review of the books and papers
          which have appeared on the subject from the time of Cruik-
          shank (1776).
    II.   Clinical reports of four cases of secondary suture of nerves as
          follows : —
    1.  Suture of tho median and ulnar nerves six and a half months
 after division in the middle of the forearm. There was total loss of
 sensation and motion in the distribution in the hand, and marked
atrophic      changes.    Three days after the operation, sensation com
 menced to      return ; by the nineteenth day, touch was correctly localised
 on all parts of the fingers ; and by the end of the first month, sensa
 tion was almost perfect.           Improvement in motion was slow and
imperfect.
    2.  Suture of the median three months after complete division
above the wrist.        Sensation was lost in the median distribution, and
 opposition of the thumb was impossible.                 There was marked
 atrophy of the thenar eminence.             Two days after the operation,
 sensation commenced to return.           Both sensation and motion speedily
 improved,      and by  the end  of  a year recovery was almost perfect.
    3. A case in which the median, musculo-spiral,            and ulnar were
 involved      in cicatricial tissue at the seat of fracture at the elbow
joint   ;  excision of portions from median and musculo-spiral,           and
 suture, two months after accident. There was total anaesthesia in
 the distribution of the affected nerves, and paralysis of tho muscles.
 Sensation, after the operation, commenced to return on the fourth
 morning, but made slow progress. The case was under observation
for six weeks only, at which time no improvement had occurred in
 motion, but sensation was present in the fingers.
    4. Suture of the ulnar nerve eighteen months after division.
 Sense of pain was totally lost in the ulnar distribution.         Five days
after the operation, sense of pain returned in the little finger, and by
six weeks, sensation was almost perfect, although motion had not
improved.
    III.   Deductions from the results of operation.
    From the above results the author concludes that the early return

                     On the Regeneration  of Nerves.               473
of sensation must be regarded as indicating a restored conductivity
of the divided nerve. He holds that the theories which have hitherto
been advanced to account for early return of sensation apart from
reunion of the nerve, are inapplicable to cases where early return of
sensation occurs from sutnre, performed after the lapse of several
months from the time of section.    The imperfect return of motion he
takes to be fully explained by the fact that the muscles have under
gone great trophic change, or indeed total destruction, and that,
therefore, their restitution must be slow, or may even be impossible.
   IV.  Microscopical examination of the portions removed previous to
        suture.
   Both the central and peripheral ends of nerves which had not
reunited in any way, contained young nerve fibres grouped in bundles,
each bundle containing, as a rule, many fibres. The fibres contained
an axis-cylinder lying in the centre of a clear, well-defined zone,
which, again, contained a granular, myeline deposit, while spindle-
shaped nuclei were attached to the sides of the fibres at frequent
intervals.   Where the ends of the nerve were united by a cicatricial
segment without conductivity being restored, the examination of the
segment showed a dense network of connective tissue containing in
its meshes bundles of young fibres.
   The portions excised from the nerves involved at the seat of frac
ture showed at their central ends a normal structure, but elsewhere
no trace of old myeline fibres, nor of degenerated fibres ; but the
section was made up of young fibres in bundles, which bundles were
of only slightly greater diameter than the old myeline fibres, and
often surrounded by a delicate sheath.      At the point of transition
from old to young fibres, many of the old myeline fibres contained
an enlarged nucleus, with one or two distinct young fibres lodged
between the sheath of Schwann and the myeline sheath. In other
cases the number of young fibres ljing in a similar position was
greater.   All stages up to complete replacement of the old myeline
sheath and axis-cylinder by young fibres were found.
   V. Deductions from the microscopical examination.
   1. Degeneration : —
   (a) That there is no evidence of ascending degeneration of the
kind described by Krause after interruption of a nerve.
   (6) That the old axis-cylinder and myeline sheath arc destroyed in
the peripheral segment, and in the ultimate portion of the central
segment.
   2. Regeneration : —
   (a) That young nerve fibres are developed in the peripheral seg
ment, as well as in the end of the central segment, and that even
while there is no connexion between the two ends.

474               Proceedings and   List of Papers read.
   (6) That these young nerve fibres originate within the old sheath of
Schwann from the protoplasm and nucleus of the interannular seg
ment. The spindle-cells formed from the protoplasm and nuclei of
the interannu'ar segments elongate and unite to form protoplasmic
threads, with the elongated nuclei attached to their sides.          The
central portion of the protoplasmic thread develops into the axis
cylinder, while myeline is deposited in drops in the protoplasm
surrounding the newly formed axis-cylinder.          The protoplasm in
which the myeline is deposited remains with the nucleus as the neuro
blast of the new interannular segment.
    (c) That so long as conductivity of the nerve is not re-established,
the development of the fibres proceeds only to a certain stage, and
as the new fibres three months and eighteen months subsequent to
division present identical characters, this stage may be regarded as a
resting stage, depending for its further development on re-establish
ment of function.
   (d) That cicatricial intercalary segments reuniting the ends of a
divided nerve may be permeated by young fibres from end to end
without re-establishment of function, if the amount of cicatricial
connective tissue present in the mass is sufficient by its pressure to
prevent the passage of impulses.

   In   continuation of investigations communicated to the Royal
Society in 1879* and 1881, f on the effect of high-tension electricity
                                         I
on the line spectra of metals, have recently used a more powerful

current and larger jar surface than that formerly employed.
   The former work consisted in noting (1) the lines brightened in
passing a spark in a flame charged with metallic vapours, and (2) the
lines brightened on passing from the arc to the spark. It was found, in
the case of iron, that two lines in the visible spectrum at 4924'1 and
5018'6, on Rowland's scale, were greatly enhanced in brightness, and
wero very important in solar phenomena.
   The recent work carries these results into the photographic region.
The result is interesting and important, since seven additional lines
have been found to have their brightness enhanced at the highest
temperature.        These, as well as the two previously observed, are
shown in the following table, which also indicates the behaviour of
the lines under different conditions, as observed by Kayser and
Runge (K and R) and myself                  (L) in the arc, and by Thalen (T)

   Combining this with former results, we seem justified in conclud
ing that, in a space heated to the temperature of the hottest spark,
and shielded from a lower temperature, these lines would constitute
the spectrum of iron.

476             On the     Iron Lines present in   the Hottest   Stars.
   Defining the hottest stars as those in which the ultra-violet spec
trum is most extended, it is known that absorption is indicated by
few lines only.   In these stars iron is practically represented by the
enhanced lines alone ; those which build up, for the most part, the
arc spectrum are almost or entirely absent.
   The intensities of the enhanced lines in some of the hottest stars
are shown in the appended diagram, and, for the sake of comparison,
the behaviour of a groop of three lines which are among the most
marked at lower temperatures, is also indicated.        In addition, the
diagram shows the inversion in intensities of the spark and arc
lines in the spectrum of a relatively cool star — such as a-Orionis.

   The facts illustrated by the diagram indicate that the enhanced
lines may be absent from the spectrum of a star, either on account of
too low or too high    temperature.

    The only theory of correlation    at present available for practical
use is based on the normal law of frequency, but, unfortunately, this
law is not valid in a great many cases which are both common and
important. It does not hold good,. to take examples from biology,
for statistics of fertility in man, for measurements on flowers, or for
 weight measurements even on adults.        In economic statistics, on tho
other hand, normal distributions appear to be highly exceptional :
variation of wages, prices, valuations, pauperism, and so forth, are
always skew. In cases like these we have at present no means of
                                                 " correlation coefficients "
measuring the correlation by one or more
such as are afforded by the normal theory.
    It seems worth while noting, under these circumstances, that in
ordinary practice statisticians never concern themselves with the
form of the correlation, normal or otherwise, bat yet obtain results of
interest — though always lacking in numerical exactness and fre
quently in certainty.      Suppose the case to be one in which two
variables are varying together in time, curves are drawn exhibiting
the history of the two.        If these two curves appear, generally
speaking, to rise and fall together, the variables are held to be corre
 lated. If on the other hand it is not a case of variation with time,
the associated pairs may be tabulated in order according to the
magnitude of one variable, and then it may be seen whether the
entries of the other variable also occur in order.       Both methods are
of course very rough, and will only indicate very close correlation,
but they contain, it seems to me, the point of prime importance at
all events with regard to economic statistics. In all the classical
examples of statistical con-elation (e.g., marriage-rate and imports,
corn prices and vagrancy, out-relief and wages) we are only
primarily concerned with the question is a large x usually associated
with a large y (or small y) ; the further question as to the form of
this association and the relative frequency of different pairs of the
variables is, at any rate on a first investigation, of comparatively
secondary importance.
    Let Ox, Oy be the axes of a three dimensional frequency-surface
drawn through the mean 0 of the surface parallel to the axes of
 measurement, and let the points marked (x) be the means of succes
 sive z-arrays, lying on some curve that may be called the curve of
 regression of x on y. Now let a line, RR, be fitted to this curve,

condition.    If the slope of RR is positive we may say that large
values of x are on the whole associated with large values of y, if it is
negative large values of x are associated with small values of y.
Further, if the slope of RR to the vertical be given we shall have a
measure of a rough practical kind of the shift of the mean of an
a:-array when its type y is altered.               The equation to RR conse
quently   gives a concise   and     definite    answer   to two most important
statistical questions.     It is also evident that if the means of the
iirrays actually lie  in a  straight line (as in normal correlation), the
equation to RR must be the equation to the line of regression.
    Let n be the number of observations in any ^-array, and let d be
the horizontal distance of the mean of this array from the line RR.
I  propose to subject the line to the condition that the sum of all
quantities like ndr shall be a minimum, i.e.,          I  shall use the condition
of least squares.   I  do  this   solely    for  convenience    of analysis; I  do
not claim for the method adopted any peculiar advantage as regards
the probability of its results.        It would, in fact, be absurd to do so,
     I
for am postulating at the very outset that the curve of regression is
only exceptionally a straight line ; there can consequently be no
meaning in seeking for the most probable straight line to represent
the regression.
    Let x, y be a pair of associated deviations, let a be the standard
deviation of any array about its own mean, and let

be the equation to          RR.            Then for any one array
                    S{x-(a       + hy)}* =          S{x-(a              + 6Y)}J = nS+nd*.
Hence, extending                the      meaning of S to summation                                    over the whole-

But in this expression                 S(ra<r)     is independent of a and b,                            it   is,   in fact,,
    characteristic of the surface.                       Therefore, making &(nd?)                        a    minimum
is a
     equivalent to making

                                is
light.      We may say that we form a single-valued relation
                                                  x   = a+          by
between    a pair of associated deviations, such that the sum of the-
squares   of our errors in estimating any one x from its        by the                                        y
relation     a minimum.
            is             This single-valued relation, which we may
call the characteristic relation,   simply the equation to the line of
                                                         is
regression   RR.   There  will be two   such equations to be formed
corresponding to the two lines of regression.
   The idea of the method may at once be extended to the case of
correlation between several variables xx, a?,, x,, &o. Let n be the
number of observations in an array of aVs associated with fixed
values X2, X3, X(, &c, of the remaining variables, let ax be the
standard deviation of this array, and let      be the difference of its     d
mean from the value given by a regression equation
                                 Xi = (luXj           +    auXj + auX^
Then, as before, wo shall determine the coefficients an, al3 au, &c, so

not their deviations from the mean.                     This may, however, be most
conveniently         done   by working        with    the     mean as origin until the
characteristic is obtained, and then transferring the equation to zero
as origin.        It would be much more laborious and would only lead to
 the same       result if zero were used ab initio as origin.
     We may now proceed to the discussion of the special cases of two,
three, or more variables.            The actual formulae obtained are not, it
will be found, novel in themselves, but throw an unexpected light
on the meaning of the expressions previously given by Bravais* for
the case of normal correlation.

 But the expressions on the right of (3) and (4)                  are the values
 obtained by Bravais on the assumption of normal correlation for the
 regression of * on y, and the regression of y on x. That is to say,
 the Bravais values for the regressions are simply those values of bx
 and hi, which make

 respectively minima, whatever be the form of the correlation between the
 two variables. Again, whatever the form of the correlation, if the
 regression be really linear, the equations to the lines of regression are
 those given above (as we pointed out in the introduction).                 This
 theorem admits of a very simple and direct geometrical proof.
    Let n be the number of correlated pairs in any one array taken
 parallel to the axis of x, and let 0 be the angle that the line of
 regression makes with the axis of y. Then, for a single array,
                         S(xy) = yS(x) = ny' tan          6,
 or extending     the significance of S to summation over the whole
 surface,
                              S(xy) — Ntanflff,!1,
 that is,
                                 tan   0 = r f!  .
    In any case, then, where the regression appears to be linear, Bravais'
formula! may be used at once without troubling to investigate the
normality of the distribution.        The exponential character of the surface
appears to have nothing whatever to do with the result.
    To return, again, to the most general case, we                 see that both
coefficients   of regression must have the same sign, namely, the sign
of r. Hence, either regression will serve to indicate whether there is
correlation or no, for there is no reason, a priori, why the values of
bi and blt as determined above, should bo positive rather than
negative.      But, nevertheless, the regressions are not convenient
measures of correlation, for, on comparing two similar cases, we may
find, say,

482     Mr. G. U. Yule.         On the Significance        of Bravais' Formula
where bfo, b',b\ are the regressions in the two cases. To which
distribution are we, in such a case, to attribute the greater corre
lation ?     Bravais' coefficient solves the difficulty, we may say, in
one way, by taking the geometrical mean of the two regressions as
the measure of correlation.         It will still remain valid for non-normal
correlation.     But there are other and less arbitrary interpretations
even in the general case.
    Suppose that instead of measnring x and y in arbitrary units we
measure each in terms of its own standard deviation.                    Then let us
write
                                     --/»-                                          0>).
and solve for p by the method of least squares.                  We have omitted a
constant on the right-hand side, since it would vanish as before. We
have, at once,

That is to say, if we measnre x and y each in terms of its own
standard deviation, r becomes at once the regression of * on y, and
the regression of y on x. The regressions being, in fact, the funda
mental physical quantities, r is a coefficient of correlation because it
is a coefficient of regression.*
    Again, let us form the sums of the squares of residuals in equations
(1) and (5). Inserting the values of 6„ 62, and />, we have
                                                                          —

 Any   one of these quantities, being the sum of a series of squares,
 must be positive. Hence r cannot be greater than unity.                         If r be
 equal to unity, or      if the correlation       be perfect,    all the above three

relation (8) holds good, or that all pairs of deviations bear the same
ratio to one another. It follows that in correlation, where the means
of arrays are not collinear, or the deviation of the mean of the array
is not a linear function of the deviation of the type, r can never be
unity, though we know from experience that it can approach pretty
closely to that value. If the regression be very far from linear, some
caution must evidently be used in employing r to compare two diffe
rent distributions.

deviation of the ai-arrays from the line of regression, and the second
expression as the mean standard deviation of the ^-arrays from the
line of regression.   Otherwise we may regard

say. In normal correlation o-^l—                    IV     is the standard deviation of
an Xi-array, corresponding to auy given types of Xa and Xj. In
general correlation it may be regarded as the mean standard deviation
of the Xrarrays from the plane
or as the standard error made in estimating Xi from                                and   x3 by
relation (12).
    The quantity R is of some interest, as it exactly takes the place of
r in the residual expressions (7). Ri may, in fact, be regarded as a
coefiBcient of correlation between xt and (XiX*) ; it can only be unity
if the liuear relation (9) or (12) hold good in every case.
    The quantities 6,3, b13, &c. (the others may be written down by
symmetry), may be termed the net regressions of xx on x,, Xi on                             33,

612 and b„ are the regressions for any group of                     X/s  or X3's associated
with a fixed type of X3's. Hence, in this case (normal correlation),
the coefficient of correlation for such a group is the geometrical mean
of the two regressions, or

a quantity that may be called the net coefiBcient of correlation

x, and %3, may be written down by interchanging the suffixes.
    In normal correlation pa is quite strictly the coefiBcient of correla
tion for any sub-group of Xi's and X2's, whatever the associated type
of Xj's. In generalised correlation this will not be so, and pn can
only retain an average significance.
     The method does not appear to be capable of investigating changes
in the net coefficient as we pass from one type to another, but it may
be noted that whatever the form of the correlation, pn retains three
of the chief properties of the ordinary coefficients : (1) it can only be

   One is rather prone to argue that if A be correlated with B, and B
with C, A will be correlated with C. Evidently this is not necessary.
A may be positively correlated with B, and B positively correlated
with C, but yet A may, in general, be negatively correlated with C.
Only, if the coefficients (AB) and (BC) are both numerically greater
than 0707, can one even ascribe the correct sign to the (AC) corre
lation.
   It is evident that one would, in general, expect to make a smaller
standard error in estimating X\ from the two associated variables Xi
and 3'3, than in estimating it from one only, say xt. But it seems
desirable to prove this specifically, and to investigate under what
conditions it will hold good.        The necessary condition is —

But (rl3— ruf^)    the numerator of pa, the net coefficient of corre

One might very naturally imagine that the introduction of the third
variable with a fairly high correlation coefficient (0-4) would con
siderably lessen the standard deviation of the av array    but this                               ;               is

                  perhaps, of sufficient practical importance to warrant

appeared    a  high degree  of correlation   between  three  series of abso
lutely independent judgments.                                      I
                                     It was some time before realised
that this correlation had nothing to do with the manner of judging,
but was a special case of the above principle due to the use of indices.
   A further illustration is of the following kind. Select three num
bers within certain ranges at random, say as, y, z, these will be pair
and pair uncorrected. Form the proper fractions xjy and zjy for
each triplet, and correlation will be fonnd between these indices.
   The application of this idea to biology seems of considerable
importance.       For example, a quantity of bones are taken from an
ossuarium, and are put together in groups, which are asserted to be
those of individual skeletons.       To test this a biologist takes the
triplet femur, tibia, humerus, and seeks the con-elation between the
indices femur j humerus and tibia / humerus.         He might reasonably
conclude    that   this correlation   marked    organic relationship, and
believe that the bones had really been put together substantially in
 their individual grouping.      As a matter of fact, since the coefficients
of variation for femur, tibia, and humerus are approximately equal,
there would be, as we shall see later, a correlation of about 0°4 to
0-5 between these indices had the bones been sorted absolutely at
random.      I  term this a spurious organic correlation, or simply a
spurious correlation.      I understand by this phrase the amount of
correlation which would still exist between the indices, were the
absolute lengths on which they depend distributed at random.
   It has hitherto been usual to measure the organic correlation of the
organs of shrimps, prawns, crabs, Ac, by the correlation of indices in
which the denominator represents the total body length or total cara
pace length.       Now suppose a table formed of the absolute lengths
and the indices of, say, some thousand individuals. Let an " imp
                                                                            "
(.allied to the Maxwellian demon) redistribute the indices at random,
they would then exhibit no correlation ; if the corresponding absolute
lengths followed along with the indices in the redistribution, they
also would exhibit no correlation.         Now let us suppose the indices
 not to have been calculated, but the imp to redistribute the abso

        Mathematical       Contributions     to the Theory       of Evolution.   491
 lute lengths ; these 'would now exhibit no organic correlation, but
 the indices calculated from this random distribution would have a
 correlation nearly as high, if not in some cases higher than before.
 The biologist would be not unlikely to argue that the index correla
 tion of the imp-assorted, but probably, from the vital standpoint,
                              "
impossible beings was           organic."
    As a last illustration, suppose 1000 skeletons obtained by distribut
 ing component bones at random. Between none of their bones will
these individuals exhibit correlation.             Wire the spurious skeletons
 together and photograph them all, so that their stature in the photo
graphs is the same ; the series of photographs, if measured, will show
correlation between their parts. It seems to me that the biologist
 who reduces the parts of an animal to fractions of some one length
 measured upon it is dealing with a series very much like these pho
 tographs. A part of the correlation he discovers between organs is
 undoubtedly organic, but another part is solely due to the nature of
 his arithmetic, and as a measure of organic relationship is spurious.
    Returning to our problem of the randomly distributed bones, let
us suppose the indices femur/humerus and tibia/humerus to have a
correlation of 0'45.           Now suppose successively 1, 2, 3, 4, &c,
per   cent,   of the bones are assorted in their true groupings, then
begins   the   true organic correlating of the bones.            It starts from 0"45,
and will alter gradually until 100 per cent, of the bones are truly
grouped.       The final value may be greater or less than 0-45, but it
 would seem that 0"45 is a more correct point to measure the organic
correlation from than zero. At any rate it appears fairly certain
that if a biologist recognised that a perfectly random selection of
organs would still lead to a correlation of organ-indices, he would
be unlikely to accept index -correlation as a fair measure of the rela
tive intensity of correlation between organs.                   I  shall accordingly
define spurious organic con-elation as the correlation which will be
found between indices, when the absolute values of the organs have
been selected purely at random.            In estimating relative correlation
by the hitherto nsual measurement of indices, it seems to me that a
statement of the amount of spurious correlation ought always to be
made.       ^

the four absolute measurements forming the indices are quite uncor

     This is the coefficient of correlation between two indices with the
 same denominator        (ai/tfa and :Bj/:ej).
     The value of    p  in (v) does not vanish if the remaining organs be
 quite uncorrelated, i.e., rw = ra = ra = 0. In this case
                                                                                 ,
 This is the measure of the spurious correlation.                     For  the special

                                Prof. Karl Pearson.
case    in which the coefficients of variation are all the same, p„ = 0'5.
When the absolute sizes of organs are very feebly correlated, then
in most cases there will be a considerable correlation of indices.
    Example (a). Suppose three organs, x,, x,, and z, to have sensibly
equal coefficients of variation, and that the correlation of Zi and xt =
r„ — r and of x: and x* as well as of xt and x, = r .
    Then:
                                   =  0*5 + 0-3
                                                  r-r'    .
                                                       ;
   This formula illustrates well in a specially simple case how the
correlation in the indices diverges from the spurious value Oo, as we
alter r and r from zero, i.e~, as we introduce organic correlation.
According as r, the correlation of the numerators, is greater or less
than r, the correlation of the numerator with the denominator, the
actual index correlation can be greater or less than the spurious
value.
   Example,    (b). If r,, r, be the indices, then in the case of normal
correlation the contour lines of the correlation surface for the indices
are given by
where     - .     and  p are given by     (iii)   and   (iv)   above.
   The contour lines of a surface of spurious index correlation are
given by

    This is the first table, so far as I am aware, that has been published
of the variation and correlation of the three chief cephalic lengths. t
It shows us that there is not at all a close correlation between these
chief dimensions of the sknll, and that a small compensating factor
for size is to be sought in the correlation of height and length, i.e.,
while a broad skull is probably a long skull and also a high sknll, a
high skull will probably be a short skull, and a low skull a long skull.

height/length indices from :
                        P   = (Vus+V0'-VlJ')/(2V13Va).
    This follows at once from the general theorem given in my memoir
on " Regression, Panmixia, and Heredity," ' Phil. Trans.,' vol. 187,
A, p. 279, or by substitution of the above values of rla, ra, rn in (v),
we find    :
                                        p  =   0 4857.
   If  we calculate from (vi) the correlation between the same cephalic
indices on the hypothesis that their heights, breadths and lengths
are distributed at random, i.e., that our "imp" has constructed a
number of arbitrary and spurious skulls from Professor Ranke's
measurements, we find ;
                                        p0 =   0-4008.

of the organic correlation of the human skull, did we judge it by the
magnitude of the correlation coefficient (0'4857) for the two chief

 of this example.
   t The values for the indices are not in absolute agreement with those to be
 deduced from the lengths, for it was not always possible to use the same skeleton
for femur and humerus as for tibia and humerus, i.e., sometimes one or other bone
was missing.     For the same reason, the constants for the absolute lengths do not
agree entirely with those given for Ainos in my paper on

   Hence we may conclude as follows :
   (i) The absolute lengths of the long bones differ from those of the
skull in being very closely correlated.
   (ii) The use of indices for the long bones would appear to mini
mise, rather than, as in the case of the skull, to exaggerate this
correlation.
   (iii) If we measure, however, organic correlation of the indices by
p—po, we shall find index correlation less than absolute length corre
lation for both long bones and skull, and in both cases the former
comparatively small as compared with the latter.
    (iv) The results for the 24 female skeletons, although based on
but few data, serve on the whole to confirm the male results.*
   (6.) From the above examples it will be seen that the method,
which judges of the intensity of organic correlation by the reduction
of all absolute measures to indices, the denominators of which are
some one absolute measurement, is not free from obscurity ; for this
method would give the major portion of the observed index corre
lation had the parts of the animal been thrown together entirely at
random, i.e., if there were no organic correlation at all. The follow
ing additional remarks may be of interest. The results (iv) — (vi)
show us that the correlation coefficients of indices are functions, not
only of the correlation coefficients of absolute measurements, but also
of the coefficients of variation of the latter measurements. Hence,
   * The fact that the male is more variable in height-sitting, in femur, and in
tibia than the female, while she appears to be more variable than he is in stature,
led me to prophesy, in my paper on " Variation in Man and Woman," that the
female would be found to be more closely correlated in the bones forming stature
than the male. This appears to be the case for the femur and tibia of Ainos.

unless the coefficients of variation be constant for local races, it ia
impossible that the coefficients of correlation can be constant for
indices.     In other words, the hypothesis of the constancy for local
races of correlation, and that of the constancy for local races of
variation, stand on exactly the same footing.
    The conclusions of this paper although applied to organic correla
tion arc equally valid so far as concerns the use of indices in judging
the correlation of either physical or economic phenomena. It was,
indeed, a difficulty arising from my discussion of personal judgments
— a spurious correlation between the judgments of different observers
— which first drew my attention to the matter.
   Note,    January 13,      1897. —The      result described by Professor
Pearson evidently affects the value of the correlation coefficients
determined by me in Crangon arid Carcinus (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vols.
51 and 54), because        I have always expressed the size of the organs
measured in terms of body length.
   In order to show the effect of this,          I have lately performed, at
Professor Pearson's suggestion, the following experiment : It happens
that my measures of Plymouth shrimps are recorded in a book, in
the order in which they were measured, and therefore at random as
regards carapace length or other characters.               I constructed from
                        "           "
these records 420         spurious     shrimps, in the following way : the
total length of the first shrimp in the book was associated with the
                                                       "                       "
carapace length of the tenth shrimp and the              post-spinous length
of the twentieth, and so thi-oughout.          Evidently these three measures
were associated at     random,    and  we might expect that these spurious
shrimps would show no organic correlation ; but when the cara
                      "                          "
pace lengths and        post-spinous lengths       of these spurious shrimps
were    divided   by the    body length,    and  the  correlation between the
resulting indices was determined, the value of r was found to be 0'38,
the value for real shrimps being 081, or the correlation due to the
use of indices forms 47 per cent,       of the observed value.

    I send  this note to serve as a kind of appendix to the memoir of
 Professor K. Pearson, believing that it may be useful in enabling
 others to realise the genesis of spurious correlation.         It is important
 though rather difficult     to do so, because the results arrived at in the
 memoir, which are of serious interest to practical          slatisticians, have
 at first sight a somewhat paradoxical appearance.

   The diagrams show how a table of frequency of the various com
binations of two independent and normal variables may be changed
into one of A/C, B/C, where 0 is also an independent and normal
variable in respect to its intrinsic qualities, but subjected to the con
dition that the same value of C is to be used as the divisor of both
members of the same couplet of A and B.                 In short, that the
couplets shall always be of the form A/C,,, B/C, and never that of
A/G..B/C..
    For the sake of clearness, the simplest possible suppositions, that
are at the same time serviceable, will be made in regard to the
particular case illustrated by the diagrams, namely, that A, B, and C,
severally, are sharply divided into three, and only into three, equal
grades of magnitude, distinguished as AI, AIT, A1II; BI, BII, Bill;
and CI, CII, CM ; also that the frequency with which these three
grades occur is expressed by the three terms of the binomial
(l  + l)3. Consequently there is one occurrence of         I to two occur
rences of  II  and to one occurrence of   III.  Roman and italic figares
are here used to keep the distinction clear between magnitudes and
frequencies.     It will be easily gathered as we proceed, without the
need of special explanation, that the smallness of the value of the
binomial index has no influence either on the general character of the
operation or on its general result.
   The large figures in the outlined square, occupying the lower
right hand portion of fig. 1, show the distribution of frequency of the
various combinations of A and B. The scales running along the top
and down the left side of the figure, which are there assigned to the
values of A/C, B/C, apply to these entries also.          The latter run in
                                    I
the same way as those in Table below, or when quadrupled, as they
will be for purposes immediately to be explained, as in Table II.

    Let us now follow the fortunes of one of the large figures in fig. 1,
say that which refers to A = I, B = III, of which the frequency is
only 1. When the latter is expanded into the three possible values
of the form A/C, B/C, caused by the three varieties of C, it yields
\   case of   frequency to (I/I, III/I), | case to (I/1I, III/II),       and
 \ case to  (I'M,    III/III), for entry at the intersections of the   lines
 (I, III), (I/1I, III/II), and (I/III, I) respectively.
    But, in order to avoid the inconvenience of quarter values, it is
 better to suppose the original figures in the fig. and in Table I above
 to have been replaced by those in Table II ; then the original entry

from which we start will have become four, to be expanded into
three derivative entries, having respectively the frequencies 1, 2, and
1 ; these latter figures are entered in fig. 1 at the intersections of the
lines just named. Under this arrangement the large figure from
which we started, which bad been changed from 1 to 4, again assumes
its original value of 1. It will easily be understood, that the posi
tions of the three derivative entries necessarily lie in the same
straight line, and that this line necessarily runs towards the (O, 0)
corner of the figure. The same is true for every other set of deriva
tive entries, with the result that whereas the original set of largo,
figures, referring to the combinations of A and B, are symmetrically
disposed on either side of the horizontal, of the vertical, and of the
diagonal lines passing through their common centre at (II, II), the
derivative values of A/C, B/C are disposed symmetrically only in
respect to the diagonal line that runs from the (0, 0) corner. Their
symmetry, in this 6ense, is well shown by the dotted connections
between the corresponding figures on either side of the diagonal.
Also, it will be seen that the diagonal passes through the regions of
greatest frequency.     It follows that the diagonal in question repre
sents the locus of average frequency.        Now, along that diagonal,
each value of A/C is associated with identically the same value of
B/C ; in other words, a correlation is found to have become estab
lished between them, which is solely due to the fact that each
member in every couplet of A/C, B/C values is divided by the same
value of the variable C.
   We will now submit the above process to the test of extreme
cases.
   First, let the variability of A be so small that it may be treated as
a constant, and take it = 1.
   Then the values of A/C and B/C, that are severally associated
with the three values of C, are as follows : —

   These frequencies are laid down at their proper places in fig. 2,
where the three entries, corresponding to each successive value of
A/C, run in vertical lines, but, on connecting the entries of maximum

frequency it is seen that they coincide with the diagonal from the
0/0 corner; also that the entries of minimum frequency are dis
posed symmetrically on either side of that diagonal and converge
towards the same corner. Consequently, the existence of spurious
correlation is manifest here.      If B be the constant, and A and C the
variables, the general results will of course be the same.
   Secondly, let both A and B be constant and equal to I, and C the
only variable ; then there are only three possible combinations of A/C
and B/C. In one of them both values are equal to I, in another
to I/II, and in the third to I/III, all of which lie along the diagonal
from (O, O), and thus testify to intimate correlation.
   Lastly, let C be the only constant and equal to 1. Then A/C, B/C,
become A and B, and the table of frequency of their various com
binations is that shown in Table       I and by the large figures in fig. 1,
whose symmetrical disposition in all directions proves that there is
no correlation.

                      Vice- Chairman of the Committee.
   In presenting, as desired by the Committee, Professor Sollas's report
on the attempts to ascertain, by boring, the structure of the atoll
of Funafuti and on other investigations simultaneously undertaken,
I avail myself of the opportunity of expressing the gratitude which
is felt by its members to our friends in New South Wales, who have
given such real and substantial help, especially by the loan of
machinery and skilled workmen, in putting the project into execu
tion ; and among them chiefly to Professor Anderson Stuart (who has
been practically another secretary in Australia), Professor Edgeworth
David, Mr. W. H. J. Slee (Chief Inspector of Mines), and Sir Saul
Samuel (the Agent- General of the Colony in England).               I  shall
venture also to acknowledge gratefully the services of Captain Field
and the officers of H.M.S. '• Penguin," and the unstinted labour
which has been given by Mr. W. W. Watts, F.G.S., oar Secretary in
London, in carrying oat our plans. In conclusion, may           I  express,
speaking    for myself, my    earnest  hope  that another  attempt will lie
made to determine the true structure of an atoll.        I think, however,
that our experience on this occasion shows that the attempt can be

        to investigate the Structure  of a Coral Reef by Boring.    503
much more easily made, and with a far greater probability of success,
                                                                 I
if Australia instead of England be the base of operations, and trust
that before long the colony of Sydney will initiate an expedition,
and we shall co-operate with them as cordially as they have done
with us.
             Report by Professor Sollas, D.Sc, LL.D., F.R.S.
    H.M.S. " Penguin " having come to anchor in the lagoon ot
Funafuti on the afternoon of Thursday, the 21st of May, Captain
 Field at once landed with Lieutenant Dawson, Ayles (the foreman of
the boring party), and myself, and we proceeded to make arrangements
for our work on the island. A site for boring was chosen near the sandy
beach of the lagoon, conveniently situated for the landing of gear,
less than half a mile to the south and west of the village of Funafuti,
 and near the village well, which supplies a small amount of brackish
but drinkable water. The work of landing was commenced the next
 morning, and completed by May 26.          The erection of the boring
 apparatus   was   at once taken  in hand, and  on June 2, twelve days
after our arrival on the island, all was in readiness for commencing
 operations.    On June 3 the 6-inch tubes were driven into the sand,
 and by Juno 6 they had been advanced 30 feet ; the 5-inch pipes
 were then entered and everything made ready for inserting the
 diamond crown and commencing to drill on Monday, June 8. On
 June 10 it was arranged that the work should proceed by shifts, so
 that the drilling might be carried on continuously day and night.
 During the first shift the crown had been advanced 20 feet, making
 the total depth then attained 52 feet 9 inches ; during this shift
 fragments of highly cavernous coral rock were brought up in the
 core barrel from a depth of between 40 and 50 feet.
    On June 11, a depth of 85 feet having been reached, it was found
 necessary to ream the hole preparatory to lining, and by June 15 the
 necessary reaming and lining had been completed. Up to this, although
 we had been somewhat disappointed at our slow rate of progress,
 occasioned partly by the unfavourable nature of the ground and
 partly by the frequent failure of our machinery, we had anticipated
 nothing worse than the possibility of finding our allotted time
 exhausted before we had reached a depth of 1000 feet ; but now, on
 setting the crown to work, it very soon ceased to advance, and Ayles
 shortly afterwards came to me to announce that, in his opinion, the
 boring was a failure.     Nevertheless, some further progess was sub
 sequently made, and on Tuesday, June 16, a depth of 105 feet was
 attained.    It then became once more necessary to ream and line the
  hole. Attempts to ream were continued all through Wednesday and
  Thursday but without success, sand poured into the hole and the
  reamer could not be driven through it. Efforts were made to remove

   504    Prof. W.    J. Sollas.  Report to the Committee appointed
   the sand by a sand-pump, but proved unavailing, the sand flowing in
  faster than it could be pumped out. Ayles assured me that it was
   impossible to descend another foot, and that he considered further
   labour as time and money thrown away. We decided therefore to
  abandon this borehole, nnd to recommence operations on another site,
  if possible in solid rock.
     The structure of the ground passed through in the abandoned
  borehole was as follows : —
                              Sand with some cora/ b/ocks.
           22 ft. 9 in.
                              Cora./ reefs  and   b/ocks    with
                                         some    sand.
             65 ft.
                             Sand with some coral          b/ocks.
            /05ft.
     Although     I  knew of many places where solid rock forms the
  surface of the ground, it was very difficult to find one to which we
  could transport our machinery, the difficulties of landing on a rocky
  shore rendered several promising spots inaccessible by sea, while
  the absence of wheeled vehicles or even wheels, and the nature of the
  ground, seemed to put transportation by land out of the question.
     At last, however, Mr. Hedley pointed out to me a portage called
  Luamanif, and used by the natives for dragging their canoes
  from the lagoon to the seaward side of the island, which at this
  place is very narrow, about 70 yards across.         As this seemed a
  good landing-place,     I submitted it to the consideration of Captain
  Field, who, after a personal examination, agreed that we might
  safely make use of it.         Ayles and his party were then set to
V

          to investigate the Structure of a Coral Reef by Boring.        505
¦work   to sink trial pits on the line of the portage, one of these,
situated 70 feet from the high-water mark on the seaward face of
the reef, was sunk 12 feet through sand and blocks of coral, when
operations were brought a close owing to the influx of sea- water at
high tides. Two other pits were then commenced nearer the sea and
a little to one side (north) of the portage, at the margin of the solid
platform of rock, which extends down to the growing edge of the
reef and which is covered by the sea at high- water. These passed
through sand and fragments of coral. In the most northern of the
two pits the sand was somewhat consolidated, and so, proceeding a
few yards further north, as far in that direction as it would have
been possible to transport our machinery, we opened another pit,
which was sunk for a depth of 11 feet through fragments of coral,
crystalline coral limestone, and partly consolidated sand.               The
bottom of the pit was 2 feet below the seaward margin of the reef,
and aR we were not inconvenienced by an influx of sea-water and
Ayles was of opinion that the rock would " stand," we decided to
make our new venture at this spot.        Taking into consideration the
difficulties of transporting our apparatus,     I do not think a more
favourable locality could have been chosen ; it was close to the very
edge of the rocky platform, which is so hard that Darwin, speaking
                                                           I
of a similar platform in the case of another reef, says " could with
difficulty and only by the aid of a chisel procure chips of rock from
its surface ;" and as near the sea as it was prudent or even possible
to go. Indeed, we had at first some doubt as to whether our pump
                     "     "
ing pipes would live in the surf of the ocean margin, and feared
that the high- water spring tides might inundate the shaft ; our fears
in these respects, however, proved to be groundless.
                                                            Trial pit /.
   Captain Field and myself were impressed with the need of addi
tional boring apparatus, and he proposed that Ayles should go to
 Sydney to see if it could be procured.       I gave much anxious con
sideration to this project, and discussed it with my colleagues,
Messrs. Hedley and Gardiner, and with Ayles. The information I
received from Ayles was not encouraging.            He stated that we
should require a complete equipment of lining tubes from 10 inches
down to 2J inches in diameter, that 10-inch tubes were not to be had
 in Sydney, and that even if we succeeded in obtaining all the

50(5   Prof. W.   J. Sollas.     Report  to the Committee   appointed
appliances we required, the success of the boring would even then by
no means be assured.
   For a doubtful result  I did  not feel justified in incurring the certain
increase in our expenditure which a journey to Sydney would have
involved; the question of time had also to be considered, for had Ayles
gone to Sydney we should on his return have been commencing our
boring at or after the date the Committee had considered it would
have been comploted. Finally, it appeared that the new locality we
had chosen for our work offered fair prospects of success.
   The shaft already sunk to a depth of 11 feet was then timbered
with Pandanus logs, and arrangements made for carrying down a
hole by jumping with a 6-inch chisel. Ayles spoke of getting as far

but after sinking 4 feet he declared it impossible to proceed further1
in this way, the chisel could not be made to continue sinking in a
straight line, the labour was too exhausting, and progress very slow.
It was decided, therefore, to begin boring, Ayles being very hope
ful, as the hole "stood" well. On Thursday, June 25, we accord
ingly made arrangements to shift our boring gear to the new site,
and by Saturday, June 27, this work was completed, chiefly by native
labour, and at a cost of about £10.         The boilers were rolled along
the beach, the rest of the machinery taken by water, and all subse
quently dragged, rolled, or carried across the portage. Lieutenant

Waugh lent us valuable assistance, during the absence of the
guin," in this work.
   Boring was commenced on Friday, July 3, and by 5 o'clock we had
sunk another 4 feet ; progress then became rapid, and on Saturday
evening, when work was knocked off, we had descended in all
46 feet.
                               "
           Very little " core was obtained, however, and at times the
boring bit met with very little opposition as it advanced, seemingly
passing through a vacant space.        Since the water pumped into the
 hole no longer flowed out above, but found its way out by some com
munication with the sea below, it was impossible to determine
whether or not some sand might have been present. It was clear,

however, that the coral rock through which the " bit advanced was
highly cavernous.
   On Monday the hole became filled with fallen fragments and some
sand, it was evident, therefore, that the sides would not hold, and so
recourse was had to lining ; by Thursday, July 9, the hole had been
reamed and lined down to 45 feet, and the work of boring was re
sumed.    On pumping, we had the satisfaction of seeing the water
flowing  out of the top of the hole, but our joy was short-lived, for, on
Monday, June 13, the water was again lost.          On Tuesday, July 14, we
had reached 65 feet, passing for the last 20 feet through sand and coral.
Subsequently we attained a depth of 72 feet, and could then proceed

         to investigate the Structure  of a Coral Beef    by Boring.  507
 no further.      We worked all Thursday and Friday with the sand
 pump, but with no success ; the bottom of the hole was surrounded
 by quicksand containing boulders of coral, and as fast as the sand
 was got out, so fast it flowed in and faster. The water pumped
 down disappeared through the sand, boring and d fortiori reaming
 was impossible, and the tubes could not be driven owing to the inter
 spersed boulders.      Had the tubes been provided with steel driving
 ends we might have forced them down ; as it was, the effect of driv
 ing them was simply to curl in the lower end. Had we been pro
 vided with 4-inch tubes we could have made a fresh start, and might
 have descended another 30 or 40 feet, but even then ultimate success
 would not have been ensured, for the chance of meeting again and
 again with intermixed sand and coral remained always open, and
every such encounter would have required lining tubes of diminished
calibre.
    Baffled in all our endeavours, and no other part of the island offer
ing more hopeful prospects of success, we had no alternative but to
abandon the undertaking, and on July 30 we were taken from the
island in the " Penguin," and returned to Fiji.       On landing there we
had the mortification to learn that additional apparatus was then on
the way to Funafuti, our friends in Sydney having with great
generosity at once despatched machinery for driving in sand on re
ceipt of a letter    I had sent informing them of the failure of our first
 borehole. We had had no reason to expect such spontaneous assist
ance, and even had we been fortunate enough to have remained on
the island till the machinery arrived, we should probably not have
accomplished the object we had in view, though we might possibly
have carried the borehole down to a depth of about 400 feet.
    A very free communication must have existed between the bore
hole and the sea, for whenever a big roller broke upon the reef the
rods lifted, and after the lining had been withdrawn, water spurted
out of the borehole with the fall of every wave. The open nature of
the reef is further indicated by the fact that the sea water rises with
 every tide to fill certain depressions, which occur in many places in
the middle of the island ; as the tide ebbs this water flows away down
fissures, often so rapidly as to form little whirlpools.

    Wherever have seen the reef growing it has always presented
itself as clumps or islets of coral and other organisms with inter
spersed patches of sand, and the borings would seem to indicate that
it maintains this character for a very considerable depth and possibly
throughout.       The structure of the reef appears indeed to be that of a
         "          " of coral
coarse     sponge              with wide interstices, which may be either
empty    or filled with  sand.
   As regards the nature of this " sand," it is important to observe
that it does not consist of coral debris; this material and fragments

more abundant, bat its chief constituents are large foraminifera,
which seem to belong chiefly to two genera (Orbitolites and Tinoporus).
It covers a considerable area of the islands, and has accumulated dur
ing the memory of the inhabitants to such an extent as to silt up
certain parts of the lagoon. This and the abundant growth of corals
and calcareous alga;, such as Halimeda, lead to the belief that the
lagoon is slowly filling up.
   A suggestion has recently been made that more light is likely to
be thrown on the history of atolls by a study of ancient limestones
in the British Isles than by boring in existing reefs. The first essen
tial, however, for such a study would appear to be a knowledge of
the structure of living atolls, for, without this, the identification of
others forming a part of the earth's crust, might remain more or less
a matter for conjecture.      So far as the structure of Funafuti has
been proved by borings, it is scarcely what a field geologist might
have anticipated, and if deposits of a similar nature and origin
should have been encountered in, say, the mountain limestone, it is
doubtful whether, previous to the borings in Funafuti, their inter
pretation would have been easily reached.
   While the boring has proved a failure, the other objects of the ex
pedition have been attained with complete success.       Messrs. Hedley
and Gardiner have made a thorough investigation of the fauna and
flora, both land and marine.     Dr. Collingwood has obtained a good
deal of information of ethnological interest, and wo all have brought
home a fairly complete collection of native implements and manufac
tures. A daily record was kept of maximum and minimum tempera
ture, and of the readings of the dry and wet bulb thermometers.
   The most important contribution, however, and one that        I  think
must, in certain details, greatly modify our views as to the nature of
coral reefs, is afforded by the investigations of Captain Field. Never
before have soundings, both within and without an atoll, been so
closely and systematically made, and the results seem to me commen
surate with the care and pains that have been taken to secure them.
Four series of soundings, " Sections " as they are termed on board
the " Penguin," have been run from the seaward face of the reef out
wards.    How close together the soundings were made is Bhown in
the following table which Captain Field has kindly permitted me to

   The profiles obtained by the four series are closely similar, and, as
regards one important feature, almost identical.                 This is the sudden
change in slope that occurs at or about 140 fathoms.                        Speaking
generally,      one may   describe    Funafuti     as the summit     of  a submerged
conical mountain, the base of which, at a depth of 2,000 fathoms, is
a regular ellipse, 30 miles long by 28 miles broad. It rises with a
very gentle slope, which gradually grows steeper as it asceuds, till
from 400 to 140 fathoms it has an angle of 30° ; at 140 fathoms an

abrupt change occurs, and the slope becomes precipitous, making an
angle of from 75° to 80° for the greater part of its course, till it
passes into the shallow flats of the growing reef.                  It is difficult to
resist the impression that it is the upper 140 fathoms (840 feet)
which represents the true coral reef. A convex curvature of the
profile between 166 and 261 fathoms is probably a talus, produced by
an accumulation of coral debris.

   The conical mountain below the 140 fathoms line, with its parabolic
slope, is suggestively similar to a volcano; but, if so, its crater mnst
have been immense, 10 miles across at least. A volcano, 12,000 feet
in height, with a crater 10 miles in diameter, is, however, not
an unknown phenomenon ; within the limits of the Pacific we may
cite Haleakala, in Maui, Sandwich Islands, as closely comparable.
   A part of my work while on the island was the construction of a
geological sketch map, part of which is shown below ; its interest
chiefly centres in a broad expanse near the Mission Station, where the
two narrow limbs of the island meet, or, if it be preferred, whence

by   a mangrove swamp, the floor of which          formed by a dead coral

and the other Heliopora ccerulea. For a great, part of the day this
floor lies bare and dry, the frayed ends of the Heliopora standing like
broken reeds,    inches above its surface, and the great clumps of
                      6
Porites forming a series of stepping stones of equal height. Neither
of these corals stands long exposure to the air on Funafuti they   ;
require constant submergence, and we are thus led to regard their
upper surface as marking what was at one time the level of low tide
in   the swamp; but since the present level of low tide                below the

low tides. Not necessarily an elevation of the reef Darwin has admi:

 by pits in its floor, which enter subterranean channels running sea

 with that of the sea or of the lagoon.         I  accordingly levelled across

                           it                that   for a considerable part

 that under these conditions the corals would continue to live, and
I   think, therefore, that the reef must have undergone some slight
 elevation, to the amount, perhaps, of          4feet. This conclusion          in           is
 accordance with Dana's view, and          is  supported by observations on
 some other features    of  the  island,  such,   for example, as the occur
 rence of an interrupted line of low cliffs, sometimes passing into a
 series of pinnacles, generally about     4 feet in height, as measured from
 low water level. In the annexed section the cliffs are farther from

               immediately antecedent stage, the reef must have
               been awash, or, perhaps, wholly submerged, and
               the present terrestrial fauna and flora must have
               reached it subsequent to its elevation, as sea drift,

                soundings obtained by Captain Field appear to
                support Darwin's theory of coral atolls ; there
          '5
                remains, however, one very important branch of
k               the subject which stands in need of renewed in
          !     vestigation, and this is the bathymetrical limit to
5               coral life.
                   Not till I had obtained a close acquaintance with
                the difficulties of dredging on the steep sides of an
                atoll did   I  recognise on how frail a basis onr
                accepted conclusions rest.     It is a task difficult
                enough to get np corals from the lagoon in com
IE              paratively shallow water ; from the sides of the
                reef it is well nigh impossible.      To obtain dead
                corals from great depths proves little ; living corals
                are generally found with dead associates, and the
                latter are the more readily detached and brought
                to the surface.
                    The weight of the evidence we already possess
                is admittedly in favour of a comparatively shallow
                bathymetrical limit, but much remains to be done
                before we can speak of any limit as definitely
                ascertained.

       Communication from Professor Oliver Lodge, F.R.S.
       Received and read February 11, 1897.
    I  ask permission to bring before the notice of the Fellows a
notable discovery recently made at Leyden by Dr. P. Zeeman, who is
 now elected Professor of Physics in the University of Amsterdam.
                               I
 To put myself in order, will state that I have set up apparatus
suitable for showing the effect, and have verified its primary feature,
 viz., that both lines in the ordinary spectrum of sodium are broad
 ened when a magnetic field is concentrated upon the flame emitting
the light.
    Zeeman has observed it likewise with lithium, and with absorption
as well as with emission spectra ; taking precautions against decep
tion by spurious effects due to changes of density or of temperature.
 It is thus probably not a chemical fact, dependent on the nature of a
substance, but a physical fact, dependent on the nature of radiation
and absorption, i.e., a fact connected with the interchange of energy
between ether and matter.
    Faraday appears to have looked for some such phenomenon in the
course of his latest magneto-optic researches in 1862, but he had not
a Rowland concave grating at his disposal, and the effect is small.
    I saw it with a 1-inch flat reflection grating containing 14,600
lines, and with an oxy-coal gas flame playing on pipe clay supporting
carbonate      of soda between pointed poles.       I tried to see it by
widening the slit till the D lines almost encroached on each other ;
thinking thereby to see the residual dark space obliterated by the
magnetic action. A luminous haze seemed to spread over the dark
chink when the magnet was excited, but the chink itself did not dis
appear; and the effect is more conspicuous and easier to observe
when the narrowest slit possible is used, and when a micrometer
spider-line is set down the middle of one of the D lines, of the second
order spectrum, well defined in a field of considerable magnifying
power.
   The broadening is then unmistakable, and is symmetrical on each
side  ; but I judge that the edges are not so bright as the central
portion.     The line appears brightened as well as broadened, i.e., the
previous borders of       the line  are  brightened, and there are also
gradated extensions.       If the focussing is sharp enough to show a
narrow, dark reversal    line down the middle of either sodium line, that
dark line completely    disappears when the magnet is excited.
   With the help of       Professor H. A. Lorentz, the discoverer has
initiated a simple theory of the effect, by considering the effect of

   Lorentz's view, to be emitting polarised light, viz., plane polarised in
  directions normal to the lines of force, and circularly polarised in a
  direction along those lines.
       This prediction has been experimentally verified by Zeeman, and
  has likewise boen confirmed by myself.               The flame being looked at
  from a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field, the light which
  will be dispersed by the grating to form the extended borders of a
  line is plane polarised, with its electric oscillations normal to the
  field's lines of force.
      I hope to have the pleasure of communicating an English version
  of Professor Zeeman's complete paper to the March number of the
  '
    Philosophical Magazine.'

            Communication          from Dr. J. Lakmor, F.R.S. Received
            and read February 11, 1897.
      In the       course  of the development of a dynamical hypothesis*               I
  have been led to express the interaction between matter and ether
  as wholly arising from the permanent electrons associated with the
  matter ; and reference was made to von Helmholtz (1893) and Lorentz
  (1895) as having followed up similar views.                    A footnote in Dr.
  Zeeman's paper has drawn my attention to an earlier memoir of
  Lorentz (1892), in which it was definitely laid down that the electric
  and optical influences of matter must be formulated by a modified
  Weberian theory, in which the moving electrons affect each other,
 not directly by action at a distance but mediately by transmission
 across the ether in accordance with the Faraday-Maxwell scheme of
 electric relations.         The development of a physical scheme in which
 such action can be pictured as possible and real, not merely taken as
 an unavoidable assumption which must be accepted in spite of the
 paralogisms which it apparently involves,t was a main topic in tli6
 papers above mentioned.
     The experiments of Dr. Zeeman verify deductions drawn by
 Lorentz from this view. It might, however, be argued that inasmuch
 as a magnetic field alters the index of refraction of circularly pola
 rised light, which depends on the free periods of the material
 molecules, it must therefore, quite independently of special theory,

actual phenomena      do   not  seem to be thus reciprocal.      On the
electric theory of light it is only the dispersion in material media that
arises from direct influence of the free molecular periods, the main
refraction arises from the static dielectric coefficient of the material,
which is not connected with the periods of molecules.* From the
phenomena of magneto-optic reflexion it may be shown that, on the
hypothesis that the Faraday effect is due to regular accumulated
influences of the individual molecules, it must be involved in the
relation between the electric force (PQK) and the electric polarisa
tion of the material (f'g'h1), of type

 where (ciC2c3) is proportional to the impressed magnetic field. This
relation, interpreted in the view that the electric character of a
molecule is determined by the orbits of its electrons, simply means
that the capacity of electric polarisation of the molecule depends on
its orientation with regard to the imposed magnetic field, that, in fact,
the static value of K, depending on the molecular configurations just
as much as do the free periods, is altered by the magnetic field. This
relation agrees with the main feature of rotatory dispersion, namely,
that it roughly follows the law of the inverse square of the wave

                           p. 813 (and Dr. Zeeman's calculation, in fact,
forms a sufficient indication of the order of magnitude of the result),
that in an ideal simple molecule consisting of one positive and one
negative electron revolving round each other, the inertia of the
molecule would have to be considerably less than the chemical
masses of ordinary molecules, in order to lead to an influence on the
period, of the order observed by Dr. Zeeman.       But then line in the      a

epicycles superposed on the main orbits of the various electrons in

     OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   Hermann    Kopp, who was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal
Society   in 1888, and who died in Heidelberg on February 20,
1892, was born on October      30, 1817, at Hanau, where his father,
Johann Heinrich Kopp, practised with some distinction as a physi
cian. The father occupied himself in his leisure with experimental
chemistry, and a few papers by him on mineral analysis and on
physiological     chemical products are to be found in Leonhard's
  Taschenbuch and Gehlen's ' Journal.'
'               '
                                           The subject of this notice
received his school training at the gymnasium of his native town,
where he was well grounded in Latin and Greek.              The facility
he thus acquired in reading classical literature never left him, and
proved of incalculable service to him in the preparation of his great
work on the history of chemistry. At eighteen he went to Heidel
berg, where he studied chemistry under Leopold Gmelin and physics
under Wilhelm Muncke.         At that time Heidelberg presented few
opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of practical chemistry.
Gmelin was Ordinary Professor of Medicine as well as of Chemistry,
and his chemical teaching was regarded as subordinate to that of
medicine. Kopp left Heidelberg for Marburg, where he graduated
in 1838, presenting to the Philosophical Faculty as his thesis an
                 '
essay entitled     De oxydorum densitatis calculo reperiendse modo,' in
which we trace the germs of the experimental work by which he is
best known.        From Marburg he passed on to Giessen, attracted
thither by the growing fame of the chemical laboratory which Liebig
had called into existence. Here he made, under Liebig's direction,
the only investigation in pure chemistry that he ever published, an
unimportant paper on the decomposition of mercaptan by nitric acid,
for the most part a repetition of the work of Lowig and Weidmann
on ethylsulphonic acid and its salts.
   Kopp, however, elected to cast in his lot with that of Giessen, and
in 1841 he became' Privat Docent in that University, lecturing on theo
retical chemistry, crystallography, meteorology, and physical geo
graphy.    He now began, when barely twenty-four years of age, his
            '
celebrated History of Chemistry,' the work by which he is best known
to the literary world.    In 1843 he became Extraordinary Professor,
and on the departure of Liebig to Munich in 1852 he and Heinrich
Will were made Ordinary Professors, and were placed in charge of
                                                                6

                                     ii
the Giessen laboratory.       This position he resigned after the first
year, leaving   Will the sole control of the laboratory.   Kopp remained
at Giessen nearly a quarter of a century, and all his most im
portant experimental work was done there. In 1863 he received a
call from Heidelberg, which he accepted, and here he stayed until
his death, occupying himself with lectures on the history of che
mistry and oh chemical crystallography. He was repeatedly solicited
to accept a position in one of the larger Universities, notably in
Leipsig and in Berlin, but all attempts to draw him from his dear
Ruperto- Carolina were fruitless. " Even Bunsen alone," he was
wont to say, "keeps me fast in Heidelberg."
   Kopp's 'History of Chemistry' is his greatest literary effort.
The first volume of it appeared in 1843, and the fourth and final
volume in 1847. By the publication of this classical work, Kopp,
when barely thirty years of age, suddenly found himself famous.
His life-long friend, von Hofmann, who was then at Giessen, has left
us the following account of the sensation which the work made on its
appearance   : —
   " With  one accord his contemporaries      recognised that here was a
production which, whether they regarded the thoroughness of re
search that it displayed, or the manner in which the material
resulting from that research was sifted and arranged, was without a
parallel in the literature of any other country.        And even to-day,
after the lapse of nearly half a century, there is no historical work on
chemistry that can be even remotely compared with it. Numbers of
books relating to the same subject, some of considerable meiit, have
since been published in Germany and France, but it is not difficult to
perceive that they are all grounded on Kopp's great work."
   For upwards of forty years Kopp had it in contemplation to bring
out a new edition, and much of the later historical work he published,
such as his ' Beitrage zur Geschichte der Chemie,' which appeared
                                       '
between 1869 and 1875, and the           Entwicklung der Chemie in der
neueren Zeit,' printed under the auspices of the Historical Commis
sion of the Bavarian Academy in 1873, together with the two
volumes on 1 Die Alchemie in alterer und neuerer Zeit,' grew out of the
materials he had gathered together. " But," again to quote Hofmann,
" the better is here the enemy of the good. Kopp postponed the ' ver-
                                     '
mehrte und verbesserte Auflage           year after year, in the hope of
being able to make a fuller study of certain special periods. Who
ever is familiar with the mass of profoundly interesting matter he
had accumulated, or who has had the opportunity of seeing the
bulky note-books in which it was stored, must deeply lament that the
hand which could alone arrange these treasures is now stiffened in
death."
   The literature of chemistry is further indebted to Kopp for the

                                      iii
part he played in the foundation        and execution of the well-known
'
   Jahresbericht fiber die Fortschritte der Chemie und verwandter
Theile anderer Wissenschaften.'         This great work was, in a sense,
the outcome and continuation of Berzelius' ' Yearbook.'              On the
death of the Swedish chemist in 1848, the leaders of the Giessen
school of chemical thought determined to carry on his work of
registering the progress of chemistry, but on a somewhat different
plan.     Berzelius at the time of his death was the greatest chemical
critic of the time, and wielded his authority with all the despotism of
                                                    '
an Oriental potentate. The ' Jahresbericht of Liebig and Kopp
differed fundamentally both in plan and execution from its Swedish
prototype.     It was to be a review of the year's progress, not only in
chemistry, but also in all those sciences which were associated with
chemistry, or were, in any definite sense, ancillary to it ; it was to be
done impartially, and with no special reference to any set of dogmas
or particular school of chemical thought.           Practically the whole of
the more active members of the scientific side of the Philosophical
Faculty of the University were concerned in its production.         To Kopp
fell the greater share of the arrangement, and of the general editorial
management ; in addition, he undertook the summaries relating to
Theoretical, Physical, and Inorganic Chemistry.           To Buff and Zam-
miner was entrusted Pure Physics ; to Heinrich Will, Organic
Chemistry ; to Knapp, Technical Chemistry ; to Ettling, Mineralogy ;
and to Dieffenbach, Chemical Geology.            The first volume appeared
towards the close of 1849, and consisted of a review of the work of
1847 and 1848.         Liebig continued to be associated with Kopp as
editor for some years after his removal to Munich, but in 1857 his
place was taken by Will, who acted as co-editor until 1862, when
 Kopp resigned his share in the responsible direction of the publica
tion just prior to his removal to Heidelberg.         No chemist active in
the prosecution of research needs to be reminded of the value of the
'
    Jahresbericht.' It has undoubtedly exercised a most beneficient
influence on the development of chemical science in Germany, and it
has been of the greatest service to those chemists in this country to
whom German is not an unknown tongue.
     In 1851 Kopp joined Liebig and Wohler in the production of the
 '
   Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie,' and for many years he took
the responsible share in its management. He prepared the section
on " Theoretical Chemistry
                                " in that well-known text-book, Graham-
         '                         '           '
 Otto's Lehrbuch der Chemie and his Introduction to Crystallo
graphy,' written specially for chemists, was long a standard work.
      Kopp's scientific papers relating to his experimental and critical
labours appeared mainly in ' Poggendorff's Annalen,' and in the
'
   Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie.'            Two or three of his early
                                            '
communications were printed in the            Philosophical Magazine,' and

                                      iv
his elaborate memoir, " On the Specific Heat of Compound Sub
stances," in which he sought to develop Neumann's law, was published
by the Royal Society.       The ' Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific
          '
Papers gives the number of his papers as 65.
    Kopp enjoys an almost unique position as an investigator.        The
one consistent purpose of his work was to establish a connexion
between the physical and chemical nature of substances ; to prove, in
fact, that all physical constants are to be regarded as functions of the
chemical nature of molecules. It is not implied, of course, that the
conception of such an interdependence originated with him. As a
matter of fact, almost immediately after the publication of Dalton's
'
   New System of Chemical Philosophy,' in which the doctrine of
atoms was revived to account for the fundamental facts of chemical
union, the endeavour was made to connect the chemical attributes of
a substance with one of its best defined physical constants, viz., its
atomic      mass.    Prout's hypothesis is, in reality, the generalised
expression    of  such an attempt ; it is an adumbration of Mende-
leeff's great discovery of the Law of Periodicity.         But it may
be justly claimed for Kopp that no one before him made any
systematic effort to connect such of the physical qualities of sub
stances as admit of quantitative statement with the stoichiometrical
values of such bodies. The sporadic attempts made prior to 1840
were practically fruitless on account of the imperfect nature of the
physical data up to that time extant.
    When Kopp began his inquiries, very few boiling points were
 known, even approximately ; and he had, as a preliminary step, to
ascertain the conditions under which such observations must be made
 in order that accurate and comparable results could be obtained.
 The thermal expansions of barely half a dozen liquids had been
 measured, and the very methods of making such measurements with
 precision had to be worked out.
    At the outset of his investigations, Kopp found the physical con
 stants with which he was more immediately concerned very much as
  Berzelius found Dalton's values of .the relative weights of the atoms ;
  at the close of his work they were hardly less accurately known than
  were those stoichiometric numbers to the ascertainment of whidh the
  great Swedish chemist had dedicated his life.
     Kopp's more important memoirs readily and naturally fall into
  comparatively few groups, viz., (1) those concerning the relations
  between the specific gravities of substances and their molecular
  weights; (2) those treating of the relations between boiling point
 and chemical composition ; and (3) the papers relating to the specific
  heats of solids and liquids.     As regards the other papers, only the
 briefest notice is here possible.   Much of this work was of a pioneer
  character,  and  his  conclusions have necessarily been modified by

                                       V.
subsequent research.         His "law "of boiling-points is no longer
regarded as an accurate expression of experimental facts, and his
deductions with respect to specific volumes have been largely affected'
by subsequent work.        It has been conclusively shown that molecular'
volume is not a purely additive property.         There is no longer room-,
for doubt that the molecular volumes of substancas are affected by
far more conditions than Kopp was able to take cognisance of.
  •
     The value CH, — 22 has no other significance than as expressing
the average increment in volume in successive members of a homo-1
logons series.       Indeed, as the physical data increase, it becomes
doubtful    whether    even this mean value is cDrrect.    Later observations
appear to show that the value augments as the series is ascended.
The relation C = 2H no longer applies to carbon compounds in
general.     What is true of carbon and hydrogen is equally true of
oxygen, whether as carbonyl- or as hydroxyl-oxygen.            No definite or
uniform values can be assigned to oxygen such that the molecular
 volume of a liquid can be a priori determined.         The valnes given by
 Kopp are simply mean values, but the actual volumes are affected by
 conditions of which, as yet, we have no very precise knowledge or any
certain means of measuring.         The values for the other elements are,
of course, affected by these considerations.       Thus the specific volume
of chlorine is obtained on the assumption        that   the values for carbon
and hydrogen are constant. AH, then, tends to show that the molecular
 volume is not the sum of constant atomic volumes.
      Although Kopp's theoretical conclusions hardly admit, of the
 generality which he assumed them to possess, his experimental work
 remains unassailed and unassailable, a monument to his ingenuity,
 manipulative skill, his rigid sense of accuracy, and illimitable
 patience.

      Dr. Johx Rae, LL.D. (Edin.),      a traveller in Arctic America, of
extraordinary      energy and   endurance,  a keen observer of Nature, and
 the discoverer of the fate of the Franklin expedition, was born in
 Orkney in 1813, died in London in 1893, and is buried in the
cathedral of St. Magnus at Kirkwall, where a statue is erected to his
 memory.
    . He qualified  as a surgeon in Edinburgh, and as such he accom-;
panied one of the ships of the Hudson's Bay Company, whose servico
be joined, and then for ten years he resided at Moose Factory.
 (1) His first journey of pure exploration was a boat voyage along the
coast of Hudson'* Bay to Repulse Bay, where he wintered, and, in;
the following year he surveyed a coast line of 700 miles, connecting,
 the surveys of Ross in Boothia with those of Parry at Fury and,
 Heckla Strait. (2) Next he joined the expedition pf .Sir J. Richard
                                                                   6  2

 son   in 1848 in search for Sir     J. Franklin, daring which the whole
 coast was explored that lay between the months of the Mackenzie and
 the Coppermine Rivers.      (3) In 1851, at the request of Government,
 he explored and mapped, with the slenderest outfit, 700 miles of the
south coast of Wollaston Land and Victoria Land, still in search of
Sir J. Franklin, for which achievement he received the gold medal of
 the Geographical Society.     Its result was greatly to narrow the range
 of possibilities as to the locality of the missing expedition. (4) He
 took charge of a boat expedition, proved the insular character of
 King William's Laud, and came at last upon relics of Franklin's party
 and received verbal information from the Eskimo that gave the first
 definite information as to their fate. The disaster occurred at the
 mouth of the Back River, a little more than 200 miles in a direct line
 from the place where he heard of it. For this achievement he
 received the promised grant of £10,000 from Government.           He did
 not visit the spot himself, but his information as to the site and the
 completeness of the disaster, was soon abundantly confirmed. After
 this he made some further travel of interest, though by no means of
 the importance of the above, surveying a route for a telegraph line
 across Iceland and in North America.
    This bald statement of itineraries will give but a poor idea, except
 to Arctic travellers, of the severity of the work accomplished.       To
supply the deficiency, the following quotation is given from the
address of Sir R. Murchison when presenting the Gold Medal to
 Dr. Rae ; his remarks chiefly referring to the jonrneys numbered
 above as (1) and (3).
    " With a boldness never
                                 surpassed, he (Dr. Rae) determined on
 wintering on the proverbially desolate shores of Repulse Bay, where,
or in the immediate neighbourhood, one expedition of two ships had
previously wholly perished, and two others were all but lost. There
he maintained his party on deer shot principally by himself, and spent
ten months of an Arctic winter in a hut of stones, the locality not
 even yielding drift timber.    With no other fuel than a kind of hay
 made of the Andromeda telrugona, he preserved his men in health, and
thus enabled them to execute their arduous surveying journeys of
upwards of 1,000 miles round Committee Bay (the southern portion
of Boothia Gulf) in the spring.          Next season he brought his party
back to the Hudson Bay posts in better working condition than wher
he set out, and with but a small diminution of the few bags of pro
visions he had taken with him.
    " On his last journeys, in which he travelled more than 3,000 miles
in snow-shoes, Dr. Rae has shown equal judgment and perseverance.
Dreading, from his former experience, that the sea might be frozen,
he determined on a spring journey over the ice, and performed a most
  extraordinary one. His last starting place at Fort Confidence on the

                                      vii
   Great Bear Lake, being at a distance of more than 150 miles from
   the coast by the route he was compelled to take, he could not, as in
   the parties of our naval expeditions, travel on the ice with capacious
   sledges, and was, therefore, obliged to restrict his provisions and
   baggage to the smallest possible weight.   With a pound of fat daily
   for fuel, and without the possibility of carrying a tent, he set out
  accompanied by two men only, and trusting solely for shelter to snow
   houses he taught his men to build, accomplished a distance of
   1,060 miles in 39 days, or 27 miles per day including stoppages, and
  this without the aid of advanced depots, and dragging a sledge him
  self great part of the way. The spring journey, and that which
  followed in the summer in boats, during which 1,700 miles were
  traversed in 80 days, have proved the continuity of Wollaston and
  Victoria lands along a distance of nearly 1,100 miles, and have shown
  that they are separated by a strait from N. Somerset and Boothia,
  through which the flood tide sets from the north. In this way Dr.
  Rae has performed most essential service, even in reference to the
 search after Franklin, by limiting the channels of outlet between the
 continent of America and the Arctic Islands."
      It is easy to understand that Dr. Rue's views as to the equipment
 of expeditions in Arctic travel would differ in many respects, rightly
 or wrongly, from those who advocated the costly naval expeditions
 then in vogue. He could point to instances of his own superior
 success, and to the disasters that befel the survivors of tho Franklin
 expedition, as they toiled homewards with a miscellaneous collection
 of heavy articles. Putting forward his views, as he did with point
 and insistence, his remarks were, as a rule, somewhat unwelcome to
 the naval authorities.
     In early middle life Dr. Rae was remarkable for manly beauty in
 form and feature, combined with a temper that was quick and some
 what fiery. In a book on Ethnology, where each of the human races
 was represented by a single specimen, it was noticed that an old
 photograph of Dr. Rae had been utilised to represent the Caucasian
type.
      Dr. Rae's house contained an interesting series of specimens illus
trating the fauna and flora of arctic America and the domestic
 methods of the Etkimo, which be delighted to show and to explain,
for he was a most courteous host, well aided by his wife. As a
 narrator he was delightful, being always lucid while full and circum
stantial.      His memoirs and speeches were stamped throughout with
those characteristics.
     His interest in the regions where he gained his fame remained
anabated to the last. He died, regretted by many friends, in his
eightieth     year.

    Franz Ernst Nf.umans was born on September 11, 1798, at Joa-
chitnsthal, a small town about forty miles to the north-^ast of Berlin.
At the early    age of seventeen  he entered the army as a volunteer
to fight against Napoleon in the campaign of 1815.            A serious
wound, received in the battle of Ligny, kept him to his bed for roany
weeks ; but, on recovery, he once more joined the army.          At tbe
end of the war he returned to his lessons at the "Gymnasium"
of Berlin, and subsequently entered the University as a student of
theology. Soon afterwards he migrated to Jena, where he came under
the influence of C. S. Weiss, the Professor of Mineralogy, and
turned his attention to that subject.    His papers, published between
1823 and 1830, all referred to crystallography,   and even his earliest
work attracted attention, and left a lasting impression on the science
of mineralogy.     It secured him a call to the University of Kiinigs-
borg as
          " Privat-docent," where Bessel, Jacobi, and Dove became his
colleagues. Under their influence he gradually drifted more and
more towards the study of physics.      His knowledge of mathematics
was acquired by private study, for although the University of Berlin
nominally possessed a teacher of mathematics, no lectures were given.
If the circumstances of Neumann's early education are considered,
it is remarkable that he obtained such a command of mathematical
physics, and this seems to have been ascribed by himself to the
careful study of Fourier's writings, which he admired to such an
extent that he made a manuscript copy of the great treatise on the
'
   Conduction of Heat.'     In the year 1828 Neumann was appointed
Professor Extraordinarius at a salary of 200 thalers (£30).      Bessel,
who had formed a high opinion of his powers, wrote in the same
year a letter to tbe Minister of Education pressing Neumann's claim
to a better position.     The letter had the desired effect, and Neu
mann was nominated, in 1829, Professor Ordinarius, and his salary
raised to £75. He never left Konigsberg, continuing his professorial
duties until 1876, and died on May 23, 1895.
    Among his earlier papers on physical subjects, attention must
be drawn to one on the specific heat of minerals           (Pogg. Ann.,
1831). It contains an extension of Dulong and Petit's law of specific
heats to compound bodies having a similar chemical constitution,
but is chiefly valuable for the improvement, both in the methods
employed and in the theoretical discussion of the experimental results.
It is shown how the method of mixture may be applied to the case
of badly conducting substances. The second paper treats of the
specific heat of water. The older observers had stated that when
hot water is poured into cold water, the resulting temperature of
the mixture is lower than that calculated, on the assumption that
the specific lieat of water is constant. Neumann showed that this
result is due to errors of experimentation, and demonstrated with

improved apparatus, that the specific heat of water increases with
rising temperature.     On the assumption that the rate of change is
uniform, Neumann calculated the ratio of the specific heats at 100°
and 0° to be T0176.       The assumption made is now known to be
incorrect, but it cannot be said that Neumann's experimental result
has been much improved upon by later investigators.            Although
nearly all fields of physical science have at different times been
successfully treated by Neumann, his fame chiefly rests on his theo
retical investigations in optics and electricity.       After Fresnel's
fundamental researches, which had shown the possibility of ex
plaining the most complicated optical phenomena by the undulatory
theory, it became necessary to connect that theory more closely with
the conditions of wave-propagation in ordinary elastic bodies.         In
other words, an elastic solid theory of the ether formed the next step
to be taken, and the name of Neumann will always remain associated
together with that of Cauchy, McCullagh, and Green in the early
efforts to found a truly dynamical theory of light. In the first paper,
" Theorie der doppelten Strahlenbrechung abgeleitet aus den Glei-
chungen der Mechanik," Neumann obtains a wave-surface identical
 with that deduced somewhat earlier by Cauchy.           In the case of
 biaxal crystals it does not agree with that of Fresnel.   It consists of
 three sheets, one of them being due to the longitudinal wave.       The
difference of the two other sheets with Fresnel's surface is, however,
more nominal than real, for as Stokes pointed out, in his Report on
Double Refraction, the difference may, by proper adjustment of
the constants, be made to show itself only in the tenth place of
decimals.     The same report gives full details on the comparison
between the theories of Cauchy, Neumann and Green. A further
important contribution to optics was made in the year 1835 under
the title " Theoretische Untersuchungen der Gesetze, nach welchen
das Licht an der Grenze zweier vollkommen durchsichtigen Medien
reflectirt und gebrochen wird."     This paper raises the difficult ques
 tion of the mathematical expression for the conditions which must
 bold at the surface separating two crystalline media. For well con
 sidered reasons Neumann adopts the view that the density of the
 ether is the same in all media, and follows out this hypothesis to its
logical consequences.     The same problem was treated at the same
 time by McCullagh by very different and simpler methods, but the
 results of both investigators were identical.   Neumann further con
 firmed his equations by experiment.    The general acceptance of the
 electromagnetic theory has now considerably changed our point of
 view, but the historical importance of Neumann's work must be con
 ceded in spite of certain defects which may, with justice, be urged
 against it.
    Several further papers treated of optical subjects, amongst which,

                                           X
perhaps, the most important refers to double refraction in strained
uncrystalline bodies.
     Neumann* next turned his attention to electricity, and in two im
portant papers, published in 1845 and 1847, established the laws of
induction of electrical currents.           We meet here, for the first time,
               "
with the electrodynamic potential."                  It is shown how currents,
induced in one circuit either by the motion of conductors carrying
electric currents, or by a change in the intensity of the current, may
be deduced from one function depending on the relative position of
the conductors, and that this function will also determine the
mechanical forces acting between the conductors.                        To appreciate
fully the great advance which was made by these two memoirs, it is
necessary to realise that the papers were published before it had been
shown, by Helmholtz and Lord Kelvin, how the principle of the con
servation of energy may be utilised in the treatment of the problem.
It may also be pointed out that Neumann's investigations are deduced
 from Lenz' laws, which are direct consequences of the principle of
energy ; so that Neumann's treatment may, indirectly, be said to
 depend on that principle.
     Neumann was the first to solve the problem of the magnetisation
 induced in an ellipsoid of revolution under the action of any mag
 netic forces. Other important contributions relate to the functions
 known as spherical harmonics.              It is a matter for regret that his
 first paper on that subject (' Astronomische Nachrichten,' 1838) was
 completely overlooked by magneticians until Ad. Schmidt recently
 drew attention to it.              The method which might with great
 advantage have been employed in the treatment of terrestrial mag
 netism, may be explained hy reference to the simpler problem of
 expanding a function of one variable by means of Fourier's series.
 For instance, if the daily changes of temperature are to be expressed in
 such a Reries from hourly readings of the thermometera, a very simple
 and well-known process leads to the determination of the constants.
 Neumann's investigations led him to an analogous process for the
 expansion of a function in a series of spherical harmonics, the func
 tions having known values at the points of intersection of certain
 latitude and longitude circles on a sphere.f
      Neumann's last publication was a memoir (edited by his son, C.
 Neumann), ' Beitrage zur Theorie der Kugelfunctionen,' which con
  tains many interesting theoretical researches on that subject.
     * Neumann's initials arc often incorrectly given   ; tlius, in the text of Maxwell's
  '                               '
    Electricity and Magnetism        (second   edition)   he is uniformly quoted       as
  J.  Neumann.
     t In  both the problems mentioned the values of the constantf are really indeter
  minate,   but the solution gives, under certain assumptions, their most probable
  values. Care should be taken that in any actual problem the assumptions are really
  justified.

                                             zi
    Neumann's publications are not sufficient to give an adequate idea
 of his life's work. As a teacher he exerted a wide-spread influence,
 and the progress of physical science in Germany is largely indebted
to the stimulating influence which he exercised, especially with the
                 '
help of the Mathematisch-Physikalisches                  Seminar,' founded by him
in conjunction with Jacobi and Sohnke. The object of this institu
 tion was to supplement the teaching given in lectures, and to intro
 duce students into the methods of original research. ExerciRes were
set to the stndents by the directors of the seminar, and, as Neumann
 himself explained, " In the choice of problems                 I laid stress on their
referring     to   points  of  practical importance,        such   as the application
of Gauss' theory of principal points and planes in a system of lenses ;
or that the selected exercise should lead students to an experimental
investigation of a problem which they had treated in a theoretical
manner."
    There was never, probably, a school of original research conducted
in so systematic a manner as this seminar, in which Neumann was
the leading spirit. Annual reports of the work done by each student
were sent in to the Prussian Minister of Education, and, occasionally,
money prizes were given for a research of special merit. An interest
ing account of the history of this seminar is contained in a notice of
Neumann's life by P. Volkmann.* Its importance may be recognised
by the fact that Kirchhoff's first papers on the distribution of electric
conductors, and H. Wild's construction of his photometer and polari-
meter, figure amongst the direct results of the teaching given in the
seminar. Kirchhoff's great powers were soon recognised by Neumann,
and when, in the year 1846, Neumann had set as a special prize problem
" The determination of the constants on which the intensity of in
duced currents depends," the prize was awarded to him for a research
which contained the first measurement of a resistance in electro-mag
netic measure.          Neumann's success as a teacher will be appreciated
by reference, in Volkmann's publication, to the doctor dissertations of
bis pnpils, which were carried out under his guidance. Amongst the
students who flocked to hear his lectures at Konigsberg, we find
Borchardt, Durege, Lipschitz, KirchhofF, Wild, C. Neumann, Clebsch,
Auwers, Quincke, and Voigt.
    Neumann was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in
1862, a Corresponding Member of the French Academy in 1863, and
received the Copley Medal in the year 1887.

    By the death of Sir Joseph Prestwich              British geological science
loses one of its oldest, as well as one of its most distinguished
votaries.     Descended      from an old Lancashire family (in which, for
some cause       or other,  a  baronetcy has lain dormant for some genera,
lions), he was born at Pensbury, Clapham, on March 12, 1812.*
After some preliminary schooling he was sent to Paris, where he
remained for two years in a school attached to the College Bonrbon.
He was then transferred to Dr. Valpy's, at Reading, and finally
entered University College, London, soon after its establishment.
He there worked diligently in the chemical and natural philosophy
classes under Dr. Turner and Dr. Larduer, availing himself also of
the geological and mineralogical collections in the British Musenm.
    While still at College he started a Society among his fellow
students, each momber of which had in his turn to deliver a lecture
on chemistry or some branch of natural philosophy.                This " Zetetical
Society" had rooms of its own, and a small laboratory, in Surrey
Street, Strand.        It consisted of about fourteen members ; but its
existence was of limited duration.            Mr. Prestwich himself was called
away   from    it to join  the  business   of his father, who was a well-known
wine merchant in Mark Lane ; and he remained closely connected
with the house and business for nearly forty years.                   Happily, his
commercial avocations to some degree aided, instead of restricting, his
pursuit of geological studies. He had to make frequent visits to
France and Belgium, in both of which countries he formed lasting
friendships with the leading geologists and palaeontologists of the
day ; and he made himself personally familiar with the actual strata
and fossils which they had described. Not only so, but his business
among the country connexions of the firm carried him to nearly
every part of the United Kingdom, and the hours unclaimed by bis
engagements were enthusiastically devoted to the study of the local
geology of the districts he visited. His comprehensive eye enabled
him rapidly to appreciate and to grasp the leading features, topo
graphical and geological, of most of the areas which in those days
possessed an exceptional geological interest ; and those who in later
years had the good fortune to accompany him to such spots were sur
prised to find how retentive was his memory and how intimate was
his acquaintance with every pit, quarry, and rock-section that in any
way illustrated the geological problem under consideration.
    His first published papers dealt with the fossil-beariug deposits of
the neighbourhood of Gramrie, Banffshire — particularly with the strata
containing ichthyolites, and with the shell-bearing layers of the Till —
 and the international character of his geological work was exhibited
   * For much that is here said I am indebted to a
                                                       memoir by Dr. Henry Wood-
 ward, F.R.S., published in the ' Geological Magazine,' 1893, p. 242.  I haTe also to
 thank Professor Lapworth for kind assistance.

                                    xiii
 by his  following paper, on " Les Debris de Mammiferes terrestres
 qui se trouvent dans l'Argile plastique aux Environs d'Epernay."
 Though written at an earlier date, these memoirs were not published
 until 1837. He had already, in 1833, become a Fellow of the Geological
 Society. His memoir on the
                                " Geology of Coalbrookdale," published
 in the Transactions of that Society in 1836, was founded mainly on
 visits made to Coalbrookdale in the years 1831 and 1832. This work,
 which was accompanied by descriptions of new plants and mollusca
 by his friend Professor Morris, was the earliest monograph on the
 structure of a British coalfield. It at once established his reputation
 as a geologist, and it has ever since been numbered among our
 British classics.
    From about 1846 onwards for several years, his attention was
 mainly concentrated upon the tertiary deposits of the London basin,
 and he published a work on the water-bearing characters of these
 deposits in 1851. But the scientific results of his investigations
 were of far higher importance.        He not only reduced the little
 known English tertiaries into proper system (establishing the sepa
 rate existence of certain local beds to which he gave the name of the
 Thanet Sands, proving the synchronism of the Reading beds with
 those of Woolwich, and fixing the true position of the London clay
 with respect to the Hampshire basin), but he succeeded in correlating
 the tertiary beds of England, France, and Belgium in such a manner
 that his classification was accepted by most geologists, and has stood
 the test of time.
    This comprehensive study of the tertiary group naturally led Mr.
 Prestwich onward to the investigation of the later and more superficial
 deposits ; and the acquaintance which the writer of these pages had the
 good fortune to form with him in 1851, led to an enduring friendship and
 constant intercourse, as well as to occasional geological excursions with
 him to spots where these drift and alluvial deposits could be examined.
In the winter of 1858, Dr. Hugh Falconer urged upon Mr. Prestwich's
attention the desirability of investigating in the field the evidences for
 the discoveries of M. Boucher de Perthes of flint implements of pre
historic man in the gravel deposits of the Valley of the Somme, which
were then somewhat doubtfully received, and in April, 1859, Mr.
Prestwich proceeded to Abbeville, where he was joined by Mr. John
Evans.     Thence they went to Amiens, and in the gravel beds of St.
Acheul saw for themselves, still embedded in its matrix, one of those
implements of unquestionable human workmanship,              the asserted
existence of which in the alluvial deposits had met with so much doubt.
The previous discoveries, thns verified and subsequently supplemented
by researches conducted on lines which could with confidence be
laid down, soon led to an entire revolution in the then existing
ideas as to the antiquity of man. Not that the new views were at

                                      XIV
once accepted, or that the advocates of the old ideas were backward
in their defence of them.      For years controversy was long and
occasionally load;  but so completely has it now died out, that the
 promoters of what were then new views occasionally find themselves
 at the present time in antagonism with the promoters of views newer
 still, for which they are not quite satisfied that there is as yet sufficient
 foundation.
    At various intervals, from 1859 onwards, Mr. Prestwich wrote
several papers relating to post-Pliocene deposits, including one of
                       " On the Loess of the
great importance,                                 Valleys of the South of
England and of the Somme         and  of the Seine," communicated to the
 Royal Society in 1862. He had previously furnished to the Society
an account of the discoveries of flint implements at Abbeville,
Amiens, and Hoxne.
    In 1866 and 1867 Mr. Prestwich rendered valuable aid to the
country by acting on the Royal Coal Commission, and on that on the
Metropolitan Water Supply.           In connection with the former he
furnished an exhaustive, and at the same time suggestive, Report
                         " On the
(published in 1871)                Probability of finding Coal under the
Newer Formations of the South of England " — some of the anticipa
tions in which he lived to see at all events partially realised.
   With regard to the latter subject, his book, ' The Water-bearing
Strata of the Country around Loudon,' gave evidence of his capacity
to speak.
    During all these years Mr. Prestwich had been actively engaged
in business, and it is amazing to note the amount of detailed and
accurate geological work that he was able to accomplish.          But about
1872 he managed to emancipate himself in a great measure from the
trammels of trade, and in 1874 he was appointed to succeed the late
Professor Phillips in the Chair of Geology at Oxford. He was there
able to devote nearly the whole of his time to the prosecution of his
favourite study, and to enlisting recruits for the science.
   It is impossible in a notice of this kind to cite even the titles of his
numerous papers, but especial mention may be made of his memoirs
" On the Temperature of the Sea at various Depths below the
Surface," and " On the Origin of the Parallel Roads of Lochaber
                                                                              "
(printed in the 'Philosophical Transactions         '),as well as those on
" Underground Temperature " and on the evidences of the " Sub
mergence of Western Europe."
   To the Institution of Civil Engineers he communicated essays on
the " Geological Conditions affecting the Construction of a Tunnel
between England and France," and on the
                                                    "
                                                      Origin of the Chesil
Beach," for which a Telford Medal was awarded him.
   His papers read before the Geological Society were numerous.
                                  "
Among his later ones, those on Volcanic Action," on the " Mundesley

                                    XV
 and Westleton Beds," on the " Relation of the Glacial Period to the
 Antiquity of Man," on the " Pre-glacial Drifts of the South of
 England," and on the " Age of the Valley of the Darent," may,
 perhaps, be described as the more important.
    It was while living at Oxford that he produced, in 1886 and 1887,
 his great work in two volumes on " Geology, Chemical and Physical,
 Stratigraphical and Palieontological."     In this work he not only
 brought   forward  many   arguments against carrying the doctrine of
 uniformity too far in attempting to read the history of the earth, but
 at the same time he showed some signs of reverting to theories
 involving more of cataclysmic action than most modern geologists are
 willing to allow. As a whole, however, his book is a monument of
 patient and conscientious work, and is likely long to retain the
 high position that it holds at present in geological literature.
    As already stated, Mr. Prestwich was elected a Fellow of the
 Geological Society so long ago as 1833.     Prom 1856 onwards he for
 many years served the Society as Treasurer, becoming President for
 two years, from 1870 to 1872. Already in 1849 the Wollaston Medal
 had been awarded him for his researches at Goalbrookdale and in the
 London Basin.
    In 1853 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and at
intervals served upon its Council, during seven years in the aggre
gate. In 1870 — 1871 he was a Vice-President of the Society.        One
of the Royal Medals was awarded to him in 1865 for his contribu
 tions to geological science.
    In France the name of Prestwich was almost as well known as in
 England.     He was one of the oldest members of the French
 Geological Society, and when it was assembled at Boulogne, in 1880,
 be was appointed President of the meeting.      In 1885 he was elected
a Corresponding Member of the Institut (Academie des Sciences).
 He was also a Foreign Member of the Accademia dei Lincei, at Rome,
of the Geological Institute of Vienna, and of various academies in
Belgium, Switzerland, and the United States of America.         When the
International Geological Congress met at London in 1888, the esteem
with which he was regarded by geologists of all nationalities was
shown by his unanimous election as President of the Congress.
    He retired from the Geological Chair at Oxford in 1888, to the
great regret of his brother professors, and of his numerous friends in
that University, which conferred upon him in the same year, as a
tribute of esteem, the honorary degree of D.C.L. After his retire
ment be resided for the most part at his deliglitf ul country honse,
Darent Hulme, Shoreham, Kent, which he built, in accordance with
bis own tastes some twenty-seven years ago, and every room and wall
of which brought to mind some subject of geological interest, either
in material or decoration. There he actively continued his scientific

                                    xvi
labours, efficiently aided and cared for by a loving wife — the niece of
his old friend, Dr. Hugh Falconer.
   The first public recognition of his services, both to science and
the State, was accorded him at the beginning of the present year,
when he received the honour of knighthood, with the unanimous
acclaim of the scientific world. But he was, alas ! not destined to
bear his honours long, and, after some months of great physical
weakness, he died on June 23rd, 1896.
   Of his personal amiability, his devoted friendship, and his charm
of manner, this is hardly the place to speak : but all those with whom
he was brought into contact will agree that in Sir Joseph Prestwich
 we have lost not only one of the great pillars of geological science,
but a geologist whose mind was as fully stored with accumulated
 knowledge as that of any of his contemporaries, and one who was
always ready to place those stores generously and freely at the
disposal of others.
                                                                 J. E.
   Gkorge Johnson was born in November, 1818, at Goudhurst, in
Kent, and he received his education at the Grammar School there.
In 1837 he paid a visit of some weeks to an uncle who was a medical
practitioner in Cranbrook, and became so enamoured with the life of
a country doctor that he decided to join his uncle as an apprentice.
There he remained for two years and a half, and then entered the
medical department of King's College, London, with which institu
tion his name has been so intimately connected ever since.           His
college  life was   a highly distinguished   one ; he obtained numerous
prizes and scholarships both at the College and at the University of
London, where he took his degree of M.D. in 1844. At King's
College Hospital he served as clinical clerk to Dr. Todd, and dresser
to Sir William Ferguson ; later on he became house physician, house
surgeon, and, in 1843, resident medical tntor.        At the end of his
college  course he   was elected an Associate of King's College.
   This brilliant academical career altered his intention of becoming
a country practitioner, and he decided to remain in London.            In
1846 he became a Member of the Royal College of Physicians, and
four years later was elected a Fellow. At the College of Physicians
he filled many important offices, including those of Examiner in
Medicine, Councillor, Censor, Vice-President, Goulstonian Lecturer,
Lumleian Lecturer, and Harveian Orator. In 1862 he was appointed
a Senator of the University of London ; in 1872 he became a Fellow
of the Royal Society ; and, in 1884, President of the Royal Medical
and Chirurgical Society.
   His appointments at King's College Hospital were those of
Assistant Physician (1847), Full Physician (1856), Professor            of

                                        xvii
Materia Medica (1857), and Professor of Medicine, in succession to
                               '
Dr. George Budd (1863).           In 1886 he resigned this post, and was
elected by the Council, Emeritus Professor of Clinical Medicine, and
Consulting Physician to the Hospital. Shortly after this he became
a Member of the Council of King's College, in which position he con-
tinned to serve his alma mater until his death.
    In 1883, Dr. Johnson was appointed by the Prince of Wales Con
sulting Physician to the Royal College of Music ; in 1885 he received
the honour of being elected a member of the Athenaeum Club, on the
ground of his eminence in science ; in 1888 his past and present
students and friends presented him with his portrait, painted by the
late Mr. Frank Holl, R.A.            This picture was publicly presented to
him in the large theatre of King's College amid a crowd of his
former colleagues and friends by Sir Joseph Lister.             The scene will
long be remembered by            all  those  who  heard   Sir Joseph Lister's
kindly words, and Dr. Johnson's emotional reply. In 1889 he was
made Physician Extraordinary to the Queen, and in 1892 he received
the honour of knighthood.
    The following list comprises his principal contributions to litera
ture : — " On Diseases of the Kidney, their Pathology, Diagnosis, and
Treatment " (1852) ; " Lectures on Bright's Disease " (1873) ; " Epi
                                          "            " Notes on Cholera "
demic Diarrhoea        and     Cholera       (1855) ;
(1856); "The Laryngoscope" (1864); "A Defence of Harvey as
the Discoverer of the Circulation of tho Blood " (1884) ; this was a
reply to certain criticisms evoked by his Harveian oration of 1882.
In 1887 he published a collection of medical essays and lectures in
which many of his former ideas were stated with new force. Sir
George Johnson's scientific life was by no means a peaceful one, and
led to much controversy ; he continued to take part in discussions
arising from his work until the very last.            In 1894, in a series of
                  '
letters to the      Lancet,' he maintained, in opposition to Dr. Pavy,
that normal urine contains no sugar, but that the principal reducing
substance present is creatinine, a material which he and his son
 (Mr. G. S. Johnson) very thoroughly investigated.                In 1889 he
 published an essay on
                            " Asphyxia," in which he defended his well-
 known views against those of his opponents.               As late as 1895, a
 ' History of the Cholera Controversy,' in which Sir
                                                                George played
 so prominent a part, appeared from his pen ; and in the present 3-ear
                         '
 a similar book on         The Pathology of the Contracted Granular
          '
 Kidney completed his long series of publications.
    He married, in 1850, Charlotte Elizabeth, youngest daughter of
 the late Lieutenant White, of Addington.             He was left a widower
 with five children ten years later.
     The vigour of Sir George Johnson's mind remained unimpaired to
 the last, but his bodily health was feeble.       He suffered from paralysis

                                      xviii
 agitans, was subject to insomnia, and was slightly deaf.              These
 infirmities rendered his attendance at pnblic meetings somewhat
 irregular, bat when questions of urgency arose he was always at his
 post at the Senate of the London University, the Council of King's
 College, and the meetings of the College of Physicians.         During the
 last three or four years, however, his health had improved, and he
 was able during his summer holidays to resume his shooting in
 Scotland, a sport of which he was extremely fond.                Only last
 Hammer he     related with  pride   how   he had  brought down a stag at
 the distance of so many yards.        His house in Saville Row contained
 many trophies of the chase.       His sudden end on Wednesday, June 3,
 1896,  therefore  came as a  surprise and shock to all his friends.     The
 cause of death was apoplexy.        The morning of Monday, June 1, he
 was in his usual health, and he employed it in writing a paper which
                                  '
 was published in the ' Lancet of June 13, under the appropriate title,
 " A Last Word on Cholera."         This was a brief criticism on Dr. Ken
 neth Macleod's article on        "  Cholera," in Dr. Clifford Allbntt's
 '                            In       afternoon he went out for his usual
   System   of  Medicine.'        the
drive, and it was on his return that he was seized with hemiplegia.
Though he regained sufficient consciousness to recognise those abont
him, he never rallied, and died within forty-eight hours of the
attack.
    The funeral took place on June 8, after a preliminary service at
 St. James's, Piccadilly, conducted by Dr. Wace, Principal of King's
 College, and attended by a large number of his friends and admirers,
Sir Joseph Lister representing the Royal Society ; the remains were
laid to rest by the side of those of his wife at St. Mary's, Addington.
    The medical and scientific world has lost a distinguished ornament,
an earnest and steady worker, a deep thinker, a vigorous writer, and
a lovable and tender-hearted friend.
    The foregoing enumeration of the principal incidents in his life
shows how full it was of active service, but cannot paint the man as
he was to those who knew him.         The readers of his works will see in
him the trenchant writer, and the uncompromising but always fair
defender of his views.         Those who listened to his lectures will
remember the well ordered, logical, and clear exposition of his
thoughts ; here he never allowed his strong but contentions ideas to
appear in undue relief when he was teaching his students. His
opponents will know him as a hard hitter, but one who was always
ready to acknowledge his own mistakes, and who never carried his
words into the region of personal attack.         It is, however, only those
who sat with him by his fireside who can properly realise the gener
ous friend, the lovable disposition, the keen interest he always took
in questions of science, and the enthusiasm with which he followed
up his theories.     It was especially the younger men with whom he

                                   xix
 liked thus to show his sympathy, and among his scientific friends he
used to say that above all he dearly loved to chat with the physio
logists.
    It is somewhat difficult for one like the present writer, who only
knew Sir George during the last ten years or so of his life, to guess
who among his earlier friends had most to do with the formation of
his character.     Sir George had obviously a strong character of his
own, which would have brought him to the front in any walk of life;
 but to judge by his conversation on the reminiscences of his younger
 days, it would seem that above all others, Dr. Todd was the one who
especially stimulated him in the particular branches he took up. At
the time that he was student, Dr. Todd was Professor of Physiology
at King's College, and throughout the whole of his subsequent life,
Johnson was as diligent a student of physiology as ho was of
medicine.       He knew, in a most surprising way, the contents of
modern physiological text-books, especially in relation to the circula
tion of the blood, his favourite study ; and, to show the vigour of his
 mind, he was intensely interested towards the last in the question of
 osmotic pressure, a difficult subject which has only recently attained
importance to physiologists.     He was, however, not merely a student
of books, but was practical to the backbone ; after the establishment of
 the physiological laboratory at King's College, during the time Pro
fessor Rutherford occupied the chair of physiology, he was a frequent
visitor there, and much important work was done at his suggestion
 then and subsequently.       He was an accomplished histologist, and
 took a keen delight in showing to his friends the specimens by which
 he believed he had refuted the views of those who disagreed with
him. Even in the last week of his life he had commenced experi
 ments on the action of the cilia in the renal tubules of the newt's
kidney.
     In mentioning his early friends, one must not omit to enumerate
 Sir Thomas Watson, whom he helped with his celebrated lectures ;
 Sir William Ferguson, Sir William Bowman, and Dr. Bristowe, all
 of whom Sir George Johnson survived.
    The controversies of his life were numerous ; there were stormy
 times at King's College, especially in years now far back ; there was
 the great cholera controversy : in the first years of this, Johnson was
most unfairly treated, being branded almost as a quack in the
medical journals.      He, however, in spite of loss of practice, stuck to
his   views,  and had, in the end of his days, the satisfaction of seeing
his evacuant treatment of cholera regarded as a rational one, and in
many cases recognised by eminent practitioners as the correct one.
 Of his sobriquets, Johnson preferred to be known as " Cholera John
 son
       " rather than "Kidney Johnson."        His views on the kidney
  question were direct deductions from physiological knowledge derived
     vol. lx.                                                     d

 from the discovery of the muscular structure of the arterioles by
 Henle, and the work of Claude Bernard on vasomotor nerves. His
 views on the cause of the hypertrophied heart in cases of Bright's
 disease are now generally regarded as correct.           His ideas on
 asphyxia, which he continued to the last to call by the old-fashioned,
 but etymologically      correct, name, apnoea, formed the subject of
 another spirited debate ; and, in conclusion, one must mention a con
 troversy of another kind, the dispute with Sir William Gull over a
 point of professional etiquette connected with the " Balham Case."
 The point was decided in Johnson's favour by the College of
 Physicians, but the incident left a good deal of bitterness behind it.
    Still this long series of struggles did not embitter Johnson's life.
 He was always able to discuss the matters involved without a trace
 of ill-feeling, though a mention of any one of them would lead him
 into a prolonged and forcible exposition of his own views.
    In his later essays he was able to write with calmness, and was
 willing to leave to time the recognition of what was true in the active
 and full life-work, which he must have known was then drawing to a
 close.
                                                            W. D. H.
    Heney Newell       Martin    was  born on July 1, 1848, at Newry,
County Down, Ireland.        He was the eldest of a family of twelve, his
father being at the time a Congregational minister, but afterwards
becoming a schoolmaster.         Both his parents were Irish, his father
coming from South Ireland, and his mother from North Ireland.
He received his early education chiefly at home ; for though he went
to several schools, his stay was not long at any one of them.
    Having matriculated at the University of London before he was
fully sit teen years of age (an exemption as to age being made in his
favour), he became an apprentice to Dr. McDonagh, in the Hamp-
stcad Road, London, in the neighbourhood of University College, on
the undei-standing that the performance of the services which might
be required of him as apprentice, should not prevent his attending
the teaching at the Medical School of the College, and the practice
at the hospital.     Daring his career at University College he greatly
distinguished himself, taking several medals and prizes, in spite of
his time for study being, on acconnt of the above-mentioned duties,
less than that of his fellow students.          In 1870 he obtained a
scholarship     at Christ's    College, Cambridge ; he had, in the
summer of that year, conducted at Cambridge a class of Histology
for the late Sir G. Humphry. The writer of this notice had about
the same time been appointed Prselector of Physiology at Trinity-
College, and the two went up to Cambridge together in the October
of that year. He at once undertook to act as the demonstrator of the

                                         xxi
Trinity   Prelector, whose right hand he continued              to be in every
way during       the  whole   of  his  stay  at  Cambridge.    His energy and
talents, and especially his personal qualities, did much to advance
and render popular the then growing School of Natural Science in
the University.       At that time there was, perhaps, a tendency on the
part of the mule rgraduate to depreciate natural and, especially, bio
logical science, and to regard it as something not quite academical.
Martin, by his bright ways, won among his fellows sympathy for his
line of study, and showed them, by entering into all their pursuits
(he became for instance, President of the Union and Captain of the
Volunteers) that the natural science student was in no respects
inferior to the others.
   In Cambridge, as in London, his career was distinguished.                  He
gained the first place in the Natural Science Tripos of 1873, the
second place being taken by Francis M. Balfour ; at that time the
position in the Tripos was determined by the aggregate of marks in
all the subjects. While at Cambridge he took the B.Sc. and M.B.
London, gaining in the former the scholarship in Zoology ; he pro
ceeded later to the D.Sc, being the first to take that degree in
Physiology. So soon as, or even before, he had taken his degree, he
began to devote some time to research, though that time, owing to
tbe necessity under which he lay of making money by teaching, was
limited ; his first publication was a little paper of the structure of the
olfactory membrane, which appeared in the Journal of Anatomy and
                                                      '
               '
Physiology        for 1873.
    In the summer of 1874 he assisted the           Trinity Projector in intro
ducing into Cambridge the course of Elementary Biology, which the
late Professor Huxley had initiated at the Royal College of Science
during the preceding year. He subsequently acted as assistant in
the same course to Professor Huxley himself.              One result of this was
that he prepared, under Huxley's supervision, a text-book of the
                                                                     '
course which, under their names, appeared with the title               Practical
 Biology,'  and    which  has  since  been  so  largely used.
    In 1874 he was made Fellow of his College, and giving himself up
 with enthusiasm to the development of natural                and, especially, of
 biologic  science at the   University, was looking forward to a scientific
 career in England, if not at Cambridge.             About that time, however,
 the Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore was being established,
 and such was the impression made by Martin upon those with whom
 be came in contact, among others Dr. Gilman, of Baltimore, that in
 1876 he was invited to become the first occupant of the Chair of
 Biology which had been founded in the Johns Hopkins University.
 This offer   he accepted,     and thus     nearly the whole of his scientific
 career was passed in America.           He went out prepared to develop       in
 his new home the higher teaching of biologic science, especially that

                                     xxii
spirit of research which alone makes teaching " high
                                                           "   and daring
                                                             ;
the rather less than a score of years which made up his stay at      Balti
more, he produced a very marked effect on American science,           fully
working out the great uim of the University which had adopted hiui.
J3y himself, or in concert with his pupils, he carried on many im
portant   investigations, among which may especially be mentioned
those on the excised mammalian heart.           He was the first to show
that by appropriate methods the excised mammalian heart may be
made the subject of prolonged study.           One of these researches,
                          " Influence of Temperature," was made the
namely, that on the
Croonian Lecture     of 1883.    His various contributions were, in 1895,
republished in a collected form by his friends and pupils in America,
                      "
under the title of      Physiological Papers."      He sent out into the
States, from among      his students, a number of trained physiologists,
fired with his own enthusiasm, who are continuing to advance the
science, and one of whom has succeeded him at Baltimore.           He also
found time to write expository         works,  and his   '
                                                           Human Body,'
'
  Briefer Course,' and ' Elementary Course,' deservedly became very
popular in the States.
    Upon his first appointment he had the charge of the whole subject
of animal biology ; and since he was himself more distinctly a
physiologist, it was almost his first duty to secure or train up a
colleague who should devote himself to morphology.            Martin early
saw the worth of one of his students, W. K. Brooks ; to him ho
gradually entrusted morphological matters, and thus prepared, not
only the way for a separate Chair of Zoology, but also the man to
fill it.
    Martin married in 1879 Mrs. Pegram, the widow of an officer in
the Confederate army ; but there was no issue, and in 1892 his wife
died.
    Even before his wife's death his health had begun to give way ;
and after that event he became so increasingly unfitted for the duties
which his own previous exertions had raised to a very great import
ance, that in 1893 he resigned his post.
    After his resignation he l-etnrned to this country, for he had never
become an American citizen, and was looking forward to being able,
with improved health, to labour in physiological investigations, either
at his old University or elsewhere in England.       But it was not to be.
 Though he seemed at times to be improving, he had more than one
severe attack of illness, and never gained sufficient strength to set
really to work.    During the past summer he visibly failed, and while
he was striving to recover his strength by a stay in the quiet dales of
Yorkshire, a sudden hsemorrhage carried him off on October 27, at
Bnrley-in-Wharfedale, Yorkshire.
    Having been for so long a stranger      to this country, Martin was,

                                  xxiii
personally, but little known in English scientific circles; in America,
however, not in Baltimore only, but in many other parts of the States,
especially among the younger physiologists, he has left behind him
a memory which will not soon pass away ; while those in this country
who knew the brightness of his early days will always hold him in
affectionate remembrance.
                                                                M. P.
   Brian Houghton Hodgson, of the Bengal Civil Service, oriental
scholar, zoologist, and diplomatist, was born in February, 1800, at
Preetbnry, Cheshire, and was the eldest son of B. Hodgson, Esq., of
Lower Beech, in that county. He belonged to a long-lived family ;:
his father attaining his ninety-second year, and a grandmother
and a great-grandmother       their ninetieth.   He was educated at
Dr. Davies' school, Macclesfield, and was, according to the wishes
of his great uncle the Bishop of London, and relative the Dean of
Carlisle, intended for the Church ; but, having no desire for holy
orders, at sixteen years old a nomination to the East India College of
Haileybury was obtained for him.        Pending the passing his pre
liminary examination at Haileybury, young Hodgson was the guest
of Professor Malthus, then preparing the seventh edition of his
" Principles of Population," who directed his attention to politics
as a career; whilst a casual presentation at the Governor's house
to Canning, then President of the Board of Control, who addressed
the youth with a brilliant sketch of the career possible to an
Indian civilian, fired him with ambition to become a diplomatist,
of which his stirring career, at the Court of Nepal, was the fruit.
At Haileybury, Hodgson gained high honours in languages and
                                                         " First of his
political economy, finally passing out in 1817 as
year."    In 1818 he sailed for Calcutta, where he passed a year in
the College at Fort William, studying the vernacular, Sanskrit, and
Persian, and becoming a proficient in the latter. At Calcutta his
health broke down, and, after a severe attack of fever, no choice was
left him between abandoning the service or obtaining a hill appoint
ment. The latter — an all but unattainable prize for an untried youth
— was, nevertheless, thanks to his early promise, and more to the
private influence of powerful friends with the Government, obtained
for him, and he was appointed Assistant to the Commissioner of
Knmaon, a province of the Western Himalaya ceded by the Ne-
palese a few years previously.
   Fortunately for Hodgson, his chief, G. W. Traill, was a first-rate
official, and, equally fortunately, Kumaon was in a condition of
disorganisation and savagery that taxed the highest qualities of its
new rulers. It was Traill's first duty to obtain the confidence of a
people driven into the jungles of all but pathless mountains by the
    vol. lx.                                                     e

alternating tyrannies of Affghans and Ghurkas, and who recognised
bat two classes of beings — themselves and their ghosts ; then to
introduce the rudiments of justice, and, finally, raise the condition
of the people to that of a prosperous British province.            It was
during his two years' pupilage with Traill that Hodgson commenced
his zoological observations and those studies of the aboriginal tribes
of India     and their languages, which he pursued throughout his
career; and, so efficiently did he perform his official duties, that,
after two years (in 1820), he found himself unexpectedly promoted
to be Assistant to the British Resident at the Court of Nepal.
Here, however, a disappointment awaited him.               He found the
Resident, the Honourable E. Gardner, giving effect to Lord Hast
ings' wise policy of converting Nopal from a turbulent neighbour
into a quiescent, if not friendly, ally of the British power, and this
he was doing so effectively that Hodgson found a truce established,
and no scope for his ambition as a politician and diplomatist.         He
accordingly applied to Government for more active employment, and
was at once gazetted to the Secretariat of the Persian Department of
the Foreign Office, Calcutta, a step towards the highest positions in
the service.   At Calcutta his health, as before, at once broke down, and
he was fortunate in being sent again (in 1824) to Nepal in a subordi
nate position, awaiting the successorship to the Assistant Rosidentship,
which post had been filled up. This he obtained in the following
year, followed by that of Acting Resident on Mr. Gardner's retire
ment (1829), and Resident in 1833.
   It was during the enforced quiescence of Hodgson's first years in
Nepal that he undertook the systematic study of Nepalese and Tibetan
Buddhist literature, and the collection and description of the verte-
brata of the Himalaya.      By his courteous treatment of the Lamas of
the temples of Katmandu and of the emissaries of the Grand Lama
of Lhassa to the Nepal Court, he enlisted their active co-operation in
the purchase of MSS., and in procuring copies of others, some dating
bick to upwards of 1100 years before the Christian era, for which
latter purpose he kept a staff of copyists in constant employ. So
impressed was the Buddhist hierarchy by his learning and labours, and
 so great was his reputation, that the Grand Lama of Lhassa himself
s?nt him a copy of their classical scriptures, the Kaghyur and
 Stangyur, in 347 folio volumes. Subsequently Hodgson procured
another copy which he sent to the college at Fort William, and which
is now in the library of the Bengal Asiatic Society.           Altogether,
 dating from 182i, he had given upwards of 270 volumes of Sanskrit
 and Tibetan literature to British institutions, especially to the Indian
 Government, and 147 to the Soeiete Asiatique de Paris. The receipt
 of the latter in France, together with copies of his own researches in
 Buddhism, were, as early as 1837, recognised by the bestowal on him

                                        XXV
of the Foreign Fellowship of the above Society, accompanied by the
award of a gold medal, inscribed " An fondatenr de la veritable Etude
<in Budhisme par les textes et les monuments."             This was followed, in
 1838, by the Cross of the Legion of Honour, and, in 1844, by his
election as a Correspondent of the Institute of France.               Meanwhile
his contributions to his own Government lay unheeded in the cellars
of the old India House in Leadenhall Street; and there they remained
 till their transference to the present India Office, where the Kaghyur
and Stangyur* occupy an apartment to themselves, accessible to all.
     Scarcely less valuable and as extensive were Hodgson's contribu
tion to zoology, especially ornithology, which rival his Buddhistical
attainments.       Throughout his residence in the Himalaya he was
himself an assiduous collector, besides keeping a staff of shooters
who penetrated even into Tibet, and of stuffers and artists at the
Residency.       He described systematically and minutely almost every
 species which he procured, accompanying the descriptions with
anatomical details, and observations on their habits, nidification
 (if of birds), and geographical distribution.               He published 127
                                         '
 zoological papers, chiefly in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of
 Bengal.'     In 1843 and 1858 he placed 9512 specimens of Himalayan
 birds, 9037 of mammals, and 84 of reptiles at the disposal of the
 British Museum, together with 1853 drawings.                 Of the above the
duplicates were distributed to the chief museums of Europe and
 America.
     Very early in his career, Hodgson commenced a study of the Non-
 Aryan Races of India, their origin, customs, their unwritten
 languages, which he reduced to writing, their religions and geo
 graphical distribution.       The results are embodied in twenty-seven
 papers contributed (with one exception) to the
                                                                '
                                                                  Journal of the
 Asiatic Society of Bengal.'         These, in the opinion of Latham and
•other scholars, are of the highest value and rank as his chief services
 to literature.
    Mr. Hodgson was a zealous advocate of the employment of the
 vernacular for instruction in the primary schools of India.               In this
 his great opponents were Macanlay,              Sir L.  Trevelyan,   and   H. H.
 Wilson, who advocated English or a classical Oriental tongue. In
 1835 he published two letters on the Btate of Education in India,
 which first " lifted the subject out of the arena of public contro
versy."     For twenty years he persisted in his efforts, which were not
¦crowned with success till 1854, when the Court of Directors adopted
his views, which were further confirmed by the Education Commis
sion of 1882.
    But diplomacy was Hodgson's            earliest and abiding ambition, and

for the exercise of this he had ample scope during the ten years of
his residence at the Nepal Conrt.        The latter, never friendly to the
British alliance, was distracted by the often murderous intrigues of
Raja, princes, queens, ministers, and a dominant military class of
aggressive disposition, and Hodgson's main efforts were directed to-
the establishment of trading relations with Nepal, and to warding
off or rendering abortive measures that would have led to hos
tilities with the Company '8 forces, especially during the crises of
the Chinese, Affghan, and Punjab Wars. He persistently advocated
the policy of enlisting the fighting class of Nepal in the British
Army as a safe outlet for its activity, and it was greatly due to his
influence with his friend Jung Bahadur, and his representations to
Lord Canning, then Governor-General, that the former placed a
Ghurka force at our disposal during the Mutiny.
    In 18413 Mr. Hodgson retired from the service, and after a year's
visit to England, and disposing of his later collections, he returned
to India with the intention of pursuing chiefly his ethnological
studies.     For this object he took up his residence at Darjiling, a
recently created health resort, nearly 7500 ft. above the sea, in the
unexplored Himalaya, east of Nepal.          Here he resided for sixteen
years,  in  indifferent health, the  result of repeated fevers in Nepal,
but as indefatigable as ever in collecting and publishing in continua
tion of his Buddhist, zoological, and ethnological work, and in fur
therance of the adoption of vernacular education.
    In 1858 he finally returned to England, and resided first at the
Rangers, Dursley, in Gloucestershire, whence he removed in 1867 to
the Grange, Alderley, in the same county, frequently visiting London
during the summer months.           Latterly, the winters were passed at
the Villa Himalaya, Mentone.        He married first, in 1863, Miss Anne
Scott, daughter of General H. A. Scott, R.A. ; and, in 1868, Susan,
daughter of the Rev. Chambre Townshend, of Derry, Cork, who
survives him.       He was elected a Fellow of the Linnean Society in
1835, and of the Royal in 1877 ; Corresponding            Member of the-
Royal Asiatic Society in 1828, and Vice-President in 1876 ; Corre
spondent of the Zoological Society iu 1859; D.C.L. (Oxou.) in 1889 ;
and Fellow or Correspondent of many other scientific and literary
bodies. The honours so early showered on him by France are given
above. In person Mr. Hodgson was very good-looking, and of singu
larly frank and courteous bearing, communicative, and generous to a
fault. His was a remarkable case not only of inherited longevity,
but of complete recovery in after life from the effects of long-
continued and often serious indisposition in India. He was fond of
out-of-door exercise, and hunted till disabled by accident at sixty-
eight. He retained his faculties but little impaired till his death in
the summer of 1894, leaving no family. He was buried at Alderley.

     William Crawfokd Williamson was born at Scarborough, on
November         24, 1816.    His father, John Williamson, who began life
as a     gardener, was a man of considerable scientific attainments, and
was, for twenty-seven years, curator of the Scarborough Museum.
From him his son early acquired a practical knowledge of geology
and natural history.           Williamson, in his recently published auto
biography,* describes how, when a boy, his evenings, throughout a
long winter, were devoted to naming fossil specimens from the
                                                        '                         '
neighbouring coast, with the aid of Phillips'             Geology of Yorkshire.
"Pursuing," he says, "this uncongenial labour, gave me in my
thirteenth year a thorough practical familiarity with the palaeonto-
logical treasures of Eastern Yorkshire.                  This early acquisition
happily moulded         the entire course of my future life."
     Williamson in those early days came into contact with several
distinguished men of science, and, notably, with William Smith, the
father of English geology, who spent two years in the Williamsons'
house.
     A little later, in 1832, he made the acquaintance of Murchison,
who was already a friend of his father's, and from whom the younger
 Williamson received great kindness.
     Williamson early adopted the medical profession, and dnring his
apprenticeship to a Scarborough apothecary, found time to carry on
his work in natural history, spending his holidays in shooting rare
birds, and collecting plants and fossils.             He wrote a paper on rare
Yorkshire birds, when only about 16, and almost immediately
 afterwards he made his first contributions to fossil botany, drawing
and describing many of the specimens for Lindley and Hutton's
 '
    Fossil Flora of Great Britain.' More than thirty of the plates in
this well-known book bear his name.
     A paper on the distribution of organic remains in the Lias series
of Yorkshire was read before the Geological Society of London, on
 May 9, 1834, when the author had only attained the age of 17^, and
another in November, 1836, on the Oolitic fossils of the same coast.
 These were remarkable contributions to science in themselves, and the
 more so as coming from so young a worker; few naturalists can
 have started serious investigation so early in life.
     Before he was 18, Williamson appeared as an author on a very
  different subject, for, in 1834, he published an account of the excava
  tion of a tumulus at Gristhorpe, near Scarborough.                 This, which
  was probably his only archaeological publication, was important in
  its effect on his scientific career, inasmuch as it brought the young
  naturalist into communication with the distinguished geologist, Dr.
  Buckland. Through his influence, this paper was reproduced in the
     *  '
          Reminiscences  of a Yorkshire Naturalist,' by W. C.  Williamson, Red war,
   1896.
      VOL. LX.                                                            /

                                      xxviii
  Literary Gazette.' In a letter to Williamson, referring to this,
Dr. Backland said, " T am happy to have been instrumental in
bringing before the pnblic a name to which I look forward as likely
to figure in the annals of British science.'' " The letter of Dr. Buck-
land," says Williamson, " was one of those influences the effect of
which was unmitigatedly healthy."*
    In 1835 Williamson was appointed curator of the museum of the
Natural History Society at Manchester, an office which he held for
three years while pursuing his medical studies. Several papers,
chiefly on geological subjects, were the fruit of this period.         In 1840
Williamson left Manchester and came up to London, where he entered
as a stndent at University College.           He here attended the lectures
of the botanist Lindley, who now for the first time made the personal
acquaintance of his young coadjutor.
    While in London he was offered the post of naturalist to an expe
dition up the Niger, an offer which, fortunately for him and for
 science, he declined, for the undertaking ended disastrously.
    After about a year's work in London, Williamson passed his
qualifying examinations at the Apothecaries' Hall and College of
Snrgeons, and then returned to Manchester, where he at once com
menced      the practice of medicine. At first he found it necessary to
keep his scientific pursuits somewhat in the background, but this did
not last long. His interest in Ehrenberg's discovery of the Foramini-
fera in chalk led him to undertake microscopic research, a field of
inquiry on which he had not previously entered. His first histo
logical investigation, in 1842, related to the development of bone, a
subject to which he returned a few years later. In the meantime he
engaged seriously in the study of Foraminifera, following1                   up
Khrenberg's work above referred to. Among the naturalists who
supplied him with material for this investigation was Charles Darwin,
then just returned from his famous voyage in the " Beagle."                 The
results of Williamson's studies were embodied in a paper published in
the ' Transactions of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Man
chester for 1845, on " Some Microscopical Objects found in the Mad
          '
of the Levant and other Deposits, with Remarks on the mode of
 Formation of Calcareous and Infusorial Siliceous Rocks." This was
 the mcst important of his works up to that date, and helped to lay
 the foundation of our knowledge of the part played by Foraminifera
 in the formation of geological deposits.
    Williamson continued the study of these minute organisms, con
firming the conclusions of Dnjardin as to their affinities, and demon
strating the great variability of the living species.          Many years later,
in 1857, he completed his monograph for the Ray Society on the
                 '
                   Reminiscences of a Yorkshire Naturalist,' page 47.

                                   xxix
recent Foraminifera of Great Britain, after publishing a number of
shorter memoirs on the group.
    In 1851-2 Williamson made a careful study of the organisation of
Volvox Qlobator, and brought ont facts as to the mode of connection
between its cells, which have only been verified by other observers
within the last few years. This was probably his best contribution
to recent botany.
    Shortly before this date Williamson had undertaken an investiga
tion of a totally different kind, namely, the development of the
teeth and bones of fishes, which he considered in relation to the cell
theory. His results in this field were of great importance, and are
embodied in two papers published in the ' Philosophical Transactions
of the Royal Society ' for 1849 and 1851. The value of these inves
tigations was recognised by his election as a Fellow of the Royal
Society in 1854.
    Previously to this, in January, 1851, Williamson had entered the
ranks of official teachers of Science, by his appointment as Professor
of Natural History in the newly founded Owens College at Man
chester. This was an arduous post, for the subjects to be taught
 included three sciences : zoology, botany, and geology. At first lie
 found it possible to deal with this formidable task, by spreading his
complete course over two years, a wise arrangement under the cir
 cumstances, but one which the exigencies of the examination system
 ultimately rendered impracticable.      This led in 1872 to a division of
the duties of the chair, Williamson being then relieved of the geo
 logical part of the teaching by Professor Boyd Dawkius. The remain
 ing work, however, was still far too extensive for any one teacher, and
 in 1880 a further division of labour took place. The late Professor
 Milnes Marshall occupied the chair of zoology, while Williamson
 retained that of botany, which he continued to hold till 1892.
     In addition to his strictly official work as Professor, Williamson
  was one of the first two members of the staff, who, as early as 1854,
 started evening classes for working men.         In later years, he met
 with extraordinary success as a popular scientific lecturer, more
 especially for the Gilchrist Trustees, for whom he delivered some
  hundreds of lectures during the period from 1874 to 1890.           His
  power of rousing and retaining the interest of great popular audi
 ences is described by those who have heard him as most remarkable.
     During a great part of the time at Owens College, Williamson
 continued in active and successful practice as a physician.       In the
 midst of all his multifarious duties, as professor, popular lecturer,
 and medical practitioner, he always found time for original scientific
  work ; rarely has so busy a man done so much for the advancement
 of    science by actual research.
      So far, little has been said of the  work of Williamson on fossil

                                        XXX
botany, the subject with which his name is now most intimately
associated, as it occupied all the latter part of his career as an
investigator.      His interest in such matters goes back, as has been
mentioned above, to the very beginning of his scientific life. In
addition to his work for Lindley and Hutton, a paper of his on the
origin of coal was read before the British Association as early as
1842.     His first original contribution to fossil botany dates from the
                                                       " On the Structure and
year 1851, when he published a paper
Affinities of the Plants hitherto known as Sternbergiae," in which he
demonstrated their true nature as casts of the pith-cavity of Gymno-
spermous trees.       A few years later, in 1854-5, he published papers
on what was then called Zamia gigas, an extraordinary oolitic fossil,
which Williamson believed to have Cycadean affinities, a view which
has since been so far confirmed that the fossil is now regarded as
representing the fructification of one the Bennettiteas, an allied,
though     very different family.         Williamson's full memoir on the
subject was written soon after 1855, but, owing to a succession of
misfortunes, its appearance was long delayed, and it only saw the
                                                         '
light in the ' Linnean Society's Transactions for 1868, when it was
published simultaneously with Mr. Carrnthers' well-known paper on
fossil Cycadean stems.         The latter author founded a new genus for
Zamia gigas under the name of Williamsonia.
    Williamson's really characteristic work in fossil botany consisted
in the investigation of the histological structure of carboniferous
plants. The first beginning was made with the paper on Sternbergia,
but it was not till long afterwards that the long series of publications
began, which have done more than the works of any other writer to
make us acquainted with the organisation of Palaeozoic plants.                     It
was early in the fifties that Williamson made his first sections, but
not till 1868 that, in consequence of a correspondence with the
French palaeobotanist, Grand'Eury, he published the result of his
                                    "
investigations in the paper On the Structure of the Woody Zone
of an undescribed Form of Calamite," ' Manchester Literary and
Philosophical      Society's Proceedings,' Ser. 3, vol. 4.               From that
period onwards, his whole time available for original research was
devoted to the Carboniferous Flora, and a magnificent series of
memoirs was the result, which will always rank among the classics
of fossil botany. The Royal Society alone published in the ' Philo
                           '
sophical Transactions nineteen memoirs from his hand, their dates
ranging from 1871 to 1893, and, besides these, many valuable papers
appeared elsewhere, notably the memoir on Stigmaria Jicoides, pub
lished in 1886, by the Paleeontographical Society.               It is impossible
here to attempt anything like a summary of this great work, which
threw light on every department of Palaeozoic botany.*
   * For fuller information  see Williamson's '
                                                Reminiscences,' especially chap. 13 ;

      Perhaps the greatest result was his demonstration, after a contro
   versy extending over a quarter of a century, that the Sigillarian and
   Calamarian trees of the Carboniferous period were Cryptogams.            To
   use his own words : " The fight was always the same : Was Brong-
  niart right or wrong, when he uttered his dogma, that if the stem of
   a fossil plant contained a secondary growth of wood, the product of
   a cambium layer, it could not possibly belong to the cryptogamic
  division of the vegetable kingdom P" Williamson ultimately suc
  ceeded in convincing his opponents, including almost all the members
  even of the French school, that the plants in question are nothing
  but highly organised Cryptogams, their secondary growth being
  mainly an adaptation to arborescent habit, and by no means an indi
  cation of Phanerogamic affinities.      In this controversy Williamson
  had two sets of opponents ; namely, those who followed Brongniart
  in regarding plants with secondary growth as necessarily phanero
  gamic, and those who, while recognising the cryptogamic nature
  of the plants under discussion, denied or minimised the secondary
  growth itself. Williamson, in spite of occasional mistakes in detail,
  was ultimately victorious on both issues; there is to-day, not the
 slightest doubt that most Palaeozoic Cryptogams formed, by means
 of cambium, secondary tissues essentially similar to those of Dicotyle
 dons or Gymnosperms, and that these plants were none the less as
 truly cryptogamic     as their less  highly organised representatives at
  the present day.
     But, apart from this controversy, upon which it is superfluous to
 dwell longer, Williamson advanced our knowledge of the ancient
 plants in many directions, especially as regards the Sphenophyllea,
 of which he discovered the first fructifications showing structure ;
 the fructifications of Calamarieae and Lepidodendreaa ; the various
 types of structure among the fossil Lycopods ; the existence of a
 group on the frontier of Ferns and Cycads, &c. He made mistakes,
 as all do, who carry out extensive investigations in a new field, but
 he corrected most of them himself, and they in no way afl'ect the per
 manent value of his great work in laying the secure foundations of
 scientific palaeozoic botany.
     Williamson's remarkable skill as a draughtsman added greatly to
 the value of his memoirs, which are illustrated almost wholly by his
own hand. He was by nature an artist, and, in addition to his scien
tific drawings, painted many pleasing landscapes in water-colours
during his leisure hours.
    Williamson was an all-round naturalist of a type now unhappily
all but extinct. He        mad^

 investigator iu three distinct sciences; in geology, by li is early work
 on zonal distribution of the fossils on the Yorkshire coast, and again
 by his investigations of the Foraminifera of marine deposits ; in
 zoology, by his researches on the development of the teeth and bones,
 not to mention his work on recent Foraminifera and Rotifera ; in
 botany, by his elucidation of the structure of fossil plants.   It would
 be difficult to find another example from our own time of equally
 varied and successful scientific activity.
    His ability was recognised by competent men of science from his
 early youth upwards, and during all the earlier part of his career his
 work was of an advanced type, and up to the best standard of the
 day.   At a later period, especially during his investigations of the
 Carboniferous Flora, this was no longer the case in an equal degree.
 Owing chiefly, perhaps, to his want of knowledge of German, his later
 publications suffered somewhat from his insufficient familiarity with
 the results of modem botanical work, and with the consequent tech
 nical expressions.    This makes some of his writings hard to follow,
 and has led to their being estimated below their true value by some
 botanists of a more modern school, who have sometimes failed to
 appreciate discoveries, however important, unless recorded in the
 current vernacular of modern science. Those, however, who take the
trouble to surmount this initial difficulty, will always be astonished at
the wealth of observation which his work contains, and at the sound
judgment which he brought to bear on his discoveries.
   After his retirement from official duties in 1892, Williamson spent
the last three years of his life near London in peaceful devotion to
his favourite studies, continuing his scientific researches to the last.
 His death took place at his house at Clapham Common, on June 23,
1895, at the age of 78.
   His unique collection of slides, illustrating the microscopical struc
ture of fossil plants, has happily been acquired by the British
Museum (Natural History Department).
   Williamson received various marks of public recognition during
his long career. A Royal medal was awarded to him in 1874 for his
researches on fossil plants, at a time when he had only published six
out of his nineteen memoirs in the 'Philosophical Transactions'; in
1890 he received the Wollaston medal of the Geological Society ; he
was a foreign member of the Gotfcingen Academy of Sciences, aud of
the Royal Society of Sweden ; in 1883, the University of Edinburgh
conferred upon him the degree of LL.I).

   Admiral Sir George Henry Richards, K.C.B. This officer, the
son of Captain G. S. Richards, R.N., was born in 1820, and entered
the Royal Navy, on board the " Rhadamauthus,"        in 1833, and served

                                     xxxiii
    iii her in the West Indies for two years under the late Admiral G.
    Graves. In 1835 he was appointed midshipman in an expedition
   consisting of the "Sulphur" and "Starling," fitting out under the
   late Admiral F. W. Beechey, for exploration and survey in the Pacific.
   He served for five years in the " Sulphur," chiefly under Sir Edward
   Belcher, on the surveys of the West Coasts of South and North
   America, the Pacific Islands, New Guinea, and the Moluccas, and was
   then transferred   as Senior Executive Officer to the " Starling,"
   Captain Kellett. He was present in her during the first Chinese
   War at the taking of the Bogne forts and the capture of Canton.
   The ship returned to England in 1842.
       After three months in the " Caledonia," under the flag of Sir
  David Milne, he was, on July 12, 1842, promoted to Lieutenant, and
  appointed to the " Philomel," fitting for the survey of the Falkland
  Islands, under Captain Bartholomew Sulivan. The "Philomel" was,
  however, diverted from this survey to take part in the operations
  against Rosas, the President of the Republic of Bnenos Ay res, in
  1845-46. Lieutenant Richards was present at the different actions
  in the Parana and the Uruguay, and commanded the boat s of the
  " Philomel " at the
                         cutting out of a schooner at night under a
  heavy fire of musketry from the banks of the Uruguay, and received
  the thanks of the senior officer, Sir C. Hotham, on the quarter deck
  of the " Gorgon."
      He was senior lieutenant at the attack of the forts at Obligado
 in the Parana on November 18, 1845, and commanded the small-arm
  men of the " Philomel
                            " at the
                                      storming of the batteries and cap
  ture of the guns which were taken on board the ships. On his
  return to England, in June, 1846, he was promoted to Commander
 from the date of the action.
      In 1847 he was appointed to the "Acheron," Captain J. Lort
 Stokes, destined for the survey of New Zealand, and was employed
 for four years on this service. The existing charts of this colony
 are mainly the result of this survey.
      Returning home, in 1852, Commander Richards volunteered for,
 and was immediately appointed to, an expedition fitting out for the
 Arctic Regions to continue the search for the missing ships of Sir
 John Franklin, and in April of that year sailed as Commander of
the " Assistauce," and second to Sir Edward Belcher in the Welling
ton Channel division of the squadron.
      Whilst on this service he conducted several extended sledging
expeditions, travelling more than 2,000 miles over the frozen sea,
mapping many unknown coasts, and being absent from the ships on
feueh duty for a period of, on the whole, seven months.      Commander
Richards' unvarying good humour and good fellowship did much to
render this expedition a success under very trying circumstances.

                                 xxxiv
    On his return to England in the autumn of 1854 he was promoted
to the rank of Captain, and was not again employed till 1856, when
he was appointed to the command of the " Plumper," in charge of
the survey of Vancouver Island and the coasts of British Columbia.
He was at the same time nominated a Queen's Commissioner con
jointly with Captain Prevost, B.N., for settling the Oregon boundary
question between Great Britain and the United States.
    Captain Richards settled the point on the coast from which the
boundary line should start, and rendered efficient aid to the com
bined party of Boyal Engineers and others who traced it to the east
ward.
    In the " Plumper," and subsequently in the " Hecate," he con
 ducted for seven years the surveys of the intricate and rock-studded
coasts and channels of Vancouver and British Columbia, accom
 plishing a marvellous amount of work. He returned to England in
 1863 by the islands of the Western Pacific, Australia, and Torres
Straits, making surveys and fixing longitudes on the way. Tin's
voyage completed his third circumnavigation of the globe.
    He arrived in England to find himself appointed Hydrographer of
the Admiralty, the late occupant of the post. Admiral Washington,
having recently died.
    Captain Richards held this post for 10 years, and by his powers of
organisation, and the most unremitting industry, greatly increased
the efficiency of his department, which he administered with great
 skill, and placed upon a firm basis to meet its ever growing work.
   A new scheme of retirement placed Richards, who had attained
 the rank of Rear- Admiral on June 2, 1870, on the retired list in
 1874, when he left the Admiralty.
    Whilst Hydrographer he did all in his power to further scientific
exploration of the sea.       The preliminary voyages made by Dr.
 Carpenter, Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, and Dr. Wyville Thomson in the
   Porcupine," " Lightning," and other of H.M. surveying vessels in
 "
 1868-71 were promoted by him, and led up to the ever memorable
 expedition of the " Challenger
                                " in 1872, in the
                                                  inception of which he
 played a very important part, whilst its fitting out and organisation
 were carried out under his superintendence.
    He also made the preliminary arrangements for the transport
 of the expeditions for the observation of the Transit of Venns in
 1874, which were carried out shortly after he relinquished office.
    In 1866 Richards was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and
in the same year a Corresponding Member of the Academy of
 Sciences of Paris.    He was also an active member of the Royal
 Geographical Society, serving on the Council.
    In 1869 he was nominated an A.D.C. to the Queen, and in 1871 a
 Companion of the Bath.       He received the honour of knighthood in

                                   xxxv
1877, and in 1838 the Knight Commandership of the Military Divi
sion of the Bath.
   Admiral Richards was, while serving at the Admiralty and sub
sequently, a trusted adviser of several administrations, and was a
member of several committees on confidential and general subjects,
and was also President of the Arctic Committee which sat in 1875.
   He became a Vice- Admiral in 1877, and Admiral in 1884.
    After leaving the Admiralty he was at once offered and accepted
the position of Managing Director of the Telegraph Construction
and Maintenance Company, which he held for twenty years, when he
was elected Chairman of the Company, a post he occupied to his
death.
   Whilst Managing      Director, some     76,000   miles of submarine
cables were   laid under his superintendence     in different parts of the
world.
    He was also Acting Conservator of the Mersey from the year 1888,
an important post in connection with the well-being of that great
seaport.
    Sir George Richards served several times       on the Council   of the
Royal Society, and was nominated a Vice-President.
   He was a man of great ability, of sound common-sense, and of un
tiring activity, and his unfailing good humour, general shrewdness,
and kindness to younger members of his profession caused him to be
universally beloved and respected.
   He died at Bath on November 14, 1896, somewhat suddenly, thougli
after a painful period of severe sciatica.
    Sir G. Richards married, first, in 1847, Mary, a daughter of Cap
tain R. Young, R.E., by whom he had several sons and daughters ;
and, secondly, Alice Mary, daughter of the Rev. R. S. Tabor, of
Cheam, who survives him.
