 I. “On the Occurrence of Silver in Volcanic Ash from the
       Eruption of Cotopaxi of July 22nd and 23rd, 1885.” By
       J.   W. MALLET, M.D., F.R.S., University             of  Virginia.
       Received November 26, 1886.
    A few months ago     I received from Se<U+FB01>or Julian R. Santos, of
 Ecuador, formerly a pupil of mine in the laboratory of this Univer—
sity, a specimen of volcanic ash collected at his place of residence,
 Bahia de Caraguez, on the coast of the Paci<U+FB01>c, about 120 miles nearly
due west from Cotopaxi.         This, the highest and among the most
 mighty of the active volcanoes of our globe, burst forth into eruption
about 11% P.M. on the 22nd of July, 1885, and the ash began to fall
at Bahia de Caraguez at 7 A.M. on the next day, the 23rd. It fell
there to the depth of several inches, this fact alone indicating the
 discharge of an enormous amount of solid matter into the atmosphere,
although Se<U+FB01>or Santos wrote to me that the unsettled condition of
the country, disturbed by revolutionary movements, prevented his
making extended enquiries which might have ascertained the area
covered by the fall of ashes.
    The specimen sent me consisted of a very <U+FB01>nely divided powder,
mobile and soft to the touch, of light brownish-grey colour. Under
the microscope it appeared to be made up of minute granules and
spicules, in general with sharp, more or less splintery edges.     These
were for the most part colourless and transparent, or White and trans
lucent; some were reddish, some dark bottle-green, some brown,
some black and opaque.      Most of those clear enough to freely trans
mit light showed brilliant colours in a <U+FB01>eld of polarised light. Quartz,

2            On the Occurrence    of Silver in Volcanic Ash.    [J an.  6,
(strongly attracted, and easily removed by the end of a. magnetic
needle), and thin scales of deep red specular iron oxide were easily
distinguished.
   The ash on being strongly heated before the blowpipe, or even in
considerable quantity in a small platinum crucible over the blast
lamp, turned dark red-brown, and fused to a nearly black slag.
   On being boiled in its original state with'water it gave up 0'21 per
cent. of soluble matter. The solution gave very distinctly the reactions
of chlorine, a sulphate, and sodium; in a. less marked degree the
reactions of potassium. On boiling with strong hydrochloric acid,
6'94 per cent. was dissolved, in addition to that already extracted by
water; the acid solution was deeply coloured by iron.
   The speci<U+FB01>c gravity of the ash was found = 2'624: at 18° C. as
compared with water at the same temperature.
   An analysis of the material taken as a whole, i.e., without any
previous mechanical separation of its consistent minerals, and without
previous digestion with water or acid, but dried at 100° 0., gave the
following results :—

     Silver was <U+FB01>rst noticed   after fusing as usual with mixed sodium
  and potassium carbonates, and dissolving in excess of hydrochloric
  acid, on the addition of sulphuretted hydrogen to the solution, which
  had been freed from silica; the sulphur thrown down by ferric chloride
  present was observed to be distinctly brown, and on being <U+FB01>ltered out.
  and carefully burned oil? before the blowpipe it left a minute bead of
  metallic silver. All the reagents and vessels used were scrupulously
  examined, but the silver could not be traced to any of them.      It was

  1887.]     On the Continuity    of  the  Liquid and      Gaseous   States.    3
  afterwards found that the metal could be obtained from the ash by
  furnace assay—fusion with pure lead carbonate, sodium carbonate, and
  a little cream of tartar, and cupellation of the lead button produced;
  and a comparative experiment was made, with negative result, using
  larger quantities of the same reagents, but omitting the volcanic ash.
      It was ascertained that silver could be extracted from the ash by
   boiling it with a solution of ammonia, or of potassium cyanide, or of
  sodium thiosulphate, but the metal was not dissolved out in appreci
  able amount on boiling with nitric acid.              Hence, as seems most.
  probable, it was present in the ash as silver chloride.             The fact of
  its being found in the solution in hydrochloric acid of the mass
  resulting from fusion with the alkaline carbonates, is of course easily
  explained by the solvent action upon silver chloride of the chlorides
  of sodium and potassium, and (when such minute quantities are
  concerned) of hydrochloric acid itself.
      The discovery of silver in the ash in question adds for the <U+FB01>rst time
  this metal to the list of elementary substances observed in the
   materials ejected from volcanoes, and the addition derives some special
  interest from the fact of the ash having come from the greatest of the
  volcanic vents of the great argentiferous chain of the Andes.
      Lead, which was found by Senor Santos himself, when a student
  here in 1879, in a specimen of ash from the eruption of Cotopaxi of
'
   August 23rd, 1878,* was sought for in the ash now reported upon, but
   neither it nor any other heavy metal beside silver was detectable.
      Several concordant experiments proved that the silver was present
   to the extent of about 1 part in 83,600 of the ash, or about two-<U+FB01>fths
   of a Troy ounce per ton of 2240 pounds.          Small as is this proportion,
   it must represent a very large quantity of silver ejected during the
   eruption, in view of the vast masses of volcanic ash which must have
   been spread over such an area as is indicated by the fall at so distant
   a point as Bahia de Caraguez.

         STOKES, D.C.L., P.R.S.        Received November 30, 1886.
      For several years past we have been engaged in an examination of
   the behaviour of liquids and gases through wide ranges of tempera
   ture and pressure.       The results of our experiments with ethyl
   alcohol have recently been published in the ‘Philosophical Transac
   tions ;’ those with acetic acid in the ‘ Journal (Transactions) of the
   Chemical Society’; and the Royal Society have in their hands a

 the thermal properties of methyl alcohol.
    In consequence of a recent publication by Wroblewski, of which
 we have seen only the abstract (‘ Deutsch. Chem. Ges. Berichte,’ 1886
 (Referate), p. 728), we deem it advisable to communicate a. short
'notice of an investigation in which we are at present engaged.
     We <U+FB01>nd that with the above-mentioned substances, acetic acid
 excepted, whether they are in the liquid or gaseous state, provided
 volume be kept constant, a simple relation holds between pressure
 and temperature. It is
                                 p = bT—a.
 This is evidently a simple modi<U+FB01>cation of Boyle’s and Gay-Lussac’s
 laws; for at low pressures, where volume is large, the term a
 approaches    and <U+FB01>nally equals zero, while b diminishes and <U+FB01>nally
 becomes     equal   to the value of 0, calculated from the ordinary
 equation,

    We have as yet only had time to apply this formula. with ethyl
 ether to the liquid state; and as we are not yet quite certain whether
 the relation holds when 1 gram of ether occupies volumes between
 4: and 20 0.0., we are at present engaged      in measurements of volumes
 and pressures at temperatures between 220° and 280°. Assuming the
above relation to be true (and it is at all events a close approximation
 to truth), it is possible to calculate those portions of isothermals
 included within the liquid-gas area, and represented in Andrews’
 diagram by horizontal straight lines.          We have calculated a few of
 these isothermals for ether, and <U+FB01>nd that the areas above and below
 the horizontal lines (see woodcut) are equal, when measured by a,
planimeter.
    Reserving a. full discussion of the subject until the completion of
 our experiments, we would here point out the similarity between
the'equation p = bT—a, and those proposed by Clausius and by van
der Waals to represent these relations.         Clausins’s formula is

         (Wi11.).” By W. O. WILLIAMSON, LL.D., F.R.S., Professor
        'of Botany      in the Owens College and in the                Victoria
         University.      Received November 27, 1886.
    In March, 1832, the late Mr. Witham read to the Natural History
Society of N ewcastle-upon-Tyne the <U+FB01>rst public notice of the classic
specimen of Lepidodendron known as Lepidodendron Harcourtii.                Still
later (1833) he published further <U+FB01>gures and descriptions of the same
                                  ‘
specimen in his work on             The Internal Structure of Fossil Vege
tables.’     Additional <U+FB01>gures and descriptions of the same object
appeared in the second volume of Lindley and Hutton’s ‘Fossil
Flora,’     and in Brongniart’s         ‘Végétaux' Fossiles.’      But notwith
standing all these publications the exact plant to which they referred
has long been doubtful.          I  hoped to have found either the original
specimen}    in   the  museum    of   the Yorkshire Philosophical Society or
the sections      described  by Lindley and Hutton in that of the New
castle Society; but, though carefully sought for,              I long failed to
discover either one or the other.
               I
     In 1871, laid before the Royal Society my memoir, Part II, “ On
the Organisation of the Fossil Plants of the Coal-measures,” in which
I   <U+FB01>gured (Plate 25, <U+FB01>g. 12), a plant that seemed to me to be identical
with L. Harcourt'ii; and. in Part XI (1880) of the same series of
             I
memoirs, gave further representations of the same plant (Plate 51,
 <U+FB01>g. 10; Plate 49, <U+FB01>g. 11). Since the publication of the latter
memoir I have obtained a <U+FB01>ne series of specimens, which appeared to
me to approach still more closely to the various representations of
Lepz'dodendron Harcourti'i, referred to above, and which inclined me to
              I
think that had hitherto included two species under a. common name.
The two forms unmistakably belong to a common type, to which                    I

1887.]       Lepidodend'ron  Harcourtii and    L. fuliginosum.          7
have frequently had occasion to refer as “ the type of L. Haroourti'i,"
characterised by the possession of a very distinct parenchymatous
medulla, surrounded by a sharply-de<U+FB01>ned non-exogenous vascular
zone—the E'tui médullaire of Brongniart—and by the almost entire
absence of any exogenous vascular zone; the chief exception to the
last feature being represented in the Plate 49, <U+FB01>g. 11, referred to
above.
   One of the most characteristic features seen in my new specimens
occurs in the structure of the foliar bundles.           These have been
large, and in transverse sections of a stem they are rendered increas
ingly conspicuous, by the disappearance of a considerable amount of
cellular tissue which originally belonged to them, but which is now
only represented by a clear vacant space. What remains of these
bundles is equally characteristic.   In each case the bundle appears to
be a double one; owing to the preservation not only of its vascular
or zylem part, but also of a distinct and separate string of what has
obviously been a modi<U+FB01>cation of the hard bast of the phloem part of
the bundle.     A further feature occurs in the almost invariable disap
pearance of the entire inner cortical zone.
   Visiting York a few weeks ago,       I made a fresh search for Har
court’s original specimen,  and  with  the kind aid of the of<U+FB01>cers of the
museum     I  was this time successful. , The specimen represented on
Plate 98 (<U+FB01>g. 1), of the ‘Fossil Flora,’ vol. 2, was discovered, and by
the kindness of Mr. Reed, the intelligent Honorary Curator of the
geological department of this museum,         I  have been permitted to
obtain a transverse section of it. It is now certain that my more
recently acquired specimens represent the true L. Harcourtii, and,
in all probability, <U+FB01>g. 9 in Plate 52 of my Part XI is a very young
branch of the same species.        Those previously <U+FB01>gured by me and
referred to above are certainly distinct.     They are characterised by
the greater uniformity in the composition of the entire cortex, the
inner part of which is preserved, and by the absence of the duplex
structure of the foliar bundle. The small size of the cells of the
inner cortex, and the dense aspect both of it and of the foliar
bundles (see <U+FB01>g. 10, Plate 51, Part XI), give to transverse sections of
the form so sooty an aspect contrasted with the luminous semitrans
parency of the true L. Harcourtii, that      I  propose to recognise the
former as Lepidodendron fuliginosum.

IV. “On the Organisation of the Fossil Plants of the Coal
       measures.     Heterangium       Tilieeoides (Will) and Kuloxylon
       Hookeri.”     By Professor W. C. WILLIAMSON, LL.D., F.R.S.,
       Professor of Botany in the Owens College and in the
       Victoria University.      Received December 1, 1886.
                                 ( Abstract.)
   Several years ago the author discovered the stems and branches
of   a remarkable plant in the Carboniferous beds at Burntisland,
which he described in the volume of the ‘Philosophical Transactions "
for 1873, under the name of Hete'rangium Grievii. This plant dis
played a central axis, in which was combined a curious mixture of
cells and vessels.     These were surrounded by a vascular zone, with
medullary rays, evidently a product of an investing cambium layer.
Outside this exogenous growth were a complex series of cortical
layers, with various arrangements of vascular bundles going o<U+FB01> to
supply lateral appendages.      The indefatigable industry of my valuable
auxiliaries, William Cash, Esq., and Mr. Binns, of Halifax, have
supplied a series of specimens which the author soon found to be
a new species of Heterangium, to which he gives the name of Heteraln
gium Tiliazoides.     Whilst the plant exhibits all the features of interest
seen in H. Grieoii, it has others peculiar to itself.         Its central axis
corresponds closely     with that   of  H.  Grievii.  Its exogenous vascular
or zylem zone is more fully developed than in the older species, but
the most striking features are seen in new structures external to and
 developed by what has been a cambial zone.            The zylem consists of
groups    of vascular laminae, the  inner   ends of  each of which groups so
 converge as to separate the vascular ring into a series of distinct
 bundles.     These are not only separated from each other by primary
 medullary rays, but as each of these latter passes outwards towards
 the cortex, it rapidly expands laterally, assuming, in transverse
 sections, a trumpet-shaped contour.         These are in fact true primary
 phloem rays, as <U+FB01>ne as those seen in the shoots of the Lime tree;
 hence the speci<U+FB01>c name of Tiliazoides given to the plant by the author
    Between these large phloem rays are clusters of phloem, the radial
 diameter of each of which is co-extensive with the zylem part of the
 bundle to which it belongs. Each of the zylem-bundles is subdivided into
 minor groups of two or three vascular laminae, separated by secondary
 medullary rays, each of which latter can be traced as secondary
 phloem rays passing radially outwards through the phloem portion
 of each bundle.       The vessels seen both in the vasculo-medullary
 axis and in the exogenous zone are chie<U+FB02>y furnished with bordered

1887.]          On the Fossil Plants    of the Coal-measures.               9
pits, not con<U+FB01>ned, as in Conifers, to the sides of the vessels in contact
with the medullary rays, but covering their entire circumference.
    On examining tangential and radial sections of the phloem, it is
found to contain numerous long narrow tubes, but which cannot be
absolutely identi<U+FB01>ed with either sieve tubes or with sclerous <U+FB01>bres.
In the outer bark numerous <U+FB02>at plates of coarse sclerous parenchyma
pass horizontally outwards.        This feature is equally characteristic of
Hete'rangium Grievi'i.     Various forms of lateral outgrowths are also
described.
   Further observations are recorded on the structure of Kaloxylon
Hooke'r'i, also originally described by the author from specimens
obtained from collieries near Oldham, in ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 166
(Part I, 1876). These specimens, though revealing the elegant arrange
ments, especially of its vascular structures, to which the plant owes
its name, did not fully reveal the true structure of its cortex. But
soon after the publication of the memoir referred to, the author
obtained from Halifax beautiful examples in which this defect was
remedied. These new specimens exhibited within a remarkable epi
dermal layer, a thick cortex, always abounding in narrow vertically
elongated tubes, which appear to have been either gum or resin
canals.     In some examples these are crowded together in remarkable
numbers. But the Halifax specimens exhibited other peculiarities. In
some of them the peripheral end of each of the <U+FB01>ve or six radiating vas
cular wedges, which are so characteristic of the plant, is furnished with
a true phloem element.       In the larger proportion of the Halifax speci
mens    the  radiating exogenous extensions of the central vascular axis
 are wholly wanting, and, whilst in most of the specimens which possess
these exogenous growths no cellular parenchyma appears amongst the
vessels of that central axis, specimens are described which display
a gradual development of such tissue in that position.              In some
cases its amount almost equals the area occupied by the medullary
vascular bundles.       Some of the latter examples give o<U+FB01> rootlets from
the exterior of the central vasculo-cellular axis, which pass directly
outwards through the bark. A further series of specimens is described,
each of which contains vascular bundles, of which the transverse section
is quadrangular, closely resembling the tetrarch bundles of many
 roots.    Tracing these bundles downwards through a number of
examples which diminish in size until very minute ones are reached,
 we <U+FB01>nd evidence that these bundles developed centrifugally instead of
centripetally.      Nevertheless the author inclines to the belief that these
                                                                           -
objects are true rootlets.
    After pointing out the probability that the Lyginodend'ron Oldhamium
previously described by him is, notwithstanding its exogenous mode of
growth, a fern, of which Rac‘hiopter'is aspem was the foliage, the author
 states that Mr. Kidston has supplied him with structureless specimens

    a
10                                 Presents.                          [Jam   6,
preserved in shale, of Sphenopteris         elegana,  which display regular
transverse ridges crossing their stems and branches, which seem to
have been caused by the presence of bands of some hard substance,
corresponding exactly with those seen in the outer bark of both the
Heterangiums.       These, at all events, are the only examples of fossil
Carboniferous plants, in which structures comparable with those of
the Heterangium stems have been discovered. It is not without sig
ni<U+FB01>cance that H. Grievii has not only been found in the Westphalian
deposits of Pith Vollmond,         but a German locality has furnished
Professor von Weiss, of Berlin, with specimens of Sphenopteris
elegans, having the same kind of bark as those found in Scotland.
The author suggests that the Heterangiums may possibly have been
ancestral forms, having exogenous stems and fern-like foliage, which
may have bequeathed the former features to some of the modern
Cycads, and the latter to the Ferns, the living Stangeria having
retained some of the features of both.

surrounds        deliberately kill itself by in<U+FB02>icting

siderable antiquity:   it   has been, moreover, attested by very high
authority.
   The phenomenon would, however, be so extraordinary that its
occurrence has been much doubted.         Did          it
                                                 happen,    would stand as

Romanes‘“ says “as a unique case of an instinct detrimental alike to
the individual and to the species.”
   The subject has within recent years attracted aconsiderable amount
of attention, and numerous con<U+FB02>icting statements based both upon
incidental observations and upon de<U+FB01>nite experiments have been from
time to time recorded.
   Surgeon-General Bidie of Madras has describedi' an experiment
where he concentrated the sun’s rays with          burning glass upon the
                                                            a
back of a scorpion, which thereupon stung itself and died.       Dr. Allen
Thomsoni    also  brings  forward  corroborative  evidence as to the effect
of rays of light. Mr. GillmanI described experiments made with              a
circle of glowing charcoal in which he states that the scorpions died
from their own sting. Mr. R. F. Hutchinson§ pointed out that the
animals experimented upon by Mr. Gillman died from the excessive
heat.    Mr. Gillman, however, subsequently pointed out that the
temperature in the centre of such circle of glowing charcoal as he
                                                a
used does not exceed 50° G.

 “never     saw the   phenomenon        so   graphically delineated by Byron."
 A would-be humorous anonymous correspondent writing at the same
 time summed up the subject thus: “Can a man pummel his own
 back ? Can a horse kick its own belly ? But the feat attributed to
 the scorpion, apart from its moral obliquity, is physically even more
 triumphant.”      Mr. Lloyd Morgan‘ tried a great many methods of
 tormenting scorpions with the view of inducing them to commit
 suicide, but in no single case did they attempt to do so.
     Lastly, Ray Lankesterf noticed when killing a scorpion (Androctonus
                                                                          “
fmzesf'us) with chloroform vapour in a glass box that it made               repeated
 blows with its sting in a straight-forward direction above its head,”
 and at last one blow was so ill-directed as to cause the sting to catch
 under the free projecting margin of the posterior region of the cephalic
 shield. There was no laceration in this case, but it was evident there
 might have been. Lankester states that it is important to note the
 species observed in connexion with this question.                Suicide may occur
 in some species, but not in others. He also suggested to me that                   I
                                                                   ’
should ascertain whether the scorpion is ‘immune in regard to its
 own poison, as Fayrer states to be the case with certain poisonous
 snakes.
    At least three     species     of scorpion occur here—a large black
one, which is probably Buthus Kochii, a smaller lighter-coloured one,
and a very small red one.              I  hope to determine these accurately
later on.      In the meantime         I  have tried a very large and varied
series of experiments upon their stinging powers with the following
results :—
    1. There can be no doubt that it is physically possible for a scorpion
to sting itself in a vulnerable place.
    2. When a scorpion is placed in very unpleasant circumstances it
not unfrequently lashes its tail about and causes actual penetration of
the sting, as in the case observed by Dr. Bidie.
    3. The poison of a scorpion is quite powerless to kill the same
individual or another individual of the same or even of another
 species.
    4:. The poison is very rapidly fatal to a Thelypho'nus, less rapidly so
to a spider, and much less rapidly so to an insect.
    5. Two scorpions when <U+FB01>ghting repeatedly sting one another with
 little if any effect, the stronger kills the weaker by actually pulling
 it to pieces with its cheliceraa.
     6. Scorpions cannot stand even a dry temperature much above
 50° C., but fall into a sort of “heat coma,” and soon die if the
 temperature is raised.
                         *  ‘

 1887.]               The Reputed Suicide   of Scorpions.                 19
    I will brie<U+FB02>y    describe the experiments which have led to the above
results.
    1. If a dead scorpion be taken which is quite limp and not in a
state of rigour, it will be easily seen that the last four segments of
the tail are about the only portions of the body, Whether on the
dorsal or ventral surface, where a scorpion could not sting itself.
Further, if two <U+FB01>ghting scorpions be watched it will be seen that the
extent to which the sting can be moved about is perfectly wonderful.
    2.   I have tried the experiment with a charcoal <U+FB01>re, with a burning
glass, and indeed a variety of other “cruel” means of leading the
scorpion to despair, and to attempt to end all by suicide, and have
noticed that in lashing the tail about scorpions so treated have stung
themselves. To take the burning glass experiment, if the rays be con
centrated on any part of the body the scorpion brings his sting there
and endeavours to strike away the source of irritation (I have seen a
scorpion do this from whom          I had removed the whole sting some
weeks previously), and sometimes the endeavours become more and
more frantic, and the point of the sting catches somewhere, but the
scorpion does not die unless the heat is concentrated on the back
when it soon succumbs, and this equally so even with the sting tied
down or previously removed.
    3. Upon the third proposition, which, if once established,          is a
conclusive and positive refutation of the suicide theory,      I  have tried
a great many experiments.         I have taken scorpions belonging to the
various species found here, and by holding the sting between a pair
of forceps and the scorpion in my hand         I have pricked the scorpion
in various places with the sting and squeezed out its poison; there is a
little bleeding from the wound.                                       I
                                        Then still holding the sting have
taken a cockroach and squeezed out some more of the poison into it,
and always with these results: the scorpion lives for days, the cock
roach becomes very sluggish at once, and dies in an hour or so; it is
always considerably paralysed, and cannot run away far or fast.
I  have also used a large cricket instead of a cockroach stung in the
femur of the large hind leg; that leg becomes paralysed. Stung in
the same place on both sides both the hind legs become useless; the
animal crawls away on the two anterior pairs of legs, but otherwise
appears happy.        Stung in the thorax it becomes quite torpid ; when
placed on its back it is not able to turn over. These last experiments
show that my method of squeezing out the poison is perfectly effec
                   '
tive.
   I   then proceeded to try stinging one scorpion with another; <U+FB01>rstly,
both being specimens of the same species; secondly, using di<U+FB01>erent
species.       There was always the same result, the stung individual
never died from the sting, although          I  think that occasionally it
became      a tri<U+FB02>e sluggish.
                                                                 c 2

20                               Dr. A. G. Bourne.                          [Jan. 13,
    4. After considerable search         I   procured some specimens of Thely
phonus,   which   I  chose  as   being   the    nearest relatives of the scorpions.
I  stung these in my usual method, and in each case they died within
six seconds.     I  then tried some spiders; they died in a few minutes
when well stung. The action on cockroaches and crickets is described
above.    The equally rapid local but slower general action in these
latter animals is probably to be explained by the very inef<U+FB01>cient
circulation of the blood in insects as compared with Arachnida.                     It
would be an interesting experiment to sting a Limulus, and compare
the e<U+FB02>ect with that on a crustacean, and with that on other Arachnida.
    5. While keeping a quantity of scorpions together in captivity it is
not di<U+FB02>icult to induce a couple to <U+FB01>ght.               I isolated such a couple, and
they fought on and o<U+FB01> for two days, during which time each repeatedly
stung the other. The scorpions face one another, and the more
powerful manages to hold the other’s chelze within its own with a
sort of hugging action; it then <U+FB01>ghts with its cheliceraa, clawing
about the region of the mouth. A strong scorpion will actually tear
out the cheliccra of a small one in this manner; it then proceeds to
suck the blood and juices.
    On another occasion        I  separated from one another two scorpions
which had been <U+FB01>ghting, and which had repeatedly stung one another.
They lived perfectly well.

experiment.      I  placed a scorpion and a cockroach (for comparison) in
an incubator with glass sides;            I   gave them a piece of wood to walk
about upon,    and    gradually     raised     the temperature. At 40" C. both
seemed uncomfortable, the cockroach performed a sort of licking
action on all its legs and antenna; at 45° C. the scorpion became
very sluggish, and at 50° C. it was nearly dead.                    A large furious
scorpion before      the  experiment,       it  now   lay   on its back  and did not
attempt to get up.        I took it out and gave it a cold bath, and put
it in    a  cool   earthenware vessel, and it gradually (two hours)
recovered.    The cockroach        I  left in the incubator till the temperature
 reached 52° C.;      when    it  was   nearly dead      I  took it out, and it very
gradually recovered.
    To try the e<U+FB01>ect of a wet heat           I placed a scorpion    and a cockroach
in water at 43° C., and they both               died almost immediately, whereas
they would both have lived in cold             water for hours.
    In conclusion,    I  think we can          understand how various observers
have been led to form con<U+FB02>icting opinions, but 1 think we may safely
assert that scorpions do not commit suicide.                   There is not only an
absence of proof      that  they possess any         instinct  to do so, but absolute
proof that it is chemically impossible for them to do so—at any rate,
in the species which I have examined. The immunity of the scorpion

from any injurious in<U+FB02>uence after inoculation with its own poison is
merely a further example of a principle already established by Sir
Joseph Fayrer’s experiments<U+FB01>‘ which show conclusively that the
cobra poison will not a<U+FB01>ect a cobra, and will not even affect the
viperine .Ptyas.
                                    Postscript.
    Having received some criticisms and suggestions from Professor
Ray Lankester with regard to the above record of experiments, I
have made the following additional observations :—
    1. It appears to have been stated that inclosure in a circle of oil,
or inclosure under an inverted tumbler, will cause a scorpion to
commit suicide. I placed a scorpion on a plate within a ring of
cocoa-nut oil. It calmly walked through.                (This calls to mind Sir
 Kenelm Digby’s experiment with a spider placed in the centre of
a circle made of powdered “ unicoru’s horn.”                   Contrary to Sir
 Kenelm’s prediction when this experiment was made before the Royal
 Society on 24th July, 1661, the spider, as recorded in the Society’s
register, “immediately ran out severall times repeated.               The spider
once   made   some stay upon the powder.”)            I placed another scorpion
on a plate, and round the edge a thick roll of rag dripping with
kerosiue oil. The scorpion walked out over the rag. I further daubed
the scorpion with the oil : it appeared uncomfortable, but did nothing
remarkable.       The experiment with an inverted tumbler was made
and gave the same negative result.
    With regard to the method of “ squeezing out ” the poison. In all
 my experiments     I  catch hold of the sting with a pair of forceps or in
my <U+FB01>ngers      and  press the poison out.        It is quite easy to press out a
little drop of milky white <U+FB02>uid which has a very pungent smell
resembling that of formic acid.
   As to the parts of the body in which two scorpions when <U+FB01>ghting
sting one another,       I  have observed that the sting is most usually
in<U+FB02>icted under the front edge of the carapace, or between the joints
of the great chelze, and sometimes near the bases of the other legs.
I  have constantly satis<U+FB01>ed myself of the actual penetration of the
sting.    I am also perfectly convinced that the scorpions so stung do
not in any way suffer from the poison.                                      .
   As to the position of the arti<U+FB01>cial stinging carried out by me,             I
took especial care in all cases to avoid mechanical injury to the nerve
ganglia.     Thus in my notes       I  <U+FB01>nd "‘ Scorpion A made arti<U+FB01>cially to
sting Scorpion B in three places under the cephalothorax; no cessation
of activity.” Again, “ Thelyphonus A stung arti<U+FB01>cially in mid-dorsal             _
line between two abdominal somites.               The animal which was very
                                                   in ten seconds.”     “

that leg became paralysed; leg removed with scissors, and the animal

turns over when placed on his back and crawls about.        Stung now
in thorax (dorsally), quite paralysed; moves jaws, but will not turn
over.”
     I
     have made experiments with simple puncture for control—that is
without introduction of scorpion poison.      Using large insects for
these experiments I obtained complete freedom from ill-effects when
using simple puncture, whilst the same species of insects when
punctured with introduction of scorpion poison were instantly para
lysed and died in half an hour.
     I
     also procured two small shore crabs.    One punctured between            I
two joints of the great chela of one side; several drops of blood
exuded, but they coagulated, and the crab remained well. The second
I stung in the same place with scorpion’s sting, squeezing it to ensure
poisoning.    The claw was immediately paralysed, and the crab
gradually became torpid, and died in less than an hour.

than was there claimed for them, yet was not entirely satis<U+FB01>ed with
the result, since the calculation of the fundamental quantities had
been carried to 269 places of decimals, and therefore the above-cited
equation of condition showed that some errors, which          I
                                                          had not suc
ceeded in tracing, had crept into the calculations so as to vitiate the
results beyond the 263rd place of decimals.
   Of course in working with such a large number of interminable
decimals, the necessary neglect of decimals of higher orders causes an
uncertainty in a few of the last decimal places, but when due care is
taken, this uncertainty ought not to affect more than two or three of
the last <U+FB01>gures.
   The Napierian logarithm of 10 is equal to 23a—6b+100, and the
Modulus of common logarithms is the reciprocal of this quantity.
   Since the value found for the logarithm of 10 cannot be depended
upon beyond 262 places of decimals, a corresponding uncertainty will
affect the value of the Modulus found from it.
   In the operation of dividing unity by the assumed value of log 10,
however, the quotient was carried        282 places of decimals.
                                         to_
   This was done for the purpose of supplying the means of correcting
the value found for the Modulus, without the necessity of repeating
the division, when   I  should have succeeded in tracing the errors of
calculation alluded to above, and thus <U+FB01>nding       avalue of log 10 which
might   be depended   upon to  a larger number    of decimal places.
   Through   inadvertence, the   values of the  logarithms  concerned, and
the resulting value of the    Modulus,  were   printed  in my paper in the
 Proceedings above referred to exactly as they resulted from the cal
‘            ’
culations, without the suppression of the decimals of higher orders,
which in the case of the logarithms were uncertain, and in the case of
the Modulus were known to be incorrect.
   Although  it was unlikely that this oversight would lead to any mis
apprehension as to the degree of accuracy claimed for my results in
the mind of  a  reader of the paper itself, there might be danger of
                                                                  a
such misapprehension        my printed results were quoted in full un
                            if
accompanied by the statement that the later decimal places were not
to be depended on.
   My attention has been recalled to this   subject by the circumstance
that in the excellent  article  on  Logarithms which Mr. Glaisher has
contributed to the new edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica,’ he
                                               ‘

IV.   “ On the Crimson              Line of Phosphorescent Alumina.” By
     WILLIAM CROOKES, F.R.S., V.P.C.S. Received December
     30, 1886.
   In a paper which 1 had the honour of communicating to the Royal
Society* in March, 1879,             I described the phosphorescence of alumina
and its various forms when under the in<U+FB02>uence of the electrical dis
charge in vacuo, in the following words :—“ Next to the diamond,
alumina in the form of ruby is perhaps the most strikingly phosphor
escent  stone      I   have examined.        It glows with a rich, full red; and a
remarkable feature is that it is of little consequence what degree of
colour the earth or stone possesses naturally, the colour of the phos
phorescence is nearly the same in all cases; chemically precipitated
amorphous alumina, rubies of a pale reddish-yellow, and gems of the
        ‘                        ’
prized pigeon’s blood colour, glowing alike in the vacuum, thus cor
roborating E. Becquerel’s-t results on the action of light on alumina
and its compounds in the phosphoroscope.                     .  .  .  .   The appear
ance of the alumina glow in the spectroscope is remarkable.                    There is
a faint continuous spectrum ending in the red somewhere near the
line B; then a black space, and next an intensely brilliant and sharp
red line, to which nearly the whole of the intensity of the coloured
glow is due.         .   .    .   .  This line coincides with the one described
by E. Becquerel as being the most brilliant of the lines in the spec
trum of the light of alumina, in its various forms, when glowing in
the phosphoroscope.”
   In 18811        I   again returned to the subject, describing a large
number 'of fresh experiments; and                 I  may add that the red glow of
alumina has been, off and on, a subject of examination with me since
the year <U+FB01>rst named down to the present time.
   In the papers above quoted I gave as accurate measurements of
the alumina line as my instrumental means would then permit.                           I
have recently had occasion to go over these measurements again in a

think, are suf<U+FB01>ciently important to be worth bringing before the notice
of the Royal Society.
   The spectrum consists <U+FB01>rstly of an exceedingly faint and hazy pair
of bands; these are too faint to measure, but they appear to be in
about the same position as the bands 1986—2009, and 2031—2075 in
the spinel spectrum given further on.       Next is seen the characteristic
crimson line of the alumina spectrum; this, when examined with a
<U+FB01>ne slit and high power eyepiece, is seen to be double, the distance
apart of the components being about half the distance separating the
D lines. Then come a pair of fainter and rather nebulous orange
lines; beyond them is a dark space followed by a continuous spectrum
extending to the green. The following are the measurements of the
spectrum :—

      It is  known that spinel (magnesium aluminate) phosphoresces with
                                                     '

  tion   in  the high power spectroscope the spectrum of the light emitted
  by spinel under the radiant matter test is seen to differ from that
  emitted by ruby and alumina under the same test, and to closely
  approximate to the description given by E. Becquerel in 1859.
      The spectrum <U+FB01>rst shows, in the extreme red, a faint double band,
  then a narrow crimson line, which, however, is not double like the
  alumina line, neither is it quite so bright and sharp. Four hazy red
  bands follow, the fourth being wider and more indistinct than the
 others.       Here the spectrum of most spinels fades away. Sometimes,
 however, a spinel is seen to glow with a greenish tint; in these the
 spectrum is the same as the others up to this point, and there is also
 seen a bright concentration of light in the green.
     The measurements of the spinel spectrum are given in the following

                       Spectrum of Spinel (Magnesium Aluminate).
   In the ‘ Comptes Rendus           ’
                                       for December 6th last" appears a brief
note by M. de Boisbaudran, in which he announces, “to take date, that
alumina, calcined and submitted to the electrical discharge in a vacuum,
has not given him a trace of red <U+FB02>uorescence.              This <U+FB02>uorescence, as well
as its special spectrum, shows itself brilliantly when the alumina contains
T%Utlz and even Tle-ath of erO;,.            With the 1°500th part of (n.0, we
still obtain very visible rose colour.                        From these observations
the presence of chromium appears to          be  indispensable     to the  production of
the red <U+FB02>uorescence of alumina.”
   This   statement       being opposed to all my experience,           I   immediately
instituted     experiments with a view, if possible, to clear up the
mystery. I started with aluminium sulphate, which                         I  knew to be
tolerably pure,       and   in which   ordinary   tests  failed  to  detect   chromium.
On ignition and testing in the usual manner in a radiant matter tube,
the alumina line was brightly visible in the spectrum of the emitted
light.    Different portions of this aluminium sulphate were now
puri<U+FB01>ed by various processes for the separation of chromium.                         All
gave as a result the absence of this impurity.                The most trustworthy
process being that devised by Wiihler<U+FB01>               I  used it to purify the bulk.
The salt was dissolved in water, and excess of caustic potash added
till the precipitate <U+FB01>rst formed redissolved. Chlorine was now passed
through till no_ more precipitate fell down and the liquid retained a
strong odour of chlorine.           The whole of the chromium would now be
in solution, whilst the alumina would be in the precipitate. The
 alumina was <U+FB01>ltered off, well washed, and a portion tested in the
radiant matter tube.           It gave as good an alumina spectrum as did the
original sulphate, the crimson line being very prominent.
    The alumina thus puri<U+FB01>ed was a second time dissolved in caustic
 potash and submitted to the chlorine purification.                       Again in the
 radiant matter tube the alumina gave its characteristic crimson line
 spectrum.

1887.]         Crimson  Line of Phosphorescent Alumina.                29
    The <U+FB01>ltrate from the alumina, which should contain all the
chromium present in the form of potassium chromate, was super
saturated with hydrochloric acid and boiled till free from volatile
chlorine compounds.       Alcohol was then added, and it was again
boiled to reduce to the state of sesquichloride of chromium any
chromic acid which might be present.          Ammonia in excess was now
added, and the whole was boiled; a very small precipitate of a brownish
colour fell down; it was <U+FB01>ltered and washed. This precipitate, which
was not more than the “<U+FB01>lm<U+FB01>h part of the alumina from which it
was derived, contained no chromium whatever; it was too small in
quantity to admit of a complete analysis being made, but all the tests
which     I could apply showed it to be a mixture of ferric oxide and
alumina.
    One part of this precipitate was mixed with 100 parts of the pure
alumina from which it had just been separated, and the mixture was
tested in the radiant matter tube.     The phosphorescence was the same
as    in the two previous experiments, the crimson line being neither
better nor worse.                        .
    I  now prepared aluminium chromate, and tested its action in the
radiant matter tube.     It was almost black after ignition, and refused
to phosphoresce.      A mixture was then made of aluminium chromate
and alumina in the proportion of one part chromium to 100 parts of
aluminium.       After ignition the colour of the mixture was almost
white. Tested, it gave very poor phosphorescence; the alumina line
was faintly visible.
    Aluminium acetate was mixed with 5 per cent. of ammonium
bichromate, ignited with sulphuric acid, and tested in the radiant
matter tube. There was no phosphorescence.           The same mixture was
heated to a high temperature before the blowpipe, when it gave a
very feeble phosphorescence,       but  I    could detect no line in the
spectrum.
    Pure alumina was mixed with 5 per cent. of ammonium bichromate,
and moistened with sulphuric acid. After ignition it phosphoresced
with a reddish colour, and the spectrum showed a concentration of
light in the orange, but no alumina light was visible. The tube was
opened, and the contents heated to a very high blowpipe temperature.
In the radiant matter tube it gave the same results as before.
    A mixture of 0'5 per cent. ammonium bichromate, 10 per cent. of
 lime, and 895 per cent. of pure alumina was ignited with sulphuric
 acid, and tested in the usual way.        The calcium brought out a trace
 of yttrium and samarium bands, but no crimson line was to be seen.
    Alumina precipitated from its ammoniacal solution by boiling was
 found to glow with a green light in the vacuum tube and to give no
 crimson line in its spectrum. The tube was now opened, and some of
 its contents removed and heated in a hot blast blowpipe to the

 30     07L the   Crimson   Line of Phosphorescent Alumina.     [Jam 13,
melting point of platinum for about <U+FB01>ve minutes. Re-tested in a
vacuum tube this alumina was seen to glow at the points and edges
of the lumps where the heat had been <U+FB01>ercest, with a red light,
giving afaint line spectrum.      The bulk of the mass, however, gave
out the original green glow.
   To get the crimson line most brilliantly, it is necessary to ignite the
earth to the highest temperature of the blowpipe <U+FB02>ame.             With a
slightly less heat  the phosphorescence   is not  strong, and  the  line is
faint. When the temperature has not been raised high enough the
colour of the emitted light in most aluminas is green, and no line is
visible; whilst the same earth raised to a higher temperature glows
with a red light, and the red line comes into view. The most brilliant
crimson line, when seen at all, has always been obtained when the
alumina has been kept near the melting point of platinum for some
time.
   Physical differences, or perhaps even difference in molecular com
position, also exert a great in<U+FB02>uence on the phosphorescence of
alumina.    In this connexion, I-ask permission to quote a sentence
from my paper of May, 1881, already mentioned :—“ Two earthen
crucibles were tightly packed, the one with sulphate of alumina, the
other with acetate of alumina. They were then exposed, side by side,
to the most intense heat of a wind-furnace—a       heat little short of
the melting point of platinum.     The resulting aluminas were then
tested in the molecular stream.     The alumina from the sulphate
gave the   crimson  glow  and  the spectrum line. The alumina from
the acetate gave no red glow or line, but a pale green phosphor
escence.”
    Experience gained in the yttria research has taught me that the
 possibility of the molecule of aluminium being composed of two or
 more submolecules, only one of which is capable of giving the crimson
 line phosphorescence, must not be overlooked.       To test this hypo~
 thesis alumina, as pure as I could prepare it,was submitted to three
 separate processes of fractionation, the operations in each case being
 repeated from twenty to thirty times.    Alumina giving the crimson
line always concentrated towards one end of the fractionations,
whilst at the other end the alumina sometimes phosphoresced of a
green tint, and at others scarcely phosphoresced at all, the crimson
line being either very feeble or entirely absent in the spectrum. The
earths were always ignited for the same time and, as nearly as
possible, to the same temperature.
    In no case could chromium be detected at either extremity of the
fractionations.
    These experiments are perhaps too few to permit any important
inference being drawn from them. There seem, however, to be four
possible explanations of the phenomena observed :—

 18 8 7                           Presents.                               31
    1. The crimson line is due to alumina, but        it is capable of being
        suppressed by an accompanying earth which concentrates
        towards one end of the fractionations.
    2. The crimson line is not due to alumina, but is due to the
         presence of an accompanying earth concentrating towards the
        other end of the fractionations.
   3. The crimson line belongs to alumina, but its full development
        requires certain precautions to be observed in the time and
        intensity of ignition, degree of exhaustion, or its absolute
        freedom from alkaline and other bodies carried down by preci
        pitated alumina, and dif<U+FB01>cult to remove by washing; experience
        not having yet shown which of these precautions are essential
        to the full development of the crimson line and which are
        unessential.
   4. The earth alumina is a compound molecule, one of its con
        stituent molecules giving the crimson line. According to this
        hypothesis alumina would be analogous to yttria.
   It is not unlikely that a chemist wishing to obtain alumina of
exceptional purity might submit it to a series of operations, akin to
fractionation, which would have the effect of giving earths phos
phorescing either with a strong crimson line, or with little or no
crimson line; and either of these samples of alumina might be looked
upon by him as pure. It is possible that some such explanation as

 I. “ Some Anomalies in the Winds of Northern India, and their
        Relation to the Distribution of Barometric Pressure.”           By
        S. A. HILL, B.Sc., Meteorological Reporter to Government,
       North-Western Provinces and Oudh.               Communicated by
       H. F. BLANFORD, F.R.S., Meteorological Reporter to the
        Government of India.       Received January 3, 1887.
                                (Abstract)
    In this paper the author points out that notwithstanding the great
amount of light thrown upon the circulation of the atmosphere over
 Northern India by the accurate and intercomparable barometric and
 other observations made at numerous meteorological stations during
the last thirteen years, there are still some unexplained anomalies
connected with the wind system of that part of the world.              The
most important of these anomalies are the following :—
    (1.) The winds of the hot season not infrequently blow against a
rising barometric gradient, i.e., from places where the pressure is low
to others where it is higher.
   (2.) The velocity of the wind has little or no relation to the
distribution of pressure, but increases and diminishes with the tem
perature.
    (3.)  An unusual accumulation of snow     on the North-west Himalaya
during the winter and spring months         causes, as Mr. H. F. Blanford
has shown, unusually strong dry westerly winds over the plains during
the succeeding summer; whereas the high pressure at sea-level
accompanying cold over the regions to the north of India should
give rise to easterly winds.
   The paper is divided into three parts in which these three anomalies
are discussed in order.   The <U+FB01>rst part is in reality a train of inductive
reasoning which leads up to the-hypothesis that the cause of the
                                                                n 2

36     Some Anomalies    in the Winds  of iVorthern India.    [J an. 20
anomalous hot winds is to be found, not in the distribution of pressure
at the level of the plains, but in an interchange between the lower
atmospheric strata and those at high levels, e<U+FB01>'ected through the
medium of convection currents set up by the diurnal heating of the
earth’s surface when the sun shines.     This hypothesis was <U+FB01>rst put
forward by Kiippen to explain the diurnal inequality of wind velocity,
and the author shows that in the dry season the vertical distribution
of temperature in India is such that convective action capable of
producing such interchange must occur.
   In the second part the diurnal variation of the wind velocity is
attributed to convective interchange, and it is shown that probably the
annual inequality may be explained in the same way, the barometric
gradients prevailing at high levels between the plains and the moun
tains to the north of India being subject to an annual variation
dependent on the temperature.       To verify the conclusions deduced
from the convection hypothesis, the midday pressures at 10,000 feet
above sea-level have been computed for the months of January, May,
July, and October from the observations of many years at forty
stations, and the resulting values have been laid down on a set of
charts, another set giving the distribution of pressure at sea-level
and the prevailing wind directions over India. The high level distri
bution of pressure, as shown on the charts, is found to be exactly such
as would produce the observed anomalies in the wind direction and
velocity.  The charts also furnish reasons for the particular paths
taken by the disturbances which bring the winter rainfall of Northern
India and by the cyclonic storms originating at different seasons in
the Bay of Bengal, the rule being that the storm centre follows the
line of lowest pressure in a stratum of the atmosphere lying above all
local obstructions such as the mountain ranges in the interior of
India.
   The third part of the paper is devoted to proving that in years
when the summer rains fail the gradients for westerly winds at
10,000 feet over Northern India are intensi<U+FB01>ed, in the <U+FB01>rst place by
the unusual cold over the North-west Himalaya, due to the previous
snowfall, and afterwards by the great heat of the plains, which have
not been cooled by the usual precipitations in June and July. The
evidence for this conclusion is not so clear as it might be; but it is
shown that when the most trustworthy observations are compared
the gradients for westerly winds at 10,000 feet over the Gangetic
plains were very high in the remarkably dry years 1877 and 1880,
whilst they were very low, that is to say, there were gradients for
easterly winds over a great extent of the plain, in 1879 and 1884,
which were years with excessive rain. In the moderately dry year
1883 there was a considerable gradient for westerly winds, but not
nearly so great as in 1877 or 1880.

                                 (Abstract)
     This is a continuation of the investigation in which the authors are
engaged. The measurements include the expansion of the liquid, the
pressure of the vapour, and the compressibility of the substance in
the gaseous state; and from these are deduced the densities of the
saturated vapour and the heats of vaporisation.         The total range of
temperature is from -—-15° to +240°; the range of pressure, from
11 mm. to 60,000 mm.        The conclusions announced in their previous
papers     are supported by these measurements.      The apparent critical
temperature is 240'0°, and the critical pressure about 59,700 mm.
III.   “  Further Discussion of the Sun-Spot Observations made at
       South Kensington.”         By J. NORMAN LOGKYER, F.R.S.
       Received January 8, 1887.
    In papers communicated to the Royal Society, and printed in the
‘                ’
  Proceedings (vol. 31, pp. 72 and 348; vol. 32, p. 203; and vol. 33,
p. 154) the sun-spot observations made at South Kensington since
1879 have been to some extent discussed.
    In the last paper communicated to the Society, in May, 1886,         I
discussed the results obtained by the reduction of the observations of
the most widened lines in the region F to b for the whole number of
observations (700) made from November, 1879, to August, 1885.
   In the latter paper it was shown that as we pass from the minimum
to the maximum period included in the years named, the lines of
known terrestrial elements disappear, their places being taken by
lines which do not appear in any maps or tables of spectral lines. It
was pointed out that such a result might be explained on the supposi
tion that since the solar atmosphere is quietest and coolest at the

38                     Mr.  J. N. Lockyer.     On the           [Jam 20,
minimum period, the vapours of terrestrial elements can exist then at
the sun-spot level and give some of their characteristic absorption lines ;
while at the more intensely heated and much disturbed maximum
sun-spot period the vapours of terrestrial elements are dissociated,
at the spot level, and give vapours which have no terrestrial equiva
lents.
   Since last May the reduction of the observations of the most
widened lines in the region b to D has been continued, and the results
are given in the present communication.          They strikingly con<U+FB01>rm
those previously obtained.       The conclusions drawn in the previous
paper are therefore much strengthened by the evidence obtained from
this new region.
   The observations referred to in the former paper were given in a
series of tables; corresponding tables are given in the present com
munication; so that a clear comparison can be made. Tables A and B
show that for each of the elements taken—iron and titanium—the
number of lines seen in the aggregate in each hundred observations
decreases from the minimum to the maximum period.
   Nickel was given in the previous paper, but in this region, b to D,
Thalén only gives <U+FB01>ve lines due to nickel, and only one of these is
found amongst the most widened lines, and that only once in the <U+FB01>fth
hundred.
   Table C gives the lines recorded as most widened, but not included
as metallic lines by Angstriim or Thalén, and it will be noticed these
are recorded as most numerous at the maximum period.
   In the curves given in Fig. 1, it is seen that there is the same
rapid rise in the unknown lines to the third hundred, the same gradual
rise from this to the sixth hundred, and then the commencement of the
fall, just as in the previous paper for the other region of the spectrum
under observation.       The curve due to iron exhibits an almost exact
coincidence with the one previously published for the other region,
with the difference that in this part of the spectrum the number of
iron lines is not so great.
   The titanium curve shows a sudden rise in the <U+FB01>fth hundred. One
line (5226) was amongst the most widened no less than twenty-two
times, and it is a singular fact that this line was only recorded as
most widened on one other occasion (in the fourth hundred) in the
whole 700 observations.        Although at <U+FB01>rst sight this seems to be a
 result contrary   to  that  obtained  in the case of iron, it should be
remarked that this line is one seen in the spectrum of the spark and
may be considered to be due to high temperature, therefore its
appearance in the maximum period was fully in accordance with the
other facts adduced.
   The reductions have been made and the tables prepared by Messrs.
Mills, Spencer, and Taylor.

 I. “On     a Perspective Microscope.”                By GEORGE J. BURCH.

    In  1874 the author discovered a form        of microscope giving constant
 magni<U+FB01>cation along     the  optic  axis,  so   that   objects were shown by it
in microscopic perspective.
    By writing (f1+f2+H) for the distance between two thin lenses,
he obtained for the formula of the system

the second lens to the image.
   Putting H = O in this equation, three things result.
   1. d'v/du, which represents the longitudinal magni<U+FB01>cation, becomes
constant, namely —(fdf1)9;

which it was drawn has the perspective belonging to an object

    If the lenses are nearly but not quite in the afocal position, greater
power and a wider <U+FB01>eld may be obtained, but it is at the expense of
the penetration, which may. however, with advantage be limited to
the thickness of the object.        The instrument offers great advantages
for artistic purposes, but lenses or mirrors of specially wide angle are
needed for the farther development of the invention.
    The optical conditions of a system of two thin lenses at varying
 distance apart are shown by diagrams.
    In Diagram I the u and 'v of the formula employed are set off as
 abscissae and ordinates, and the curves (which are rectangular hyper
 bolas) drawn for several values of H.              In the afocal position of the
 lenses the curve degrades intn a line which is a tangent to all the
hyperbolas at the point (fpfg).              The locus of vertices and locus of
 centres of these curves being straight lines, and the hyperbolas all
 touching the point ( f1, f2), it is shown that the principal foci, principal
 points, and equivalent focal length for any given position of the lenses
 can be found by rule and compasses, without drawing the curve.
    In Diagram       II the actual position of the lenses, their principal foci,
 separate   and   combined,    and the principal points, positive and negative
  (answering to the vertices of the curves in Diagram 1), are plotted
 down as abscissze, the values of H on an enlarged scale being taken as
 ordinates.
    Diagram     III   shows the same for two lenses of equal focal length.
     Comparison      of these two diagrams suggests the employment of the

 magnitude of the image is in the constant ratio jil/fl to that of the

     Professor Ramsay has communicated to me that he and Mr. Young
  have found that within wide limits            several substances in the liquid
  and gaseous states have the following relation connecting their pres
  sure (p), temperature (T), and speci<U+FB01>c volume (v),

  Ill.   “On the Morphology of Birds."               By Professor W. K.
             PARKER, F.R.S. Received January 13, 1887.

                            Introductory Remarks.    _
   During the time that the special study of the development of the
skull has occupied my attention, the rest of the skeleton has been
neglected; it has, however, had its cultivators in no small number.
   In a limited degree the skeleton has been worked out by me ;—for
instance, the shoulder-girdle and sternum in the Vertebrata generally ;
in birds, the whole skeleton did at one time—a quarter of a century
ago—take up much of my thought.
    The development of the skeleton, generally in this Class, is a subject
of great interest, and     I   am anxious to catch up all the scattered
results that lie before me, of the excellent but extremely limited
labours of other biologists.
    I  did begin the study of the development of the limbs, sternum,
pelvis, and spine, in 1842, and some of the results will be brought
forward in the present paper.
    This will be, I trust, but the <U+FB01>rst-fruits of my most recent work;
for, during the long years that have elapsed since this research was
fairly begun, I have lost no opportunity of laying up in store
 embryos and young of birds of many kinds.               These stores, if well
worked out, will yield a series of papers like the one now o<U+FB01>ered to

  The bibliography of my published papers on the Osteclogy of the
Thorax partly, and of the Skull largely, is given in the general
Bibliographical List. It has been necessary to do this, as every scrap
and part of the older work is wanted, now that an attempt is made
to build the old and the new into something like a structure having
form and fulness.
    There are several things that go to increase the interest in the
morphology of these culminating Sauropsida at the present time.
    First—The discovery by Gegenbaur, Huxley, and others, of the
close relationship of birds and reptiles, especially of the extraordinary
 fact that the hind limb and pelvis of even the most minute bird pass
 through a stage in which they correspond almost exactly with the
 hind limb and pelvis of the most gigantic kinds of extinct reptiles—
 the Dinosaurs or Ornithoscelida.
    Secondly.—The recent discoveries of biologists as to the composition
of the Cheiropterygium in the various types of air-breathing Verte
brata. It is now well known that the <U+FB01>ve-<U+FB01>ngered hand and the foot
with <U+FB01>ve toes are the specialised modern representatives of hands and
feet that had at least seven rays in their composition.
   And, thirdly—the study of the development and general morphology
of birds    is,
              at the present time, of great interest,—now that we are
looking to the study of metamorphosis for some initial elucidation of.
the mystery as to the origin of the various types of Vertebrata. ‘
   The labour of each succeeding day at this culminating Class makes
it  more and more impossible for me to conceive of birds as arising
direct from the Dinosaurians, or indeed from any other order or
group of reptiles.
   Long attention to the metamorphosis of the Amphibia. has intensi<U+FB01>ed
this dif<U+FB01>culty to me; for the newly-transformed frog or newt appears
to me to be the true counterpart of a newly-hatched reptile—snake,
lizard, turtle, or crocodile.
   Each of these young creatures, whether          has undergone a true

evidently an imago; although an image that continues to grow.
   Now each amphibian has its own larva, for the larvae of the various
species have their speci<U+FB01>c di<U+FB01>erences.
   The thousand known species of existing Amphibia—Anurans,
Urodeles, and Coecilians—and all the <U+FB01>shes that undergo metamor

  54                           Prof.  W. K. Parker.                     [Jam 27,
      If many of the existing Vertebrata are metamorphic now, is it not
  very probable that they were all metamorphic once ?
      The fact that we have, even now, such forms as the larval lamprey
  (or Ammocoete),       the larvae of Ganoids and Dipnoi, and the tadpoles
  of newts and frogs, suggests to me the possibility of the existence of
  huge swarms of low Proto-Vertebrata in the early ages of the inhabited
  planet.
      If such proto-vertebrate forms existed, then it is quite supposable
  that a metamorphosis may, from time to time, have taken place, of
  this and that quasi-larval form into archaic reptile, ancestral bird, or
  primitive mammal.
      I am not afraid that anyone familiar with the development,
  structure, and habits of the existing Amphibia will see any dif<U+FB01>culty
  in the passage of a metamorphic into a so-callcd non-metamorphic
  type, during time, and under the pressure of new outward conditions,
  —when the dilemma offered to the supposed low vertebrate was
  Transform 0r perish.
      To me it seems that the creature’s necessity was Nature’s oppor
  tunity; and that, during long ages, the morphological force had
  accumulated in those low forms an enormous surplusage of unused
  energy which, in the ripeness of time, blossomed out into this and
  that new and noble type.
      Of all the types of Vertebrata, there is none like the bird of high
  degree for illustrating what Professor Huxley calls “the threefold
   law of evolution," namely, overgrowth of some parts, starvation and
  even death of others, and fusion of parts originally distinct.
      N o kind of vertebrate whatever presents to the osteologist so hope
   less an enigma in the adult skeleton as that of the bird; in the
   overgrowth of certain parts, the abortion or suppresion of others,
   and the extensive fusion of large tracts of skeletal elements.
      Hence this Class has largely acted upon the morphological mind ;
                                      ”
   the “ Comparative Anatomist           has, of necessity, undergone evolution
   into the “Morphologist,” and the latter has had to be re<U+FB01>ned and
                          “
   developed into the       Embryologist.”
       In the bird class we meet with this remarkable phenomenon,
   namely, that the swiftest creatures by far that inhabit the earth have
   had, for the purposes of their most consummate mechanism, the
    greatest loss of freedom of the individual parts of the skeletal frame
   work.
       Between the pigeon, on one hand, above, and the emeu, on the
    other, below, there are several families of related birds; but there is
    no direct superposition,—they arc obliquely above or below each other.

is none better for the purposes of study than the common fowl; to

the limbs in as many stages as formerly did the skull.
   I can now give an account of the vertebral column with the ribs and
sternum, the limb-girdles and limbs, from the end of the seventh day
of incubation; by which time the hyaline cartilage is perfect, and
certain even of the bony tracts are begun.
   The fowl is an intermediate form between the emeu and the pigeon;
but most akin to the latter. I shall now con<U+FB01>ne myself to what is
seen in the development of the skeleton (excluding the skull) in this
medium type.
   The vertebral column, at the end of a week’s incubation, is formed
of hyaline cartilage; up to the end of the true sacrals, the notochord
is completely invested with cartilage; but, behind those four segments,
only at the sides.
   The notochord has its constrictions in the middle of each centrum,
and is most dilated at the intercentra.
   The neural arches do not nearly meet above; the atlas is in four
pieces—a super<U+FB01>cial and an inner piece to the centrum, and a pair of
arch-rudiments;       the inner segment of the centrum becomes the
odontaid process of the awis.
   Between the axis and the <U+FB01>rst true sacral, all the vertebrae have
separate ribs; in the cervical region, except near the dorsal region,
there are small styloid cartilages lying horizontally, which have their
head, or thick end, wedged in between the upper and lower transverse
processes.     Near the dorsals they are transversely placed, and then
begin to develop a descending process.
    The <U+FB01>rst vertebra of this stage with complete ribs becomes, by
 absorption of the lower part of the arch, the last cervical in the
adult.     Behind the twenty pre-sacrals there are <U+FB01>fteen sacrals, and
 this series has its subdivisions.
    The <U+FB01>rst develops ribs (it is dorso-sacral), the next three develop
 minute but distinct ribs, like those near the lower part of the neck;
 these are lumbo-sacral.     Then come the four sacrals with no ribs, and
 then the seven uro-sacrals, the <U+FB01>rst two of which have rib-bars that
 ossify separately, below the upper transverse processes, which latter
 form a complete series from the third cervical to the last free caudal
 segment.
    Of those there are <U+FB01>ve; then come <U+FB01>ve more paired imperfect      rudi
 ments,   clinging  to the terminal part of the notochord.
    At  the end of the 8th day there are six of these, with the last elon
 gated, and the notochord projecting      behind far enough for three or
 four more rudiments.
    At  the end of the 10th day the vertebral chain has undergone a great

   56                         Prof. W. K. Parker.                     [Jan  27,
   change.      The atlas is still composed of four distinct pieces of car
   tilages, but the ribs have become fused above and below with the
   transVerse processes, and the notochord is now most constricted at the
   intercentra.
       Besides this, in the pre-sacrals, it is constricted in two places within
   each centrum;     so that each centrum in the modern bird corresponds
  to three subdivisions of this axial chord.
      For two or three days there is evidence of an archaic subdivision of
  the notocliord into three timesas many verteme divisions as are made
  now in the modern bird.
      In the sacral the constrictions are fewer; they are only at the inter
  centra, and in the middle of the centrum.
      The only absolutely necessary part of the sternum is that where the
  sternal ribs are attached; that is a very small part, and the rest is
  for the attachment of the huge muscles that act upon the wings, and
  for the obliqui and mash abdominis.
      The limb-girdles are each in three pairs of distinct cartilages.       In
  front, the scapula, the minute pre-coracoid, the coracoid; behind the         i
  ilium, pubis and ischium; the [ire-pubis is part of the ilium, and that
 has two regions, the pre-ilium and the post-ilium.
      These parts in the bird are not continuous tracts of cartilages,
 ossi<U+FB01>ed by several centres, but are distinct, <U+FB01>rst as cartilages, then
 as bony tracts; those of the shoulder keep distinct; those of the hip
 soon coalesce.
      The wings at the end of the 7th day are three-toed webbed paws,
 with all    the digits turned inwards.      The rods that compose the main
 part of it are composed of solid cartilage ; the humerus, radius, ulna,
 and 1st and 2nd metacarpals have a bony sheath round their middle
 part ; the ends of the digits and the carpals are but partly chondri<U+FB01>ed.
 Five carpal nuclei, however, can be made out, and the two proximal
 nuclei are known to be further subdivided, each into two, in other
 types; hence we can already account for seven carpals in the bird,
 which has only two in the adult, in a free state.
      Moreover, the 1st digit has two, and the 2nd three phalanges, the
 normal number, as in lizards; the 3rd, which should have four, but
 in birds has as a rule only one, has now two, as in the ostrich, and a
 few other birds ; there is no sign at the end of the 7th or even of the
 8th day of incubation of any more than three digits, but we have in
 the wrist an tntermedio-radiale,        a centralo-ulnare,   and three distal
 carpals, answering to the three developed metacarpals.              The digits
 up    to the  end of  the 8th day are rounded and <U+FB02>attish, and are quite
 like those of a young newt or frog. But in two days more, at the
 end of the 10th day, the wing has almost acquired the adult form;
 and one more bony centre, that of the 1st metacarpal, has appeared.
.The overgrowth of the 2nd distal carpal and the 2nd metacarpal,

 1887.]                 On the Morphology   of Birds.                   57
 with its large and dilated digit, has arrested the distal carpal of the
 lat or short digit, the “ pollex.” This is the last nucleus to chondrify.
 It is still a very small, limpet-like disk of cartilage, and is now only
 to be seen on the <U+FB02>enor face of the manus, inside the top of the 2nd
 metacarpal ; the distal carpal of the 3rd ray is also small as compared
with the large crescentic 2nd distal nucleus. It is thrown on to the
ulnar or outer side of the manus, by the overgrowth of the middle
rod and its carpal. The curve of the digits at their end is now, not
inwards, or to the radial side, but outwards; and the two developed
distal segments form now the core of two claws, that of the <U+FB01>rst, or
pollex, being of considerable length.
    Thus, by the end of the 10th day, the reptilian type of fore-foot
has been attained, and the amphibian type lost; whilst the limb as a
whole is now a fore-leg no longer, but a wing, thoroughly specialised
by evolutional transformation.
    The fore-limb has not simply become modi<U+FB01>ed into a wing by the
shortening of the pollex and 3rd ray, the enlargement of the 2nd,
and the abortion of the 41th and 5th of a fore-paw, like that of the
lizard; but we have now the historical representatives of three more
rays which have cropped up since the end of the 8th day.
    I have repeatedly noticed that aborted parts, like overshadowed
plants, are late to appear, and soon wither, or are arrested in their
growth.     This is the case here, for the new rays are late, small, and
scarcely functional in the fullest development. They are not lost,
however, but, like certain larval structures to be found in the skulls
of the highest types of birds, they are built up into the <U+FB01>nished wing,
although they form an unimportant part of it as far as function goes.
    The <U+FB01>rst of these additional rays is the “pre-pollex;” this is a
lunate tract of <U+FB01>bro-cartilage attached to the inner face of the lst
metacarpal. The other two are composed of true hyaline cartilage,
and appear, one on the ulnar side of the 2nd, and the other on the
ulnar side of the 3rd developed metacarpal.
   I  have described them as intercalary metacarpals, for they seem to
be the starved twins of the 2nd and 3rd large rays : each distal carpal,
very probably, in the archaic forms carried two rays. Thus there is
supposed, for such a fore-limb, a digit inside the pollex of the modern
bird, and then two pairs of rays, of which only the inner in each case
has been retained.
    The paddle of Ichthyosaurus shows this kind of primitive cheiroptery
gium, admirably.
   Thus we can account for seven carpals and six digits in the wing of
the modern bird; in the legs the specialisation is not so intense, but
is very great; the study of the embryonic stages shows in it many
parts that the adult bird gives no signs of whatever.
   Instead of there being even two tarsals, free and functional, there is

58                     On the Morphology      of Birds.              [J an. 27,
                                                       “ sesamoid,” and has
only one, and that has merely the function of a
been mistaken continually for a bone of that sort; that nucleus answers
to our na'viculare, morphologically termed the “ centrale."
   Notwithstanding the extreme diversity in the habits of existing
birds, and the great difference seen in their shank bone, this part is
always single, although composed of three metatarsals.          As in reptiles,
the joint at this part is not between the astragalus and tibia, as in
mammals, but through the tarsal series; no sign of this structure is
seen in the adult bird.     That which appears to be the condyloid end
of the tibia is a row of tarsal bones, the tibiale, <U+FB01>bulare, and inter
medium; these have long been known as separate bones in young
birds, but their distinctness in the early embryo as cartilaginous
nuclei has only lately been made out.
   I have been able, however, to demonstrate this repeatedly in different
kinds of birds. The centrale also, although seen in the embryo as
one of the tarsal series, was not properly identi<U+FB01>ed; it is a constant
element, but becomes degraded.
    The distal series of tarsals exists as a single tract of cartilage, and
then as a single plate of bone.      But it is related to three metatarsals,
and the middle or thick part is the <U+FB01>rst to chondrify in the embryo,
and to ossify in the chicken or young bird; there are here three
connate nuclei, with very slight signs of distinctness.            The whole
                                                “ cuneiform
mass answers to our middle and external                        bones,” and to
                         “ 0s
the inner half of the         magnum.”      Thus <U+FB01>ve tarsals can be always
made out clearly,    and  two  more   accounted  for.
    The 1st metatarsal, which has been known, for some time, through
 the valuable researches of Morse, to have occasionally a proximal as
 well as a distal rudiment, has, I <U+FB01>nd, always a proximal rudiment as
 well.                           .
    Then, as Dr. G. Baur and Miss A. Johnson have shown, there is a
 5th metatarsal; it is a small pisiform cartilage, which soon coalesces
 with the 4th, and with the great distal tarsal.           I  can only <U+FB01>nd a
 “pre-hallux” by     turning   to  Teratology,  and   this is  not the lawful
 method.
    There may, however, be some “reversion” or “ atavism” in the
 polydactyle foot of the Dorking fowl, which has a well developed
 “             ”
                  and a double “hallux;” the twin digits of that part
    pre-hallux
  have a very ichthyosaurian appearance.

66                  Lieut.-General     Strachey.        On the
    The results obtained by the two methods of calculation will there
fore have no sensible di<U+FB01>erence of accuracy, and as the method now
proposed is believed to be both simpler and less liable to arithmetical
error it may without objection be preferred.              The preliminary com
putations on both systems, consisting of combinations of the observed
quantities by addition and subtraction, are identical up to a certain
point, but the formuhe (2) involve more frequent use of tables, and
greater chance of error in algebraical signs, in the <U+FB01>nal operations.
It may be added that much additional labour is often needlessly
created by employing the hourly di<U+FB01>erences from the mean value,
instead of the hourly values themselves, which are obviously su<U+FB01>icient
for the computation of the coe<U+FB02>icients.
    The probable errors of the values of the coef<U+FB01>cients obtained from
the equations (1), will be sensibly larger than those above stated, and
on the same assumptions will be as follows :—
                      For PI  and  q1=§/(ZS)     . e  =  '577e,

    The probable error of a pair of observations being rather less than
 fths of that of a single observation, the greatest possible error of the
 coel<U+FB01>cients thus found will only be about T‘Uths of the probable error
 of one of the original observations, and when great precision is not
 aimed at the results thus obtained may suf<U+FB01>ce, and will not be found
 to di<U+FB01>er materially from those got by the more tedious methods of
 calculation.

    The foregoing discussion assumes that the series of quantities dealt
 with is truly recurrent, that is to say, that the 25th observation will
 be exactly coincident with the. 1st, or a0 = a24.            In fact this will rarely
 be the case, and it becomes necessary to ascertain what effect any
 non-periodic change, or want of coincidence between the beginning
 and end of the series will have on- the values of the several p q
 coe<U+FB02>icients.
    In the absence of any knowledge of the law which determines such
 a. non-periodic     change, it may be assumed to be uniform for the
 period over which the observations extend.                  Further it will be con
 venient to refer the change to the middle of the period, or to the mean
 value of the series with reference to which the periodic variations are
 being considered, so that the non-periodic deviations will be equal
 and a<U+FB01>ected by opposite signs, at equal intervals on either side of the
 middle of the period.
    Hence assuming that 2c is the whole non-periodic change with its
 proper sign, so that a0+2c = a“, the correction of any observation
 a, in order to eliminate the non-periodic change which a<U+FB01>ects it, will

another, be continuous if there were no non-periodic disturbance. IF
they are not thus continuous half the distance between them measured
on the ordinate of 0 hours will be the quantity 0.

trouble.      Assuming   that   the  third  differences of the quantities (a)

    The computation of the harmonic components of a yearly series of
365 daily values, orof 73 <U+FB01>ve-day mean values, such as are now usually
calculated for the principal meteorological elements,               would be
extremely laborious if conducted in the usual manner, and it is there
fore desirable to contrive some approximate method which shall not
involve excessive arithmetical operations.            For meteorological pur
poses the following mode of procedure will, it is believed, supply what
is needed, and it may possibly be employed conveniently in other
cases.
    When the number of the terms of a series is exactly divisible by
 2, 4, 6, and 8, it will be readily seen that the new method of computa
tion proposed in the case of a daily series of 24 hourly terms, will be
 applicable in its general form; all that is necessary by way of modi
<U+FB01>cation being the introduction of suitable changes in the combination
of the terms, and the adoption of other multipliers in place of those
 given in the equations
    The series of <U+FB01>ve-day means for a year consists of 73 terms, and
 the above-mentioned condition is therefore not directly complied with
by it.    It   may, however,,_be    easily transformed by interpolation   into

 a series of 72 terms, which       will comply with the conditions, in the
 following   manner    :—
     If the original series of the 73 <U+FB01>ve~day means he represented by
 the numbers (0), (1), (2), (3), &c., . . . . (72), it will be apparent
 that the <U+FB01>rst term (0) corresponds with neon of the 3rd day of the
year, the subsequent terms following each other at <U+FB01>ve-day intervals.
 The new interpolated series of 72 terms should begin at 0 hours of
the 1st day of the year, and will be designated          by the numbers 0, l,
2, 3, &c., . . . . 71.    Then if T(, and '1‘_l represent, respectively, the
mean for 24 hours of the <U+FB01>rst day of the year under computation,
and the last day of the preceding year, the interpolated series
will be—

   The reciprocals of the numerical coef<U+FB01>cients of the several 17’s and

represented by the right-hand portions of those equations, which will
be obtained by suitable combinations of the <U+FB01>ve-day means.                                The
multipliers are—

   A table calculated to give multiples of the quantity '02183 will
evidently suffice for the other coef<U+FB01>cients, with the small corrections
shown above.
    To provide for cases (which are likely to be frequent) in which
the series of terms is not truly recurrent, corrections similar to those
required for the 24-term series must be applied. As before, repre
 senting by T0 and T_1 respectively the mean values for the <U+FB01>rst day
 of the period under computation, and the last day of the preceding
 year, and by to and L, respectively the mean values for the <U+FB01>rst day
 of the following year and the last day of the year under computation;
 the quantity that must be added to the <U+FB01>rst term of the series of
 72 terms, corresponding to the initial midnight of the year, to make
 it equal to the <U+FB01>rst term of the next yearly series, will be 20 =
 *(to-l-Ll) —§(T0+ T_1), and it will be found that the corrections for
 the several 1; q coef<U+FB01>cients will be as follows :—
 Forpl ....icXm='0290,                     For g,              31§0Xm                 ='684c,

                For    170,  or the mean of the whole series,         . . . . = 7‘70.
     A similar method of computation might                      be adopted in the case of

             Computation   of certain Harmonic   Components.           73
a yearly period of 365 days, which could be transformed by interpola
tion into a series of 360 days, each term of which would correspond
01% days = 1 +717 days. But the irregularities of a series of daily
quantities, in meteorological discussions, would be so great, even when
dealing with the mean of many years, that. no practical advantage
would be obtained by employing such a series; the computations
would be more troublesome, and the <U+FB01>ve-day means will be pre
ferable.
                                    10.
   The annexed Forms are proposed as supplying methods of computa
tion from the formulas contained in the foregoing discussion, which
shall involve the least practicable quantity of arithmetical operations.
   Form 1 differs little from what is believed to be the ordinary
method at present. It requires tables of multiples of the sines of
15°, 45°, 60° and 75°.
   Form 2 is for the proposed new method of computation. It
requires tables of multiples of the special multipliers applicable to the
several orders of harmonic coef<U+FB01>cients.
   Form 3 requires no comment except to mention that the value of
the angles which correspond to the hours of maximum ,4 will facilitate
the graphic representation of the several components, and appear to
characterise them better than the angles T.
   Forms 4 and 5 call for no special remark.      But they indicate the
degree   of divergence that exists between the approximate values of
coef<U+FB01>cients obtained from them, and those got by the more exact
methods.     The <U+FB01>gures employed are the mean hourly temperatures
for one year for the month of June, at Greenwich. If the mean
values for a series of years had been dealt with, the results would not
have dilfered one with another by so much as one-tenth of a degree
Fahrenheit.
   Form 6 shows the method of computation from 73 <U+FB01>ve-day mean
values. The <U+FB01>gures employed are mean temperatures at Konigsberg
for 24 years (taken from Bessel’s paper, the translation of which is
given in the Quarterly Weather Report of the Meteorological O<U+FB01>ice,
               ‘                            ’
Part IV, 1870, page [29]), which were selected in order to test the
agreement of the results with those given by Bessel, calculated by
the method of least squares.     The values of the coef<U+FB01>cients by the
two methods are virtually identical with the exception of ps, in which
I feel satis<U+FB01>ed that some error has been committed in Bessel’s calcu
lation; to verify this, however, would involve a very tedious com
                  I
putation which have not thought it worth while to undertake. It
should be observed that Bessel’s coe<U+FB02>icients, being calculated with
reference to a period commencing with the <U+FB01>rst of the <U+FB01>ve-day means,
that is noon on the 3rd day of the year, have to be modi<U+FB01>ed to adjust

74               Lieut.-General   Strachey.     0n the
them to a period commencing with the initial midnight of the year.
In order to render the form complete, as a type of the proposed
system of computation, values for the <U+FB01>rst and last days of the year
have been interpolated, and a small non-periodical correction has been
assumed to be required; but these have no practical effect on the
numerical results.
   For this computation a table of multiples of the multiplier (m) is
required, and to save trouble a table of multiples of 7‘; has also been
drawn out.

  For brevity and simplicity consider only                 the case of two-dimensional
motion.
  All that       it-   is   necessary  of the medium
                                         to know            the relation      is
between the wave-velocity and the wave-length of an endless proces
sion of periodic waves.  The result of our work will show us that the
velocity of progress of a zero, or maximum, or minimum, in any
part of a varying group of waves,     equal to the velocity of progress
                                                is
of periodic waves of wave-length equal to a certain length, which may

     Take the simplest case: let the moving solid be a globe, and let
the <U+FB02>uid be of in<U+FB01>nite extent in all directions.          Let its pressure be of
any given value, P, at in<U+FB01>nite distances from the globe, and let the
globe be kept moving with a given constant velocity, V.
    If the <U+FB02>uid keeps everywhere in contact with the globe, its velocity
relatively to the globe at the equator (which is the place of greatest
relative velocity) is gV. Hence, unless P>§V2,* the <U+FB02>uid will not
remain in contact with the globe.
    Suppose, in the <U+FB01>rst place, P to have been >%V2, and to be
suddenly reduced to some constant value <-§—V2. The <U+FB02>uid will be
thrown o<U+FB02>' the globe at a belt of a certain breadth, and a violently
disturbed motion will ensue.       To describe it, it will be convenient to
speak of velocities and motions relative to the globe. The <U+FB02>uid must,
as indicated by the arrow-heads in <U+FB01>g. 1, <U+FB02>ow partly backwards and
partly forwards, at the place, I, where it impinges on the globe,
after having shot off at a tangent at A. The back-<U+FB02>ow along the
belt that had been bared must bring to E some <U+FB02>uid; and the free
surface of this <U+FB02>uid must collide with the surface of the <U+FB02>uid leaving
the globe at A. It might be supposed that the result of this collision
would be a “ vortex sheet,” which in virtue of its instability, would
get drawn out and mixed up inde<U+FB01>nitely, and be carried away by the
<U+FB02>uid farther and farther from the globe. A de<U+FB01>nite amount of
kinetic energy would be practically anmulled in a manner which                 I
hope to explain in an early communication to the Royal Society of
Edinburgh.

fluid,  or in a real <U+FB02>uid such as water or air, to form a vortex
sheet, that is to say an interface of <U+FB01>nite slip by any natural
action. What happens in the case at present under consideration,
and in every real and imaginable case of two portions of liquid
meeting one another, as for instance a drop of rain falling
directly or obliquely on a horizontal surface of still water, is
 that continuity and the law of continuous <U+FB02>uid motion become
established at the instant of <U+FB01>rst contact between two points, or
 between two lines in a class of cases of ideal symmetry to which our
present subject belongs.
    An inevitable result of the separation of the liquid from the solid,
 whether our supposed globe or any other <U+FB01>gure perfectly symmetrical
 round an axis and moving exactly in the line of the axis, is that two
circles of the freed liquid surface come into contact and initiate in an
 instant the enclosure of two rings of vacuum (G and H in <U+FB01>g. 2,

    The “circulation " (line-integral of tangential component velocity
 round any endless curve encircling the ring, as a ring on a ring, or
 one of two rings linked    together) is determinate for each of these
 vacuum-rings, and remains constant for ever after: unless it divides

 which accidents there is no security.
    It is conceivably possible" that a coreless ring vortex, with irrota
 tional circulation round its hollow, shall be left oscillating in the
neighbourhood of the equator of the globe; provided (%V2—P)/P be
not too great.     If the material of the globe be viscously elastic, the
vortex settles to a steady position round the equator, in a shape
perfectly symmetrical on the two sides of the equatoreal plane ; and
the whole motion goes on steadily henceforth for ever.
    If (>gV2-P)/P exceed a certain limit,             I  suppose coreless vortices
will be successively formed and shed off behind the globe in its
motion through the <U+FB02>uid, incessantly.

HI.       “ on Proterosaurua Speneri (von Meyer)."      By H. G.
          SEELEY, F.R.S., Professor of Geography in King’s College,
          London.  Received February 3, 1887.
                                     (Abstract)
   The author gives an account of the scienti<U+FB01>c history of Protero
saurns, and states the interpretations of its structure given by Cuvier,
von Meyer, Sir R. Owen, and Professor Huxley.
   In Part     II
               he describes the type specimen in the Museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons. In the skull characters are given of the
cerebral cavity, the supra-occipital, parietal, frontal, pre-frontal,
nasal, and premaxillary bones.    A restoration is made of the skull and
the teeth are shown to be anchylosed to the jaw.       On the palate the
vomer, palatine, and pterygoid bones are described and shown to have
all   been armed      with minute   teeth.    The pterygoid bone was strongly
united to the quadrate bone.               The lower jaw and hyoid bones are
also described.
     In                                  is given of the second to the
          the vertebral column a description
seventh cervical vertebrae, of sixteen dorsal vertebrae, two sacral
vertebraa, and twenty-three caudal vertebrae.
   The femur, tibia and <U+FB01>bula and foot are also described. The skin
is found to have been defended with a bony armour.
   In Part      III
                  comparison is made between the type and other
specimens which have been referred to        with the result that some
                                                  it,
are regarded as indicating different species while others indicate
different genera.
    In Part IV a comparison        made to show the resemblances of
                                      is
 Proterosaurus with other reptiles, in the several regions of the
 skeleton; with the result that the Proterosauria        regarded as a
                                                             is
 distinct division of the Reptilia, showing resemblances to many of
the highly specialised orders and to some low types.

       nicated by JOHN PERCY, M.D., F.R.S., Pres. Iron and Steel
       Inst. Received August 18, 1886.
   § 1. Bismuth: its Separation from Gold, and its Re<U+FB01>ning Action
upon same during the Process of Separation—In bringing the above
subject under notice, it is necessary to allude to some of the facts dis
tinguishing this very interesting metal.
   Bismuth, in some of its important characteristics and reactions,
resembles lead.     And one of the chief points of resemblance between
these metals is their ready oxidation, and their absorption by bone
ashes or wood-ashes whilst so oxydised.         I refer of course, to the
process   of cupellation.
   This ancient and serviceable process, still employed universally
for the separation of gold and silver from lead, is equally applicable
to bismuth, if associated with these precious metals; and, like lead,
bismuth may be readily employed as a vehicle or means of collecting
gold and silver from their ores in reduction processes; but its com
parative cost accounts for its non-employment in this respect.
   Commercially speaking, bismuth differs from lead in its greater
value, lead being worth at present £13 to £141 per ton,‘* whilst bismuth
realises between £700 and £800 per ton ; this high value being due to
its greater rarity and to its limited and special uses.
   As is well known, bismuth ores are frequently auriferous; and
one of the points which it is my desire to bring under notice is the
e<U+FB02>'ectual separation of the gold from bismuth by a rapid and ef<U+FB01>ca
cious process.
   Of course, nothing could be easier than to separate these two
metals by the ordinary process of cupellation.        The gold, by these
                                * June, 1886.

90                           Mr. E. Matthey.                   [Feb. 10,
means, is at once rendered available, but   with the drawback that not
only is there a very considerable loss      of bismuth by volatilisation
during the cupellation, but the subsequent recovery of the metal,
which in the state of oxide has been absorbed by the cupel, is
rendered necessary, involving a tedious and troublesome smelting
operation, the employment of expensive <U+FB02>uxes, and a further con
siderable loss of metal.
   Bearing in mind the close resemblance of bismuth to lead in its
behaviour in the cupellation process, I directed my attention to its
separation from gold by means of the addition of a small proportion
of zinc—a method known as the Parkes process, as employed for the
separation    of silver from lead.    And this I found successful, the
natural separation of these two metals during the process of cooling
proving to be similar in both cases.
   The operation as carried out by me is as follows :—
   The Bismuth holding the gold is melted at the ordinary tempera
ture, about two per cent. of melted zinc is then added, and the
whole brought to a dull red heat.        The alloy is then well stirred,
and   the  temperature gradually lowered. When at a black heat the
slight crust formed on the surface is skimmed o<U+FB01> and the metal
again treated with a further quantity of zinc at the higher tempera
ture. The whole of the gold will be found in these skimmings, and
the bismuth will be thus freed from it.
   The skimmings, consisting of bismuth, gold and zinc, and zinc
oxide,   I now treat by a process which quickly renders the gold avail
able, and at the same time has the e<U+FB01>ect of re<U+FB01>ning the gold from all
impurities excepting silver during the actual process of extraction.
   This small proportion of bismuth litharge and its charge of gold
is fused in a clay crucible with a little borax, and allowed to cool
down in the crucible, or it is poured into a mould with the bismuth
litharge, which being perfectly liquid, allows the metallic gold to
separate by its own gravity, and during its fusion absorbs any base
metals associated with it as oxides.      The bismuth litharge, in fact,
acts as a re<U+FB01>ning agent to the gold, which, when cold, is,detached from
it. This bismuth slag is broken up, re-fused with a little metallic
bismuth, and is so freed from the last trace of gold which is collected
by the bismuth, and subsequently extracted. The bismuth litharge
so freed from gold is then reduced by fusion with carbon to its
metallic state.
    The quantity of bismuth litharge holding the gold is exceedingly
small in proportion to the bulk of metal originally treated, as the
<U+FB01>gures hereinafter given will show ; but, by this process the bismuth
is at once freed from its gold contents with little time, labour, or
              ‘
expense.
    I  have  continuously carried out this method of treatment with the

 1887           Contributiom    to the Metallurgy of Bismuth.                91
most satisfactory results. It will only be necessary to take the <U+FB01>gures
of one operation as an illustration.
   A quantity of 9483 lbs. of bismuth, holding about one per cent. of
impurity, and 12'5 ounces of gold per ton (equal to 535 ounces in
the bulk), was so treated, and of this nearly 9000 lbs. was imme
diately rendered available for commercial use, the skimmings, which
amounted to 658 lbs. (7'30 per cent. of the bulk), containing the whole
of  the gold.
   These skimmings      I   oxidised by means of nitric acid, thus obtain
ing  the  greater proportion of the bismuth and what little copper there
was in solution, from which the bismuth was precipitated by the
ordinary method, care being taken to saturate the nitric acid by ex
tracting the greater portion of the bismuth as nitrate, so as to leave
a. portion of the bismuth as oxide with the gold in order to re<U+FB01>ne
it from the impurities existing as oxides when fused with it. This
residue, collected and dried, was, when dried, fused in clay crucibles,
with a small quantity of borax, yielding the full amount of gold shown
by assay.
   As before stated, in these fusions the metallic gold separates from
the bismuth litharges, and descends to the bottom of the crucible by
its own gravity. The liquid and supernatant bismuth litharge <U+FB02>oats
upon it and breaks away readin when cold, the gold so obtained being
associated only with silver, both metals being in fact re<U+FB01>ned by the
action of the bismuth litharge.
   § 2. Separation of Bismuth from Lead.—- The dif<U+FB01>culty surrounding
the treatment of bismuth associated with other metals by any rapid
or comprehensive process is well known to the metallurgical chemist.
I  believe    I am correct in stating that hitherto the only process
employed for the re<U+FB01>ning of bismuth on the Continent—notably in
 Saxony, the chief continental source of this metal—has been that of
chlorination and subsequent precipitation, a process tedious in itself
and involving much plant and labour in comparison with the quanti
ties of metal operated upon.
   Rapidity of production with a minimum margin of loss, in order
to free the metal from its impurities and render it marketable as
quickly as possible, being a great desideratum, induced me to turn
my attention to its re<U+FB01>ning by dry processes.            In carrying this out  I
have found present most of the metals which are easily seized by and
become associated with the bismuth itself during the process of reduc
tion from its ores,"‘= such as antimony, arsenic, tellurium, lead, copper,
&c., &c., all of which   I  have successively and successfully dealt with.
   It is not my intention in this paper to describe the processes
adopted for the elimination of these several metals, but to con<U+FB01>ne
                        *  See Table of Analyses herewith.

92                              Mr. E. Matthey.                           [Feb. 10,
myself to the separation of lead, the presence of which especially
presented at <U+FB01>rst great di<U+FB01>iculties.
   As stated above,      I have found that      I   can separate one by one the
metals   mentioned     above, all  of which have been associated with crude
bismuth which has come under my notice. In this, success though
gradual, has been complete: but            I  was still confronted by the fact
that the lead alloy was retained by the bismuth with a most charac
teristic persistency which seemed to defy all e<U+FB01>orts of separation
excepting by tedious wet or acid processes.
   The amount of lead existing in the bismuth               I  operated upon, after
freeing  it by dry processes     from   its  other   impurities, varied from 2 to
10 per cent.
   Bearing in mind the respective fusing points of lead and bismuth,
it occurred    to me that, as alloys of bismuth and lead fuse at a
temperature considerably lower than that of bismuth itself, separation
would possibly take place betwee'n the two metals at a certain point
of cooling;   I therefore made the following experiment :—
   Taking a quantity of bismuth (about 10 cwt.), holding 11‘5 per
cent. of lead, and fusing same,       I  allowed the metal to cool until the
major part of it had crystallised, then removing the <U+FB02>uid portion.
   The residue showed by assay only 6'35 per cent. of lead, pointing
at once to the partial separation I had hoped for.
   These crystals again similarly treated showed only 3'75 per cent.
of lead.
   The operation repeated gave crystals with only 2 per cent. of lead,
and a fourth crystallisation brought this down to below 0'5 per cent.
   As a matter of possible interest,        I  subjoin the progressive results
during the crystallising operations of several lots up to the point of
bulking, and of <U+FB01>nally separating every trace of lead :—
                     Bismuth holding 14'6 per         cent.  Lead.
      1st crystallisation   gave crystals     holding     9'8 per cent. of lead.

   Having attained this point,          I worked    upon several large quantities
of metal—with practically the             same results—<U+FB01>nally        succeeding by a
continuation of the process in eliminating every trace of lead.
   By the above it will be seen that the process becomes an ex

involving little or no loss, and occupying hours, instead of possibly
weeks.

alloys,    I give the following <U+FB01>gures from metal holding originally <U+FB01>ve

   10,675    lbs.  produced, in the course of six to seven crystallisations,
9306 lbs. of available bismuth, the residue 1188 lbs. holding 40 per
cent. of lead, so that from a quantity of nearly 5 tons of bismuth and
lead alloy only about half a ton remained, holding practically the
whole of the lead; the bulk of the bismuth separated by simple crys
tallisation holding traces only of lead, which, if necessary, could be
readily eliminated by further crystallisation.               From these facts it is
apparent that the separation of these two metals can be e<U+FB01>ected by
turning to account their relative fusing points.

II. “ An Inquiry into     the Cause and Extent of a. special Colour
      Relation between certain exposed Lepidopterous Pupae
      and the Surfaces which immediately surround them.” By
      EDWARD B. POULTON, M.A., of Jesus and Keble Colleges,
      Oxford, Lecturer in Zoology and Comparative Anatomy
      at St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington.             Communicated by
      Professor E. RAY LANKESTER, F.R.S.                 Received Feb
      ruary 10, 1887.
                                (Abstract)
   Historical.—Mr. T. W. Wood <U+FB01>rst called attention to the colour
relation   in pupae (‘Entom Soc. Proc.,’ 1867, p. xcix), adducing

 1887.]        between certain Papa; and their Surroundings.             95
instances of      Pieris brassicoe, P. rapw, Vanessa polychloros, and
 (erroneously) Papilio machaon.         He even suggested that gilded
surfaces might probably be found to produce gilded pupae, but the
experiment has never been made until the present investigation.        His
observations were disputed by many entomologists, but were con<U+FB01>rmed
by Mr. A. G. Butler and Professor Meldola (‘ Z001. Soc. Proc.,’
1873).     Finally, Mrs. Barber (‘Entom. Soc. Trans.,’ 1874, p. 519)
obtained striking results with the pupae of Papilio nireus (South Africa)
which were con<U+FB01>rmed by Mr. Roland Trimen, who experimented upon
Papilio demoleus. Still later Fritz Miiller (‘ Kosmos,’ vol. 12, p. 448)
argues that the dimorphic pupw 0f Papiliopolydamus do not possess the
colour-relation.     It was generally assumed that all the above instances
of the colour-relation were to be explained by supposing the skin of
the freshly formed pupa to be “photographically sensitive,” but the
explanation was never tested by any system of transference to other
colours, and Professor Meldola pointed out in 18741 that there was no
real analogy with photography.        Furthermore, the explanation failed
to account for the colour of pupae which threw off the larval skin on
a dark night.      I therefore thought that the problem would probably
prove to be essentially physiological, and that the re<U+FB02>ected light
would be found to act on the larva at some time before pupation
and not upon the pupa itself, and it seemed probable that the
sensitive area might be de<U+FB01>ned by experiment.            The investigation
was conducted in the summer and autumn of 1886.
    I. Experiments upon Vanessa Io.—Material was kindly supplied
by Mr. E. D. Y. Pode, of Slade, Ivybridge.        Six mature larvaa were
placed in a glass cylinder surrounded by yellowish-green tissue-paper,
and all suspended themselves from the paper roof.       Five changed into
the rarer yellowish-green form of pupa, and the sixth immediately
after the skin had been thrown o<U+FB02>‘ and while still moist and with the
shape unformed, was transferred to a black surface in darkness, but
the pupal colours deepened into a yellowish-green tint exactly like
that of the other <U+FB01>ve pupae.
   This experiment, so far as it went, con<U+FB01>rmed my anticipation of
larval as opposed to pupal susceptibility, and added another striking
instance of pupal colour-relation.     Mr. W. H. Harwood, of Colchester,
also informed me that he had found the same variety of this species
on the under side of nettle leaves, but not the dark form which
occurs commonly on walls, stones, &c. Hence the protective value of
the colour-relation is well seen; the species having varieties suitable
for vegetal and mineral surroundings, and adjustable by the stimulus
supplied by the colours of the environment.
   II.  Experiments upon Vanessa urticce.—- This species was investigated
in great detail, over    700 individuals being employed in the experi
ments. Material was in part supplied by Mr. Pode, but chie<U+FB02>y

   96      Mr. E. B. Poulton.     On a special Colour-Relation     [Felm 10,
   found near Oxford.      The <U+FB01>rst necessity was the construction of a
   standard list of colours with which to compare the pupae which had
   been the subjects of experiment.     The pupae are very variable, and in
   many of the experiments the colour in<U+FB02>uence was only allowed to act
   during a small part of the time during which the larva are sensitive.
   Hence the careful record of minute differences was absolutely
   necessary, and the standard list was made as detailed as possible.
   The list was as follows :—
      The-degree of colour represented by—
       (1.) Very dark, from the large amount of cuticular pigment; no
   gilding or the merest trace.
      (2.) Dark normal form, but not so black as (1) and sometimes more
  gilding but very little.
      (3.) Light normal form, sometimes with a fair amount of gilding,
  often with a predominant pinkish tint. This degree was afterwards
  subdivided into dark           (3), and light (3), and even further in
  certain experiments.
      (4.) Very light variety, often extremely golden; sometimes light
  pink.
     (5.) The lightest variety  ; often completely covered with the gilded
  appearance.
     In the experiments summarised below, the individuals      belonging to
  di<U+FB01>erent    companies   were  always   separated, except   in  the larvae
 subjected to green surroundings, so that the errors from varying
 hereditary tendencies were reduced to a minimum, for the larvae of
 each company are hatched from the eggs laid by a single butter<U+FB02>y.
     1. The Results of szerent Colours—Orange surroundings produced
 no effect, as far as the experiment went, for the few pupae were all (
 and therefore showed no relation to the colour of the environment.
 After the experiment upon the allied V. Io I tried the effects of green
 upon a large number of individuals, but the resulting pupae were on
 the whole rather darker than usual, probably because of the amount of
shade produced by the tissue-paper.         This conclusion suggested the
use of black surroundings, and at once an immense effect was witnessed.
 These effects in turn suggested the use of white surroundings (white
paper and white opal glass) and here also a powerful in<U+FB02>uence was
exerted, the pupae being often brilliantly golden in appearance.        But
it was clear that the very dark varieties were much better protected
against the black surfaces than the lustrous golden pupm against the
white surfaces, and this consideration suggested the use of a material
with which the golden appearance harmonised most perfectly, i.e.,
metallic gold. Boxes and cylinders lined with gilt paper and turned
towards a strong light produced the most extremely gilded varieties in
a large proportion of the pupae, and the metallic appearance            was
yellower and more truly golden than in the more silvery forms

  the use   of these different surroundings were          as follows (omitting the:

    2. The Colours of Wild Pupw.—It is impossible to realise the
 extremely remarkable results of the gilt and white surroundings
 without taking into account the fact that a (4) or a (5) is very rarely
 seen in the <U+FB01>eld, except when the pupa is diseased.                  Out of <U+FB01>fteen
 wild pupa; found August 31 on a grey stone wall, the lightest pupae
 were (3), while there were four of the degree represented by (1), and
 there was only the minutest spot of gold to be seen after careful exami
 nation on two of the pupae, and none on any of the others.
     3. The Efeots        of .Mutual Proximity—Inasmuch as the above
 <U+FB01>gures show that the larva are sensitive to dark surfaces and the
 larvae themselves       are almost black, it appeared probable that they
 would be mutually in<U+FB02>uenced when a large number pupated in close
 proximity.      This was incidentally shown to be the casein several of
 the experiments, of which the most striking was as follows.                      Four
larvse were placed each in a separate cylinder while twelve were placed
together in another similar cylinder, all having the same conditions of
light and each cylinder lined and roofed with an equal amount of
white paper and each standing upon an opal glass <U+FB02>oor.                 Of the twelve
 larvae ten pupated in close proximity upon the roof and sides, and were
all light (3), while the remaining two pupated on the <U+FB02>oor and were
both (4). Of the four pupae in separate cylinders two were (4) and
two were (5). In consequence of these and other equally convincing
results the exact position of the pupae has to be taken into account in
estimating the in<U+FB02>uences which have been at work, and in all the most
careful experiments only one or two larvae were placed in each coloured
case.
    4. The E<U+FB01>ects of Illumination.-—Oue              experiment was directed
towards the comparison of the in<U+FB02>uence of a black surface in strong
light and the same surface in darkness, and the results show clearly
                                                                            H 2

98     Mr. E. B. Poulton.       On a special Colour-Relation     [Feb. 10,
that the pups: are on the whole darker in the latter circumstances,
although dark under both conditions.
    In another experiment some larvae were suspended in a strong direct
light without any coloured background suf<U+FB01>ciently near to affect them,
and as far as the experiment went it indicated that there was an
in<U+FB02>uence in the direction of the lighter varieties, but in this case the
numbers employed were too small to be convincing.
   5. The Time during which the Larvw are Sensitive—The              whole
period preparatory to pupation, intervening between the cessation of
feeding and pupation itself, may be divided into three stages: (i) in
which the larva descends from the food-plant and wanders about in
search of some (generally mineral) surface upon which to pupate;
(ii) in which it rests motionless, usually in a curved position, upon
the surface selected; (iii) in which it hangs head downwards sus
pended by its posterior claspers from a boss of silk spun at the close
of the last stage.      The duration of Stage          depends upon the
varying proximity      of  suitable surfaces, and  it was always greatly
curtailed in con<U+FB01>nement, because such surfaces were close at hand.
If the larva is sensitive during this stage, the in<U+FB02>uences cannot
generally contribute towards the result, because the larva. is wandering
over surfaces of various colours. It is also very improbable that the
larva can be sensitive after the <U+FB01>rst few hours, or at any rate the <U+FB01>rst
half of Stage (iii), because rapid changes are taking place under the
larval skin, and it is even likely that processes are already on their
way towards completion which will result in the formation of pig
ment or other substances, which will many hours later deepen into
the effective causes of pupal colour.     The length of Stage (iii) did not
very very much in different larvae, and in the shortest case observed
the length was about 14 hours, while ‘20 hours was an unusually long
period, but the majority of larvae passed about 17 or 18 hours in this
stage.    Stage (ii) was more variable, but about 15 hours was a common
length, while 36 hours is a fair estimate of the length of the whole
preparatory period.       In the majority of cases a larva is probably
sensitive   to the  colour  of surrounding surfaces for about 20 hours
preceding the last 12 hours of the Whole preparatory period.          Thus
the length is amply sn<U+FB02>icient to include many hours of daylight during
which the surrounding surfaces are illuminated.          If a larva be dis
turbed when Stage (ii) is far advanced the whole period begins again,
and all the three stages are again passed through, but they are
 all abbreviated, including Stage (iii), which had not previously com
 menced.     Many experiments indicated that darkness may increase
 the length of the stages; but my observations were not specially
 directed towards the settlement of this question, which only occurred
 to me when the notes were tabulated.             Therefore  I  propose to
specially investigate this point in the next season. Such prolongation,

1887.]         between certain    Pupw and their'Surroundlngs.               99
if  corroborated, may be physiologically connected with pigment
formation, or it may merely give the larva an additional opportunity
of being acted on by light, if for any cause the illumination of the
surrounding surface is delayed, or if the most sensitive part of the
whole period corresponds to the ordinary darkness of night.
   6. Experiments which show the Sensitive Condition during Stages (ii)
and (iii).——1t was very important to obtain beyond any doubt the
demonstration that the larvae are sensitive during Stage (ii), and also
to decide conclusively whether any susceptibility was continued into
Stage (iii), and if so to compare the relative susceptibilities of the two
stages.     Such experiments, if successful, would at once dispose of the
older theory of pupal sensitiveness, and would be most important in
making pessible other methods of investigation which, applied to
Stage (iii) alone, might successfully terminate the long and dif<U+FB01>cult
search for the larval sensory surface which is affected by surrounding
colours. A great many experiments were conducted with this object.
The larvae were made to pass Stages            and (ii) exposed to the in<U+FB02>uence
of a powerfully acting colour, and then were transferred for Stage (iii)
to the colour which tended most strongly in the opposite direction.
The largest, most carefully conducted, and most successful experiment
of the kind gave the following results, all the larvae belonging to the
same company        :—
         Degrees of colour.        (1.) (2.)       (3.)        (4.) (5.)

   The analysis speaks for itself. Stages (ii) and (iii) are both sensitive,
but Stage (iii) is much less sensitive than the other. Thus, when the
earlier part of the period was passed in gilt surroundings, the resem
blance between the results and those preduced by gilt surroundings
acting during the whole period was much stronger than the resem
blance between the latter and the results produced when the gilt
acted during Stage (iii) only. It is observable that the larva as a
,whole    evidently tended towards the lighter forms, so that the black

'100     Mr. E. B. Poulton.    On a special Colour-Relation     [F eb. 10,
 did not produce nearly such strong e<U+FB01>ects as the gilt surroundings.
 It is almost unnecessary to point how completely the old theory of
pupal sensitiveness is broken down by the analysis. The experiment
 shows that the more elaborate methods alluded to above could be
 applied to Stage (iii) with at any rate a fair prospect of success.
     7. The Search for the Sensitive Larral Surface.         The Oeelli.—
 The most obvious suggestion pointed towards the larval ocelli (six in
number on each side of the head) as the possible sense-organs which
 were acted on by surrounding colours, and formed the beginning of
 the physiological chain of which the end is seen in the colours of the
 pupa. In many different experiments the larvaa were divided into two
 sets, with precisely similar conditions of surrounding colours and
 illumination, the one set of larvaa being normal while the ocelli of the
 other larvae were carefully covered with an opaque black varnish,
which was renewed more than once if necessary (the larvae being very
 much irritated by the process and <U+FB02>inging their heads about so as to
 remove some of the varnish).        The material made use of was a
 quickly-drying, photographic varnish, rendered opaque by the addition
 of lamp-black.     Experiments of this kind were conducted with green,
 white, and gilt surroundings, but the pupte which were formed from
 the blinded larvae could never be distinguished as a whole from the
 others, having been equally acted upon by surrounding colours.
 Even supposing the conditions of experiment had not been quite
 perfect, so that the ocelli were not wholly eliminated, we should
 expect some differences between the resulting pupae, if these organs
 represent the ef<U+FB01>cient sensory surface.    After repeated experiments
 with negative results, I subjected two sets of larvaa to the in<U+FB02>uence of
 black surroundings in darkness, thinking it possible (but highly
 improbable) that the process of blinding, or the varnish itself, might
 act as a stimulus to the ocelli, and so produce the light-coloured
 pupae.    Again it was possible that the blinding might assist the
  in<U+FB02>uence of black surroundings, although it could not prevent the
 action of bright colours. Of the resulting pupae, the set produced
 from the blinded larvae were rather lighter than the others, but there
 was little difference, and hence both suggestions were negatived, for
 the process obviously did not assist the in<U+FB02>uence of the surroundings,
 and the di<U+FB01>erence between the two sets was so slight as to o<U+FB01>er no
explanation of the brilliant pupae produced from blinded larva; by gilt
 or white surroundings, on the hypothesis that the process of blinding
 itself supplies a stimulus.
     (fl) The Complex Branching Spines.—It seemed possible that these
 spines, of which there are seven on most of the segments, might
 contain some terminal organ which receives impression from coloured
 surfaces.   When the spines are snipped o<U+FB01> the bases bleed a little, so
it is clear that a subcuticular core is contained within them. The

   1887.]      between certain Papoe and their Surroundings.             101
  bristles were shorn from several mature larvae, and they were placed
  under exactly the same conditions of light and surroundings (white or
  gilt being used in three different experiments) as about an equal
  number of normal larvae, but the pupae of the two sets were almost
  exactly similar.
     (q.) The whole Shin Surface as Tested by Con<U+FB02>icting Colour Experi
  ments—It has been shown in paragraph 6 that the larvae are to
  some extent sensitive during Stage (iii), and   I had long thought that
  this stage in which the larvae are suspended motionless, and cannot
  be greatly affected by disturbance, might be investigated by the appli
  cation of strongly con<U+FB02>icting colours to di<U+FB02>erent parts of the larval
  surface. Black and gilt were obviously shown to be the best colours
  to select for the purpose, and the experiments were conducted in two
 ways. In the <U+FB01>rst the larvae were induced to suspend themselves from
 sheets of clear glass, by placing them in wide shallow glass boxes, so
 that the ascent to the glass roof was easily accomplished. As soon
 as suspension had taken place each of the larvaa was covered with a
 compartmented cardboard tube, of which the septum was perforated
 by a hole just large enough to admit the larval body.        The tube was
 <U+FB01>xed to the glass sheet with glue, and the upper chamber and upper
 surface of the septum were lined with one colour, e.g., gold,
 while the lower chamber and lower surface of the septum were
 lined with the opposite colour, e.g., black, which also covered
the outside of the cylinder, in case the larva should stretch beyond
its lower edge.        The septum was placed at such a height in
the tube that the larval head and rather less than half of the
total skin surface (anterior) were contained in the lower chamber,
while rather more than half of the skin surface (posterior) was con
tained in the upper chamber. It was thought that the upper chamber
would be illuminated too strongly as compared with the lower,
because its opening was directed upwards towards the light descending
from the window, and therefore compensation was provided by <U+FB01>xing
another perforated septum on the upper end of the cylinder, so that
its opening was reduced to the same diameter as the perforation in
the septum between the two chambers. The results show that                 I
overcompensated for the difference in illumination, for     I  did not take
into account the fact that the larva spins its boss on a comparatively
wide layer of silk which it has previously spun over the glass, and
which greatly diminishes the transparency of the latter over an area
at least equal to the diameter of the tube, which is comparatively
thick, and includes the boss itself over the smaller area, corresponding
to the perforation in the disk.   Hence the resulting pupaa were rather
lighter when    the gilt chamber was  below, although the difference was
not great. At the close of the experiment      I altered the conditions of
illumination by removing the upper septum, and then the single pupa

102      Mr. E. B. Poulton.   On a special Colour-Rehtion        [Feb 10,
produced in a tube with the gilt chamber above proved to be the
only (5) obtained in the whole of this set of experiments, in which
83 pupaa had been compared.         Such results show that the sensitive
surface is not represented by a. sense-organ in the head, or with an
anterior portion only, but that the whole skin area possesses suscepti.
bility.
    The second method     of conducting con<U+FB02>icting colour experiments
was superior in the more equal illumination      of the gilt surface when
above    or below.   Flat wooden trays were covered in each case with
black and gilt paper in alternating areas, the two colours meeting
along lines which ran across each tray, and along which shelves were
<U+FB01>xed covered with gilt paper towards the gilt surface, and black paper
towards the black surface. The shelves were perforated close to the
 tray bottom with holes separated by equal distances, and of such a
size as to easily admit the body of a larva with its spines, while the
latter as in the compartmented tubes tend to obscure the interval
between the larval body and the edge of the aperture.             The trays
 were placed vertically in a strong east light, so that the shelves pro
jected horizontally, the black surface being uppermost in some cases,
the gilt surface in others. Suspended larvae were pinned (by the
boss of silk) on to the uppermost colour in such a position over the
 holes that the head and <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>ve segments of each larva passed
 through a hole into the colour beneath, which tended to produce oppo
 site results. The curvature of the larval body brought the head close
 up to the underside of the shelf, and thus there was no chance of its
 being in<U+FB02>uenced by the colour above the shelf. Other larvae were
 similarly <U+FB01>xed between the shelves upon one colour only, so as to
 afford a comparison with the results of the con<U+FB02>icting colours. The
 pupae obtained were on the whole rather lighter when the gilt surface
 was above, and hence the gilt surroundings in<U+FB02>uenced the rather
larger posterior part of the skin to a. greater extent than in the converse
arrangement, when the effective colour was below. Hence on the
 whole the in<U+FB02>uence of con<U+FB02>icting colours has ended in as complete a
con<U+FB01>rmation of the numerous blinding experiments as the necessarily
limited conditions of experiment could be expected to produce.
    8. The Nature of the Efects Produced—The gilded appearance is
one of the most metal-like appearances in any non-metallic substance.
 The optical explanation has never been understood. It has, however,
 been long known that it depends upon the cuticle, and needs the
 presence of moisture, and that it can be renewed, when the dry
 cuticle is moistened.    Hence it can be preserved for any time in
 spirit.   If a piece of dry cuticle be moistened on its upper surface
 the colour is not renewed, but almost instantly follows the application
 of spirit to the lower surface. Sections of the cuticle resemble those
 of Papil'io machaon described in a previous paper (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’

 1887.]       between certain Pupce and their Surroundings.             103
vol. 38, 1885, p. 279), and show an upper thin layer, and a lower much
thicker, <U+FB01>nely laminated layer, which is also striated vertically to the
surface. With Professor Clifton’s kind assistance I have been able to
show that the appearances follow from interference of light, due to
the presence of <U+FB01>lms of liquid between the lamellae of the lower layer.
The microscope shows brilliant red and green tints by re<U+FB02>ected light,
while in transmitted light the complementary colours are distinct,
but without brilliancy. The latter colours are seen to change when
pressure is applied to the surface of the cuticle, and when the process
of drying is watched under the microscope, owing in both cases to the
liquid <U+FB01>lms becoming thinner. In the dry cuticle the solid lamellaa
probably come into contact, and prevent the admission of air, which,
if present, would cause even greater brilliancy than liquid. The
spectroscope shows broad interference bands in the transmitted light,
which change their position on altering the angle of incidence of the
light which passes through the cuticle. Precisely similar colours,
metallic on re<U+FB02>ection, non-metallic and with the complementary tints
on transmission, with the same spectroscopic appearances and changes
induced by the same means, are seen in the surface <U+FB01>lms which are
formed on bottle glass after prolonged exposure to earth and moisture.
 In the alternating layers of the pupa the chitinous lamellaa are of higher,
the liquid <U+FB01>lms of lower refractive index, hence water or alcohol pro
duce brilliant appearances, while liquids of higher refractive indices
produce less effect.
   It is very interesting to note that this most specialised means of
producing colour is probably derived in the most simple manner from
the ordinary lamellated layer of other non-metallic pupae (e.g.,
P. machaon) in which the lamellaa merely act as re<U+FB02>ectors, so that the
pupa is brightly coloured by absorption due to pigment contained in
the outer lamellaa only, and hence traversed twice by a large part of
the incident light.
   The dark pupa; of V. urticaa, and the dark parts of the brilliant
pupae, contain abundant pigment in the upper thinner layer only,
which therefore acts as a screen, and shuts off light from the lamel
lated layer below, thus preventing the metallic appearance.          In the
brilliant pupa) this layer is transparent, and of a bright yellow colour,
and doubtless assists in producing the yellowness of the golden
appearance by absorption of light.       The two layers are of diiferent
chemical constitution, for the upper will not stain in logwood, while
the lower does so without dif<U+FB01>culty.
   9. The Biological Value of the Gilded Appearance—Mr. T. W. Wood
suggested that the appearance was so essentially unlike anything
usually found in the organic kingdoms as to protect the organisms
possessing it. Others have thought that it has the value of a warning
colour, indicating an unpleasant taste.     It is probable that it is‘ now

104      Mr. E. B. Poulton.     On a special Colour-Relation       [Feb. 10,
used for this purpose, but it is improbable that such was its original
meaning, for the fact that the appearance can be called up by the
appropriate surroundings shows that it belongs to the highest class of
protective colours, as far removed as possible from conspicuous
warning colours, the object of which is to become as unlike their
surroundings as possible.        The former suggestion no doubt contains
the   true origin  of the character, if we add to it the statement that the
appearance is not only unlike anything organic, but strongly resem
bles many common mineral substances,             especially the widespread
mineral mica.       The darker pupae, on the other hand, resemble grey
and weathered rock surfaces, just as the brilliant varieties resemble
many exposed and recently fractured rocks. The shape of the Vanessa
pupa is eminently angular and mineral looking.          It is probable that
the glittering form arose in a hot dry country, where exposed rocks
would not weather for a long period of time. Gilded pupm of
Vanessa are formed from larvae which contain parasitic larvae of
ichneumon <U+FB02>ies, probably on account of the absence of pigment in
such diseased individuals, and such absence being correlated with the
gilded appearance, the latter is therefore formed.          Vanessa Io has a
green variety of pupa which appears when the insect is attached to
its food-plant; V. atalanta, has not such a form, and spins a tent of
leaves when it pupates on the plant, while V. urticaa has neither the
green variety nor the latter habit, and exhibits a strong disinclination
to pupate among vegetal surroundings.           During the past summer      I
only found three pupae of the species on the food-plant inthe <U+FB01>eld, and
all were “ ichneumoned ” and were abnormally gilded.
    III. Experiments upon Vanessa, atalanta.—A few larvae of this
species, kindly sent me by Mr. J. L. Surrage, were subjected to gilt and
to black surroundings, while a few others were left in bright light
among the leaves of the food-plant.           The results harmonised very
completely    with  those  obtained  from  V. urticw, the <U+FB01>rst set of pupae
being uniformly golden, the second very dark and with hardly any or
none of the gilded appearance,         while the third were intermediate
but nearer to the former.       The length of Stage (iii) appeared to be
about the same as in V. urticoe, as far as this could be ascertained
from the limited data.
    IV.  Emperiments    npon   Papilio madman—Mr.          W. H. Harwood
supplied me with larvae of this species.           The eight largest were
selected and placed in brown surroundings (twigs, &c.), four of them
being blinded. The lar'vee were very quiet and did not appear to be
irritated by the proces, which was repeated three time.            The posi
tion of the ocelli on a distinct black area rendered it easy to ensure
that they are all covered with varnish.       Eight bright green pupae were
obtained, <U+FB01>xed to the brown stems or roof or lying free on the brown
<U+FB02>oor. This result surprised me very much, for I knew that there

 1887         between certain Paper and their Surroundings;           105
 was a brown variety of the pupa not uncommon in this species.       The
 remaining three larvae were placed in green surroundings, one of
 them being blinded as above, but only one of the normal larvae
pupated, <U+FB01>xed to the green food-plant, and produced a distinct brown
variety. These startling results show that there can be no suscepti
bility in this species, and this is all the more remarkable because the
two varieties are so well marked, and because of the striking results
obtained by Mrs. Barber and other observers on two species of South
African Papilios.    Fritz Miiller, however, shows that another species
of this genus resembles P. machaon in being dimorphic and yet not
susceptible. The contradictory results obtained in my experiments
were either due to the secondary association of one variety of a
dimorphic species with an unhealthy condition or even a stunted size,
                                                                ” larvae,
as the gilded Vanessa pupm result from “ichneumoned
or to the shade caused by the green tissue-paper.            The eight
largest and healthiest larvae produced the green pupae, while of
the three smaller larva) only one pupated and formed a brown pupae.
Mr. Harwood informs me that he has always looked with suspicion
on the brown pupae, believing that they have been bred from larva
which were captured when small, and which are reared in close-<U+FB01>tting
tin boxes; and he believes that the wild pupae, and those obtained
from larvae which were found when almost mature, are green. On the
whole  I think it is probable that the pupal dimorphism in this species
is the remnant of a former suceptibility to coloured surroundings.
   V. Experiments upon Pieris brassicee and P. rupee—These two
species are treated together because they were in nearly all cases kept
under similar conditions and were often placed in the same cylinders.
The (nearly mature) larvae were almost always obtained, and the
experiments conducted, at Seaview (Isle of Wight).
   1. Standards of Papal Oolour.——Degrees of colour were constructed
by the comparison of a large number of individuals in each species.
In these standard lists the pupae were arranged in both species
according to the relative predominance of black pigment, both as
patches and minute dots, the latter tending to produce a grey appear
ance and obscuring the ground colour.         The lightest degrees were
classi<U+FB01>ed according to the tint of the ground colour which had become
prominent in the comparative absence of the pigment.
   2. Efects of various Colours acting during the Preparatory Period.
(an) Black—Interesting results following the use of this black ground
under various conditions of illumination (P. rapoe only), the effects
being stronger in the direction of pigment formation when the
amount of light was increased (the opposite effect having been
witnessed in V. urticce).   The pupa) of both species were dark in the
great majority of instances after exposure to black surroundings in
the larval state during the preparatory period.

   (3.) White—In this case also the effects were stronger (as shown
in the prevention of pigment formation) as the surface was more
highly illuminated (P. mpaa only).
   (q.) Colours of the Spectrum—All the colours were used except
violet, and the effects upon pigment formation in the two species were
so graduated in the successive colours that it was possible to approxi
mately represent the results by a graphic method, making the abscissa
of the scale of wave-lengths of the visible spectrum, and each ordinate
of a length which corresponded to the average amounts of pigment
obtained from all the pupae subjected to any one colour, each ordinate
being made to diverge at its base, and to include the degrees on the
scale of wave-lengths which were shown by the spectroscope to corre
spond to the rays re<U+FB02>ected (or transmitted) by the colour in question.
Joining the summits of all the ordinates, the lines obtained were
strikingly similar in the two species.

   The colours which most retard the formation of pigment were
shown by the spectroscope to contain certain rays in common, i.e.,
those from W.L. 0'00057—W.L. 0'00059, or 000060.          The whole of
the experiments on these species seemed to show that, of the light
incident on the larval surface, the direct white light produces no
effect at all (until after    has been re<U+FB02>ected).
                                   it              Further experiments

must have been largely coloured by absorption from re<U+FB02>ected as well
as transmitted light.

   3.The Length of the Preparatory Period—The observations were
not su<U+FB02>icient to determine the duration of the periods and of its stages
with any great accuracy, but all the experiments render it certain
that the length is much greater in both species than in V. urticae.
There were also some indications, as in V. urticw, that darknes may
cause the prolongation of the period.
  4. Blinding Ezpem'ments.—The larva: of     P. rapw were alone made
use of, and they are as well suited to this method of investigation as
P. machaon. The sets of pupae produced from normal and blinded
larvae were very similar, and thus the results harmonise        with      those of
all the blinding experiments in other      species of larvae.
   5.   Transference Empertments.—A considerable number of the larvae
of P.     rapa: were transferred for the whole or part of Stage (iii)
 to a surface of a colour different from and generally opposite to that
 which had previously in<U+FB02>uenced them, and the results entirely har
 monised with those previously described in other species, showing
 that the larva is sensitive and not the pupa, and that the time of
 greatest susceptibility is before Stage (iii), or only including the <U+FB01>rst
 part of    it,
              but also rendering     itprobable that the larva: can be
in<U+FB02>uenced to a small extent during this stage.
    6. The Nature      the E<U+FB01>’ects wrought upon the Rupee—The
                       of                                           varied
pigment e<U+FB01>ects which follow the in<U+FB02>uence of di<U+FB01>erent surrounding
 colours are attended by other more deeply seated changes                 of
 even greater physiological interest and importance.            The black
 pigment patches and minute black dots are cuticular and super
 <U+FB01>cial, while the green, pink, or other ground colours are subcuticular
and deep-seated, and in the most brightly coloured pupae they are
mixed colours, due to the existence of different pigmentary (and
probably chlorophylloid) bodies present in different elements and at
different depths in the subcuticular tissues of the same pupa. In
other pupae no trace of such colours can be seen. Hence we see in
these most complex and varied effects of the stimulus provided by the
re<U+FB02>ected light, which deepen into their permanent pupal condition
very many hours after the stimulus has ceased to act, the strongest
evidence    for the existence of a chain of physiological processes
almost unparalleled in intricacy and di<U+FB02>iculty, while a theory of
comparatively simple and direct photochemical changes induced by the
stimulus itself, without such a physiological circle, seems entirely
inadequate as an explanation of the facts,     aconclusion which     borneis
out by comparison with the experiments upon other species described
        a
in this paper.
   VI. Experiments upon Ephyra pendularia.—After the consideration
of the many species of variable pupae of the Rhopalocera,       it of inte
                                                                     is
rest to compare the results of the investigation of the equally exposed
and variable pupae of certain species of a single genus of Heterocera,

  the genus Ephyra.     I observed this genus in 1883 (i.e., E. pendularia,
  E. omicronaria, and E. orbiculan'a), and the results are published in
  ‘
    Entom. Soc. Trans.,' 1884, pp. 50—56. The most curious result of
 the observation was the establishment of the fact that the green and
 brown larvae always produce pupae of the same colour.             I think it is
 very probable (from      the  consideration    of  other  partially published
 observations), although entirely untested in this genus, that the
 colours of the larvae, and throngh them of the pupae, could be con
 trolled by the selection of appropriate surroundings during the whole
 or a large part of the larval stage.      Concerning the di<U+FB01>erent species
 made use of, E. orbicularia        is  variable, E. pendularia regularly
 dimorphic green and brown, and E. omicronaria dimorphic, with the
 brown forms very rare. The relative numbers of the green and
 brown larvaa and pupae of E. pendularia vary at di<U+FB01>erent times of the
 year, the green forms greatly predominating in the summer brood,
 while they are not so abundant in the winter brood. When the
 parents of any set of larvae were both of the same colour in the
 larval stage there was a much larger proportion of that same colour
 in the resulting o<U+FB02>'spring.    I made some observations upon the situa
 tions selected for pupation, thinking that these might show some
 relation to the pupal colours, but the results were not convincing,
 and were certainly highly irregular, but the experiment was not
 carried out in the best way, for there was not a suf<U+FB01>cient quantity of
 both colours in the surroundings.      Dr. Wilhelm Miiller, of Greifswald
 (Spengel, ‘Zool. Jahrb.,’ vol. 1, 1886, p. 234), calls attention to this
remarkable and constant relation of larval to pupal colours, and
expresses the belief that it is entirely exceptional, a statement which
is of importance, when it is remembered that Dr. Muller has worked
carefully for many years on the South American larvaa.                   Hence
certain species of Ephyridie afford an interesting contrast with all the
other species of exposed pupae which have been hitherto observed.
     VII. Emperimenis upon the Colours of the Cocoon in Satmniq,
carpini.—At the suggestion of Mr. W. H. Harwood                  I made some
experiments    upon  this  species,  and  found    that  four  cocoons   which
were spun in the corners      of  black  calico bags were very dark brown
in colour, while those of other larvae which had been freely exposed
to light until after they had begun to spin, and which were not sur
rounded by dark surfaces, were nearly all perfectly white, and when
darker of a much paler tint, and very di<U+FB01>'erent from the four men
tioned above. Thus Mr. Harwood’s suggestion seems to be entirely
con<U+FB01>rmed, and another instance of the in<U+FB02>uence of surroundings is
added, and one which it appears cannot be explained in any way
except by the supposition of the existence of a complicated physio
logical, and apparently a nervous circuit.

   The paper consists, as its title implies, of a record of experiments
relating to the functions of the cerebral cortex, a subject upon which
 the authors have been engaged during three years.        The-experiments
have been entirely made upon monkeys.        After describing the methods
employed, the general results of excitation and of extirpation of
 various parts of the cerebral hemispheres on one or both sides are
given, and the cases in which the method of ablation has been
employed are then recorded in detail, the symptoms observed during
life and the conditionoof the brain after death being systematically
 noted. Each case is illustrated by one or more drawings, showing
 the exact condition of the brain post mortem. In some instances
 sections of the brain are also represented.     The paper includes also a
topographical plan      of the  excitable or motor    region of the cortex
cerebri.
II.   “ ()n Radiant Matter Spectroscopy :—Examination of the
     Residual Glow.”        By WILLIAM CROOKES, F.R.S., V.P.C.S.
     Received February 10, 1887.
   The duration of phosphorescence after cessation of the exciting
cause is known to vary within wide limits of time, from several hours
in the case of the phosphorescent sulphides to a minute fraction of a

second with uranium glass and sulphate of quinine.                   In my examina
tions of the phosphorescent earths glowing under the excitement of the
induction discharge in vacuo, I have found very great differences in
the duration of the residual glow.               Some earths continue to phos
phoresce   for  an  hour    or   more      after  the current is turned oif, while
others cease to give out the light the moment the current stops.
Having succeeded in splitting up yttria into several simpler forms of
matter di<U+FB01>ering in basic power,‘ and always seeking for further
evidence of the separate identity of these bodies,             I noticed occasionally
that the residual glow was of a somewhat different colour to that it
exhibited while the current was passing, and also that the spectrum
 of this residual glow seemed to show, as far as the faint light enabled
 me to make out, that some of the lines were missing.                   This pointed
 to another difference between the yttrium components, and with a
 view to examine the question more closely I devised an instrument
 similar to Becquerel’s phosphoroscope, but acting electrically instead
 of by means of direct light.
    The instrument, shown in <U+FB01>g. 1, A and B, consists of an opaque
 disk, a b 0, 20 inches in diameter, and pierced with twelve openings
  near the edge as shown.            By means of a multiplying wheel, d, and

stationary object behind one of the apertures is alternately exposed and
hidden twelve times.      A commutator, g (shown enlarged at <U+FB01>g. 1, B),
forms part    of the  axis of the disk. The commutator is formed of a
hollow cylinder of brass round a solid wooden cylinder. The brass
is cut into two halves by a saw cut running diagonally to and fro
round it, so as to form on each half of the cylinder twelve deeply cut
teeth interlocking, and insulated from these on the opposing half
cylinder by an air space about 2 mm. across.          Only'one half h hh,
of the cylinder is used, the 'other, i t i, being idle; it might have been
cut away altogether were it not for some little use that it is in saving
the rubbing-spring, j, from too great friction when passing rapidly
over the serrated edge.       To a block beneath the commutator are
attached two springs, one,    hi, rubbing permanently against the con
tinuous base of the serrated hemicylinder,           and the other,

when the breaks will be much longer than the makes, or it can be set
to rub near the base of the teeth, when the current will remain on for
a much longer time and the intervals of no current will be very short.
By means of a screw, ll, attached to the spring, any desired ratio
between the makes and the breaks can be obtained. The intermittent
primary current is then carried to an induction coil, m, the secondary
current from which passes through the vacuum tube, n, containing
the earth under examination. When the commutator, the coil-break,
and the position of the vacuum tube are in proper adjustment, no
                                                                          '
light is seen when looked at from the front if the wheel is turned
slowly (supposing a substance like yttria is being examined), as the
current does not begin till the tube is obscured by an intercepting
segment, and it ends before the earth comes into view. When, how
ever, the wheel is turned more quickly, the residual phosphorescence
lasts long enough to bridge over the brief interval of time elapsing
between the cessation of the spark and the entry of the earth into the
<U+FB01>eld of view, and the yttria is seen to glow with a faint light, which
becomes brighter as the speed of the wheel increases.
   To count the revolutions, a projecting stud, o, is fastened to the
rotating axis, and a piece of quill, p, is attached to the <U+FB01>xed support,
so that at every revolution 2. click is produced.   With a chronograph
watch it is easy in this way to tell the time, to the tenth of a second,
occupied in ten revolutions of the wheel.                    ,
   Under ordinary circumstances it is almost impossible to detect any
phosphorescence in an earth until the vacuum is so high that the line
spectrum of the residual gas begins to get faint ; otherwise the feeble
glow of the phosphorescence is drowned by the greater brightness of
the glowing gas.      In this phosphoroscope, however, the light of
glowing gas   does not  last an appreciable time, whilst that from the
phosphorescent   earth  endures  long enough for it to be caught in the
instrument.    By this means, therefore,    I have been able to see the
phosphorescence of yttria, for example, when the barometer gauge
was 5 or 6 mm. below the barometer.
   When the earth under examination in the phosphoroscope is yttria
free from samaria, and the residual emitted light is examined in the
spectroscope, not all the bands appear at the same speed of rotation.
At a slow speed the double greenish-blue band of G3 (545) <U+FB01>rst
comes into view, closely followed by the deep blue band of G4 (482).
This is followed, on increasing the speed, by the bright citron band
of G8 (574), and at the highest speed the red band of G§ (619) is
with dif<U+FB01>culty  seen.
   The following   are measurements     of the time of duration of the
phosphorescences   of the different constituents of yttrium.   The wheel
was <U+FB01>rst rotated slowly, until the <U+FB01>rst line visible in the spectroscope
attached to the phosphoroscope       appeared; the speed was counted,

this way the minimum speed of revolution necessary to bring each
line into view was obtained, and from these data the duration of
phosphorescence for each constituent of yttria was calculated. The
time in the following table represents in decimals of a second the time
elapsing between the cessation of the induction discharge and the
visibility of the residual glow of the earth :—
   At 000%     sec. interval the green and blue lines of GB and Ga begin to be visible.
   At 0'0032         ,,      the citron line of G8 begins to be visible.
   At  0'00175       ,,       the deep red line of G! (647) is just visible.
   At 0‘00125        ,,      the line of G5 is almost as bright as that of GB, and the
                                red line of G1] is visible.
   At 0‘000875       ,,     the highest speed the instrument could be revolved with
                                accuracy, the whole of the lines usually seen in the
                                yttria spectrum could be seen of nearly their usual
                                brightness.
    I have   already recorded‘ that phosphate of yttria, when phospho
mesced    in vacuo, gives the         green lines very strongly whilst the citron
band is hazy and faint.            The same tube of yttric phosphate was now
examined in the phosphoroscope. The green lines of G3 soon showed
themselves on setting the wheel into rapid rotation, but                    I  was unable
to detect the citron band of G8 even at a very high speed.
   The eifect of calcium on the phosphorescence                    of yttria and samaria
has been frequently referred to in my previous papers.                        It may same
           I
time if summarise the results here.                  About 1 per cent. of lime added
to a badly phosphorescing body containing yttrium or samarium
always causes it to phosphoresce well. It diminishes the sharpness
of the citron line of G8 but increases in brightness. It also renders
the deep blue line of Ga extremely bright.                       The green lines of GB
are diminished in brightness.                Lime also brings out the phospho
rescence of samarium, although by itself, or in the presence of a small
quantity of yttrium, samarium scarcely phosphoresees at all.
    In the phosphoroscope the action of lime on yttrium is seen to
entirely alter the order of visibility of the constituents of yttrium.
In a mixture of equal parts yttrium and calcium, the citron GB line
is the <U+FB01>rst to be seen, then comes the Ga blue line, then the GB green
line, and <U+FB01>nally the G0] red line. This may,                      I think, be explained
somewhat as follows :—Calcium sulphate has a long residual phos
phorescence, whilst yttrium sulphate has a comparatively short
residual phosphorescence.                Now with yttrium, although the green
phosphorescence of Gr<U+FB02> lasts longest, it does not last nearly so long as
that of calcium sulphate. The long residual vibrations of the calcium
compound induce, in a mixture of calcium and yttrium, phospho
rescence in those yttric molecules (G8) whose vibrations it can assist,

the mixture of yttrium and samarium the residue would be Ya. I
have little doubt that this will soon be accomplished, but in the
meantime the phosphoroscope enables us to remove the line of G8
from the mixture.       It is only necessary to add strontium to a suitable
mixture of yttrium and samarium and view the phosphorescing
mixture in the instrument when the wheel is rotating rapidly, to
obtain a spectrum which is indistinguishable from that of Ya.

   Antimony oxide With 95 per cent. of lime (in the form of ignited
sulphate).    White phosphorescence, the spectrum showing a broad
space in the yellow, cutting the red and orange o<U+FB01>.                In the phos
phoroscopes the residual glow is very strong, and of a greenish colour.
The spectrum of the residual light shows that the red and orange
are entirely obliterated, leaving the green and blue very luminous.
Antimony oxide with 99 per cent. of lime gives a pale yellowish phos
phorescence, which on heating turns red.            In other respects it is like
the 5 per cent. mixture.
   Arsenious acid with 99 per cent. of lime gives a greenish-white

   Barium 5 per cent., calcium 95 per cent—The sulphates phos
phoresce green, with specks of yellow and violet.               The spectrum is
continuous, with slight concentration in the red, great concentration
in the green, and in the orange a broad black band hazy at the
edges.
   Bismuth   15 per cent., calcium 85 per cent., phosphoresces of a bright
reddish-orange.     The spectrum shows a tolerably sharp and broad
dark band in the red and orange, and a strong concentration of light
in the green and blue; the spectrum being continuous and divided
into two parts by a black band in the yellow, as in the case of the
antimony-calcium      spectrum.     In the phosphoroscope the red and
orange disappear and the green and blue remain. Bismuth 7 per
cent., calcium 93 per cent—The action is similar to the 15 per cent.
mixture, except the colour of the phosphorescence, which is whiter.
In the phosphoroscope the red and orange below the dark band is cut
OE.    With 2 per cent. of bismuth the same phenomena occur. With
0'5 bismuth. the phosphorescence        is greenish-blue and the spectrum
is continuous, with strong concentrations in the orange and green.

     Calcium sulphate was prepared from a colourless and transparent
  rhomb of Iceland spar which had been used for optical purposes.                 It
  was dissolved in nitric acid, the nitrate was decomposed with distilled
  sulphuric acid, and the ignited sulphate tested in the tube.                  The
  phosphorescence     is bright greenish-blue without bands or lines. In
  the phosphoroscope the colour is a rich green; the spectrum shows
  the red and orange entirely out 0E, leaving the green and blue; the
  blue is especially strong.
     Calcium sulphates prepared from Professor Breithaupt’s calcites“
  were re-examined.       All phosphoresce with the normal greenish-blue
  glow of calcium, except No. 11, which gives a reddish glow.                     A
  minute trace of samarium was found in this calcite, but not enough
  to a<U+FB01>ect the colour of the glow.              In the phosphoroscope all the
  specimens give a continuous spectrum beyond the yellow, the red and
  orange being cut off as usual.
      Chromium 5 per cent, calcium 95 per cent., as sulphates, gives a
  pale reddish phosphorescence.           In the phosphoroscope the colour is
  green, and the red and orange are cut 05.               1 per cent. of chromium
  with calcium phosphoresces          green    in  the   cold, and becomes a red
  when slightly heated.       The behaviour of chromium with aluminium
  has already been described.T
      Copper sulphate with 95 per cent. calcium               sulphate behaves like
  calcium sulphate.
      Diamonds phosphoresce of various colours.                 Those glowing pale
   blue have the longest residual glow, next come those phosphorescing
  yellow;     I am unable to detect any residual glow in diamonds
   phosphorescing of a reddish colour. A large diamond of a greenish
   hue, very phosphorescent, shines almost as brightly in the phosphoro
   scope as out of it.
      Glucina phosphoresces of a rich blue colour. There appears to be
   no residual glow with this earth in the phosphoroscope.
      Lanthanum.——All the specimens of lanthanum sulphate                    I  have

   from red to yellowish, and brings out yttrium and samarium lines,

in very small quantities with lime, the lines of G5 and Ga are
intensi<U+FB01>ed, while that of G<U+FB01> is weakened.                This new result seems to
show that if only a small trace of GB is present with lime and
lanthanum, the green line is not only suppressed, but the quenching
action has actually extended so far as to neutralise that part of the
continuous lime spectrum having the same refrangibility as the G/3
line, the result being ablack space in the spectrum. In the phos
phoroscope the line of Ge is visible at the slowest speed ; G6 comes in
at an interval of 00035 second, and the Ga: line immediately after
wards.
    Lead sulphate, by itself, in the radiant-matter tube glows with a
nearly white colour, giving a continuous spectrum.                   In the phos
phoroscope the red and orange are cut off, leaving a strong concen
tration of light in the green and blue.             5 per cent. of lead added to
calcium sulphate phosphoresces like lime.
    lifagnesia. phosphoresces      pink.    5 per cent. with lime, as sulphates,
give a greenish phosphorescence, with a tendency to turn red as the
powder heats.        As the Oriental ruby contains between 1 and 2 per
cent. of magnesia,        a mixture was prepared of acetate of alumina
with 2 per cent. of magnesia, and tested after ignition. It gave no
spectrum or lines.          This was done to see if the crimson line of
aluminium might be due to the presence of magnesia.
    Nickel added to calcium sulphate in the proportion of 5 per cent
makes no alteration in the usual phosphorescent phenomena                       of
calcium.
    Potassium, 5 per cent, added to calcium sulphate gives a bright
phosphorescence,      and made the residual glow very persistent.
     Samarium.——The phosphorescent behaviour of this body, alone and
mixed with other substances, has been fully described in my paper on
 samarium.‘
     Scandium, either in the form of earth or sulphate, phosphoresces
of a very faint blue colour, but the light is too feeble to enable a
 spectrum to be seen. Addition of lime does not bring out any lines.
     Sodium sulphate mixed with an excess of calcium sulphate gives av
greenish tinge to the usual colour of the phosphorescence.                   The
sodium line is visible in the spectrum.
     Strontia in the radiant-matter tube glows with a rich blue colour,
showing in the spectroscope a continuous spectrum with a great
concentration of light in the blue and violet. In the phosphoroscope
the colour of the glow is bright green, showing in the spectroscope a,
continuous spectrum, with the red and blue ends cut o<U+FB02>’. A mixture
of calcium sulphate with 5 per cent. of strontium sulphate behaves
 like calcium sulphate alone.

    Thorium,   as  oxide or sulphate, refuses to phosphoresce, and the
tube rapidly becomes non-conducting.               A tube with thoria at one end
and a phosphorescent earth such as lime or yttria at the other end,
and furnished with a pair of poles near each end, at a particular
exhaustion is non-conducting at the thoria end, while it conducts at
the yttria end. If the wires of the induction coil are attached to the
poles at the thoria end, no current will pass; rather than pass through
the tube, the spark prefers to strike across the spark gauge—a striking
distance of 37 mm.—showing an electromotive force of 34,040 volts.
Without doing anything to a<U+FB01>'ect the degree of exhaustion, on trans
ferring the wires of the induction coil from the thoria to the yttria
end, the spark passes at once.           To balance the spark in air the wires
of the gauge must be made to approach till they are only 7 mm.
apart, equivalent to an electromotive force of 6440 volts; the fact of
whether thoria or yttria is under the poles making a di<U+FB01>erence of
27,600 volts in the conductivity of the tube.               The explanation of this
action of thoria is not yet quite clear. From the great difference in
the phosphorescence of the two earths, it is evident that the passage
of the electricity through these tubes is not so much dependent on
the degree of exhaustion as upon the phosphorogenic property of the
body opposite the poles.         This view is supported by the fact that the
thoria may be replaced by a metal wire, when the same obstructive
action will result.                                                               .
    Lime does not give phosphorescent properties to thoria, if this
earth be pure, but it brings out the lines of yttrium and samarium
which are almost always'present in small quantities in thoria unless
 it has been specially puri<U+FB01>ed.
    Tin with   95 per cent. of lime gives the lime phosphorescence only.
    Thul'ium and erbium together phosphoresce with a green light,
giving the erbium spectrum already described before this Society.‘
 There is, in addition, a faint blue line apparently double (see
“Ytterbium ”). The addition of lime causes the mixture to phos
 phoresce of a pale blue colour.             The spectrum now shows a bright
blue band, in the same position as the faint double blue band seen in
.the absence of lime.       The blue line of G5 is also seen, and a faint line
 of G6. The deep red line of G1,, one of the constituents of the
ordinary yttria spectrum, is prominent in this spectrum.
     Tungsten and uranium, each mixed with 95 per cent. of lime, only
give the lime spectrum.                                                             I

    These blue bands are seen much fainter without lime, and are about
as strong in the mixture of thulia and erbia. with lime described above.
I   had ascribed them to ytterbia, when Professor Nilson kindly
forwarded me a small specimen of ytterbia, considered by him
perfectly pure, and used for his atomic weight determinations.
This ytterbia gives absolutely no blue bands.                     The origin of these
bands therefore       remains    uncertain.
   ‘  This is the band spoken of in my Royal Society paper of 9th June last (‘ Roy.
Soc. Pr00.,’ vol. 40, 1886, p. 507), provisionally called 87, and ascribed to ytterbia.
If  it is not due to ytterbia it is evidence of a new body.

     Ytterbia from Professor Nilson, in the form of sulphate, refuses to
 phosphoresce       without the addition of lime. When lime is added it
 only brings out traces of the phosphorescent bands of Ga, GB, and Ga.
 Evidently these are impurities.
     Ytterbia from M. de Mar-ignac is identical with that from M. Cleve,
 as far as my examination can go.           In sending me this ytterbia M. de
 Marignac warned me that he was very far from thinking it pure.
      Yttrium.—During the fractionation of the higher fractions of
 yttria (+6, 118 and 119), a very sharp green line sometimes makes
 its appearance, situated between GB and Gq (approximate position on
 the l/k2 scale, 325). It is very faint, and is not connected with the
 orange line of SE, although it is as sharp. The yttria showing these
 lines phosphoresces          of a transparent golden-yellow colour, the
 fractions at the other end phosphorescing yellowish green.
     I  have previously described the action of a large number of bodies
 on the phosphorescence of samarium.“              The experiments resulting in
 the following observations were tried at about the same time.                   I will
 describe them in alphabetical order.           Unless otherwise mentioned all
the mixtures were in the form of anhydrous sulphates.
     Yttrium 5 per cent., aluminium 95 per cent., gives a good yttria
spectrum; the blue line of Ga is very distinct, and the double green
of GB is well divided. In the phosphoroscope the GB and Ga lines
<U+FB01>rst appear simultaneously, then the G6 line.
     Yttrium 995 per cent., bismuth 0'5 per cent—The spectrum is
bright, and on close examination a trace of samarium green, G7, is to
be detected forming a. wing to the G5 line.              In the phosphoroscope
the citron line of G5 entirely disappears and the samarium double
green line, which out of the phosphoroscope is almost obscured by the
great brightness of G6, now appears distinctly, together with the green
G13 line.      Yttrium 95 per cent., bismuth 5 per cent., gives the usual
yttria spectrum. No G8 line appears in the phosphoroscope at any
speed.      At <U+FB01>rst only the G 3 line is seen, and next the Ga line appears,
as in yttria.       On gradually increasing the percentage of bismuth the
spectrum of yttria grows fainter, until with 95 per cent. of bismuth
the phosphorescence is bad and the spectrum faint.
    Yttrium     5  per cent., cadmium 95 per cent., gives a brilliant phos
phorescence,       but the spectrum is almost continuous.            In the phos
phoroscope       a  faint concentration   of  light is seen in  the   green, which
becomes sharper as the speed increases.
    The action of calcium on the phosphorescence                  of yttrium has
already been described.                                                       .

added.      All the bands remain of their normal sharpness.
    Yttrium 5 per cent., copper 95 per cent., phosphoresces very
feebly.
    Yttrium 90 per cent., didymium 10 per cent—This mixture gives
a good yttria spectrum. Yttrium 70 per cent., didymium 30 per
cent., phosphoresces very fairly and gives all the usual lines.
    Yttrium 50 per cent., didymium 50 per cent., refuses to phos
phoresce. The tube is either too full of gas to allow the phosphor
escence to be seen or it becomes non-conducting.              When the mixture
is illuminated by the glowing gas          the absorption  lines  of didymium
the green are seen. With higher proportions of didymium the same
results are produced. On adding 25 per cent. of lime to the mixture
 containing 50 per cent. of didymium the yttria spectrum is brought
 out very well. Lime added to a mixture of 10 per cent. yttria and
 90 per cent. didymium brings out the yttrium spectrum fairly, but the
 tube soon becomes non-conducting.
     Yttrium 5 per cent. and glucinum 95 per cent. gives a bright phos
 phorescence, but the de<U+FB01>nition of the spectrum lines of yttria is bad.
    Yttrium 5 per cent., thallium 95 per cent—No spectrum is given
 by this mixture, it turns black and refuses to phosphoresce.

 bright yellow colour, the spectrum is brilliant, but the lines are not
 sharply de<U+FB01>ned.       In the phosphoroscope the colour becomes greenish,
 and the spectrum shows only the green lines of GB.
     Yttrium 5 per cent., zinc 95 per cent—The phosphorescence is of
 a pale yellowish-white, and the spectrum is very brilliant, being equal

   Gl.—All earth phosphorescing with a blue light, and showing in
the spectroscope        a deep blue line, of a mean wave-length                482.
This earth occurs in di<U+FB01>erent proportions in puri<U+FB01>ed yttria from
different minerals.        Samarskite, gadolinite, hielmite, monazite, xeno
time, euxenite, and arrhenite contain most Ga, whilst <U+FB02>uocerite and
cerite contained notably less of this constituent.                 The addition of
lime brings    out  the   phosphorescence        in Ga  in  advance of that of the
other constituents. The behaviour in the phosphoroscope of Ga when
mixed with the alkaline earths also points to a difference between it
and its associates.       With lime the blue phosphorescent band of Gm
comes into view at a very low speed, the order of appearance with a,
small quantity of lime being GB, Ga, G6, and with a large quantity
of lime, G8, Ga, GB. Employing strontia instead of lime, the order
of appearance in the phosphoroscope when the quantity of strontia
is small is GB, Ga, G1), and when the quantity of strontia is in excess,
G4, G1,, GB. Baryta in small quantity brings out the lines in the
phosphoroscope       in the following order: GB, Ga, G17, but when the
baryta is in excess the order is GB, Ga), Ga. The chemical position
taken up by Ga. in the fractionation scheme precludes it from being
due to the bodies I have called GB, Gq, Ge, G§, Sq, or 86.               It closely
accompanies G5 (the earth giving the citron line), concentrating at
the least basic end, and      I have not yet succeeded in e<U+FB01>ecting a sepa
ration of the two. If, therefore, Ga is not a. separate entity, its blue
line must be due to the citron-band-forming body called G8.                    The
difference between Ga. and G8 is brought out in a marked manner by

     GB—An earth phosphorescing with green light, and showing in
 the spectroscope a close pair of greenish-blue lines of a mean wave
length of 545. This earth can be separated by chemical fractionation
from the other constituents of yttrium.      It concentrates at the most
basic end, and is present in the samarium which invariably makes its
appearance at this end of the fractionation of yttrium.       It is one of
the prominent lines in Ya, where also it accompanies some of the
samarium lines. GB, however, is not a constituent of samarium, for
it is easy to purify samarium by chemical means so that it does not
 show a trace of the GB green lines, although it is very di<U+FB02>icult to get
 GB free from some of the samarium lines. The residual phosphor
 escence of GB is very considerable, and its green lines show <U+FB01>rst in
 the phosphoroscope    when only yttrium is present.     The addition of
 lime keeps back the glow of GB, and brings forward that of G6.
 Strontium and barium act on GB very di<U+FB01>erently to lime. A small
 quantity of strontium brings forward the residual glow of GB, whilst
 in large quantities strontium keeps the phosphorescence of GB back
to the last.
    Gq.—An earth phosphorescing with a green colour, and showing in
 the spectroscope a green line having a wave-length of 564. This is
 one of the least de<U+FB01>nite of all the supposed new bodies.       It appears
to be a constituent of samarium, occurring in the fractionation of
yttrium among the most basic constituents connecting yttrium and
 samarium. Its point of maximum intensity is, chemically, very well
marked, and is at a different part of the fractionation scheme to those
of the other lines of samarium, especially G6. On dilution with lime
the phosphorescent line of Gq vanishes before that of Ge.
    G8.-—An earth phosphorescing with a citron-coloured light, and
showing in the spectroscope a citron line having a wave-length of 5745.
 G8 is one of the least basic of all the bodies associated in yttrium,
occurring almost at one extremity of the fractionation.          It is not
very di<U+FB01>icult to separate chemically G6 from all the other accompany
ing bodies except the one which     I have called Ga giving the deep
blue line). Not only can G6 be obtained free from the other four con
stituents of yttrium, but the body called by M. de Marignac Ya is a
proof that the other four components of yttrium can be obtained quite
free from G6. Lime intensi<U+FB01>es the phosphorescence            of G5, and
deadens that of GB, while strontium has the opposite action.            The

    Ge.—-A11 earth phosphorescing with a yellow colour, and, in the

 superposed on a hazy double band.            As I have already pointed out,
 Gczfractionates out high up among the most basic earths, and gener

 lanthanum the line Ge is seen quite free from the lines of other
 bodies.
    G§.—An earth phosphorescing with              a red light,      showing in the
 spectroscope   a red line of wave-length       619.   This body is always more
plentiful in yttrium obtained from samarskite and cerite than from
gadolinite, hielmite, and euxenite, and is almost absent in yttrium from
xenotime. G§ is of about intermediate basicity. Working with
samarskite yttria, G§ becomes most brilliant after the line of Gr,
has completely disappeared.          Further fractionation causes the line
of G§ to fade out, and the citron and blue lines are then left.
    The phosphorescence        of G§ is developed to a different extent
according to the metal with which the yttria is mixed. The order
 (beginning with the substance having the greatest action) is zirco
nium, tin, aluminium, bismuth, glucinum.

in the spectroscope a red line having a wave-length of 647.                 Like its
fellow red constituent, G1] occurs most plentifully in samarskite
yttrium, and scarcely at all in yttrium from hielmite, euxenite, and
cerite. It is the <U+FB01>rst of the strictly yttrium constituents to separate
out, on fractionation, at the most basic extremity, leaving Gan, GB, G5,
and GQ‘.     In almost all samples of yttria, except when very highly
puri<U+FB01>ed, G1; is seen very brilliantly, and by its side can be detected the
faint red band of samarium. In the phosphoroscope the line of G1, is
the last to appear when yttria alone is being observed; strontia and
baryta enhance       the residual glow of GI), strontia in moderate
quantities bringing it out before that of GB, while baryta brings it out
after GB.

very sharp orange line of wave-length 609.                   I  have already* dis

is not present   in the   rare  earths  from    gadolinite, xenotime, monazite,
hielmite, euxenite, and arrhenite; it is present in small quantity in

sharp orange line is not strong enough to be seen in the phosphoro
scOpe.     A little calcium entirely suppresses the orange line, while
samarium or yttrium seems to intensify it.
    In addition to the above earths, it is not improbable that the sharp
green line (l/k2 325) mentioned under the heading “Yttrium”
may be caused by still another earth.
    The brilliant and characteristic spark spectra yielded when certain
elements are volatilised and rendered incandescent by the spark from
a powerful induction coil are relied on by chemists as an indisputable
proof of the identity of such elements.       Bearing this in mind  I have
endeavoured to ascertain how these yttrium constituents would behave
in respect to the spark spectrum. Do the de<U+FB01>nite system of lines in
the old yttrium spark spectrum belong to one constituent only, or are
the yttrium lines broken up and distributed among the di<U+FB01>erent
bodies   I have designated as Ga, GB, &c. ? Also do the other con
stituents possess special spark spectra of their own P Very careful
and long-continued experiments have shown me that neither of these
hypothetical cases occur.
    The spark spectrum given by old yttrium is shown in the drawing
(<U+FB01>g. 5).     It is chie<U+FB02>y characterised by two very strong groups of
 lines in the red and orange.    I now take the earth G6. This occurs
 near one end of the fractioning, and not only di<U+FB01>ers from the parent
yttrium in its phosphorescent spectrum, but by virtue of the process
 adopted for its isolation it must likewise differ in its chemical pro
 perties. On examining its spark spectrum            I  see absolutely no
difference between this spectrum and the one given by old yttrium,
    I now pass to the other end of the fractionation of yttrium, where
occurs a concentration of a body givinggt totally different phospho
rescent spectrum to the one at the <U+FB01>rst end. And it also differs
chemically from old yttrium, and in a more marked manner from its
brother, G8, at the other extremity of the fractionation.      Here again
its spark spectrum is perfectly     identical  both with  old yttrium and
with G5, and however closely I examine these three spectra in my
laboratory, the whole system of lines is still identical.

    Respecting the theoretical considerations involved in these results,
 I  see two p0ssible explanations of the facts brought forward.        Ac
 cording to one hypothesis, research has somewhat enlarged the <U+FB01>eld
lying between the indications given by ordinary coarse chemistry
 and the searching scrutiny of the prism. Our notions of a chemical
 element have expanded.      Hitherto the molecule has been regarded
 as an aggregate of two or more atoms, and no account has been taken
 of the architectural design on which these atoms have been joined.
 We may consider that the structure of a chemical element is more
complicated than has hitherto been supposed.       Between the molecules
we are accustomed to deal with in chemical reactions and the
 ultimate atoms, come smaller molecules or aggregates of physical
atoms; these sub-molecules di<U+FB01>'er one from the other, according to
the position they occupied in the yttrium edi<U+FB01>ce.
    An alternative theory commends itself to chemists, to the effect
that the various bodies discussed above are new chemical elements
di<U+FB01>ering from yttrium and samarium in basic powers and several
other chemical and physical properties, but not suf<U+FB01>ciently to enable us
to e<U+FB01>ect any but a slight separation.      One of these bodies, G8, gives
the phosphorescent citron line, and also the brilliant electric spectrum.
The other seven do not give electric spectra which can be recognised
in the presence of a small quantity of G5, whilst the electric spectrum
of G8 is so sensitive that it shines out in undiminished brilliancy
even when the quantity present is extremely minute.         In the process
of fractionation, Ga, G/i, G5, &c., are spread out and more or less
separated from one another, yet the separation is imperfect at the
best, and at any part there is enough G5 to reveal its presence by
the sensitive electric spark test.    The arguments in favour of each
theory are strong and pretty evenly balanced.        The compound mole
cule explanation is a good working hypothesis, which I think may
account for the facts, while it does not postulate the rather heroic
alternative of calling into existence eight or nine new elements to
explain the phenomena.      However,   I  submit it only as an hypothesis.
If further research shows the new element theory is more reasonable,
I  shall be the <U+FB01>rst person to accept it.
    Neither of these theories agrees with that of M. Lecoq de Bois
baudran, who also has worked on these earths for some time.            He
considers that what I have called yttrium is a true element, giving
a characteristic spark spmtrum, but not giving a phosphorescent
spectrum in vacuo. The bodies giving the phosphorescent spectra he
considers to be impurities in yttrium.        These he says are two in
number, and he has provisionally named them Z1 and Z3, By a,
method of his own, diifering from mine, M. de Boishaudran obtains
<U+FB02>uorescent spectra of these bodies; but their <U+FB02>uorescent bands are
extremely hazy and faint, rendering identi<U+FB01>cation dif<U+FB01>cult.          Some

of them fall near lines in the spectra of my G3 and G6. At <U+FB01>rst
sight it might appear that his and my spectra were due to the
same bodies, but according to M. de Boisbaudran, the chemical pro
perties of the earths producing them are widely distinct.                   These
giving phosphorescent lines by my method occur at the yttrium
extremity of the fractionation, where his <U+FB02>uorescent bands are scarcely
shown at all; whilst his <U+FB02>uorescent phenomena are at their maxi
mum quite at the terbium end of the fractionation, where no yttrium
can be detected even by the direct spark, and where my phospho
rescent lines are almost absent.

1.   “Problems in Mechanism regarding Trains of Pulleys and
         Drums of Least Weight for a given Velocity Ratio.”                         By
         HENRY HENNESSY, F.R.S., Professor of Applied Mathe
         matics and Mechanism in the Royal College of Science,
         Dublin. Received February 7, 1887.
    Eighty years     have elapsed since Dr. Thomas Young“ published a
theorem which has since found a place in most of the scienti<U+FB01>c
treatises on mechanism.         This theorem states that in order to obtain a
given value or velocity ratio by a. train of toothed. wheels and pinions
of which all the pairs are equal, the ratio of the number of teeth in
each wheel to the number in each pinion should be as 359 to 100,
when the total number of teeth in the train is the least possible.                 The
late Professor Willis has remarked that the rule deduced from this
theorem seemed not to have much practical utility, but he illustrates
 his remarks by referring to the trains of wheels and pinions em
ployed in clockwork.          As trains of wheels, pulleys, and drums, are
largely employed in many machines whose arrangements greatly differ
from clockwork, and especially in the processes of textile manu
facture, it may be interesting to examine whether there are not other
 conditions, besides the number of teeth, which may be economised in
the transformation of a movement of rotation from a moderate rate
of velocity to a very high rate of velocity.1'             As the number of teeth
 on a wheel or pinion is proportional to the circumference of the pitch
   *   ‘
         Natural Philosophy,’ vol. 2, p. 56.   4to.  1807.  The preface to this volume
is dated March, 1807.
   1' In some spinning machines it is said that the spindles rotate with velocities
of from 6000 to 7000 turns per minute, and high velocities are also often required
for reels, bobbins, and <U+FB02>iers. Between these rapidly rotating parts of the machines
and the prime mover, trains of pulleys, drums, 01' wheels are usually interposed, the
value of each such train depending on the required increase of velocity.—[Feb. 21,

1887.]             Mechanism regarding Trains                               of Pulleys,              (fro.            135
circle, it may be understood as giving a rule for deducing the ratio of
the diameters of the wheels and pinions so that the sum of all their
circumferences shall be a minimum.       Although economy of the cir
cumferences of wheels, speed pulleys or drums in a train may not be
of much importance, is it not possible that economy of total weight
of material employed may be worthy of inquiry ? Reduction of weight
in the parts of a machine is not merely economy of materials em
ployed in the structure, but in the case of moving parts it involves
economy of work by lessening the resistances due to friction.      The
following problems have arisen from such considerations, and in all of
them, as well as in that studied by Young, if we call m the number of
similar pairs of wheels, speed pulleys or drums, C the circumference
of a large wheel, &c., and c of a small one in the same train, the
velocity ratio or value of the train u will be—
                                 u   = (C/c     ’"   = (R/r           m     =     am,
where :2: represents the ratio of the radii R and 'r of a large and a
small wheel or pulley.   In all such problems we have therefore
                                                \
                                          m   = log u/log             re,
and Whether the question relates to the volume or circumference of
the wheels or pulleys the usual operations of the calculus will in
every case lead to a minimum.
   The volumes or circumferences of pairs of pulleys or wheels with
radii having the ratio m may in general be expressed in the form
Fa: = a+bm+cw2, where a, b, and c are constants.    On multiplying

large and small cylinders may be denoted by 1rbR2 and 1rb13, where

this equation is   approximately satis<U+FB01>ed by making a: = 1'895. Hence
the ratio of the   radii may be practically set down as 19 to 10 for a
train of pulleys   of minimum volume or least weight of material.
   In drums the    surface carrying the band is broad, and this surface is
commonly supported by spokes which radiate from the axle, while
sometimes, as in pulleys, the drum consists of a disk with a broad
hoop.    If the thickness of the hoop and its disk are equal, a problem
similar to the foregoing can be easily solved.      The question is, in a
series of large and small drums if all the large are equal and also all
the small, required the ratio of their diameters so that the entire
train shall have the least volume for a given velocity ratio.        Let t
be the uniform thickness of the disks and hoops of the drums, R and
1' the radii of a small and a large disk, b the breadth of the hoops ; we
shall have for the total volume of the train

has been indicated.
   Although it is manifest that the volume of a single pair of pulleys
with the same velocity ratio as this train of <U+FB01>ve pairs would be con
siderably greater, it may be interesting to make the comparison. If
R' be the radius of the large pulley in the single pair, and as before
r of the small pulley, then R' = ur, and the volume of the pair

    In order to illustrate the foregoing problems a model of a train of
 pulleys and another of a train of drums made of brass were con
structed by Mr. Yates. In the train of pulleys all the large ones are
1'9 inches in diameter, and all the small are 1 inch. Each of the former
weighs 2'61 oz., and each of the latter 1'058 02.; as there are <U+FB01>ve
pairs their total weight is 18340 oz., while they give a velocity ratio
of (1'9)5 = 24‘761, or a little more than 24-}.
    The train of drums consists of large ones with diameters of 2'55
inches and small of 1 inch, the hoops are in all 0'5 inch in breadth,
and the spokes are half the volume of a complete disk.         The weights
of the large drums are each 3386 oz., of the small 0'811 oz.
    There are four pairs of drums, and their total weight is 16783 oz.,
or little more than 1 lb.
    The velocity ratio of this train is (51/20)“I = 422825, or a little more
than 42}.
II. "On      the Relation between Tropical and Extra-Tropical
       Cyclones.” By Hon. RALPH ABEROROMBY, F.R. Met. Soc.
       Communicated by R. H. SCOTT, M.A., F.R.S.                  Received
       February   7,  1887.
                                  (Abstract)
    The conclusions as to the relation of tropical to extra-tropical
cyclones which the author has derived from the researches of which
this paper gives an account, may be stated thus :—
   All cyclones have a tendency to assume an oval form; the longer
diameter maylie in any direction, but has a decided tendency to range
itself nearly in a line with the direction of propagation.
    The centre of the cyclone is almost invariably pressed toward one or
other end of the longer diameter, but the displacement may vary
during the course of the same depression.
    Tropical hurricanes are usually of much smaller dimensions than
extra-tropical cyclones; but the central depression is much steeper,
and more pronounced in the former than in the latter.
   Tropical cyclones have less tendency to split into two, or to develope
secondaries, than those in higher latitudes.
   A typhoon which has come from the tropics can combine with a

1887.]               Tropical and Extra-Tropical      Cyclones.              139
 cyclone that has been formed outside the tropics, and form a single new,
and perhaps more intense, depression.
   No cyclone is an isolated phenomenon; it is always related to the
general distribution of pressure in the latitudes where it is generated.
   An area of excessive pressure, with unusually <U+FB01>ne weather, precedes
most cyclones.      Though the nature and origin of this high barometer
is very obscure, the general character of the formation, and the
 weather associated with     it, appear to be the same everywhere.
   In all latitudes a cyclone which has been generated at sea appears
to have a reluctance to traverse a land area, and usually breaks up
when  it  crosses    coast line.
                     a
   After the passage of cyclone in any part of the world, there
                            a                                                isa
remarkable tendency for another to follow very soon, almost along the
same track.
   The velocity of propagation of tropical cyclones            isalways small;
and the average greatly less than that of European depressions.
   There   ismuch less difference in the temperature and humidity before
and after a tropical cyclone than in higher latitudes. The quality of
the heat in front      always distressing in every part of the world.
                      is
   The wind rotates counter-clockwise round every cyclone in the
 Northern Hemisphere, and everywhere as an ingoing spiral. The
 amount of incurvature for the same quadrant may vary during the
 course of the same cyclone; but in most tropical hurricanes the
incurvature      least in front, and greatest in rear; whereas in England
                is
the greatest incurvature        isusually found in the right front.       Some
observers think     that    broadly speaking    the  incurvature   of the wind
decreases as we recede from the Equator.
   The velocity of the wind always increases as we approach the centre
in a tropical cyclone; whereas in higher latitudes the strongest winds
and steepest gradients are often some way from the centre. In this
peculiarity tropical cyclones approximate more to the type of                     a
tornado  ;  but the author does not think that a cyclone                 only a
                                                                        is
highly developed whirlwind, as there are no transitional forms of
rotating air.
   The general circulation of       cyclone, as shown
                                     a                    by the motion of the
clouds, appears to be the same everywhere.
   All over the world, unusual coloration of the sky at sunrise and
sunset   isobserved, not only before the barometer has begun to fall at
any place, but before the existence of any depression can be traced
in the neighbourhood.
   Cirrus appears all round the cloud area of tropical cyclone, instead
                                                  a
of only round the front semicircle, as in higher latitudes.         The stripes
of cirrus appear to     lie  more  radially  from   the  centre in  the tropics,
than tangentially, as indicated          by
                                          the researches of Ley and Hilde
brandsson in England and Sweden respectively.
                                                                    '

140             On Tropical and  Extra-Tropical Cyclones.      [Feb   24,
    The general character of the cloud all round the centre is more
uniform in than out of the tropics; but still the clouds in rear are
always a little harder than those in front.
    Everywhere the rain of a cyclone extends farther in front than in
rear. Cyclone rain has a speci<U+FB01>c character, quite different from that
of showers or thunderstorms; and this character is more pronounced
in tropical than in extra-tropical cyclones.
    Thunder or lightning is rarely observed in the heart of any
cyclone, and the absence of electrical discharge is a very bad sign of
the weather.     Thunderstorms are, however, abundantly developed on
the outskirts of tropical hurricanes.
    Squalls are one of the most characteristic features of a tropical
cyclone, where they surround the centre on all sides; whereas in
 Great Britain, squalls are almost exclusively formed along that portion
of the line of the trough which is south of the centre, and in the
right rear of the depression.    As, however, we <U+FB01>nd that the front of
a British cyclone tends to form squalls when the intensity is very
great, the inference seems justi<U+FB01>able that this feature of tropical
hurricanes is simply due to their exceptional intensity.
    A patch of blue sky, commonly known as the “ bull’s-eye,” is
almost universal in the tropics, and apparently unknown in higher
latitudes.    The author’s researches show that in middle latitudes the
formation     of a “bull’s-eye" does not take place when the motion of
translation is rapid; but as this blue space is not observed in British
 cyclones when they are moving slowly, it would appear that a certain
 intensity of rotation is necessary to develope this phenomenon.
    The trough phenomena,——such as a. squall, a sudden shift of wind,
and change of cloud character and temperature, just as the barometer
turns to rise, even far from the centre—which are such a prominent
feature in British cyclones, have not been even noticed by many meteor
 ologists in the tropics. The author, however, shows that there are
 slight indications of these phenomena everywhere ; and he has collated
 their existence and intensity with the velocity of propagation of the
whole mass of the cyclone.
    Every cyclone has a double symmetry. One set of phenomena,
such as the oval shape, the general rotation of the wind, the cloud
ring, rain area, and central blue space, are more ' or less related to a
central point.
    Another set, such as temperature, humidity, the general character
of the clouds, certain shifts of wind, and a particular line of squalls,
are more or less related to the front and rear of the line of the trough
of a cyclone.                          I
    The author’s researches show that the <U+FB01>rst set are strongly marked
in the tropics, where the circulating energy of the air is great, and
the velocity of propagation small ; while the second set are most

 prominent in extra-tropical cyclones, where the rotational energy is
moderate, and the translational velocity great.              .
    The <U+FB01>rst set of characteristics may conveniently be classed together
as the rotational; the second set as the translational phenomena of a
cyclone.
    Tropical and extra-tropical cyclones    are identical in general cha
racter, but differ in certain details,     due  to latitude, surrounding
 pressure, and to the relative intensity of rotation or translation.
 III. “A    Thermal Telephone Transmitter.”           By Prof. GEORGE
     FORBES.      Communicated by LORD RAYLEIGH, D.O.L., Sec.
     R.S. Received February 12, 1887.
   We have had      so much evidence of the sensitivcness of the Bell
telephone receiver to the minutest changes of current, that we
have ceased to be surprised at any transmitter which responds to
the sounds of articulate speech.      But, in the instrument now shown,
it was so extremely unlikely that sensible variations of current
could be produced with suf<U+FB01>cient rapidity, that even now there is
perhaps some interest attached to the experiment.              A wooden
cylinder was used closed at one end. A saw cut was made across
the diameter of the closed end, making a <U+FB01>ne slit. In the slit
 was stretched a platinum wire, O'OOI inch diameter and 2 inches
long, with its ends connected by copper wires through the primary
of an induction coil to a battery su<U+FB02>iciently powerful to make the
platinum wire red hot. On connecting the secondary circuit with
a receiving telephone in a distant room and speaking into the
wooden cylinder, the words are reproduced and heard in the tele
phone.     Each vibration of air in the slit cools the platinum wire,
diminishing its electrical resistance, and increasing the electric
current.     The words transmitted are not quite perfect, the higher
harmonics being wanting. It requires some attention to make out
all the words of a sentence. A brass cylinder instead of the wooden
one, and a Wollaston platinum wire of excessive <U+FB01>neness have been
used without materially altering the clearness of the articulation.
Platinum foil has hitherto given no sound of the voice. The slit in
the brass instrument is made of glass to prevent the short-circuiting
and destruction of the platinum wire.
   Wires from one to three inches in length have been used. The
longest ones are best. No distinct articulation is heard if the wire
be not red hot. The hotter the wire the better is the articulation.
An adjustible slit was tried and the narrow slit gave the best
results.    Mr. Preece some years ago used the expansion and con
                                                                          '

as a receiver.    The articulation seems to have been about the same
in quality as when the new transmitter is used with a Bell receiver.
These new experiments bear out all that Mr. Preece said about the
rapidity of variation of temperature which can be produced in a <U+FB01>ne
platinum wire. They may also be perhaps of some interest from other
points of view; but they are not likely to lead to any results of
practical importance. It is probable from the theory of the instru
ment that the tones are raised an octave, as is also the casein the
Preece receiver.

1.   “Preliminary Note on a Balanoglossus Larva from the
        Bahamas.”        By W. F. R. WELDON, M.A., Fellow of
        St. John’s College, Cambridge.                 Communicated by Prof.
        M. FOSTER, Sec. R.S.          Received February           15, 1887.
    In October last, during        a visit   to the Island      of Bemini, on the
western edge of the Bahama bank, an organism was constantly found
in the tow-net which closely resembled the larva of Balanoglossus
recently described by Bateson.‘
    In the youngest stage observed, this creature has an elongated
cylindrical body (about 0'8 mm. long by 0'4. mm. bread) with rounded
ends.      At the anterior extremity are two eye-spots, while near the
posterior is a large and powerful ring of cilia.              An anterior region is
separated     from  the  rest  by  a deep    transverse    groove; more than this
cannot be made out by examination of entire specimensf                        A little
later, a second shallower groove appears behind the <U+FB01>rst, marking off
a smaller middle region of the body from the larger anterior and
posterior divisions. An idea of the shape of the body, just before the
appearance       of the second transverse groove, may be gathered from
the nearly median longitudinal section (<U+FB01>g. 1). In this section the
mouth is seen to lie in the <U+FB01>rst transverse groove, on the ventral side
of the body ; it leads to a well-developed alimentary canal, ending in a
median posterior anus, not seen in the <U+FB01>gure. On each side of the
alimentary canal lie two sections of body cavity; the <U+FB01>rst (<U+FB01>g. 1, II)
can hardly be spoken of as a cavity, its lumen being never con
spicuous, and often obliterated ; behind this is a well-developed pos
terior cavity (III). The body cavities of the two sides are separated

   1- I regret that my observations on the living larva are most imperfect.   Owing to
my want of experience in protecting delicate organisms, after capture, from a tropical
sun,  I  was frequently obliged to preserve the material obtained in an open boat,
where microscopic work was impossible.

 148                  Mr. \V. F. R. Weldon.       On a            [Main 3,
 groove is occupied by a single unpaired body cavity (<U+FB01>g. 1, I), which
  obliterates the blastocoel.   This cavity is traversed by a number of
                 “                  " muscles
  longitudinal     mesenchymatous               (Mc.), and carries on its
  <U+FB02>oor a glandular organ (01.), near which opens, asymmetrically, a
  short canal, which runs to the middle dorsal line, where it communi
 cates with the exterior by a pore          Immediately beneath the gland
  is a forwardly directed diverticulum of the gut (Ch).
     It seems impossible to avoid identifying these structures with the
                                                                    “ noto
  proboscis gland and pore of Balanoglossus, and the subjacent
  chord ”; while the anterior paired body cavity represents the collar
 cavity, the posterior the trunk cavity, of the normal“ Balanoglossus
 larva.     A con<U+FB01>rmation of this view is given by the appearance, at a
 slightly later date, of a single pair of rudimentary gills (<U+FB01>g. 2, Br.).
    ~The ectoderm of the larva, up to the point at which the gills appear,
 isv very thick (<U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2), and contains many mucus and other
 glandular cells; while beneath the eye-spots is a well-developed
 “
    Scheitelplatte,” and beneath the general ectoderm a well-formed
  embryonic nervous system, the details of which I reserve for a later
paper.
     Just after the development of the gill-slits, there appears to be
much variation in the conduct of the larva: obtained; some exhibit
indications of a normal development; the majority, however, begin
from this point to undergo a gradual process of degeneration, accom
panied by considerable increase in size.
    The shape of the most degenerate larva obtained may be gathered
from the nearly median longitudinal section (<U+FB01>g. 3) ; where the collar

groove is seen to have disappeared altogether, while that behind the
proboscis has become much shallower.                    The external appearance is
complicated by the formation, on each side of the proboscis, of a
m-shaped groove, the middle limb of which communicates with the
post-proboscidean groove, while the margins of all the limbs are pro
vided with short, broad tentacles.             The arrangement of this groove is
indicated by     the  shading    between     dotted   lines in <U+FB01>g. 3.
    Sections show that the mesoblastic organs have undergone cou
siderable reduction, both relative and, in some cases, absolute.                  The
proboscis cavity is smaller (<U+FB01>g. 3, 1); its walls are thinner, and its
muscles fewer.          The notochord beneath it has quite disappeared;
the collar cavities have disappeared; while the trunk cavities are
small and thin-walled (<U+FB01>g. 3, III). No trace of gill-pouches remains.
 The ectoderm is much thinner, and contains hardly a trace of any
nervous structure except the much diminished “ Scheitelplatte”
(Sch), on which the eye-spots still persist.
    In connexion with this degeneration, of the tissues, it may be
 noticed that many cells, possibly phagocytes, are present in the
 blastocoel at earlier stages (<U+FB01>g 2, Ph. ?).
    I was not able during my stay at Bemini to follow this creature
 further; but at Nassau, New Providence, in the middle of the Bahama
 bank,   I observed, during four months, a similar series of changes in a
 much larger larva.         This larva was <U+FB01>rst obtained at a period just
 before the development of the tentacular apparatus, and after the
 disappearance of the collar groove (if this ever existed).                  The collar
 and trunk cavities were both well developed, and the proboscis cavity,
 with its gland and pore, was as in the youngest Bemini forms. Eye
 spots were present, and there was a well-developed cutaneous nerve
 plexus.     In this form degradation was followed to a much fuller
 extent, till the ectoderm was (except on the well-developed tentacles
 and beneath the cilia) a mere <U+FB02>attened epithelium; the trunk cavity
 was a minute solid rod beneath the ciliated ring; the collar cavity
 disappeared, and the reduction of the proboscis cavity was carried
 much further than in the Bemini form.                                     .
    I  hope   to   publish   a  fuller   account   of   both forms   in  a subsequent
 paper. In the meantime, it is submitted that there is fair ground for
the belief that the organisms described are Balanoglossus larvae,
 which from some cause or other have been unable to develop adult
 characters, and have therefore varied.               Independent evidence shows        ,
that   a  probable     cause   may   be   the   compulsory shifting of the larvaa
 into deep water by the joint action of currents and winds<U+FB01>‘                         .

    In previous communications to the Royal Society by one of the

 presence of micro-organisms in the atmosphere.                          In these investiga

 facilitated their enumeration, but also presented them in an isolated
 condition.        In this manner the authors have met with a number of

 di<U+FB01>erent varieties of aerial micro-organisms, which have hitherto
remained either unknown or undescribed.                    They have therefore
undertaken the characterisation of a number of these organisms by
growing them in various cultivating media and observing the different
appearances      which they subsequently exhibit, by studying them
microscopically in stained and unstained preparations, and by culti
vating them on gelatine-plates, and describing the colonies to which
they give rise.      They have likewise made a number of drawings to
illustrate the appearances which they present under the various exami_
nations to which they have submitted them.                  To further facilitate
their   identi<U+FB01>cation   the  authors  have provisionally given them names,
by which they have endeavoured to represent some of their most
striking individualities.
    The authors venture to hope that by thus characterising some of
the organisms most prevalent in the atmosphere, they may prove of
assistance in those investigations which have for their object the
study of the particular physiological changes which are brought
about by speci<U+FB01>c micro-organisms.
    The following is a list of the micro-organisms described :—

  III.   “On the Limiting Distance of Speech by Telephone.” By
         WILLIAM HENRY PREECE, F.R.S. Received February 17,
         1887.
      The law that determines the distance to which speaking by tele
  phone on land lines is possible, is just the same as that which de
  termines the number of currents which can be transmitted through
  a submarine cable in a second.          The experimental evidence upon
  which this law is based was carried out in 1853 by Mr. Latimer
  Clark (whose assistant I then was). The experiments were made by
  me in the presence of Faraday; many were his own; he made them
  the subject of a Friday evening discourse at the Royal Institution,
                                                                    ’
  January 20, 1854, and they are published in his ‘ Researches (vol. 3,
  p. 508). They received full mathematical development by Sir William
  Thomson in 1855 (‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ May 24), who determined
- the law, the accuracy of which was proved by Fleeming Jenkin and
  by Cromwell Varley, and the 110,000 miles of cable that now lie
  at the bottom of the ocean a<U+FB01>ord a constant proof in their daily
  working.
       Hockin  reduced   Thomson’s law to the following series :—
             z = 0(1—2{(%)”“—(%)“’"+(§)°”“—(%)‘°”“+&c-}),
   which allows it to be expressed by the following curve (1) :—

       Now a is a time-cdnstant dependent on the conditions of the circuit,
   invariable for the same uniform circuit but di<U+FB01>ering for di<U+FB01>erent
   circuits.    It represents the time that elapses from the instant contact
   is made at the sending end to the instant that the current begins to
   appear at the receiving end.       It is given by the following equa
  tion :—

inductive capacity per unit length (mile or knot); r the resistance
per unit length, and l the length in miles or knots.
   a, therefore, limits the number of vibrations per second that can be
sent through any circuit.              If a be 0196 second, as it was in the
French Atlantic cable of 1869;“ 2584 knots long, then it is impos
sible to send 5‘1 currents per second through that cable; but it would
be possible to send 5 or 2% complete reversals per second.                     Moreover,
as the number of reversals varies inversely with the square of the
length, it shows that such a cable if of 100 miles length would
allow 1562 reversals to pass through it. It is necessary to remark
that these expressions involve no mention of E.M.F., or of current,
and therefore the number of reversals which can be produced at the
end of a wire is quite independent of the impressed E.M.F., and
therefore of the strength of the current. But the number of reversals
is dependent upon the sensitiveness of the apparatus used to receive
the currents, for if we use an instrument which will respond to a cur
rent indicated by the full line, we get two currents per second ; and if
we use an instrument which will respond only to the dotted line, we
get only one current in two seconds, which is about the current used
with delicate relays in this country. This is why such discordant
results are obtained by diiferent observers who attempt to measure the
velocity of currents of electricity.               It is also why the telephone is
such an admirable instrument for research—for it is sensitive to the
least increment or decrement of current.
   Before proceeding with this inquiry it was necessary to determine
very accurately the inductive capacity of overhead and underground
wires.    This was done with great care on very dry days in di<U+FB01>erent
parts of the country by means of a Thomson mirror galvanometer
and a standard condenser.
   The results come out as follows :—

   It then became necessary to determine the speed of the current
through wires of different lengths, resistances, and capacities.
   A multiplex distributor—such as we are now using in the Post
Of<U+FB01>ce—enables this to be done with great accuracy. At each station
a circle     broken up into 162 sections, and an arm in connexion with
               is
the line wire carrying     brush sweeps over these sections and makes
                             a
contact. This arm can be made to rotate at any speed.          If makes       it
three revolutions per second      will make the duration of each contact
                                    it
Thth    of a  second.   Now  the  two  distributors are kept running in
absolute synchronism, so that the brush at each station always rests
simultaneously on corresponding sections.       The sections at one station
can be placed in contact with the battery, and those at the other
station with a galvanometer or other sensitive apparatus. If the cur
rent traversed the wire instantaneously then         would appear on the

same section at the same time on the galvanometer; but the current
is always retarded, and the amount of retardation or the value of a can
be measured and the curve of arrival and cessation drawn by watching
the indications of the galvanometer on each succeeding section.
   The following table summarises          large number of experiments
                                              a
that have been made in diiferent parts of the country, and on different
lines, to determine by observation the connexion that exists between
speed of current, distance spoken through, resistance, and capacity.
The maximum current, or the crest of the wave, was observed.           This
was equivalent to 0003 ampere.
   It will be seen that the limiting distance through which                            it   is
possible to speak varies inversely with the speed of the current, and
that the speed of the current varies inversely with the product of the
total resistance and the total capacity of the circuit.         Hence we
can say that the number of reversals that                possible to send

   Take copper, whose constant is 15,000, and a wire whose resistance
is  1‘" per mile, and capacity 00124! per mile, then——

which is the limit of speaking upon such          a wire.
   The wire used between Paris and Brussels has a resistance of
2'4, ohms and a capacity'of about 0012 microfarad per kilometre, and
as that distance is only about 200 miles the speaking must be excellent.
Moreover, there is reason to believe, from the di<U+FB01>erence between
observation and calculation, that the static capacity on Continental
and American lines is less than that _of English lines, owing to the
use of earth wires on all poles in England, and therefore the distance
would be greater.
    Take an Atlantic cable—

                                w    =   96.
Now     I had found in 1878* that it was just possible to speak through
100 miles of such a cable—a very close agreement.
    Moreover, by the law of the squares, 100 miles of an Atlantic cable
ought to transmit 1562 reversals, if 2584! miles transmit 215, and
this is probably the average number of sonorous vibrations imparted
by the human voice, when hearing by telephone begins to get dif<U+FB01>cult
by the loss of the higher partials and overtones.
   There is another interesting consequence of Thomson’s law which
comes out of these experiments, and that is, whether the line he a
single wire completed by the earth, or a double wire making a

same, and therefore the distance we can speak through is just the
same whether we use a single or double wire circuit.            This is owing
to the fact that though in the latter case we double the total resis
tance, we halve the total capacity, and therefore the product remains
the same.
   The difference between copper and iron is clearly due to self
induction, or to the electromagnetic inertia of the latter, and the
difference between copper overground and copper underground is due
to the facility that the leakage of insulators o<U+FB01>ers to the rapid dis
charge to earth at innumerable points, of the static charge, which in
gutta-percha-covered wire can <U+FB01>nd an exit only at the ends.
   It is also evident that there is no di<U+FB01>iculty in working telephones
through underground wires, even though they attain 50 miles in
length, and in fact it would be better to work underground with
proper copper wire from London to Brighton, than to use iron wires
along the railway telegraph poles, owing to the absence of external
disturbances in the former case.
   The limit of working of diiferent insulated wires is easily obtained
by equation (2), and the following table gives that information for

IV. “The Etiology of Scarlet Fever.”                    By E. KLEIN, M.D.,
       F.R.S., Lecturer on General Anatomy and Physiology at
      the Medical School of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London.
      Received February 23,         1887.
   The investigation, the results of which         I    new record, was com
menced at the end of December, 1885.        It arose out of an inquiry into
the prevalence of scarlatina in di<U+FB02>ferent quarters of London, under

1887.]                The Etiology  of Scarlet Fever.               159
taken by the Medical Department of the Local Government Board as
a part of its business of investigating local epidemics. That inquiry
had demonstrated milk from a farm at Hendon as the cause of the
scarlatina, and had adduced strong circumstantial evidence that the
scarlatina had been distributed, not in the whole, but in certain sec
tions of the Hendon milk, and further that the ability of the sections
of milk service to convey the disease had been related to a malady
affecting particular cows.     This evidence against particular cows at
the Hendon farm could not and did not aspire at furnishing direct
and de<U+FB01>nite proof of the connexion of this cow disease with scarlet
fever of man, for the inductive methods usually employed by the
Medical Department of the Local Government Board when applied
to inquiries about epidemic spread of scarlatina can for obvious
reasons yield but circumstantial evidence.        As on various former
occasions, so also on this, the Medical Department sought to put the
above conclusions to the test of scienti<U+FB01>c experiment. This task was
delegated to me by the Board.       The <U+FB01>rst part of this work has been
published   in the recently issued volume  of the Reports of the Medical
Of<U+FB01>cer of the Local Government Board for 1885—1886.              I have
therein shown that the suspected cows from the Hendon farm that
had been made the object of special study, showed besides a skin
disease—consisting in ulcers on the udder and teats, and in sores and
scurfy patches and loss of hair in di<U+FB01>erent parts of the skin—also a
general disease of the viscera, notably the lungs, liver, spleen, and
kidney, which resembled the disease of these organs in acute cases of
human soarlatina.     I have further shown that the diseased tissues of
the ulcers on the teats and udder produced on inoculation into the
skin of calves a similar local disease, which in its incubation and
general anatomical characters proved identical with the ulceration of
the cow; and further, that from the ulcers of the cow a species of
micrococcus was isolated by cultivation in arti<U+FB01>cial nutritive media,
which micro-organism in its mode of growth on nutritive gelatine, on
Agar-Agar mixture, on blood serum, in broth, and in milk, proved
very peculiar and different from other species of micrococci hitherto
                                                         I
examined. With such cultivation of the micrococcus have produced
by subcutaneous inoculation in calves a disease which in its cutaneous
and visceral lesions (lung, liver, spleen, and kidney) bears a very
close resemblance both to the disease that was observed in the Hendon
cows as well as to human scarlatina.
   The second part of the work, carried out during 1886—1887 for the
Medical Department, had for its object to investigate whether or no
the disease, human scarlatina, is associated with the. identical micro
coccus, and whether this, if obtainable from the human subject, is
capable of producing in the bovine species the same disease as was
observed in the Hendon cows and in the calves experimented upon

   160                  The  Etiology of Scarlet Fever.              [Man   3,
  from the latter source. The de<U+FB01>nite and clear proof that this is really
  the case has now been obtained, and the evidence I now bring to the
  notice of the Royal Society.
     On examining acute cases of human scarlatina—for which oppor
  tunity  I owe great thanks to Dr. Sweeting, the Medical Superintendent
  of the Fulham Fever Hospital—I soon ascertained the fact that there
  is present in the blood of the general circulation a species of micro
  coecus, which on cultivation in nutritive gelatine, Agar-Agar mixture,
  blood serum, and other media, proved to be in every respect identical
  with that obtained from the Hendon cows. Out of eleven acute cases
  of scarlet fever examined in this direction, four yielded positive results:
  three were acute cases between the third and sixth day of illness
  with high fever temperature, and the fourth was a case of death from
  scarlatina on the sixth day.     In all these four cases several drops of
  blood were used, after the customary methods and under the required
  precautions for establishing cultivations in a series of tubes con
 taining sterilised nutritive gelatine, and generally only a very small
 number of these tubes revealed after an incubation of several days
 one or two colonies of the micrococcus. This shows that the micro
 cocci were present in the blood in but small numbers.
     Having ascertained the identity in morphological and cultural
 respects of the micrococcus of the blood of human scarlatina with the
 organism obtained from the Hendon cows, the action of the cultiva
 tions of both these sets of micrococci was then tested on animals and
 the results compared.       It was found that mice—wild mice better
 than tame ones—011 inoculation as well as feeding, became a<U+FB01>ected
 in exactly the same manner, no matter whether the one set of
 cultivations or the other was used.         The great majority of these
 animals died after between seven and twenty days; the post-mortem
 examination revealed great congestion of the lungs, amounting in
 some cases to consolidation of portions of the organ, congestion of
 the liver, congestion and swelling of the spleen, great congestion and
 general disease of the cortical part of the kidney. From the blood
of these animals, taken directly from the heart, cultivations were
established in nutritive gelatine, and hereby the existence of the
same species of micrococci was revealed; they possessed all those
special characters distinguishing the cultivations of the micrococcus
of the Hendon cows and of the human scarlatina.
    In the third and concluding section of the work, cultivations of the
micrococcus of two cases of human scarlatina were used for infecting
calves; two calves     were inoculated and two were fed from each set
                   .
of cultivations.     All eight animals developed disease, both cutaneous
and visceral, identical to that produced in the calves that had been
last year infected with the micrococcus from the Hendon cows.
    From the heart’s blood of calves thus infected from human

                                                                            v
sessing all the characters shown by the cultures of the micrococcus of
the Hendon cows, and of the cases of human scarlatina.
   It must be evident from these observations that the danger of
scarlatinal infection from the disease in the cow is real, and that
towards the study and careful supervision of this cow disease all
efforts ought to be directed in order to check the spread of scarlet
fever in man.     It is also obvious that in the agricultural interest
alone investigations of this cow disease are greatly called for.

    For practical purposes   these equations are really suf<U+FB01>cient.
   We see <U+FB01>rstly that the transformer transforms the potential in the
ratio n/m, and adds to the external resistance of the secondary
circuit p a resistance (ngR/m2) +r. This at once gives us the varia
tion of potential caused by varying the number of lamps used. The
phase of the secondary current is exactly opposite to that of the
primary.
    In designing a transformer it is particularly necessary to take
note of equation (9), for the assumption is that a is limited so that he
maybe neglected. The greatest value of a is B/{ (21r/T)mA}, and this
must not exceed a chosen value. We observe that B varies as the
 number of reversals of the primary current per unit of time.
   But this <U+FB01>rst approximation, though enough for practical work, gives
no account of what happens when transformers are worked so that
the iron is nearly saturated, or how energy is wasted in the iron core
by the continual reversal of its magnetism. The amount of such
waste is easily estimated from Ewing’s results when the extreme
 value of a is known, but it is more instructive to proceed to a second
approximation, and see how the- magnetic properties of the iron infect
the value and phase of 'a: and y. We shall as a second approximation
.substitute in equations (5) (6) (7) values of a deduced from the
value of a furnished bythe <U+FB01>rst approximation in equation (9).

from this curve in equations (5) and (6), and so obtain the values
of a: and y to a higher degree of approximation.      If the values of a
were expressed by Fourier’s theorem in terms of the time, we should
<U+FB01>nd that the action of the iron core introduced into the expression
for a: and y, in addition to a term in cos (21rt/T) which would occur if
a and a were proportional, terms in sin (21rt/T) and terms in sines
and cosines of multiples of Zrt/T.          It is through the term in
sin (21rt/ T) that the loss of energy by hysteresis comes in.
   A particular case, in which to stay at a <U+FB01>rst approximation would
be very misleading, is worthy of note.      Let an attempt be made to
ascertain the highest possible values of a by using upon a trans-
former a very large primary current, and measuring the consequent
mean square of potential in the secondary circuit by means of an
electrometer, by the heating of a conductor, or other such device.
The value of a will be related to the time somewhat as indicated by
ABCDEFG in <U+FB01>g. 2; for simplicity assume it be as in <U+FB01>g. 3; the

 11.   “Note on the Theory of the Alternate Current Dynamo.”
        By JOHN HOPKINSON, M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S. Received Feb
        ruary    17, 1887.
     According to the accepted theory of the alternate current dynamo,
 the equation of electric current in the armature is rygi-l-Ry = periodic
function of t, where q is a constant coef<U+FB01>cient of self-induction. This
equation is not strictly true, inasmuch as o/ is not in general constant)
but it is a most useful approximation.             My present purpose is to
indicate how the values of <1 and of the periodic function representing
the electromotive force can be calculated in a machine of given con
 <U+FB01>guration.
     To <U+FB01>x ideas, we will suppose the machine considered to have its
magnet cores arranged parallel to'the axis of rotation, that the cores
are of uniform section, also that the armature bobbins have iron cores,
so that we regard all the lines of induction as passing either through
an armature coil, or else between adjacent poles entirely outside the
armature.        The sketch shows a development of the machine con
sidered.       The iron is supposed to be so arranged that the currents

that the line integral of magnetic force within the armature core may
be neglected.
   Let A1 be the e<U+FB01>‘ective'area of the space between the pole piece and
armature core when the cores are in line, 11 the distance from iron to

   Let A; be the section of magnet core, 12 the e<U+FB01>ective length of a
pair of magnet limbs, so that 12 may be regarded as the length of the
lines of force as measured from one pole face to the next.
   Let m be the number of convolutions in a pair of magnet limbs,
and
   n, the convolutions in one armature section,
   T, the periodic time.
   The time is measured from an epoch when the armature coil we
shall consider is in a symmetrical position in a <U+FB01>eld which we shall
regard as positive.

positive direction being that which produces the positive <U+FB01>eld at time
zero.

       Received February                          17, 1887.

  The observations were            by means of the colour photometer
                                                    made
which General Festing and himself introduced last year, and which
they described in the Bakerian Lecture for 1886.         They extended
over more than a year, the object being to ascertain the intensity of
the di'<U+FB01>erent rays in the solar spectrum after passing through various
thicknesses of the atmosphere. Owing to the unpromising results
obtained by Langley with his bolometer experiments,             was not                                            it
anticipated  that  the  variation  in the intensities  of  the different
rays would obey any law, but subsequent investigation showed that
as a rule the intensity of any ray obeyed the law enunciated by Lord
Rayleigh, in that      = Is““"“, Where
                                  I'        and     are the initial and   I                  I’

standard illuminating value of the spectrum was taken from observa
tions made in Switzerland at 8000 feet altitude on September 15 at
noon. The other observations were made at South Kensington.            It
was found that with the wind in the proper quarter the sky at the
latter place was as pure in colour as in the country, and that measures
made on the days on which there was apparently no haze gave results
which when combined together gave a minimum value for 10 of 00013.
A mean of the results showed that k = 00017.
   The author then discusses the value of the area of the curves so
obtained, and shows that astronomers who have used the ordinary
logarithmic formula of I’ = Ia?“c z” have not erred in so doing, but
that these results are perfectly concordant with the results obtained
by taking the different values of absorption over the whole visible
spectrum.    He further shows that with the coef<U+FB01>cients of trans
mission for different wave-lengths which Langley has published, the
above formula is applicable,which is contrary to the theory which
Langley propounded. The author further shows that when using the
part of the spectrum to which various photographic salts are sensitive,
the areas of the curves of intensities also fall in with the logarithmic
formula.
    He also points out that if the value of    in the formula 1’: 16—!“

l/M of 5570 and 4450 respectively. From this he deduces the fact that
the illuminating value of any part of the visible spectrum on any day
at any hour can be ascertained by taking the optical and photographic
values of total sunlight.   This plan not only enables the light which
undergoes general absorption to be calculated, but also the values of
loss of intensity for each ray. He further indicates that         double
                                                                      a

will give similar results.
   Experiments on the photographic methods are described, and the
results agree with those which theory indicated would arise.
   The author states that the high altitudes in the Alps may not be
suitable for observations of wave-lengths in the infra-red; but that
they are especially suitable for observations in the visible part of the
spectrum, since the atmosphere       very often free from dust, though
                                    is
it may not be free from aqueous vapour, and the latter affects the
dark rays vastly more than   it does the visible rays.  He then points
out the probable cause of the presence of particles which scatter light,
and brie<U+FB02>y discusses the diiferences which he obtains in his value for
the transmission     of light, as compared with Bouguer, Seidel,

Pritchard,  and others.    He further shows that observations made by
people who are colour-blind     in the red tend to diminish the value of
the coel<U+FB01>cient of transmission, and that the difference between stellar
and solar light cannot account for the apparent discrepancy. It would
appear that Professor Pritchard's maximum value for the coe<U+FB02>icient
of transmission at Cairo does not differ much from his.
   The values of the di<U+FB01>erent colours in the spectrum which Rood has
adopted from Vierordt’s method are then discussed, and corrected
according to the author’s determination of the values on a day in
June.
   A series of tables close the paper, in which the original observations
and the deduced values are given.

 I. “A Coal-dust Explosion.”         By W. GALLOWAY.        Communi
       cated by R H. SCOTT, M.A., F .R.S. Received February 17,

  '
    The Silkstone pits of Altoft’s Colliery, near Normanton, in York
shire, in which the explosion took place, are 420 yards deep.      Both
shafts are round, the down-cast being 12 feet and the up-cast 10 feet
 in diameter.    The thickness of the working, including a bed of soft
shale below the seam, used as a holing, is 41 feet 6 inches.        The
system of working is longwall.          The number of men and boys
 employed underground in the day shift was about 350. 'The colliery
is now twenty-one years old.
    Very little <U+FB01>re-damp is produced in the workings.     Naked lights
were used by all the workmen for twenty years before February,
 1886, yet during the whole of that period no single workman had
been injured by an explosion of <U+FB01>re-damp, great or small.
    Besides being naturally very free from <U+FB01>re-damp, the workings of
this mine were continuously swept by strong and swift currents of
air, produced by means of two ventilating furnaces at the bottom of
the up-cast shaft, amounting in the aggregate to 147,380 cubic feet
per minute.
    As the roof subsides upon the stowing near the faces, it is neces
sary to take down a certain thickness of it in the stall roadways, in
order to preserve them at a workable height.    For this purpose about
4 feet in thickness of roof was taken down by blasting in each stall
road, the height being thus made about 8 feet 6 inches, at a distance
of 10 or 12 feet back from the face. Each stall road thus required
about one blasting-shot, with a charge of from two to three pounds of
powder to be <U+FB01>red in it about once every <U+FB01>ve or six days, so that
from seven to ten blasting-shots were <U+FB01>red near the faces every day.
In this way the <U+FB02>oor of each roadway became covered with small

pieces of broken roof, which completely obscured any small quantity
of coal or coal-dust that might have fallen upon          it,  and been left
there in the process of coal-getting.
   The tubs consist of rectangular wooden boxes, mounted on
wooden frames, with wheels attached to them.               They were <U+FB01>lled
with coal to a level with the top, and then contained about 10 cwt.
Thus, although no coal could fall over the ends or sides, the vibration
due to the operation of hauling caused coal-dust and small pieces of
coal to be shaken out through the seams in the sides and bottom on
to the roadway beneath.        Here
                                  it    accumulated little by little between
the  rails, and  to a distance  of  a few inches on each side of them, and
 the attrition due to the constant trampling of men and horses,
together with the occasional dragging of the endless chains on the
 <U+FB02>oor, gradually reduced     it  to a state of <U+FB01>neness.     The quantity of
 coal-dust   which  accumulated    on  any roadway was    thus, other things
 being equal, proportional to the number of full tubs that had passed
 along    itfrom the <U+FB01>rst; so that the oldest roadways would naturally
 be the dustiest, were the accumulations not removed from time to
time.                                                                 .
,  Each return air-way represents the continuation of a stall road all
the way from near the bottom of the up-cast shaft to the face, and         it
must therefore contain in any given section of its length about the
same average quantity of coal-dust as any ordinary stall road. But
the return air-ways are all used as travelling roads for the men and
boys going to and from the faces, and the constant trampling of
feet soon mixes up any little coal-dust there may happen to be on the
<U+FB02>oor with the dust of the roof-stu<U+FB01>, and reduces the whole to an
impalpable powder of light grey colour.
                        a
   The following conditions thus prevailed before the explosion :—
   1. An unusual immunity from <U+FB01>re-damp.
   2. Very excellent ventilation.
 ~  3.Blasting going on at the rate of say 2000 shots a year, involving
the consumption of upwards of two tons of powder in the same time,
and this within the zone of subsidence where, practically speaking,
all the <U+FB01>re-damp was given off, and where there was no coal-dust.
    4.Pure air <U+FB01>lling the intake air-ways from the bottom of the
down-cast to the faces.
.
    5.Air containing all the <U+FB01>re-damp in the colliery <U+FB01>lling the
working places and the return air-ways from the faces to the
up-cast.
  6. Coal-dust in the intake air-ways        decreasing rapidly    near the
faces.
    7.Light grey dust of roof-stone, but no visible coal-dust in the
 return air-ways.
   The colliery had been carried on under these conditions for seven

176       Geometrical Construction    of the Cell of  the Bee.  [Man   17,
teen years within the experience of the present manager.       During the
whole of that time no blasting had ever been done in any intake air
way. On the 2nd of October last, however, a party of men were
instructed to blast away a portion of the side of the west chain road
at a distance of about 550 yards from the bottom of the shaft.       They
<U+FB01>red three shots in all, and the third caused the explosion.       It was
not a blown-out shot in any sense.
    The mechanical effects were exactly the same as those produced
by other explosions.     Timber was torn out, and falls of roof some
times of great magnitude and extent were caused all through the
intake air-ways, as far as the <U+FB02>ame reached.         In the endless chain
roads the box part of each empty tub was swept away from the frame,
and shattered into small pieces, not one being left whole.        A spare
pulley-wheel, 4 feet in diameter and weighing 15 cwt., which had
been standing on its edge leaning against the side near the end of the
west chain road, was carried four yards inwards towards the face, and
laid <U+FB02>at on its side.
    The <U+FB02>ame traversed all the intake air-ways, except the new east
road, and died out in some nearer to, and in others further from, the
faces.    It did not in any case pass into a return air-way. It did not
reach the face of the workings at any point.
    The new east road was quite undisturbed.          Two men who were
working in it felt a concussion of the air, but saw no <U+FB02>ame, and came
out unscathed. This result appears to be due entirely to the circum
 stance that the principal stables were ranged along the entrance to
 this road, and the ground having been kept constantly wet with the
 water used in the service of the horses, the <U+FB02>ame was unable to pass
 that point for want of coal-dust to sustain it.

178                             Mr. W. H. Caldwell.                           [Man 17,
cells,   travel vthence to the .ovum; food granules also appear in
the neighbourhood of the germinal vesicle, and travel away from
it: hencethe horse-shoe shape of the yolk-mass as seen in section.
The time during ‘iwhich food granules are thuspassing from the
follicular cells to the ovum may be called “the yolk forming period.”
   It is succeeded by a period during which the vitelline membrane
again becomes thin, the follicular cells are reduced to a single layer,
and the cells are very thin and <U+FB02>at. This period may be called
the “absorption of <U+FB02>uid period,” since during it the ovum absorbs
large quantities of <U+FB02>uid through the thin vitelline membrane and
single layer of thin follicular cells, and thereby increases largely in
size.
   This is in turn succeeded by a third period, during which the folli
cular cells again become active, multiply, increase greatly in size, and
give rise between themselves and the vitelline membrane to a deeply
staining homogeneous layer, which             I will call the chorion.     This period
                             “ the chorion forming period."          All these three
may hence be called
periods are gone through while the ovum is still in the follicle.
   Upon the bursting of the follicle and the reception of the ovum in
the Fallopian tube, a. few of the follicular cells remain attached to the
chorion ; the majority are left behind within the burst follicle.
   During the passage'along the Fallopian tube, the vitelline mem
brane again increases in thickness, and the chorion, also increasing in
thickness, absorbs <U+FB02>uid and becomes the albumen layer.                    Outside this
now appears a new structure, the shell or shell-membrane, of tough
parchment-like consistency) not staining with reagents.                     I  have not
yet    traced   the   deposition    of  the  shell  to the  activity   of  any special
glands; but      I  can   say  that  the shell-membrane        does  not   increase at
the expense of the chorion or albumen layer.
    After reaching the uterus both vitelline membrane and shell-mem
 brane increase in thickness, but the albumen layer diminishes and
disappears, serving apparently for the nutrition of the ovum.                     Imme
 diately beneath the vitelline membrane a new layer is now seen in
 hardened preparations; but it may be shown that this layer is really
 <U+FB02>uid, yielding a coagulum which stains deeply with reagents, the
 <U+FB02>uid being apparently derived, through the membranes, from the
 uterine glands.
     In Marsupialia the history of the vitelline membrane, save that
 “the yolk forming period” is not marked off from the “ absorption of
 <U+FB02>uid” period, is similar       to that in Monotremata.       I have not been able to

    ovary, in Marsupialia; but in an ovum of Phascolarctos, from the uterus,
    I found a chorion like that of Monotremata, and surrounded moreover
    by a thin transparent membrane—a shell-membrane. Within the uterus
   the chorion, increasing in thickness, becomes transformed into an
   albumen layer, and is eventually absorbed, passing through the
   vitelline membrane to nourish the ovum, so that eventually the
   vitelline membrane comes to be close to the shell.
       As in Monotremata, a coagulable, and, when coagulated, deeply
   staining <U+FB02>uid makes its appearancev between the vitelline membrane
   and ovum (blastoderm).
       The shell-membrane persists until the developing ovum becomes
   <U+FB01>xed to the walls of the uterus, after which it disappears.
       The paper then compares the egg-membranes just described with
   those of Placentalia, and those of Vertebrata generally.
                                 2.  Segmentation.
       The telolecithal ova of Monotremata and Marsupialia go through a
   partial segmentation.     The ova of Placentalia segment completely,
   but the resulting blastodermic vesicle is identical with that produced
   by partial segmentation in Monotremata and Marsupialia.
       In Monotremata there is a posterior lip to the blastopore similar to
   that of Elasmobranchii.      Theepiblast grows in. so rapidly from the
   sides, that a primitive streak region is formed in front of the posterior
   lip long before the epiblast has enclosed the yolk. This unenclosed
   area in front of the primitive streak probably includes a region
   where the hypoblast (yolk) has secondarily broken through the
   epiblast.    The existence of such a region would hide the position of
   the anterior lip of the blastopore. The circumference of the circle
  made up by the larger 'arc of the edge of the blastoderm on the yolk,
  and the smaller arc vof the posterior lip of the 'blastopore, is a
  measure of the quantity of yolk in a meroblastic ovum.
      In Marmqoialz'a the epiblastic growth encloses the hypoblast at
  a very early age, ex'cept over a narrow slit in front of the posterior
  lip of the blastopore. This slit corresponds to the area.enclosed'by
  the circle described above in a meroblastic egg. The primitive streak
  is not conspicuous at an early age because of the large size of the
  cells. No hypoblast projects through the epiblast in front of the
  primitive streak region.      I   would explain the segmentation and the
  gastrula of Placentalia in the same way. Balfour’s objection (‘ Comp.
  Embryol,’ vol. 2, p. 187) to Van Beneden’s original comparison of the
  blastopore of the rabbit with that of a frog, is explained away by
  the presence of a posterior lip to .the blastopore in Marsupialia.
  explanation postulates the existence of a similar structure in the
  rabbit.    The blastopore of the rabbit corresponds therefore to the

IV. “On      the   Total   Solar Eclipse of August 29, 1886 (Pre
     liminary Account).”       By ARTHUR Sonvsrsn, Ph.D., F.R.S.,
     Professor of Applied Mathematics in Owens College, Man
     chester.    Received March 3, 1887.
    The instrument entrusted to me by the Eclipse Expedition was
similar to that employed in Egypt during the eclipse of 1882. The
equatoreal stand carried three cameras, one of which was intended
for direct photographs of the corona, while the two others were
attached to spectroscopes.
    Photographs of the Corona.—The lens had an aperture of 4- inches,
and a focal length of 5 feet 3 inches; giving images of the moon
 having a diameter of about 0'6 of an inch.
    During the <U+FB01>rst minute of totality the corona was covered by a
cloud, which was, however, suf<U+FB01>ciently transparent to allow the
 brightest parts of the corona to show on the two photographs exposed
during that time.
    During the remaining time, that is to say, during about two
 minutes and a half, the sky was clear, but there were clouds in the
 neighbourhood of the sun.
    The time of exposing the photographs, which had been <U+FB01>xed before
 hand, had to be altered in consequence of the uncertainty of the
 weather, and for this reason   I  can only give the actual times of expo
 sures very approximately and from memory.            One photograph on
 sensitive paper shows only little detail; but three photographs on
 glass were obtained, which, as regards de<U+FB01>nition,    I believe to be equal
 to those obtained in Egypt.      The approximate exposures were 15 to
 20 seconds, 10 to 15 seconds, and about 5 seconds.
    With the view of possibly increasing the amount of detail, which it
 has hitherto been possible to obtain on the photographs of the corona,
 I have, on this occasion, given considerable attention to the di<U+FB01>erent
 adjustments, so as to <U+FB01>x the cause which at present limits the de<U+FB01>ni
 tion. A telescope of 4 inches aperture ought to separate two small
 objects which are at an angular distance of about 6 seconds of arc.
 The theoretical resolving power can only be realised with small and
 distinct objects like double stars; in an object like the corona it is
 dif<U+FB01>cult to estimate the resolving power actually obtained. N everthe
 less, as far as I can judge, the photographs obtained in Egypt and in
 Grenada with the same instrument show no detail which theoretically
 could not have been seen with an aperture of 1 inch.           The photo

graphs obtained in India during the eclipse of 1871 show about the
same   <U+FB01>neness of detail as those obtained in 1882 and 1886, but the
aperture then employed was only 2 inches.          It appears from this
either   that the  corona   does not as  a rule show   suf<U+FB01>cient detail to
warrant an aperture greater than 2 inches, or that for some other
reason the full advantage of an aperture of          inches has not been
                                                        4'!

a camera of 63 inches focal length would have a length of about
the 600th part of an inch in the photographic plate.        Remembering
the fact that diffraction gratings have been photographed with 17,000
lines to the inch, it    clear that
                        is        it  cannot be the fault of the photo
graphic <U+FB01>lm  if   greater de<U+FB01>nitionis  not obtained.
   The different adjustments which      it  in the power of the observer
                                             is
to regulate can all be easily made to the required accuracy.          I
feel certain, at any rate, that during the last eclipse the orienta
tion of the instrument and the average rate at which the clock went
during the eclipse were su<U+FB02>Eicient to give the theoretical resolving
power. There seems to me to be only one way in which an improve
ment in the photographs can be hoped for. The mechanical arrange
ment by means of which the clock motion         transferred to the camera
                                                  is
is far from perfect. The series of cogged wheels which transmit the
motion must do so, in my opinion, in an irregular and oscillatory
manner, so that although the average rate of the clock can be regu
lated with suf<U+FB01>cient accuracy, there are minor periods which seriously
interfere with the regularity of the motion and the de<U+FB01>nition of the
images. If we are to obtain better photographs of the corona we can
only hope to do so by means of a better mechanical arrangement for
moving the camera.
   Photographs    ofthe Spectrum of the corona were obtained by means
of two instruments, one being identical with that employed at
Caroline Island in 1883.      This spectroscope has two prisms of 62°
refracting angle, the theoretical resolving power being about 10 in
the yellow.    (The unit of resolving power         that resolving power
                                                       is
which allows of the separation of two lines diifering by the thou
sandth part of their own wave-length.)       The slit of this spectroscope
was placed so that      was tangential to the image of the sun formed
                       it
by the condensing lens.      One plate was exposed during the whole
of totality.  The results are good;    anumber of lines belonging to the
prominences    and to the corona  are very distinct and can be measured
with fair accuracy. The dif<U+FB01>culty of measurement lies in the multi
tude of lines.I     have measured at present between forty and <U+FB01>ftyv
distinct corona lines between the solar lines       and H, and a number
                                                       F
remain   unmeasured.

that although the lines seem to be in the same position their relative
intensity has greatly altered. The strongest corona line during the
last eclipse had a wave-length of about 4232; it is slightly but
distinctly less refrangible than the strong calcium line at 4226.
    The measurement of the photographs is very fatiguing to the eyes;
and it is only when these are in exceptionally good condition that the
work can be done with any degree of accuracy. The delay in bring
ing out a full report is solely due to this dif<U+FB01>culty.
   The second spectroscope had its slit placed so as to take a radial
section of the corona.     It had one large prism giving a. theoretical
resolving power of 11'4; slightly larger therefore than the two
prism spectroscope.
   The <U+FB01>lm was one prepared by Captain Abney so as to be more sen
sitive in the green than the ordinary plates.

   The photograph obtained is faint, but believe will ultimately give
good results.
   A good drawing of the corona was obtained by Captain Maling at
the station occupied by Captain Darwin and myself.
   The plates were“ prepared by Captain Abney, whose valuable help

                                 [PLATE 1.]
    Considering the intimate though as yet little understood con
nexion between chlorophyll and the carbon dioxide of the atmo
sphere, it seemed to me that it might be of interest to ascertain
whether compounds of phyllocyanin, similar to those previously
described, could be obtained, in which the organic or other acid should
be replaced by carbonic acid.
    On passing a current of carbon dioxide through a solution of
phyllocyanin in absolute alcohol holding a quantity of freshly
precipitated hydrated ferrous oxide in suspension, no combination
took place, the phyllocyanin remaining unchanged, though the
current of gas was passed through the liquid for a. considerable time.
    On substituting freshly precipitated cupric oxide for the ferrous
oxide there were slight indications of some reaction taking place, but
the phyllocyanin remained for the most part uncombined.
    A much more decided e<U+FB01>ect is produced when zinc oxide is
employed.     On passing a current of carbon dioxide for several hours
through an alcoholic solution of phyllocyanin holding hydrated zinc
oxide in suspension, the colour of the liquid changes by degrees, the
dull phyllocyanin tint disappearing.        On being <U+FB01>ltered from the
excess of zinc oxide (which retains a pale-green tint, not removable
by washing with alcohol) it appears of a <U+FB01>ne bluish-green ; it <U+FB02>uoresces
strongly, and shows absorption-bands which coincide with those of
the alcoholic solution of phyllocyanin zinc acetate.    The liquid leaves
on evaporation a dark-green semi-crystalline residue, which may be
heated to 150° without undergoing any change, but is decomposed at
a temperature of ISO—170°.        It is, however, very easily decomposed
 by the action of strong acids.     On adding a little hydrochloric acid
 to its alcoholic solution and heating, bubbles of gas are seen to
 escape, the colour of the solution changes to blue, and on now adding
 water there is a dull <U+FB02>occulent precipitate, which dissolves easily on
 shaking up with ether, the solution showing the colour and absorp
 tion-bands peculiar to phyllocyanin solutions.        There can be no
 doubt, therefore, that the compound formed is a phyllocyanin zinc
 carbonate, which by the action of strong acids is decomposed, yielding
 phyllocyanin and carbon dioxide. An alcoholic solution of the com
 pound exposed in an open test-tube to sunlight soon loses its bright
  green colour and becomes yellow, the absorption-bands at the same
 time disappearing.

             Contributions to the Chemistry   of Chlorophyll.            185
   The compounds of phyllocyanin containing zinc are in some
respects not unlike chlorophyll itself, or rather the green constituent
of chlorophyll, and it was, therefore, natural to suppose that the
peculiar effects observed when zinc powder was made to act on
Hoppe-Seyler’s chlorophyllan (impure phyllocyanin P) were due to
regenerated chlorophyll.      The phyllocyanin zinc compounds, like
chlorophyll itself, yield bright green strongly <U+FB02>uorescent solutions;
they are easily decomposed by strong acids, and they are rapidly
changed under the combined in<U+FB02>uence of air and light.           The absorp
tion spectrum of the phyllocyanin zinc compounds consists like that
of chlorophyll of four bands, but the bands do not exactly coincide
with those of chlorophyll as regards position and relative intensity.
In making such comparisons it must not of course be forgotten that
what we in a general way call chlorophyll is a mixture, the com
ponents of which have not hitherto been separated from one another
in a satisfactory manner.
   The various double compounds of phyllocyanin are not equally
 susceptible to the in<U+FB02>uence of air and light ; they differ as much in this
respect, inter se, as do phyllocyanin and chlorophyll, the former being
a very stable body, the latter exceedingly unstable.       The compounds
containing zinc are most easily changed, while those containing
copper are very permanent. These differences were clearly manifested
in an experiment of which the results were as follows :-—A dilute
                                                                              '
alcoholic solution of phyllocyanin was divided into four equal parts.
In one part the phyllocyanin was left uncombined; in the second
part it was by the addition of acetic acid and zinc oxide and boiling
changed into phyllocyanin zinc acetate, while in the third and fourth        -
parts it was in like manner converted into phyllocyanin ferrous
acetate and phyllocyanin cupric acetate respectively.       All four liquids
having been made equal in volume by the addition of alcohol where
required, were exposed from the end of July in loosely stoppered
cylinders to alternate sunlight and di<U+FB02>'used daylight, an alcoholic
solution of chlorophyll of approximately the same intensity as the
phyllocyanin zinc a‘cetate solution being placed in a <U+FB01>fth vessel at the
side.   After three days’ exposure the chlorophyll solution had
become nearly colourless, though it still showed bands due to ready
formed phyllocyanin.      After one week’s exposure the phyllocyanin
zinc acetate solution had in like manner lost the greater part of its
green colour, retaining only a faint greenish-yellow tinge with a
slight <U+FB02>uorescence, and showing a faint band in the red. After a
fortnight’s exposure the solution appeared nearly colourless, and the
band in the red could only be seen when the light passed through a
considerable thickness of liquid, while the other solutions were quite
unaltered as regards colour and absorption-bands.          After a further
exposure   of  <U+FB01>ve weeks the phyllocyaninsolution       had   become much

186.                          Mr. E. Schunck.
paler, though still showing the characteristic absorption-bands, while
in the solution of the ferrous compound only a faint indication of the
band in the red could be seen, the solution of the cupric compound
remaining quite unchanged as regards intensity of colour and distinct
ness of absorption.     After a still further exposure the absorption
bands of the phyllocyaniu solution had nearly disappeared, only a
faint indication of the one in the red remaining, but no change could
be perceived in the solution of the cupric compound.           It appears,
therefore, that while the zinc compound shows far less stability
when exposed in solution to the action of air and light than uncom
bined phyllocyanin, being indeed almost as unstable as chlorophyll
itself, the cupric compound is far more stable, the ferrous compound
occupying in this respect a position intermediate between that of the
zinc compound and that of uncombined phyllocyanin.              There are
few compounds of colouring matters which would withstand the
combined action of light and oxygen for so long a period as phyllo
cyaniu cupric acetate.       The instability of the zinc compound must
 be due to the nature of the compound itself, for it is dif<U+FB01>cult to
suppose that the metallic base can in any way assist in the process of
 oxidation, for such the process must be.
    Action of Caustic Alkali and Zinc on Phyllocyanin.—When phyllo
cyaniu is treated with boiling caustic potash lye to which zinc powder
 is added, it dissolves rapidly, yielding a dark greenish-blue solution,
 which after <U+FB01>ltration from the excess of zinc, gives with acetic acid
a green precipitate.     This precipitate, after <U+FB01>ltration and washing,
dissolves in ether, giving a <U+FB01>ne bluish-green <U+FB02>uorescent solution,
 which resembles the solutions of phyllocyaniu zinc acetate, but shows
 a slightly different spectrum, all the bands except the <U+FB01>rst being
 further away from the red. The ethereal solution leaves on spon
 taneous evaporation an amorphous residue, which is green by trans
 mitted, purple by re<U+FB02>ected light.     When instead of acetic acid hydro
 chloric acid is added to the greenish-blue alkaline solution, there is a
 dark green precipitate, which differs from phyllocyaniu inasmuch as
 its ethereal solution is greener and far more <U+FB02>uorescent than an
 ethereal solution of the latter, and shows a spectrum of <U+FB01>ve bands,
 all 'of which lie further away from the red than the corresponding
 ones of phyllocyanin.     It is probable that the precipitate with hydro
 chloric acid consists of a product formed by the reducing action of
 zinc on phyllocyanin, whereas the precipitate with acetic acid repre
 sents the double compound of this body with zinc and acetic acid,
 being formed when acetic acid is added to the solution containing the
 product of reduction along with zinc oxide.
    Action of Hydrochloric Acid and Metallic Tin on Phyllocyanin.—
 When metallic tin is added to a solution of phyllocyaniu in concen
 trated hydrochloric acid, the solution on standing gradually loses its

             Contributions to the Chemistry                             18?;
                                                of Chlorophyll.
bright bluish-green colour, which changes to a dull olive-green. The
addition of water to the solution produces a brown precipitate, which
being <U+FB01>ltered o<U+FB01>‘ and washed to remove the acid, dissolves much more
easily in boiling alcohol than phyllocyanin, giving a dark olive
coloured solution.       This solution leaves on evaporation a brown
amorphous residue, which treated with ether dissolves for the most
part.    The ethereal solution has a green colour with a tinge of red,
and shows a spectrum consisting of eight bands; it leaves on evapo
ration a semi-crystalline residue, which is green by'transmitted,
purple by re<U+FB02>ected light.        On the addition of concentrated hydro
chloric acid  it  separates into two distinct layers, the upper one being
colourless, while the lower one is green, and shows four bands.
   By the prolonged action of tin on the solution of phyllocyanin in
hydrochloric acid, a further and more complete change is effected, the
solution acquiring a bright red colour without the least tinge 'of green.
On adding water the solution gives a red <U+FB02>occulent precipitate, which
<U+FB01>ltered off and washed appears dark red, the <U+FB01>ltrate retaining an
orange colour, and showing a broad ill-de<U+FB01>ned band, covering part of
the green and blue. The precipitate dissolves almost entirely in
warm alcohol, giving a bright red solution.       This solution, on adding
a little caustic alkali, acquires a bright lemon-yellow colour, but the
red colour is restored by an excess of hydrochloric acid; the alkaline
solution shows a broad hand between the green and blue, but on
standing at short time exposed to the air it changes, becoming of a
deeper yellow, and it now shows a spectrum of three bands, one in
the yellow, one in the green, both pale, with a dark band between the
green and blue.      The red alcoholic solution leaves on spontaneous
evaporation a reddish-brown amorphous residue, which dissolves only
in part in boiling ether, giving a reddish-brown solution, which shows
a peculiar spectrum of six bands. The body showing this spectrum is
probably a product of oxidation of the red substance.       The acid liquid
<U+FB01>ltered   from   the red   precipitate, after removing the tin with sul
phuretted hydrogen, is found to contain a mere trace of organic
matter.
   The colouring matter formed by the action of tin and hydrochloric
acid on phyllocyanin resembles in some respects those contained in
                                                   I
the petals of red <U+FB02>owers. Hitherto, however, have not succeeded in
<U+FB01>nding among the latter any one exactly like it.
   Examination of the Mother-liquors 0f Phyllocyanin.—Having some
reason to suspect that the acetic acid mother-liquors of phyllocyanin
contained some other substance similar to it of de<U+FB01>nite character,         I
added water to a portion of these liquors, so as to throw down the
whole of the colouring matter contained in it. The <U+FB02>occulent pre
cipitate was <U+FB01>ltered OE and dissolve‘l in boiling alcohol. The solu
tion on cooling gave a crystalline deposit which was found to possess

all       the properties of phyllocyanin.        I think therefore      that the mother
liquors contained that colouring matter only, along with fatty matters
and other impurities.

   Till lately the thermopile and galvanomcter have a<U+FB01>orded the
most delicate means of detecting and measuring radiant energy. This
combination has been surpassed by Professor Langley, who has made
use of the increased resistance of metallic wires or the diminished
resistance of a carbon <U+FB01>lament when warmed.
   It seems dif<U+FB01>cult to believe, in consequence of the very small change
of resistance which even iron undergoes when slightly warmed, that
this is the best principle to make use of in designing the most sensi
tive possible instrument.       felt that if an instrument depending on
                                  I
thermo-electric    ferce could be made as beautifully as Professor
Langley’s bolometer, a better result ought to be obtained.        The one
point in which the bolometer has a great advantage          the small mass
                                                               is
of the part to be heated, whereas a thermopile, delicate as the bars
may be, has a mass so enormous that both the rate of heating and the
ultimate rise of temperature must be small in comparison.
   A thermopile with bars as thin as the wires of the bolometer cannot
be made with antimony and bismuth, and yet such a construction
would be required before the thermo-electric force could be utilised to
the same extent that the change of resistance        in the bolometer.

190                             Mr. C. V. Boys.                           [Mar. 24,
Deprez (on the principle of Sir W. Thomson’s siphon recorder)
would have many advantages. It occurred to me that if an active
bar were made with two pieces of metal, antimony and bismuth,
as thin as possible, soldered edge to edge, and if the outer edges were
joined by an arch of copper,v and if this were hung in a strong magnetic
<U+FB01>eld, all the advantages of an ideal thermopile and of the Deprez
galvauometer would be gained, while the impossibility of the former,
and the resistance and tension of the stretched wires of the latter, and
the resistance of the wires connecting the thermopile with the galvario
meter would be abolished. I anticipated that a greater delicacy would
be obtained than has been considered possible, that the instrument
 would be convenient in that it would be of necessity dead beat, that
its indications would be proportional to the received radiations, that
it would have the constant and de<U+FB01>nite zero which mechanical control
such as torsion gives, that it would not be a<U+FB01>ected by the magnetism
of objects near it, and that as the circuit could be suspended in a hole
in a mass of metal with one window for the radiation to enter, the
instrument should be very insensitive to temperature changes other
 than those in the line of action.     It has the further advantage that
for spectroscopic work the radiation may be limited by a narrow slit
without much reducing its sensibility! It is, however, a <U+FB01>xed instru
ment that cannot be handled and pointed like the thermopile or the    ’
bolometer.
  I have made some preliminary experiments to test these conclusions.
One instrument, made by my friend Mr. Cunynghame very roughly
with a torsion wire support only a few inches long, is fairly sensitive.
   One which       I
                  made with the active bar about 6x8Xé~ mm., and
with a circuit 1 cm. square, of one turn of which the three sides are
made of copper wire about          mm. in diameter, and in which the
motion of the circuit is resisted by a torsion <U+FB01>bre of the <U+FB01>nest spun
glass about 10 cm. long, gives when placed on the poles of a permanent
magnet results so good that I have ventured to submit the instrument
for inspection to the Royal Society.       This particular instrument is
capable of showing the heat which would be cast by a candle <U+FB02>ame
on a halfpenny at a distance of 200 yards.‘l'      As I have not yet em
ployed what    Iknow  to be  the best proportions, it is evident that very
                                                                           1
great sensibility is possible.
  iI  should have mentioned that much larger angles could be measured         theif,
<U+FB01>bre were suspended by a torsion head and the light brought to a de<U+FB01>nite position
for every observation—[March      2,

   It is easy to calculate exactly what de<U+FB02>ection will be caused by a
given rise of temperature in any instrument.       Taking quantities, all
of which can be easily obtained, namely, antimony and bismuth, each
5 X 5 X 025 mm., one arch of copper wire one—eighth of a square mm'.
in section, completing a circuit of one square cm., suspended in
a <U+FB01>eld of 10,000 units by a thread of such a torsion as would
give an undamped period of oscillation of 20 seconds, the least move
ment that could be detected would be produced by a rise of tempera
ture of about one ninety-four millionth of a degree centigrade. It
seems to be capable of attaining about 100 times the sensitiveness of
the bolometer. Further, the electromotive force acting at this tempe
rature would be only about one million millionth of a volt, which
is probably smaller than any that can be detected by other
means.
   I  am now engaged in working out such details as the various
maxima.       Thus for a certain shape of circuit and number of turns a
certain thickness of copper gives the best result; of various shapes
the rectangle only is practically convenient, but taking the best
thickness of wire for each successive length, a certain length is better
than any other; with a particular shape and the best thickness, two
turns are better than one or three, but it does not follow that this will
be so for all shapes ; no advantage is gained by employing more than
one junction.      An increased sensibility may be produced by either
using   a  longer  torsion thread or a stronger <U+FB01>eld, a certain relation
between these and the resistance will give a maximum quickness.
   The conductivity of aluminium compared to its mass is, as is well
known, more than that of any other material, so it would be pre
ferable to copper if it were not for the dif<U+FB01>culty of soldering it.
   The instrument may be made with a second active bar, forming
the other end of the rectangle, with its own window, and can thus
be used di<U+FB02>erentially, one bar being exposed to the radiation to be
measured and the other to any compensator.
   It is interesting to note that the damping action is slightly reduced
by the Peltier eitect.
   I anticipate some dif<U+FB01>culty in using the <U+FB01>eld produced by an electro
magnet; for even if the effect of the heating of the coils by the
                              I
current can be avoided, as think it may by the use of long iron con
necting-rods passing through water, any variation of current will
give rise to motions of the suspended circuit, the nature of which       I
described in the ‘Phil. Mag,’ September, 1884.           But after these
di<U+FB02>iculties are removed, there will remain the diamagnetism of the
three metals and the great damping action.      With <U+FB01>elds of reasonable
strength, the diamagnetism may be set against the torsion of the
thread, so that but feeble controlling force may be obtained by a
thread of moderate length, but for electromagnetic <U+FB01>elds I propose to

netically neutral.
   Mr. Cunynghame suggested to me, when Iexplained to him my
views, that a rotating instrument might possibly be made like
Crookes’ radiometer. After some trouble           I have devised and made a
most simple rotating pile.       It consists of  a  cross with bismuth arms
and an antimony centre.         To the end of each arm is soldered a piece
of copper wire, the four wires being parallel to one another, and at right
angles to the plane of the cross.      The four free ends of the wires are
soldered     to  a  ring  of copper  wire parallel to the cross.    If this is
balanced on a point between the poles of a permanent magnet, and if
radiant heat is allowed to fall on the right hand side of the cross,
looking from the north to the south pole, the cross will at once begin
to oscillate, making larger and larger oscillations until it rotates,
which it will do indi<U+FB02>ferently in either direction.         If the heat falls
upon the left hand side, any motion that it may have is at once
arrested.       It follows that if the source of heat is removed and the
cross is turned mechanically, the right hand side will be cooled and
the left warmed.
   If the cross is made with antimony arms and a bismuth centre,
then what was true of the right hand side is now true of the left, and
rice versti.
   Instead of a cross and four wires, 1 think an antimony disk, with
many pieces of bismuth and many wires or with a ring of bismuth,
and many wires forming a sort of drum armature, would give a
better result; but the one described with four arms rotates rapidly
when the spark at the end of a blown-out match is held near it.
   We have in this rotating pile, which might be called an electric
radiometer, an electromagnetic motor, which is almost an exception
to the axiom that such an engine cannot be made without sliding or
liquid  contacts.
   I am   now working out fully the conditions of maximum sensibility,
and hope to communicate shortly a paper to the Royal Society, in
which they are discussed, and at the same time to show an instrument
of the best construction and some results obtained with it.
                         Note added March 23, 1887.
   I have     found, both by calculation and experiment, that the move
ment of the circuit becomes perfectly dead beat with a <U+FB01>eld of a little
over 1000 units; therefore advantage is gained by using more than
one junction, as a stronger <U+FB01>eld can then be used before the motion
becomes dead beat.
   I have     spoken of a <U+FB01>ne glass <U+FB01>bre  as a  torsion support.   Since this

 perfect elasticity, and so have avoided the inconvenience of the
 shifting zero of the glass <U+FB01>bre, and with a torsion, if required, ten
 million times less than that of spun glass. This will be described at
 the next meeting of the Physical Society.

        M.A., F.R.S. Received February 26, 1887.
     An interesting letter of criticism from Professor C. S. Peirce on
 my recently published Memoir on the Theory of Mathematical Form
 has led me to reconsider certain paragraphs therein, relating to the
 de<U+FB01>nition of what        I  have termed “aspects,” and       I am anxious to
 make the following amendments.
     For Section 5 substitute—
     5. In like manner some pairs of units are distinguished from each
 other, while others are not. Pairs may in some cases be distinguished
 even though the units composing them are not.               Thus the angular
 points   of   a square   are  undistinguishable   from  each other, and a pair
 of such points lying at the extremities of a side are undistinguished
 from the three other like pairs, but are distinguished from each of the
 two pairs arrived at by taking the angular points at the extremities of
 the diagonals, which pairs again are undistinguishable from each
 other.      Further, though two units a and b are undistiuguishable
 from each other, an absence of symmetry may cause ab to be dis
 tinguished from ta. Thus, if we "put'aside differences arising from
 their positions on the paper, and the use of reference letters (Secs.
 41 and 42), the three black spots, a, b, 0, shown in <U+FB01>g. 1, are undis~
 tinguished from each other; but at is distinguished from ba, for
 when we take the spots a, b, in the order ab an arrow proceeds from
 the <U+FB01>rst spot to the second, but when we take them in the order ba
 an arrow proceeds to the <U+FB01>rst spot from the second.
     For Section 7 substitute—                    >
     7. Again,     there are distinguished       and undistinguished triads,
tetrads, . . . . m~ads, . . . . n-ads, . . . . ; every m-ad being of
course distinguished from every n-ad. Just as we may have ab dis
tinguished from ba, though a is undistinguished from b, so we may
have pgrst . . . . 1w distinguished from qusvt . . . . rp, though the
units 10, q, 'r, s, t, . . . . u, v, are all undistinguished from each other,
and further, though their pairs are also undistinguished, as likewise
their triads, &c.        Here pqrst . ; . . m; and qus'ut . . . . rp will be

  194                          Mr. A. B. Kempe.                     [Man   24,

  sidered in Secs. 73 f, and we shall there see that an aspect of a
  collection of n units, i.e., of an n-ad, is itself an n-ad. It will be
  convenient to speak of the aspects of the pairs, triads, &c., contained
  in a collection, as if they were themselves pairs, triads, &c.. of the
  collection.
     For Sections 73 to 77 substitute—
     73. If with each unit of a collection of n units a, b, a, . . . . of any
  form, we mentally associate one of a given discrete heap (Sec. 37)
  of n marks, so that each unit is thereby distinguished from each of
  the others, and from all other units, we obtain what            I  have, in
  Secs. 6 and 7, termed an aspect of a, b, c, .
     It may assist in arriving at a proper idea of the use and importance
  of aspects, and may justify the use of the expression “aspect,” to
  point out that when, in the consideration of a collection of units, we
  give different degrees of prominence in our minds to different units
  of the collection, we are mentally af<U+FB01>xing distinctive marks to those
  units, and have a particular “aspect” of the collection before our
  mind’s eye. It may be, in some cases, that we give a distinctive
  degree of prominence to one unit only of the collection, and equal
  degrees of prominence to the rest: thus, when we consider the
  relations of a number of things to a particular thing, we a<U+FB02>ix a
  distinctive mental mark to the latter thing, and marks undis
  tinguished from each other to the former things. It is convenient,
  however, for our present purposes to con<U+FB01>ne the use of the word
  “aspect” to the case in which a different degree of prominence,
  or other distinctive mental mark, is af<U+FB01>xed to each unit of the
  collection.
     The 1:. marks may be associated with the n units, a, b, c, . . . .
  in in different ways, giving rise to In aspects of a, b, c, . . . . ; each
  aspect being derivable from the _others by transpositions            of the
  marks.    When    we   regard   a unit a as associated  with  a   particular
  mark g in a particular aspect of a, b, c, . . . . , we deal with a unit
  A, which is a different unit from a, and may be called an aspect of a.
  Thus an aspect of the 'n-ad, a, b, c, . . . . , is an 'n-ad composed of
  a unit aspects, A, B, C, . . . .
     The unit aspects composing one aspect of a, b, c, . . . . are each
  distinct units from those composing another aspect, andv thus the In
  aspects of a, b, c, . . . . derived by employing a particular collection
  of 1» marks, furnish in all nln unit aspects such as A.
     Since the marks employed are all distinguished from each other, the
- a unit aspects A, B, C, . . . . composing a particular aspect of
  a, b, c, . . . . are all distinguished from each other.
     We may associate the same collection of n marks with any number
  of collections of n units a, b, c, . . . .; p, q, r, . . . .; &c., and
  obtain |n aspects of each collection.

 1887.]            ()n the Theory   of Mathematical Form.                 195
    In future when we compare aspects of a collection, or of a number
of collections of the same number of units, unless the contrary is
manifestly the case, it will be supposed that the same collection of n
marks is employed in each case.
    We may choose as our discrete heap of n marks a collection of n
“relative positions,” or sorts of places, which are distinguished from
each other, and from all other relative positions: 6.9., we may choose
the sorts of places—<U+FB01>rst, second, third, &c., in a row. In such a case
the units a, b, c, . . . . may be regarded as occupying the sorts of
places which serve as marks.
    74!. If two collections of units a, b, c, .....  and p, q, r, . . . . are
undistinguished from each other, they may be regarded as correspond
ing to each other in one or more ways, in each of which corre
spondences to each unit, pair, triad, &c., of one collection there cor
responds in the other a counterpart unit, pair, triad, &c., undistin
 guished from the former in any circumstance. In any one of those
 correspondences twovcorresponding units may be regarded as occupy
 ing corresponding places, or, as we may express it, places of the same
 sort; and we may if we please regard these sorts of places as dis
 tinguished from each other, and from all other sorts of places; i.e.,
 we may regard the correspondence          as giving rise to two aspects
A, B, C, . . . . and P, Q, R, . . . ., the former an aspect of a, b, c,
 . . . ., the latter of p, g, r, . . . .  The two aspects A, B, O, . . . .
 and P, Q, R, . . . are clearly undistinguished from each other; and,
as the units of each are distinguished from each other, to each unit
 of one there corresponds one unit, and one only, in the other which

    75. Two aspects will not be undistinguished        unless they can be
regarded as derived in the manner indicated in the last section; and
therefore the undist-inguishableness of two aspects A, B, C, . . . .

ence between the two undistinguished collections a, b, c, . . . . and

of the one there corresponds in the other a counterpart unit, pair,

    Similarly, the undistinguishableness of two aspects of the same
collection a, b, c, . . . . may be said to indicate a self-correspondence of
the collection, i.e., a correspondence in which to each unit, pair, triad,
&c., of the collection a, b, c, . . . . there corresponds the same, or
another unit, pair, triad, &c., of a, b, c, . . . . undistinguished from

Ill.       “ OnEllipsoidal Current Sheets.” By HORACE LAMB, M.A.,

                                       (Abstract)
     This paper treats of the induction      of electric currents in an
ellipsoidal sheet of conducting    matter   whose  conductivity per unit
area varies as the perpendicular       from  the  centre on the tangent
plane, or (say) in a thin shell of uniform material bounded by similar
and coaxial ellipsoids.  The method followed is to determine in the <U+FB01>rst
instance the normal types of free currents. In any normal type the
currents decay according to the law e'”’; the time-constant 1- may be
                          “                             “            ”
conveniently called the modulus of decay,” or the persistency          of
the type.
   When the normal types and their persistencies have been found, it
is an easy matter to <U+FB01>nd the currents induced by given varying
electromotive forces, assuming these to be resolved by Fourier’s
theorem, as regards the time, into a series of simple harmonic terms.
Supposing then that we have an external magnetic'system whose
potential varies as ell", we can determine a <U+FB01>ctitious distribution of
current over the shell, which shall produce the same <U+FB01>eld in the
interior.   If   denote the current-function

‘Electricity,’ § 600, that the induced currents are the same if we
suppose    the conductor to be <U+FB01>xed, and the <U+FB01>eld to rotate in the
opposite direction.    When the conductor is symmetrical about the
axis of rotation, the current-function of any normal type contains as
a factor cos sw or sin sw, where w is the azimuth, and s is integral (or
zero). When we apply Maxwell’s arti<U+FB01>ce, the corresponding time
factor is ei’P‘, where p is the angular velocity of the rotation; and
we easily <U+FB01>nd that the system of nduced currents of any normal
type is <U+FB01>xed in space, but is displaced relatively to the <U+FB01>eld though

the interior.    For instance, the axes of coordinates being along the

discussed in the present paper; the persistency of each normal type is
found, and various particular cases are considered. Of the special

    The problem of induced currents is then discussed, and I consider
more particularly the case of a circular disk, of the kind indicated, rota

attaching to the question, it would be interesting to have a solution
for the case of a untfornl disk ; but in the absence of this, the
solution for the more special kind of disk here considered may not be
uninstructive.
    As in all our calculations relating to ellipsoids of revolution, we
employ elliptic coordinates; viz., seeking the origin at the centre of
the disk, and the axis of z perpendicular to its plane, we write

   The behaviour of iron and steel when subjected to very strong
magnetising forces        a matter of considerable practical and very
                                is
great theoretical interest, especially from its bearing on the molecular
theory of magnetisation, which assigns an upper limit to the intensity
of magnetism that      piece of iron can acquire, and even suggests that
                             a
the metal may become diamagnetic under the in<U+FB02>uence of a sn<U+FB02>i
ciently great force.    All experiments hitherto made, by magnetising
iron in the <U+FB01>eld of an electric solenoid, have shown that the intensity
of magnetism        as well as the induction

steel,    and 18,250 in a bar of wrought iron.*              The corresponding
values of a are 1563 and 1437 respectively.               Probably the highest
magnetisation reached in any experiments of this class already pub
lished is that found by Mr. Shelford Bidwell‘l' in his experiments on
the tractive force between the halves of a divided ring electro-magnet.
For a force g} of 585 he gives 19,820 as the value of § (calculated
from the tractive force) in a wrought-iron ring.              The corresponding
value of a is 1530.
    With cast iron, Dr. Hopkinson found (in a sample of grey iron)
10,783 for the induction produced by a force of 240. The corre
sponding value of a is 841.                                                       .
    In the space between the pole-pieces of a strong electro-magnet w
have a <U+FB01>eld of force of much greater intensity than it is practicable
to produce by the direct action of the electric current. This <U+FB01>eld is
not well adapted for experiments whose object is to determine with
precision the relation of magnetisation to magnetising force, on
account of the distortion which it undergoes when the piece of iron
to be magnetised is introduced into it. It is, however, well suited
for experiments whose object is to determine how much magnetism
the metal can be forced to take up.
    For this purpose it is of course necessary that. the cross-section of
the test-piece should be much smaller than the area of the pole-piece
faces.     In the following experiments the electro-magnet consisted of a
 pair of vertical limbs 25 cm. long, with cores 5 cm. in diameter, joined
 at the bottom by a horizontal yoke, and furnished on the top with
 pole-pieces, made of soft hammered scrap iron, in the form of rect
 angular blocks with plane faces, whose distance from each other
 could be adjusted at will. The faces were 5'25 cm. square.                     The
 magnet was wound with wire large enough to permit a current of about
 27 amperes to be used for a short time. In the earliest experiments
 the test-piece to be magnetised was a round cylinder of soft iron, with
 <U+FB02>at ends 0'34 cm. in diameter and 1'3 cm. long. This was covered
 with an induction coil, consisting of a single layer of <U+FB01>ne wire, which
 extended over the whole length of the piece.             It was placed length
 wise in the centre of the <U+FB01>eld, with the pole-pieces just touching its
 ends, and the <U+FB01>eld magnet was excited.                The test-piece was then
 suddenly withdrawn, while the transient current produced in the
 induction coil was measured by a ballistic galvanometer connected to
 the induction coil by long leading wires, which were twisted together
    ‘ J.  and  E. Hopkinson    have observed an induction of 20,000 in the core of a.

throughout their whole length. Very few experiments were made
with test-pieces of this form, for it was found that they gave by no
means an exceptionally high value for the magnetic induction.        This
is to be ascribed to the fact that the ends of the cylinder, which were
in contact with the pole-pieces, necessarily shared that value of the
induction which existed in the part of the pole-piece faces which they
touched, and this comparatively low induction in and near the ends of
the cylinder neutralised the much higher value in the middle portion.
The induction coil, being wound from end to end of the bar, gave a
mean value for the whole length.       To obtain higher values, it was
obviously necessary to restrict   the measurement   of the induction to
the middle portion, where the induction was greatest; and, further,
it was desirable to furnish the bar with conical or some form of
spreading ends, which would present an easy path for the lines
of induction to converge towards the central neck.          Accordingly,
test-pieces were turned of the form and dimensions of Sample A,
shown in Plate 2, <U+FB01>g. 1, where the bobbin is sketched in place between
the pole-pieces.    These were wound along the whole length of the
narrow central neck with an induction coil consisting of a single
layer of No. 36 S.W.G. silk-covered wire.           In Sample A the
diameter of the iron neck was 0'923 mm., and the diameter measured
to the middle of the thickness of the wire forming the induction coil
was 094%.       Hence there was but little space, outside the section of
the iron, enclosed by the coil; and the small amount of magnetic
induction in this non-ferrous space was allowed for by a method to be
explained below.
   In test-pieces of the form of Sample A the loss of magnetism
observed on suddenly withdrawing the piece from its place between
the pole-pieces of the <U+FB01>eld magnet, is less than the whole magnetism
by the small but somewhat uncertain quantity of residual magnetism
which the piece retains. To avoid this source of uncertainty another
form of test-piece was used, which is shown in <U+FB01>g. 2, Sample B.
Here the bobbin has its conical ends rounded at the base to form
portions of a circular cylinder, and the pole-pieces are hollowed to
correspond. The bobbin can now be turned completely round about
a central axis at right angles to the paper, so that the direction of its
magnetism is reversed, and half the ballistic e<U+FB01>ect of the reversal
measures the magnetic induction.        This method was used in the
greater number of the observations. Again, by merely withdrawing
the bobbin from the <U+FB01>eld, and comparing the effect of this withdrawal
with half the e<U+FB01>ect of reversal, an estimate was arrived at of the
amount of error to which the former experiments were subject on
account of residual magnetism.
   To determine the intensity of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld in the space
immediately surrounding the narrow neck in which the greatest

  1887.]     On the Magnetisatz'on  of Iron in Strong Fields.        203
 induction occurred, a small quantity of wire was wound over the <U+FB01>rst
 induction coil, to form a distance-piece, and on the top of that a
 second induction coil was wound, the second coil, like the <U+FB01>rst, con
 sisting of a single layer of very <U+FB01>ne wire. The space between the
 two coils was accurately determined.         When the test-piece was
 reversed or drawn out of the <U+FB01>eld the operation was in each case
 performed several times, and two groups of observations were
 recorded, one giving the induction in the inner coil, and the other the
 induction in the outer coil; the difference of course served to
 determine the <U+FB01>eld in the space between the coils. When this <U+FB01>eld
 was known it was easy to correct for the induction in the non-ferrous
 space enclosed by the inner coil.
    Three kinds of wrought iron were tested; soft hammered scrap,
 Swedish iron, and Lowmoor iron. The hammered scrap proved less
 susceptible than the other two, and was not used in the <U+FB01>nal experi
 ments, which were made with test-pieces 0f the form of Sample B.
 Pieces of cast iron were also tested, in forms resembling both A and B.
    To determine in absolute measure the value of the ballistic e<U+FB01>ects,
 a large earth-coil was kept in circuit with the induction coil and
 galvanometer, and was turned over in either the vertical or horizontal
earth-<U+FB01>eld at the beginning, and again at the end of each group of
observations.     To avoid the possibility of error in this important
particular,  two   separate earth-coils of entirely di<U+FB01>erent dimensions
 were employed, and the galvanometer constant was determined inde
pendently by means of both, with results which were in excellent
agreement.     The values of the induction stated below are worked out
on the basis that the horizontal force in the grounds of University
 College, Dundee, at a place u<U+FB01>iciently removed from local magnetic
in<U+FB02>uence, is 0'160 in C.G.S. units.

   In another     test of Lowmoor iron, conducted          in  the same way, a still
higher value of g was reached, namely, 32,880.                 This is the highest
induction that has been recorded in .these experiments.
   A similar experiment with a piece of Swedish wrought iron, of the
form and dimensions shown in <U+FB01>g. 2, gave 32,310 for the greatest value
of   g   the magnetic force in the ring of space surrounding the iron
neck being then 11,250.
   The amount of residual magnetism retained by a Lowmoor sample
of this form (Sample B) was determined by comparing the e<U+FB01>ect of
withdrawing the test-piece with the effect of reversing it. The results
showed that within the range of magnetic force used in these experi
ments, namely, from about 4000 to 11,000 C.G.S. units, the residual
magnetism is nearly constant.              Its mean value in a number of
determinations was—
   For Lowmoor iron, residual induction, g, = 510 per sq. cm.
   For Swedish iron, residual induction, @, = 500 per sq. cm.
   These results showed that pieces of the form of Sample B (<U+FB01>g. 2)
retained only a small part (less than 1/60) of their greatest induction
when withdrawn from the <U+FB01>eld.                  The proportion of residual to

greatest induced magnetism in samples of the form A (<U+FB01>g. 1), is
probably not very di<U+FB01>erent from this.
   In the following experiment a bobbin of annealed Swedish iron, of
the size and shape shown in <U+FB01>g. 2, was tested by withdrawing it from
the <U+FB01>eld. The columns of the table have the same meaning as before,
except that the quantity in column VIII, now headed g —- g,, is not
the whole induction per sq. om., but that part of the induction which
disappeared when the test-piece was withdrawn from the <U+FB01>eld.                      In
this case the section of the iron was the same as before, but the space
between the inner and outer induction coils (S3) was 0308 sq. cm.
There were fourteen turns in the inner coil and twelve in the outer.

   Another     set  of readings were taken with this sample             at the same
time, by drawing it suddenly out of the <U+FB01>eld, in order                 to determine
the   residual induction.       The results showed that throughout the
range of magnetic forces employed here, the residual induction had a
nearly constant value of 400 C.G.S. units per sq. cm.

 also tested by drawing it out of the <U+FB01>eld. The results were in close
 agreement with those given above for the other sample.
    In <U+FB01>g. 3 the general results for Lowmoor wrought iron (Sample B)
 and cast iron are shown by curves which give the relation (1) of the
 induction g within the metal neck to the current in the <U+FB01>eld magnet
 coils, and (2) of the induction or magnetic force in the space im
 mediately surrounding the neck to the current in the <U+FB01>eld magnet
 coils.   The full lines are for the Lowmoor forging, and the broken
lines are for cast iron.    The <U+FB01>eld produced by a given current is (at
its higher values) rather less strong in the case of cast iron, probably
because the larger size of the cast iron neck allowed a greater portion
of the whole induction from pole to pole to <U+FB01>nd its way through the
metal. (Compare X1 for cast iron and for Lowmoor.)
    The magnetic force within the metal            differs from the <U+FB01>eld in
the surrounding space by _ an amount which cannot be estimated
withouta knowledge of the distribution of free magnetism on the
pole-pieces and conical faces of the bobbin. It appears probable that
with the dimensions of the various parts used in these experiments,
the magnetic force within the metal is less, but not very greatly less,
than the outside and closely neighbouring <U+FB01>eld. In the absence of
any exact knowledge of g, it is interesting to examine the relation of
§ to the outside <U+FB01>eld. Thus, (g—outside <U+FB01>eld)/41r gives a quantity
which is probably not much less than the intensity of magnetism
The values of this quantity for Lowmoor wrought iron, Swedish
wrought iron, and cast iron are stated below. In the case of the
Swedish iron the values of § —§, given in the previous table for that
metal have had 500 added to allow for the residual magnetism.
Again, the quantity g/outside <U+FB01>eld is probably not much less than
the magnetic permeability In: its values also are given below.

 there is   a maximum of the induction            The value of    y  capable of
 being reached by the method we have employed depends mainly on
 the scale of the experiments. Larger <U+FB01>eld magnets with pole-pieces
 tapering to a narrow neck should yield values of           3 greatly in excess
 even of those we have observed.
     The experiments will be continued and various qualities of steel will
 be examined with the following modi<U+FB01>cation in the apparatus :—The
 pole-pieces will themselves be turned, at the ends which face each
 other, into cones with <U+FB02>at ends, between which the test-piece in the
 form of    a  round cylinder will be inserted. The induction will be
 measured in the neighbourhood of a medial transverse plane only, and
 the value of the <U+FB01>eld outside the iron will be determined in this plane
 at various distances from the axis. Since there          is
                                                           no free magnetism
 in the iron bar in the medial plane, the magnetic force within the
 metal  is   continuous with the force in the surrounding space, and a
 curve showing the relation of the magnetic force at various points
 outside to the distance from the axis should admit of being produced
 so as to give      good approximation to the magnetic force within the
                    a
 metal. If this can be successfully accomplished, the value of the
isthmus method of examining the magnetisation of iron will be greatly
enhanced.

called the “isthmus” method nearly three years ago, but gave                 up

coil but not through the iron. In the present experiments this dif<U+FB01>
culty has been avoided mainly by using larger bobbins with a single
layer of <U+FB01>ne wire for induction coil.      I  am indebted to Dr. Hopkin
son for the suggestion (soon to be put in practice) that the “isthmus ”

 1.  “Note on the Development of Voltaic Electricity by Atmo
       spheric Oxidation.”        By C. R. ALDER WRIGHT, D.Sc.,
       F.R.S.,   Lecturer on Chemistry and Physics, and C.
       THOMPSON, F.C.S., Demonstrator of Chemistry, in St. Mary’s
       Hospital Medical School.       Received March 10, 1887.
    It is well known that when metallic copper is brought into contact
simultaneously with atmospheric air and aqueous solution of ammonia,
rapid oxidation is set up, the copper oxide formed dissolving in the
liquid, producing a blue solution of ammoniacal         cupric oxide, or
euprammonium hydroxide.          Whilst investigating processes for the
manufacture of this <U+FB02>uid (now used commercially on a considerable
scale) we noticed that if the air supply be greatly in de<U+FB01>ciency
relatively to the bulk of the copper, under certain conditions the
solution is but little coloured, containing copper dissolved principally
as cuprous, and not as cupric, oxide.      This might, perhaps, be antici
pated d priori, inasmuch as it is well known that blue cupric solution
in ammonia, when digested with metallic copper in the absence of air,
takes up a second equivalent of copper, becoming colourless cuprous
solution ; but further experiments seem to indicate that the production
of cuprous oxide under the oxidising in<U+FB02>uence of a limited supply of
air is the primary action, and not merely a secondary result ; in short,
that the <U+FB01>rst step in the change is expressed by the reaction-—
                             4Cu+02 =     201120;
cuprous oxide being formed, which then (under favourable conditions)
becomes further oxidised to cupric oxide, thus——
                          2Cu20+02     = 4CuO,
and not by the reaction—
                            2Cu+02 = 2CuO;

  1887.]       Voltaic Electricity by Atmospheric Owialation.             213
 the cupric oxide thus formed as the <U+FB01>rst product becoming subse
 quently reduced (in the absence of air) to cuprous 0 :ide, thus—
                             CuO+Cu =         CuSO.
     When a sheet of copper is kept out of direct contact with air by
  being immersed in ammonia solution, oxidation of the metal is
 gradually eifected by virtue of the dissolving of oxygen from the air
  at the surface of the <U+FB02>uid, and diffusion of the oxygen solution to the
 vicinity of the copper.     This action is an extremely slow one if the
 copper be covered by some depth of <U+FB02>uid, and if the setting up of con
 vection currents through heating or evaporation be prevented by
 keeping the vessel perfectly at rest and at an equable temperature, and
 well closed to prevent escape of ammonia; but if these precautions be
 neglected it goes on much more rapidly, and the liquid compara
 tively soon becomes blue; it can, however, be also materially acce
 lerated by arranging horizontally on the surface of the <U+FB02>uid a plate of
 platinum or other electrically conducting material not chemically acted
 upon by the <U+FB02>uid, and connecting this by means of a wire, &c., with the
 copper plate. The upper conductor, or aeration plate as it may be con
 veniently termed, being simultaneously in contact with the atmosphere
 and <U+FB02>uid, attracts to its surface a <U+FB01>lm or aura of condensed gases, the
 oxygen of which becomes gradually transferred to the copper, a voltaic
 current circulating through the <U+FB02>uid and connecting wire. Cuprous,
 and not cupric, oxide thus results, dissolved in the ammonia
 solution in contact with the copper plate, the mechanism of the
 reaction being conveniently represented by the scheme—

           Copper plate   I CuQO  | H20   I  H20   |  Aiiration plate,
water being represented as the electrolyte for simplicity’s sake.        The
air <U+FB01>lm on the aeration plate being constantly renewed by absorption
from the atmosphere, the process goes on continuously as long as the
two plates are connected together by the wire.            This wire may be
lengthened    at will so as to make  the    current  which passes through it
whilst the action goes on relatively stronger or weaker according to
the amount of resistance introduced into the circuit; and by includ
ing a galvanometer or silver voltameter in the circuit the ordinary
phenomena due to the passage of currents are readily recognisable.
   A voltaic cell thus produced “runs down ” very rapidly when the
resistance in circuit is diminished, more or less recovering when the
resistance is again increased ; with a large resistance (e.g., sui<U+FB01>cient to
reduce the current density to a micro-ampere or less per square
centimetre of aeration plate surface), a very notable E.M.F. is main

tained, amounting under favourable conditions to 05 or 0'6 volt
The maximum E.M.F. thus capable of development varies considerably
with the strength of the ammoniacal solution, being the less the
weaker the <U+FB02>uid; addition of common salt or of sal-ammoniac to the
liquid notably increases the           and diminishes the internal resist
ance of the cell.      Spongy platinum in a thin layer as the aeration
plate gives higher values than thin platinum foil; the highest num
bers thus obtained, using pretty concentrated     ammoniacal brine, fell
but little short of 0'8 volt; or somewhat less than ,the E.M.F. corre
sponding with the heat of formation of cuprous oxide,* since, accord
ing Julius Thomson, Cu2,O = 40810 = about 0‘88 volt.
    It is obvious that this copper atmospheric oxidation cell has a close
connexion with the “air-battery” described in 1873 by Gladstone
and Tribe (‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 21, p. 247) in which what is virtually
an “aeration plate,” consisting of a tray full of crystals of silver is
used, opposed to a copper plate immersed in a solution of copper
nitrate. Cuprous oxide is formed in both cases, in virtue of the
indirect combination brought about between the oxygen of the air
 and the copper: but there is this great difference between the two
 (apart from the cuprous oxide being deposited as such in Gladstone
 and Tribe’s arrangement, and being kept in solution in ours), that in
 the one the cuprous oxide is formed at the surface of the copper plate
 itself, and in the other at the surface of the aeration plate.      This
 essential   difference is embodied in the above depicted scheme as
 compared with the following        one which represents   the action in
 Gladstone    and  Tribe’s cell :—

    In order to examine separately the <U+FB02>uids collecting round the two
plates after action had gone on for some time, we employed cells of
 U-shape ; and to obtain as large an aération surface as possible, we
adapted to one leg of the U a funnel (as indicated in the <U+FB01>gure)
with the stem cut 01?, and united to the U-tube by a piece of india
rubber tubing, a, slipped tightly over the junction.     The other end of
the U-tube was closed with an india-rubber cork, b, through which
passed a piece of glass tubing with a platinum wire, 0, sealed into it
at the lower end and <U+FB01>lled with mercury, thus forming a mercury
cup, and serving to make contact with the copper plate,      at,which was
soldered to the end of the platinum wire, the soldering and platinum
being coated with gutta-percha, so that only the copper plate was in
contact with the <U+FB02>uid with which the U-tube was subsequently <U+FB01>lled.
A similar glass tube and platinum wire mercury cup,          f,  served to
make contact with the aeration plate, which was conveniently sup
ported horizontally at the surface of the <U+FB02>uid in the funnel by means
of a disk of porous earthenware, e; by <U+FB01>xing      a   rim of gutta-percha
round    this disk so as to convert
                                  it  into a sort of tray like the lid of a
pill-box, and <U+FB01>lling this tray with platinum sponge, an aeration plate
of spongy metal was readily obtained.         By interposing suitable re
 sistances, galvanometer, silver voltameter, &c., in the external circuit

  216           Prof. G. F. Fitzgerald.     Clausius’s Formula    [Man 3],
  obtained on connecting the two mercury cups by a wire, the current
  passing could be modi<U+FB01>ed at will, and shown to exhibit all the
  ordinary phenomena of moderately weak currents.
     After continued action with small resistance only in circuit, the
  liquid in the funnel was found on analysis to contain no copper what
  ever, whilst that surrounding the copper plate, though colourless
  before removal from the tube, speedily became blue on exposure to
 air, and contained more or less considerable amounts of copper in
 solution, obviously originally in the condition of cup'rous oxide, CuQO.
     Following up the ideas suggested by the above observations, we are
 making a number of experiments with a variety of analogous com
 binations, in which atmospheric oxidation constitutes the essential
 chemical action taking place; by varying the nature of the aération
 plates, the metals dissolved, and the liquids employed (as also by
 substituting other gases, 0.9., chlorine, for air), a large number of
 combinations are obviously obtainable.         Some of those which we
 have so far examined present points of considerable interest, the
 oxidising action exerted under favourable conditions being strongly
 marked, so much so that certain metals, e.g., mercury and silver, not
 ordinarily prone to atmospheric oxidation, can under suitable condi
 tions be gradually oxidised and dissolved in appropriate liquids, ust
 as the copper is dissolved in the ammonia in the cell above described ;
these actions, moreover,      being accompanied     by the development of
 currents of strength suf<U+FB01>cient to cause measureable amounts of electro
 lytic decomposition outside the cell, 0.9., in a silver voltameter.
 II.   “ Clausius’s Formula for the Change of State from Liquid to
       Gas applied to Messrs. Ramsay and Young’s Observations
       on Alcohol.”      By GEO. FRAS. FITZGERALD, M.A., F.T.C.D.,
      F.R.S., Erasmus Smith’s Professor of Natural and Experi
      mental Philosophy in the University of Dublin. Received
      March 14, 1887.
     Clausius, in Wiedemann’s ‘Annalen,’ vol. 14, 1881, pp. 279—290,
        ‘
and       Phil. Mag,’ vol. 12, 1881, p. 381, and vol. 13, 1882, p. 132, has
given an empirical formula for calculating the relation between the
volume, pressure, and temperature of a substance in both liquid and
gaseous states.       The equation he gives is a continuous one for an
isothermal,     and he determines the pressure at which evaporation takes
place by considering that the work done in the transformation from
liquid to gas at a constant pressure must be equal to what would be
done if the transformation took place along the continuous isothermal.
He requires, for convenience in applying this to actual cases, to calcu_

late the values of certain rather complicated exponential functions, and
has published tables of their values which greatly facilitate the work
of comparing his formula with observations of vapour-pressures at
different temperatures.           He has compared his formula with deter
minations of vapour-pressure, &c., by Andrews and Regnault of carbon
dioxide, and by Regnault and Sajotschewsky of ether, and with
Regnault’s experiments on water, and has shown that they agree very
well.     He has also, by help of his formula, calculated the critical
temperature for water, and <U+FB01>nds it to be about 332° C., and the
critical pressure     to be 134! atmospheres.
    Professor Ramsay has kindly furnished me with his and Mr.
Young’s observations on alcohol, and                I   have compared them with
 Clausius’s formula, with which they agree very well.
    The formula Clausius has given may be described as follows :—
    The relation connecting the volume, pressure, and temperature of
a substance can be expressed by the formula—
                            RT
                              };

    In this R,      a, and <U+FB02> are constants for each substance, p is the
pressure,    1: the speci<U+FB01>c volume, T the absolute temperature, and 9 is a
function     of the temperature which vanishes with T, and for which
Clausius has given the formula—

                             <U+FB01>ec

in which b and n are constants for any one substance, and T, and 90
the values of T and 6 at the critical temperature.
    From a consideration of the isothermals represented by Clausius’s
formula it is easy to show that the critical isothermal, for which two                ,
of the tangents parallel to the axis from which pressures are measured
coincide, gives—
                                  90

    As the combination a + B occurs frequently, Clausius denotes it
by   'y.  He expresses the speci<U+FB01>c volumes of the saturated liquid and
gas by a and s, and uses an and W for a —- a and s — a. respectively.
He also uses the symbol 1'! = P/ (RT) where P is the saturated
vapour-pressure, and subscribes 0, thus Ila, to express the value of any
of these quantities at the critical point. Hence we get—

In    some of these cases, as for example for W at 0° 0., it is very
dif<U+FB01>cult to interpolate accurately into Clausius’s tables, and similarly
for the values of w near the critical point, and             I consequently do not
attribute much accuracy to these values. On the whole, however,                   I
think that, considering the enormous range of values to be represented
by the formula, it is most remarkably accurate.                 When we compare
the calculated and observed volumes of the liquid, in which case a is
of importance, we <U+FB01>nd that no constant value for a can make them
agree, for a: obviously diminishes with increased temperature, and
near the critical point the value of a for the liquid and gaseous
states is not the same.               All this means of course that Clausius’s
formula does not apply accurately to the case of alcohol. Clausius
 has not, as far as I can <U+FB01>nd, applied his formula to calculate the
volumes of liquids, and without doing so the want of*constancy in a
would not appreciably a<U+FB01>ect the result. Messrs. Ramsay and Young
have made observations of the volume of the liquid at various
temperatures and pressures, and I have compared some of their
results with the formula.             In this way it can be seen that a. must be
made a function of the pressure as well as of the temperature.              I  have
calculated the values of u — a at' certain temperatures and pressures,
and <U+FB01>nd at 110° C.——

   From this it is evident that a diminishes with increased temperature,
and increases with increased pressure.
   Notwithstanding         this, that Clausius’s formula does not at all
accurately represent the state of the liquid, there is no doubt that
it gives a wonderfully accurate general representation of the more
important features of the change of state.            In this respect it is of
enormously higher value than the formulae that only give the relations
connecting the temperature and pressure of saturated vapours. In
addition to this, which it certainly gives in a rather complicated way,
it gives the state of the liquid and gas before and after as well as
during evaporation, and enables us to calculate points on the theoretical
continuous isothermal connecting the liquid and gaseous states.              I
have calculated enough of these points to roughly sketch in these
curves that cannot be made the subjects of experimental investigation

   From this it is evident that an isothermal is a quartic curve having
 asymptotes y = O, z = O, and w+ry a double asymptote at a. cusp at
 in<U+FB01>nity, so that the point at in<U+FB01>nity on this line is a multiple point of
a high order.
   If we calculate the positions of the points of tangency of tangents
parallel to y = 0, for which consequently dy/da: = O, we have the cubic

serpentine branch, lies in the positive region of m and mostly of y, and
is the only branch of physical interest at present.               The other two
branches lie entirely in the negative region of x and y.             One of these
is somewhat parabolic,   and  lies  between    a:  =  O   and m =  —q asymptotic

       1887.
                                   (Abstract)
    The   author lays before the Society the results of experiments
extending over a period of ten years on the effects of stress and strain
on the magnetic permeabilities of iron, nickel, and cobalt.
    Two methods were employed. In one the metal to be tested—
usually in the form of wire—was placed with its axis coincident with
that of a magnetising solenoid, in most cases of considerable length
as compared with the diameter of the Wire ; round the central portion
of the solenoid was wrapped a secondary coil.            A similar pair of
primary    and    secondary coils, with  a similar piece of  the same speci
men of metal,      was  balanced   against the <U+FB01>rst by  means   of resistance
coils, so that on closing the magnetising circuit no de<U+FB02>ection was pro
duced in a delicate Thomson’s galvanometer suitably connected up
with the resistance coils and secondary coi‘ls. The alteration of mag
netic permeability produced by stress was measured by the change
necessary to be made in the resistance coils in order to restore the
balance.
    In the  second method the resistance coils were dispensed      with, and
only a metal core used in one of the two pairs of solenoids which were
connected in series each to each.        The arrangements were such that
 the pairs of solenoids, when without any cores, balanced each other’s
effects on the galvanometer, so that the de<U+FB02>ections of the latter instru
ment were due only to the magnetic permeability of the metal to be
 tested.    The alteration of permeability was in this case measured
 by the change of de<U+FB02>ection produced in the Thomson’s galvanometer.
 The second method was the one principally employed.
    In all cases, where it is advisable, the results are either given in
 C.G.S. units, or data are supplied for reducing to these units ; more
over, the author has endeaVOured to separate, as far as possible, the
 effects of stress on the permanent and on the temporary permeabilities of

 the metals,* which e<U+FB01>ects are for the most part opposite in nature. The
 paper is illustrated by a large number of curves showing the relations
 between magnetic permeability and stress and strain at dilferent tem
 peratures from 0° C. to 300° C. and upwards. The information con
 veyed by these curves it is impossible to adequately represent in an
 abstract, but the following are among the chief conclusions arrived
 at :—
     1. When there is no permanent load on an iron wire, and the mag
 netising force is small, longitudinal traction of small amount increases
 the temporary permeability.         The increase reaches a maximum very
 quickly, as the load increases when further loading begins to diminish
 the magnetic permeability, until a certain limit has been reached, for
 which the permeability is a minimum.          If the load be carried beyond
  the above limit the permeability begins to increase again with the
 load. As a consequence of the above, when the magnetising force is
 small there are two critical values of load for which the load produces
 no e<U+FB02>ect on the temporary permeability.
     2. The <U+FB01>rst of the two critical values of loading mentioned above
 diminishes with increase of magnetising force, and <U+FB01>nally vanishes
-when the latter reaches a certain limit.
     On the contrary, the second critical value of loading increases with
 the magnetising force.
     3. The maximum of temporary permeability mentioned in 1 di
 minishes as the magnetising force increases, and occurs at a less and
 less degree of loading until the latter begins to produce decrease
 instead of increase of permeability.                                     .
     The minimum of temporary magnetic permeability, on the con
 trary, increases with the magnetising force, but, like the maximum,
 occurs with a lower amount of load the higher the magnetising
force.
     4. The e<U+FB02>'ects mentioned in 1, 2, and 3 as being produced by load
 ing, are modi<U+FB01>ed when a comparatively small load is left permanently
 on the wire.      The modi<U+FB01>cations are stated in 5, 6, and 7. _
     5. For small magnetising forces loading produces no effect on the
temporary magnetic permeability, unless carried beyond a certain
limit. Beyond this limit further loading suddenly begins to increase
 the permeability.
     6. For all values of the magnetising force       the <U+FB01>rst critical value  of
loading vanishes.                                         v
     The second critical value of loading increases with the magnetising
force, but for a given magnetising force is much lower than when
there is no permanent load.
    " By the terms permanent and temporary permeabilities are meant the permea
bility for permanent magnetisation, and the permeability for temporary magnetisa
tion respectively.

 netisingforce up to a certain limit of the latter, but beyond this limit
decreases.                .
       8. The permanent magnetic permeability is increased by loading, the
amount of increase per cent. being very large for small magnetising
forces and moderate loads, but diminishing as the magnetising force
 increases.
        9. The increase of permanent magnetic permeability mentioned in
.8     rises in greater proportion than the load up to a certain limit of
  the latter. Beyond this limit it rises in less proportion than the load,
  and eventually ceases to rise with increase of load; the value, of the
  load at which this last occurs decreases as the magnetising force is

        10.  For   a wide    range of loading, the e<U+FB01>ect of the stress on the
  permanent permeability is opposite in direction to the effect on the
  temporary permeability.           Consequently loading may be found to pro
   duce either increase or decrease of permeability according as the
  permeability we are considering is temporary or permanent.
         Similarly the total magnetic permeability, since it includes both
   temporary and permanent permeabilities, may be a<U+FB02>ected by loading
   in the contrary direction to the temporary magnetic permeability, and
   the more so as the effects of loading on the permanent magnetic
 permeability are very much larger than those on the temporary
   magnetic permeability for a rather wide range both of loading and of
    magnetising force. .             T

    When the above-mentioned limit is exceeded the e<U+FB02>fect of the peré
 manent strain is reversed.
    15. The effects mentioned in 12, 13, and 14 are for the most part
really the results of subpermanent molecular strain, and can be in great
measure removed by severely shaking the wire.                                .
    16. The permanent molecular strain which is left on the removal of
any load, produces, both for low and high magnetising forces, a per
manent diminution of magnetic permeability increasing with the
strain up to a certain amount of the latter. When, however, the
strain is such that the wire is sensibly increased in length, the tem
porary permeability increases considerably, and the permanent permea
bility diminishes considerably up to a second limit of permanent
strain, when once more decrease of temporary permeability sets in.
   17. The <U+FB01>rst maximum of the decrease of permeability mentioned
in 16 at <U+FB01>rst decreases with increase of the magnetising force to
nearlyzero; it increases again, however, if we exceed a certain limit
of magnetising force.
    On the contrary, the maximum increase of temporary permeability
at <U+FB01>rst rises with the magnetising force until the permeability is more
than doubled, when it begins to fall as the magnetising force is pushed
further.
    18. Mere rest after permanent extension has little or no effect on
the alteration of the temporary permeability which is produced by
loading, whereas it very perceptibly increases the longitudinal elasti
city of iron.
    19. For magnetising forces not exceeding a certain limit there are,
for all temperatures between 0° C. and 300° 0., two critical values of
loading for which no alteration in the temporary permeability is pro
duced by the load (see 1).
 . .The value of the load at the <U+FB01>rst critical point diminishes, and that
at the second critical point increases, as the temperature is raised from
0° C. to 100° C. but as the temperature is raised still further the
<U+FB01>rst critical load becomes greater, and the second becomes less, until
at some temperature between 250° C. and 300° C. the two critical
points coincide.                                                          ,
   20.  For magnetising  forces exceeding   a certain limit the two critical
points of loading approach each other, at <U+FB01>rst slowly and then rapidly,

loads diminish with rise of temperature, but the second more rapidly
than the <U+FB01>rst.                                                        ~
   21. The effect of loading on the permanent permeability diminishes
with rise of temperature from 0" C. to 300° C.
   22. As the magnetising force increases, the total magnetic permea
bility of annealed iron _which has not been previously magnetised rises
to a maximum and then begins to decline.         The maximum permeabi.

lity.seems to occur at nearly the same point of magnetic intensity
for different specimens of well-annealed iron of good magnetic permea
bility, but not at the same point of magnet'is'i'ng force.
    23. When an iron wire has received previous magnetisation the point
of maximum permeability occurs with a higher and higher magnetising
force as the previous permanent magnetisation increases.
    The point of maximum permeability also occurs at a higher degree
of magnetic intensity when the wire has been previously subjected to
a high magnetising force.
   24:. Besides a point of maximum total permeability there a point         is
of maximum temporary permeability which occurs a little before the
<U+FB01>rst-mentioned point.
  24 and 23 are in accordance with Maxwell’s extension of Weber’s
 theory.
    25. The temporary permeability         diminished by previous per
                                           is
 manent or subpermanent magnetisation in the same direction.          The
 e<U+FB01>ect above mentioned may be very considerable, provided the mag
 netising force lies between certain limits.
    26. When the wire        well shaken after having been previously
                            is
 magnetised by    a strong force the temporary permeability     consider
                                                                       is
ably restored, and is, moreover, much more nearly            constant for
                                                                   a
different values of the magnetising force than      was either previously
                                                      it
to shaking or previously to su<U+FB01>'ering permanent'magnetisation.
   27. More than 90 per cent. of the whole magnetisation imparted
by given force to annealed iron may be permanent or subpermanent
    a
provided the magnetising force has a certain moderate value<U+FB01>“ When,
however, the force     isvery large the percentage of permanent mag
netism   ismuch diminished.
   28. When an iron wire         loaded to a certain limit longitudinal
                                 is
magnetisation has no e<U+FB01>ect on the thermo-electrical qualities of the
metal.
   The limit of loading mentioned above seems to be the same for a
given magnetising force, as that at which magnetisation has no effect
on the dimensions of the wire.
   29. The general features of the curves showing the relation
between temporary magnetic permeability and load are the same for
nickel as for iron.
   30. There are two critical points of loading at which the load has
no eifect on the temporary magnetic permeability of nickel.
   31. The load at the <U+FB01>rst critical point diminishes with diminution
of the magnetising force and <U+FB01>nally vanishes.
  * This has been already noticed by Ewing       Phil. Trans.,’ 1885, Part II), in
                                                (‘
whose important memoir other points of interest connected with magnetic induction
which are mentioned in this paper have been also discussed.

 1887.]      Stress and Strain on the Properties     of Matter.      229
    On the contrary the load at the second critical point increases as
the magnetising force diminishes.
    32. The effect of increasing the magnetising force on both the <U+FB01>rst
and second critical loads is therefore opposite in direction to the e<U+FB01>'ect
in the case of iron.
    33. Similarly the e<U+FB01>ects mentioned in 3 are opposite in direction in
nickel and in iron.
    34. Rise of temperature from 0'J C. to 300° 0. increases the maxi
mum increase of temporary magnetic permeability, which can be
e<U+FB01>ected by loading nickel wire, and diminishes the maximum
decrease.
    35. With nickel    as with iron the magnetic permeability is not
constant,   but reaches a maximum.          The magnetising force which
produces    maximum permeability is greater with nickel than with
iron, but the magnetic intensity at the point of maximum permeability
is less with nickel than with iron.
    36. Nickel wire  can by shaking be more effectually de-maguetised
than iron.
    37. Well annealed nickel     is capable of retaining subpermanently
 a very large percentage   of  the  whole magnetisation imparted.     The
maximum percentage retained is, however, not so great as with
iron.
    38. At a certain temperature the magnetic permeability of nickel
vanishes.    The temperature at which this occurs seems to be higher
the higher the magnetising force.        This last, however, may perhaps
be due to impurities in the nickel.
    39. The magnetic permeability of nickel rises with the temperature
to a maximum and then diminishes.              The temperature at which
maximum permeability occurs          diminishes  as the magnetising force
increases.
    40. The temporary effects of compression on the temporary mag
netic permeabilities of iron, nickel, and cobalt, are in the opposite
direction to the eiiects of extension, provided neither the mechanical
nor the magnetic stress exceeds a certain amount.
    41. The temporary eiiect of traction transverse to the line of
magnetisation on the magnetic permeability of iron, is opposite in
 direction to the eifect of traction in the same line as the magnetisa
 tion.
    42. Temporary torsion beyond a certain limit (see 44) increases
 the temporary magnetic permeability of iron.           The amount of in
 crease may become very large if the wire has previously suifered
 permanent torsion or permanent magnetisation in the opposite direc
 tion.
    43. Permanent    torsion decreases the temporary magnetic per
 meability.   The amount of decrease may become very large if the

 wire has previously received permanent torsion in the opposite
 direction.
     44. There is for all but very large magnetising forces a critical
 point of torsion, for which temporary torsion does not a<U+FB01>ect the
 temporary magnetic permeability.
     45. When the critical point of torsion is passed, the temporary
 permeability increases with the torsion at <U+FB01>rst more rapidly than the
 torsion, and afterwards more slowly until a maximum is reached and
 the permeability begins to decline.
     46. When the wire has previously su<U+FB02>r‘ered excessive permanent
 torsion, temporary torsion which has before produced increase of
 permeability now produces decrease.
     47. The e<U+FB01>ect of temporary torsion on the temporary permeability
 of unannealed piano-steel wire is in the same direction as with
 annealed iron which has suifered excessive permanent torsion
 (see 46).
     48. For a wide range of torsion the temporary permeability          and
the permanent permeability of annealed iron are oppositely affected
                                 ‘
by temporary torsion.
     49. Fluid pressure does not temporarily a<U+FB01>ect either the temporary
magnetic permeability of annealed iron, or the permanent magnetisa
 tion of hard steel, except, it may be, to a degree which is not com
parable with that of the ’e<U+FB02>iect of stress applied in any one direction.
     50. The application, however, or the removal of <U+FB02>uid stress like
that of the stresses of compression, extension, and torsion, shakes out
 from annealed iron a certain amount of residual magnetism.

undiluted serum-distinctly acid by means of dilute acetic or very
dilute (4 pro mille) sulphuric acid. Neutralisation does not cause its
precipitation;      the serum must have a strong acid reaction. It is
constantly present in the serum of dog’s blood, and when collected by
the centrifuge it is precisely similar in physical characters to ordinary

produces any effect, serum containing plenty of paraglobulin and
ferment but only traces of the new substance.
     But the injection of a solution of this body prevents the coagulation
 of the shed blood. Occasionally as the result of the injection very
 small thrombi are formed; possibly if more could be obtained con
 siderable intravascular clotting might be set up.
     The following is an example.
     A quantity of the new substance obtained from 300 0.0. sheep’s
 serum and well washed was dissolved in dilute alkali and salt
solution.     (The amount of substance was     I estimate 0'2 gram.)    This
solution was injected into the jugular vein of a rabbit. The blood of
this rabbit previous to the injection clotted in two minutes; after the
injection the blood drawn off remained quite <U+FB02>uid for three hours—
time of observation.      It clotted, however, directly on adding some of
the solution injected.
     The injection of considerable quantities of serum or of paraglobulin
I   have not found to have any appreciable effect.
     Of itself this substance, since it exists in so small amount, is of
little interest, but as it appears to vary in quantity in different
animals and under different circumstances, it is easy to see that
misapprehensions as to the in<U+FB02>uence of paraglobulin on coagulation
might easily arise.
     These observations also throw great doubt on the power of <U+FB01>brin
ferment to produce a so-called intoxication.
     This substance has an extremely feeble in<U+FB02>uence on dilute MgSO,
plasma, and hence contains but a trace of <U+FB01>brin ferment.               Since
 it is closely related to the <U+FB01>brin-yielding matters of the plasma, and
to the tissue <U+FB01>brinogens I have elsewhere described,               I  should
 propose to call it serum <U+FB01>brinogen.

   (apparently formed of concreted blown sand), and they have a very

were long since rightly determined to be Chelonian by Mr. Davis,
and set aside as such.
    Several of the most important of these numerous and, in general,
very fragmentary bones were originally found imbedded close together
in the same block of sandstone.                  They consist of a great part
of a pelvis, a caudal vertebra, and an imperfect skull.                        Of the
pelvis, a right ischium and a pubis are imbedded in the rock, while
an imperfect right ilium, which <U+FB01>ts well on to the ischium, is
separate; all these bones are unmistakably Chelonian.                     The caudal
vertebra has remarkable peculiarities.                 It resembles an ordinary
Chelonian caudal vertebra from the anterior half of the tail, in its
general characters; but it is strongly opisthocoelous,                 the centrum
having a deep cup behind and a correspondingly curved articular head
in front.      From the posterior part of the ventral face, two stout pro
cesses diverge, and present terminal rounded facets for the rami of the
large chevron bone which must have articulated with them.                         As a
general rule, the caudal vertebrae of Chelonia are procoelous—but
Chelydra and Gypochelys (perhaps also Stanrotypns and Platystemum)
form well known exceptions)“ in so far as the vertebrae behind the 3rd
or 41th are strongly opisthocaalons.           In fact, the vertebra in question
closely resembles the 6th or 7th of C'helydra or of Gypochelys (see
<U+FB01>gs. 1 and 2).          In the <U+FB01>rst, however, the transverse processes are

    2. The upper surface of the cranial shield is, at most, rugose in
the recent Chelydridw; in the fossil, three strong conical processes,
like horn-cores, of which the middle is the longest, are developed
from its posterior and lateral region.*
    This skull is described and <U+FB01>gured in the ‘ Philosophical Trans
actions’ for 1886 (Plate 30, <U+FB01>g. 1) by Sir R. Owen, under the
generic or subgeneric name of Meiolam'a, and is said to belong to a
Saurian reptile closely allied to the “ Megalania. prism ” described in
earlier communications.            But the skull is assuredly that of the
Chelydroid       Chelonian    to which  the pelvis and caudal vertebra belong.
What Megalam'a. prism. may be I do not pretend to say; but the
remains which         I  have described can have nothing to do with any
Saurian reptiles ; and       I  propose to confer on the genus of Chelonia to
which they belong the name of Oemtochelys.
   The singular osseous caudal sheaths described by Sir R. Owen, in
the same memoir, also appertain to Geratochelys.               They formed part
of the series of remains sent to the British Museum along with the
foregoing, in which none but Chelonian bones have yet been
discovered; and the remains of vertebrae left in these sheaths are
similar to the caudal vertebrae of the terminal fourth of the tail in the
Chelyd'ridaz.       The Snapping turtles are noted for the length and
strength of the tail and for the strong, laterally compressed,
acuminated “ scales ” which form a crest along the median dorsal line,
while others, less strongly keeled, lie at the sides of the tail. In many
Chelonia, the extremity of the tail is enveloped in a continuous sheath.
These and other scale-like structures in the Chelonia, are usually
spoken of as if they were entirely epidermal. But, a day or two ago,
Dr. Giinther informed me that in the Australian Tortoise, Manoum'a,
the great imbricated scales of the limbs contain bony scutes; and that
similar scutes are to be found in Testudo g'rwca.                 This of course,
suggested       the examination of the caudal scales of Ohelydm and
 Gypochelys ; and, having been enabled by Dr. Giinther’s kindness to
examine the caudal scales of a good sized specimen of the latter,             I have
found that those of the crest contain bony scutessl" The bony scute
corresponds very closely in form with the whole “scale,” but the
recurved apex of the latter is formed only by epidermal substance
(<U+FB01>gs. 5 and 6).
    The living Chelydra, therefore, has a caudal armature which, in
   *  It is possible that these may be dermal  bones coherent with the proper cranial
shield.
   1' The fact     is noted by Riitimeyer (Lang and Riitimeyer, “Die Fossilen
Schildkroten von Solothurn,” ‘Denkschriftsn der Allg. Schweiz. Gesellschaft,’
vol. 22).    The armature of the tail in Platysternum is for the most part arranged
in zones, of four plates in each zone; but     I have not yet been able to <U+FB01>nd any
bone in them.

 principle, is similar to that of Geratochelys, but the osseous elements
 are  relatively atrophied. There is exactly the same relation between
 the armour of species of living Crocodiles and Alligators, on the one
 hand, and those of Jacare and Caiman and the extinct Teleosauria, on
 the other.     In the former, the epidermal scales remain well developed
 on the ventral side of the body, while the corresponding osseous scutes,
 fully developed in Jacare, Caiman, and Teleosau'ria, have vanished.
    Among the detached fragments to which I have referred, there are
remains of ribs, with their costal plates; marginal and other plates of
the carapace; parts of the plastron; part of a scapula; sundry limb

bones; and several of the cranial processes called              horn-cores.” They
all agree, so far as they can be compared, with the determination
already arrived at; which, to sum it up in a few words, is that the
remains of crania and caudal sheaths from Australia, hitherto referred
to Saurian reptiles, under the names of Megalan'ia and Meiolam'a,
appertain to a hitherto unknown species of Chelonian, Oemtochelys
ahenurus, closely allied to the living Ohelydra, Gypoclzelys, and Platy
sternum.
   The evidence of this fact oifered in the present note appears to me
to be conclusive,     but it may be desirable hereafter to <U+FB01>gure the parts
mentioned and to describe them at length.
   The interest which attaches to the discovery of this singular
Chelonian arises partly from the fact, that the group of Chelonia to
which it belongs is wholly unrepresented in the fauna of Australia, as
at present known.        Platystemum is usually said to be found in China.
Dr. Gunther, however, informs me that Upper Burmah is its proper

the nearest    region in which    the'iC'h'elg/dridce  are to be found.   But
Chelydm'doe,   and, indeed,v species of the genus C'helydm, occur in
Upper Miocene (CEningen) and in Eocene formations in Europe.
Moreover, Platychelys, of the Upper Jurassic series of Bavaria and
 Switzerland is regarded by Riitirneyer as an early form of the group.
     Lord Howe’s Island is about 200 miles from the nearest Australian
mainland, and something like 400 miles, as the crow <U+FB02>ies, from the
Darling Downs, in which the caudal armour, which has been ascribed
to Megalania, was found.       The discovery of Geratochelys, therefore,
has an interesting bearing on the question of the former extension of
Australia to the eastward, on the one hand; and of the possible
 derivation of such forms as O'e'ratochelys from Asia, on the other
 hand. An elevation of the sea bottom of 6000 feet would place
 Norfolk Island and Lord Howe’s Island on a peninsula extending
 from the region of the present Barrier Reef to New Zealand; and
 the Flora and Fauna of these islands are known to have special
 af<U+FB01>nities with those of New Zealand and none with those of Australia.
     Speculations respecting the origin of the Chelonian carapace, are
 suggested by the discovery of osseous scutes in the vertebral region
 of the tail, and their coalescence in Gemtochelys to form a sort of
 caudal carapace, ridged in a manner resembling that of Chelydm and
 Platychelys. But the consideration of these points would take me
 beyond the limits of the present note.

        By T. LAUDER BRUNTON, M.D'., F.R.S., and                J. THEODORE
                                                                         i
        CASH, ‘M.D.   Received March         24, 1887.
     From a number of experiments we have found that ca<U+FB01>'ein and
  theine both cause rigor in the voluntary muscles of frogs. .All these
  experiments were made on Rana temporaria. and none on Rana escu
 ,lenta.   The action is, however, very variable, the rigor. being some
  times exceedingly well marked, and at other times not observable.
  The alteration does not depend on the dose of the alkaloid.           When
  the gastrocnemii    of the  same    frog were treated with solutions of
  ca<U+FB01>ein or theine of different strengths, the stronger solution had the
  most powerful action; but when different frogs were used, a large
   dose sometimes had little action on one frog, while a small dose had a
  powerful action on another. Theine seems to be rather more powerful
  than ca<U+FB02>'ein, but the quantitative di<U+FB01>erence betweenthem is slight.
 .There is, however, a marked qualitative difference between them,
  inasmuch as .theine tends ,to produce rhythmical contractions in the
  muscle.    Complete curarisation quickens the occurrencepf rigor. ..-.A

variation is observed in the action of the alkaloids on the different
muscles of the same frog; In the triceps theirigor is ’inore rapidly
developed,     and more extensive than in the gastrocnemius. In the
sartorius rigor commences soon, increases rapidly, lasts for some

hours, and then relaxes.
    The addition of lactic acid to a solution of theine or ca<U+FB02>’ein causes
the rigor to appear sooner, develop                 more rapidly, and attain a
                                                                                     ‘
greater maximum. Potash retards and diminishes the action of theine
or caffeine.      Guanidine produces at <U+FB01>rst its characteristic clonio cou
tractions, but these pass o<U+FB01> long before the rigor of caffeine or
theine begins, and the appearance .of the rigor is postponed as ,com'
pared with the rigor of theine or ca<U+FB02>‘ein alone.                On comparing the
eifeot of guanidine with that of chloride of barium, we found that in
the case of the guanidine the rigor was longer in occurring, and its
maximum was greater than that produced by barium salts.                         The
addition of chloride of calcium to the solution of theine quickens
rigor and makes it more extensive.                One phenomenon which seems
 deserving of attention is the rhythmic contraction of the muscle pro
duced by theine. This rhythm is so slow that it would escape attention
unless a very low rate of speed were used in the recording appar
ratus; it is sometimes as slow as from three to about one contraction
per hour; it may continue for twenty hours. The rhythm is usually
produced by small doses of theine, which do not cause a marked rigor;
 it may, however, occur at the commencement of what develops into a
 lasting rigor, or at the relaxation of a pseudo-rigor, by which we
 mean a phenomenon which might also be termed tetanic relaxation.
 The rhythm is more rapid at the commencement of its occurrence
\and sloWer towards its termination; it may be as rapid as twenty
 relaxations and contractions in an hour, or as slow as between one and
two in an hour.           The total- extentzof contraction and relaxation is
 very small, amounting to about one-<U+FB01>fth of a millimetre.             At <U+FB01>rst {the
 contractions and relaxations are equal in duration, but afterwards the
 relaxations become more rapid and the contractions slower.                  In one
  instance we observed the remarkable phenomenon to which we have
  given the name of pseudo-rigor; in this experiment the application
.of the theine was followed by slight relaxation of the muscle, 'to' this
  succeeded an equal contraction, and then followed great relaxation
below the normal, - so great indeed that the negative curve below the

      Chemical Constitution and Physiological Action. Prelimi

      Bodies.”       By T. LAUDER BRUNTON, M.D., F.R.S., and
      J. THEODORE CASH, M.D. Received March 24, 1887.
   The distinctive    action of the lower members of the fatty series is
their stimulant and      anaesthetic action on the nerve-centres.
   The members of the aromatic series also affect the nervous system,
but they appear to a<U+FB01>ect the motor centres more than the sensory, so
that instead of producing anaesthesia, like the members of the fatty
series, they tend rather to produce tremor, convulsions, and paralysis.
Benzene,      chlorobenzene, bromobenzene,        and iodobenzene    are all
somewhat similar in their action on frogs; the halogen radicals not
modifying the action of the benzene to such an extent as they do in
the case of ammonium salts.            The voluntary muscles are weakened
by them,      and  there  is  a slight tendency to paralysis of the motor
nerves; but the action is chie<U+FB02>y exerted upon the brain and spinal
cord.      The brain is <U+FB01>rst affected, as shown by general lethargy and
disinclination to move. Next the cord is a<U+FB01>ected; motions are imper
fectly performed, and there is a tendency to general tremor on move
ment resembling that observed in disseminated sclerosis; sometimes,
however, the tremor is observed independently of movement.
   The addition of hydroxyl to the benzene nucleus intensi<U+FB01>es the
convulsant action, so that oxybenzene           (carbolic acid) and dioxy
benzene cause convulsions in frogs, and trioxybenzene causes jerkings,
though of a slighter character.

                                    I. Introduction.
    The optical e<U+FB02>‘ect of polishing the surface of a transparent body has
received the most complete investigation at the hands of Seebeckf
and till very recentlyt Seebeck’s were almost the only experiments
made on the subject.          Seebeck’s method consisted in observing with
a Nicol the light of a lamp re<U+FB02>ected from the surface of the body.
By means of a divided circle, the angle of polarisation was measured,
and it was from an alteration in this angle that a change in the state
of the surface was inferred. But it has been since shown by aminI                J
that, when plane polarised light is incident upon the surface of a
transparent body, the re<U+FB02>ected light is in general not plane but to a
measureable degree elliptically polarised, and consequently there is no
angle of incidence at which the light can be completely quenched by a
Nicol.     It follows that, as regards our present state of knowledge,
Seebeck’s investigation is to some extent incomplete, and also that
there is some uncertainty in the determination of the angles of
polarisation, which may a<U+FB01>ect our conclusions as regards the state of
the surface, especially since the diiference produced by polishing is
according to Seebeck not very large. Both Sir David Brewster§ and
M. Jamin were of the opinion that Seebeck’s experiments should be
repeated, and the latter promised to consider the effect of polish
later on but appears never to have done so. Mr. Glazebrook kindly
pointed out to me that the subject presented a suitable <U+FB01>eld for
research, and, at his instance,         I  undertook the present investigation.
    My object has been to attain greater accuracy than hitherto by
 employing for an analyser a quarter undulation plate in addition to a
 Nicol, so as to make the extinction of the re<U+FB02>ected light very
 complete.      The angle of incidence of the polarised light falling on the
 surface of the crystal was kept constant, in order to measure as
 directly as possible the alteration produced by change of polish.                 Both
 the azimuth of the major axis and the ratio of the axes of the
 elliptically polarised light were calculated. These quantities furnish

        two independent tests of a change of surface, and completely
determine the nature of the light, so that a knowledge of their values
before and after polishing enables us to state the precise alteration
produced in the re<U+FB02>ected light, a question which has never been
investigated, and   is,
                    I believe new to this paper.
                                     II.   Apparatus.
    A series of preliminary experiments were made to discover what
apparatus was best suited for the investigation.            found that,
                                                                   I
whether a Nicol or a Nicol and          quarter undulation plate were
                                               a
used as analyser,   itwas best to polarise the light before incidence.
Also, observations showed me that       Nicol and a quarter wave plate
                                               a
were a more sensitive arrangement than          simple Nicol, supposing
                                                        a
that in each case the light was polarised before incidence.        have      I
therefore  deemed  it necessary to  employ  the Nicol and  quarter wave
plate arrangement in order to secure all the accuracy that      possible    is
by completely quenching the re<U+FB02>ected light.
   The instrument  I   used was an elliptic analyser kindly lent for the
purpose   of these experiments by Professor Stokes.
   A very full description of the instrument will be found in the
‘
  Phil. Mag.’ for 1851, but the following abbreviated account      given         is
in order to explain the way in which      was used during the course of
                                                it
the experiments.
   The elliptic analyser consists of a brass annulus attached to a
vertical stem which <U+FB01>ts into a hollow cylindrical foot. When the
foot    placed on a table, the plane of the annulus
        is                                              vertical.
                                                              is    Within
the annulus turns        abrass graduated disk; and the angle through
which it turns     is read off by means of verniers engraved on the
annulus. These verniers are therefore <U+FB01>xed.        The disk     pierced by
                                                                       is
a  central aperture on the side of which opposite the incident light      a           is
screw thread, so that        cell containing a quarter wave plate can be
                               a
screwed into the disk.       In front the disk carries a hollow cylinder
turned in the lathe with the disk itself. Round the cylinder turns a
collar into which        screwed a tube containing the analysing Nicol.
The collar carries      a is
                         pair of level edged verniers by which the angle
may    be read   off through   which the Nicol has been turned. These
verniers are   therefore   moveable.   Thus the quarter wave plate moves
in azimuth, carrying the Nicol along with              and the Nicol has
                                                            it,
likewise an independent motion in azimuth. In observing, the light
is  extinguished by       acombination of the two movements, in which
 case the elliptically polarised light is converted by the quarter wave
 plate into plane polarised, which          then quenched by the Nicol.
                                                   is
 There are two principal positions in which the light can be quenched,
 and, since either Nicol or quarter plate may be reversed by turning
 through 180°, there are four subordinate positions corresponding to   '
                                                                            s    2

244         Mr. C. Spurge.               Oh the      Eject of Polish   on the
each principal   position. The position of the Nicol is determined by
the readings of the two moveable and that of the quarter wave plate
by the readings of the two <U+FB01>xed veruiers. Thus each principal
position is determined by eight readings, and in the tables which
follow, each number is the mean of eight readings.
    Suppose that R, R' are the mean readings of the <U+FB01>xed,           the         1',   'r'
mean readings of the moveable verniers, then the quantities, which                      it  is
the object of the present investigation to determine, are tan 1r, the
ratio of the axes of the ellipse,  the azimuth of the major axis of the
                                           I,
ellipse, and these are given by the formulae—
                        cos 21*    = sin ('r'—r)/sin (R'—R),
and                                I     = %(R'+R).
  These             determine or
            equations                              absolutely, but

from an arbitrary zero which will                   remain <U+FB01>xed so long as the quarter
plate isnot unscrewed from its                     containing tube, but which will be

  A   subsidiary quantity           is   the retardation of the crystal plate,
                                         p,
which may be determined             by means of the equation,
                        cos   p   = tan ('r'—'r)/ tan (IV—R).
  The source of light employed was an Argand burner, the rays from
which were polarised by means of a Nicol before incidence.
                                    III.      Adjustments.
   The tube' of the polariser was levelled and its axis placed in   direct      a
line with the centre of the <U+FB02>ame. The height of a small brass table, on
which the crystal was placed was adjusted so that the re<U+FB02>ected light
passed through the tube of the analyser.           number of preliminary
                                                             A
observations were made to determine the best angle of incidence, i.e.,
the angle at which the extinction was most rapid.
   The best position of the analyser having been found, the centre of
the tube of the analyser was adjusted to the same height as the centre
of the tube of the polariser and the centre of the face of the crystal.
 The tube of the analyser was so directed that a ray of light from the
centre of the <U+FB02>ame passing along the axis of the polariser was re<U+FB02>ected
 so as to enter at the centre of the tube of the analyser and leave at the
 centre of the tube.
    As the present experiments were directed to discover a difference
 which at the outset was recognised as possibly small, especial care
 was taken to secure <U+FB01>xity of position in the parts of the instrument
 and in the position of the face of the crystal of Iceland spar.

                   Re<U+FB02>exion  of Light from Iceland Spar.              245
    The instruments were <U+FB01>rmly attached to a laboratory table, and
 before commencing the moveable parts were examined and tightly
 screwed up. Round the base of the table and the foot of the analyser
 a small quantity of melted paraf<U+FB01>n was poured so as to form con
 necting links from one part of the apparatus to another. From time
 to time these links were examined and found to be unbroken.
    To attach the crystal to the table, hard electrical cement was used.
  The plan <U+FB01>nally adopted was to place the crystal on the table, and to
 <U+FB01>x it by pouring a small quantity of melted wax down the back of it.
    Since the crystal was removed from the table to polish its surface,
 some means of restoring it to its original position were needed.     The
 following optical method was employed»
    A circular diaphragm with a. central pinhole was <U+FB01>tted. to the brass
 tube containing the polarising Nicol.      If the pinhole were slightly
 eccentric, the position of the hole would change as the disk rotated in
 its plane. To obviate any such alteration, a radius was drawn on the
 diaphragm which was set so that it was horizontal and always pointed
 in the same direction. In front of the source of light was placed a
 screen having a small hole at the same height as the pinhole in the
 diaphragm.     The position of the screen was de<U+FB01>ned by lines drawn on
 the table.
    Thus only a single ray of light was allowed to fall on the surface of
 the crystal, viz., that passing through the apertures in] the screen and
 diaphragm. As these apertures could always be replaced in the same
 position, the direction of this incident ray was a <U+FB01>xed horizontal
 straight line. In a similar manner a circular diaphragm with a
 central pinhole was <U+FB01>tted to the brass tube containing the analysing
 Nicol, and some distance in front of this tube wasv placed a screen
 with a pinhole at the same height as the pinhole in. the diaphragm.
 The position of the screen was de<U+FB01>ned as before by lines- drawn on the
table.    A radius was drawn on the diaphragm, and also,since the tube
itself was moveable, a mark was made on it so that it could be turned
into the same position.
    The crystal was placed on the brass table so that its plane was
vertical and passed through the centre of the circular top.
    On placing the eye opposite the aperture in the screen facing the
elliptic analyser, it was found that a bright dot of light was visible.
Thus the horizontal incident ray already mentioned must have been
re<U+FB02>ected by the crystal surface so that it passed through the apertures
in the screen and the diaphragm <U+FB01>tted to the analysing tube. These
apertures could be replaced in the same position, and therefore the
direction of the re<U+FB02>ect-ed ray was a <U+FB01>xed horizontal line. Consequently
the normal to the surface of the crystal bisecting the angle between
 the incident and re<U+FB02>ected rays was a <U+FB01>xed direction.
    Supposing the crystal to have been taken down for polishing, it

 246           Mr. C. Spurge.         0n  the   Eject of Polish    07!. the
 could   be restored to position by placing the diaphragms and screens
 in their proper stations, and setting the crystal so that a bright dot of
 light was visible to the eye in front of the last screen.
     The only possible changes in position that this method allows are a
 displacement parallel to the table and a rotation of the face of the
 crystal in its own plane.           The former was prevented by means of
 <U+FB01>xed marks on the table, and the latter by taking every precaution to
 leave the base of the crystal in contact with the table unchanged, and
later   on by the use of a template.
    A  series   of experiments were made           to determine whether the dia
 phragms and screens could be removed and replaced in exactly the same
 positions. For this purpose the screens and diaphragms were removed
 one ata time and replaced, using only the setting lines. It was found
 that the dot of light remained visible, while the slightest displace
 ment of the screens caused it to disappear.
    During each set of experiments the screens and diaphragms were
frequently replaced to determine if the crystal remained unmoved.
    'The surface of the crystal was shielded during the day by a box
 with apertures, and completely covered at night.                    In taking the
 readings the quarter wave plate and Nicol were turned into such
 positions that the centre of the <U+FB01>eld was as dark as pessible.
                 IV.    Emper'iments made with a Natural Face.
     Observations were now made with the light re<U+FB02>ected from that
 natural face of the crystal which seemed the best.                  The results are
  given in Tables I, II. The observations made with the crystal were
 always consecutive, none being rejected after the <U+FB01>rst satisfactory
  observation had been taken.

   We are calculating p merely for the purpose of veri<U+FB01>cation, and are
not using it to determine the nature of the polarised light.                            Take,
then, p to be the least positive angle which satis<U+FB01>es the last equation.
Thus p = 111° 14'. This is the mean value of p. To estimate the
error in determining p, take the 12th set of observations in Table I.

whence p    = 115° 19'. There is thus a difference of 4° in the extreme
value  of p from the mean. The cause of this apparently large varia~

                                  Face Polished.
   The crystal was taken down from its position on the brass table,
and,   in order to ensure that the face from which the light was
re<U+FB02>ected was ground parallel to itself, the inclinations of t-he face to
two other faces which were left untouched, were obtained before and
after polishing. The measurements were made in the usual way with
the spectrometer.      It was found that a fair image of the slit could be
obtained by re<U+FB01>exion at each of the faces.              Three times the crystal
was completely dismounted and measurements of each angle taken.

   The angles are almost unaltered and the differences are within the
limits of experimental error.           Lines were drawn round the sides of
the crystal parallel to the edges, and after polishing remained still
parallel, which was an additional con<U+FB01>rmation.                  The conclusion at
 which we arrive is that the polished face was parallel to the natural
face.
                     VI.   Method of Polishing the Crystal.
   The natural face which had been the subject of the experiments
recorded in Tables I and         II  was polished.       The polishing was per
formed by myself to ensure an exact knowledge of the treatment it
received.
   I  am indebted to Professor         Threlfall for  the use of the apparatus
and materials.      As previous experimenters seem to have experienced
a dif<U+FB01>culty in obtaining a surface polished in the same manner,                it may
be well to state the exact mode of polishing the surface.
   That   the crystal might be polished under the same conditions                  of
pressure, a rectangular block of lead was cemented to the crystal.                 In
polishing especial care was taken not to press on the crystal down
wards, but to exercise only lateral pressure.               The crystal was <U+FB01>rst
polished with emery on a plate of glass which had been rendered
plane by grinding on a slate. The emery was prepared as follows:

                    Re<U+FB02>exion     of Light from Iceland Spar.                         249
some very <U+FB01>ne emery was           scattered     over a tub of water and allowed
to  settle; after standing for         a number of         minutes, the liquid was
poured elf, and the sediment, which was deposited on standing for a
further number of minutes, was preserved for use. Five kinds of
emery were used, viz. :—
                 Stood     1  minute, deposited in         5  minutes.
                     n     5              ,,              15      n

                     ,,    2  hours       ,,             410      ,,
   The crystal was polished about twenty minutes with each kind in
 a perfectly quiet room to avoid dust being deposited on the glass and
 causing <U+FB02>ecks in the crystal.
   Next a bed of re<U+FB01>ned pitch was prepared having its upper surface
perfectly plane. Upon this the crystal was polished with rouge for
about three hours.         Finally, the surface was carefully cleaned by
washing it in a stream of water.
            VII.    Experiments made with         the same Face      Polished.
   The screens were carefully set in their places, and by means of
these the crystal was <U+FB01>xed in the same position as formerly by the
method described towards the end of Section III. Then the observa
tions recorded in Table        III  were taken consecutively.

Taking from Table       III the mean       values of     R'—R, r’—r,    we have—
                     cos 2w   =
                                    sin 86'769

                                                  _   0 99873'
Thus w = 1° 266’, and we obtain for the values of the quantities,
which we are seeking in order to determine the nature of the polarised
light,
          tan w = 002520,                                  I = 107'819°.
Comparing these values with those formerly obtained which follow
Table II, we see that the e<U+FB01>ect of polishing is to cause a small
alteration of the ratio of the axes and in the inclination of the major
axis of the ellipse. Thus the ratio of the axes has been changed from
003346 to 002520, while the inclination has been changed from
108'088° to 107-819°, an alteration of about 16’.               These results also
show that the re<U+FB02>ected light is exceedingly nearly plane polarised.

   The value of   ,0 obtained before polishing          was——
                                    p  =  111° 14’.
   These values are not the same, but this has no bearing on the
polishing, inasmuch as p is a constant of the instrument and is inde
pendent of the crystal.

   In order to test the truth of the results we have arrived at, a
Nicol’s prism, the azimuth of which could be read off by a divided
circle to 3', was mounted on the side of the table opposite to that on
which the elliptic analyser was, in such a position that, when the angle
of incidence was the same as before, the light was re<U+FB02>ected along the
tube containing the Nicol.      It was found that the light re<U+FB02>ected
from the surface could be reduced to a minimum but could never be
completely eclipsed.    The minimum was very small but quite per
ceptible. This might be due to the fact that the light was not homo
geneous.     But further experiments showed that, even with, orange
and   rubyglasses there was a perceptible minimum.        Next the inci
dence  was   increased  and   diminished   in succession by 5°, and the
same result obtained.      We, therefore, conclude as before, that the
light was slightly elliptically polarised.
VIII.   Discussion of    the   Determination of the Retardation of the Quarter
                                     Wave Plate.
  We have now to inquire into the discrepancy of the values of p,
which have been found before and after polishing, viz. :—p = 111° 14/
and p   =    116° 37'.
  Now, cos    p is the ratio of the tangents of two angles, one of which
is very nearly 90°. Consequently, a very small error in this last
angle will produce a considerable change in the value of cos              We                  ,0.
therefore come to this conclusion, that          not a good plan to deter

                                      is                      polarised.   To
determine more accurately the value of p, a steel plate was substi
tuted for the crystal. At <U+FB01>rst, white light was used as before, but
the image was found to be strongly coloured.              The difference in
readings for blue and red rays was several degrees.          After trying a

  From Table        V
                   we may <U+FB01>nd I with what accuracy we can work with
the elliptic analyser.
   The greatest difference between the mean and a single observation
is 0003, so that the error of determination of tan w is less than a per
centage. The mean value of                I
                                is 47'188", and the greatest error O‘236°
or 14'. The mean value of p is 81° 29', and the greatest error is some
what less than 26'. Let cl be the space retardation measured in air
for wave-length X, then—
                                              p   =    gird/X.
  Thus the error in the determination of                              p expressed       in wave-lengths
is—

    As in the experiments tanw = 03209, this is very nearly the case
in which the accuracy of the analyser has been determined by Pro
fessor Stokes. The present results agree well with his limits of
accuracy.
    “The mean error of single observations amounted to about          in                                11°
the determination of the azimuth of the principal axis, about three or
four thousandths in the ratio of the minor to the major axis, and a.
little more than    athousandth part of an undulation in the determina
tion of p.”*
    We notice that in the mode of expressing in degrees an error will   p
be made more apparent, for the formula        = 21rd/7t shows that thep
space retardation      divided by the small quantity )t. Thus, express
                        is

 1%  per cent. of a wave-length.

the experiments made on the crystal face were performed with white
light. It was not possible to determine p accurately for blue rays, as
a blue glass absorbed too much light.   We cannot, therefore, employ
the value of p as determined by the steel plate to accurately correct
the observations made with the crystal.   Nevertheless, let us see what
the effect of the substitution will be.

  Thus, even when the value of                p   for red light     as determined by the

   This discussion shows us that while the steel plate affords a more
accurate means of determining p for light of given refrangibility, yet
p is to a large extent a purely instrumental constant, such that its
value has no effect on the character of the results, and, when we con
sider that white light was used in the previous experiments, the value
of [1 determined by Tables I, III, would seem to be con<U+FB01>rmed by the

value unless the time elapsed since polishing were speci<U+FB01>ed.                       I  found
that preceding experimenters had made investigations on this point
in regard to a few bodies, and had come to the conclusion that the
surface did not alter with the time. Thus Seebeck found such a re

proved that in the case of metallic surfaces the surface state is a
fairly permanent one, not being destroyed by contact with a liquid or
a considerable amount of rubbing with a chamois leathersf                         It there
fore naturally occurred to me to examine this question for Iceland
spar.
   For this purpose          a simple analyser consisting of a Nicol and a
graduated       circle  was   set up on the side of the table opposite to the
elliptic analyser, and placed in such a position that the light could be
reduced to a minimum.                 The observations taken are recorded in
Table VIII.

    Thus there is in the period of six weeks no time variation of a
polished    surface, for the di<U+FB01>erences between the means are quite
within the limits of experimental error. Also this result is con<U+FB01>rmed
by the general character of the observations made with the elliptic
analyser, which often extended over some weeks, during which no
change was noticed.
  XI.   Variation of Surface State of a Polished Crystal with Change of
                                       Temperature.
   An attempt was made to secure greater accuracy by altering the
arrangement of the parts of the elliptic analyser. For this purpose
the screw <U+FB01>xing the vertical stem was loosened, and the circular rim
rotated through two right angles about the stem as axis.                       The Nicol
was unscrewed from its collar, and the cell containing the quarter
Wave plate from the disk.               The quarter wave plate was now con
nected with the collar and the Nicol with the disk.                      In this mode of
                           *  ‘

256        Mr. C. Spurge.       On the E<U+FB02>ect       of Polish  on the
arrangement, therefore, the Nicol moves in azimuth, carrying the
quarter wave plate with it, while the quarter wave plate has likewise
an independent motion in azimuth.
                                I
   After taking 700 readings became convinced that the accuracy of
this mode of using the analyser was less than previously.               A sub
sequent investigation of the theory, made by tracing the surface locus
of a point whose coordinates represented the intensity of the trans
mitted light, and the azimuths of the Nicol and quarter wave plate,
seemed to con<U+FB01>rm this conclusion.
   It is well known that in the case of some bodies the application of
heat considerably in<U+FB02>uences the mode in which they re<U+FB02>ect light.
Thus, in the case of <U+FB02>int glass, Sir David Brewster produced as great
an alteration as 9° in the polarising angle by varying the temperature.*
To test the alteration in the case of Iceland spar, a small tray <U+FB01>lled
with ice was placed on the top of the crystal, all the rest of the appa
ratus being carefully protected, especially the woodwork.             I  found
that, leaving the quarter wave plate and Nicol untouched, no per
ceptible effect was produced by lowering the temperature of the
crystal 8°, and also that no difference could be detected when observa
tions were taken.    I  conclude that in the case of Iceland spar for
moderate ranges the effect of temperature is insensible.
                    XII.  New Series of Observations.
   Since the change in the mode of using the elliptic analyser de
scribed in the last section had diminished the accuracy of the obser
vations, it was considered best to revert to the original arrangement
of the parts of the analyser. The instrument was therefore reversed.
The screw which <U+FB01>xed the stem of the analyser was unloosened, and
the disk rotated through two right angles about the stem as axis. The
tube was set to point in the same direction as before by means of the
diaphragms and screens.        The quarter wave plate was unscrewed
from the collar and the Nicol from the disk.               The quarter wave
plate  was  now  connected  with  the   disk   and  the Nicol  with the collar.
Thus the arrangement of the parts of the analyser was now exactly
like that described in Section II.
    Since the quarter wave plate has been unscrewed, we must no
longer expect the values of I to be the same as in Table IV. There
will be a constant difference between the preceding series of values
and those which follow, because the arbitrary zero from which              I is
measured is now changed.        For these reasons it is necessary to take
 a new set of observations to serve as a standard of reference.
    Sir John Conroy has attempted to determine the effect of polishing
 a crystal of Iceland spar by observing with a simple analyser the

a view to a comparison of my own work with his results, a second
Argand burner was placed close to the former. The brass table was

tion that the incident light was re<U+FB02>ected to the opposite side of the
table to that on which the elliptic analyser was placed.   The re<U+FB02>ected
light was observed   with  a simple analyser consisting  of a Nicol, the
azimuth of which could be determined by means of a divided circle
and verniers to 3’.

 the difference produced by the reversal of the instrument     not at all            is
 comparable with the difference produced by polishing.

 mean reading will correspond to the azimuth of the major axis of the

      It
      was suggested that the setting of the crystal was such as to
 allow a, rotation of the face in its own plane, which might possibly be
 the  cause of the diiferences hitherto observed.        A wedge of 4° 27'
 angle was constructed, and upon this the crystal was placed.              So
 delicate was  the  mode  of setting  by screens that, even with  the  labour
 of hours, was unable to turn the crystal into such a position that
            I
 the re<U+FB02>ected ray emerged through the pinholes.             therefore took a
                                                                        I
 thin sheet    ofpaper and gently were its surface away so as to obtain
 a <U+FB01>ne wedge which was drawn under a corner of the crystal.           By this
 means the re<U+FB02>ected ray with some trouble was rendered visible.           The
  observations   are divided  in  the  following table into sets of two or
  three.   Each set was taken after the crystal had been taken off the
  Wedge and replaced upon        in position by means of the screens.

260           Mr. C. Spurge.          0n    the       Eject of Polish   on the
   Table     VII
              shows us that the e<U+FB01>ect of polishing is to decrease   from               I
108'088o t0 107'819°, a diminution of O'269°.   Since then a rotation of
4° 27’ produces an increase of0166; to produce an e<U+FB01>ect equal to that
of polishing by rotation, the crystal face would have to be rotated in
its own plane 8°. No such error of setting was possible.
   Again,
             r’—-r = 94'137°,              and               R'—R =    91'665".
   The last reading is of an altogether di<U+FB01>erent magnitude to what
has hitherto occurred.
   A template’was constructed and used in future observations to test
the accuracy of setting.  It was found that the setting by the screens
was always correct on afterwards being examined by the template,
and when it was out of adjustment by the screens the template did
not <U+FB01>t. These three grounds seem to be more than suf<U+FB01>cient for the
rejection of the hypothesis of a rotation of the crystal face in its own
plane.
  It may be of some interest to calculate the value of the change in
the ratio of the axes produced by a rotation of 41° 27’. We therefore
                                           m,
calculate it—
                                           sin 94'137
Thus                     COB    2w    -—
whence                           W    =    1°   536',
and                       tan iv = 003305.
The value before rotation was
                          tau    er   = 002655.

   Much of the value of the observations on polishing must depend
on the fact whether the crystal can be polished in the same manner,
that is, polished and repolished so as to obtain the same results. The
crystal was, therefore, submitted to the same process 'of polishing as
has been described already in Section VI.     The observations with the
same face  thus  repolished are recorded in Table XII.

262           Mr. C. Spurge.         On the     Efect of Polish    on the
    The observations in Table X11 made with the elliptic analyser are
divided into sets of 12, for our object is not only to determine what is
the change produced by repolishing, but also to discover the error of
a mean of 12 sets of observations with a view to <U+FB01>xing the accuracy
of working with the elliptic analyser, and also the errors of the
means of the sets of observations recorded in Tables I—IV.                        For
convenience of comparison the means are exhibited together in
Table XIII.

    We now proceed to consider the accuracy of the sets of obser
vations     with the elliptic analyser.            Table XIII shows that the
greatest deviation of a single set of 12 observations from the mean
is less than 1'6 per cent. for the ratio of the axes. The best set
diifers from the mean by under % per cent. Again, Table XII shows
                                                             I
that the greatest deviation from the mean for is 0046" or under 3',
whereas the least deviation from the mean is under 1'.                      We take,
then, the upper limits as the errors of observations. Let us now
consider the e<U+FB01>ect produced by repolishing.                 Before repolishing, the
calculation following Table 1X shows that——
                                 tan 1' = 0'02655.
     After repolishing, Table      XIII shows      that——
                                 tan  1:  = 002723.
     The difference between the two values of tanw is 2} per cent.,
 which may be covered by the limits of errors of observation.
    Again, rbefore repolishing—
                                     1  =    87‘654.°
     After repolishing, Table     XII    shows that——
                                     I  =    87'712°.
     There is thus a difference of 0'058° or 3'48’, which is covered by the
 limits of errors of observation.

                    Re<U+FB02>exion of         Light from Iceland Spar.                           263
   Again, Table VII shows that the effect of the <U+FB01>rst polishing was to
diminish   I from 108088" to 107'819°, a diminution of 0269"; but the
effect of the second polishing has been to increase                       I from 87'654?’ to
87712", an increase of 0'058°.             Thus the effect of the polishings has
not been cumulative so as to cause the original deviation of polishing
to increase still further on second polishing.                      On the contrary, I has
approached by      a small     quantity     the   value     it  would     have for a natural
face.   The inference maybe drawn that the <U+FB01>rst polishing produced
all the effect that polishing can bring about, and that the second
polishing differs from the <U+FB01>rst by a quantity which there is some
ground for regarding as an error of experiment. But if this is so, it
may be thought that the values of tan w, the second independent test
of a change in the re<U+FB02>ected light, should also alter in the same manner
and sense as those of        I  have done.
   Now, Table VII shows that the effect of polishing is to diminish
tan w from 003345 to 002517, a diminution of 000828.                              Table   XIII
and the calculation following Table IX show that the effect of re
polishing is to cause time to increase from 002655 to 0'02723, an
increase of 000068.         Thus tan is changes sympathetically with I.
   In Table XIV are contained the results of' the observations made
with the simple analyser, and we have <U+FB01>rst to investigate the limits
of accuracy. In regard to single observations there can be no doubt
of the correctness of Sir John Conroy’s observation that “in order
to obtain accurate results with observations of this kind, it is neces
 sary to make a large number of observations, and to take their mean.”*
 Thus, in Table XIV the means of tens of readings are recorded, and
for purposes of comparison the means of <U+FB01>fties are tabulated.

    The results in Table XIV show a greatest error of 232' from the
mean for a 100 readings, and of about 4" for 10.                       Before polishing
the value of      I  as given by Table X is—
                                    I’ =     266°   53'.
    After polishing, Table        XIV      gives—
                                    1'  =    265° 57'28'.
    There is thus a difference of 8'. This is covered by the larger
limit above, but not by the lower. This is not surprising when the
errors and <U+FB02>uctuations of single observations are taken into account,
and also the number of observations.
    The parallelism of the polished and repolished faces was tested by
means of the lines drawn round the sides.                     As these lines gave no
perceptible inclination, it did not seem worth while to measure the
angles with a. spectrometer, since the differences caused by repolishing
are so small.
    Thus, we come to the conclusion that the repolishing produced
little, if any, alteration in the nature of the re<U+FB02>ected light, and that
 this alteration is very small compared with the change produced by

                   Re<U+FB02>exion       of Light from Iceland Spar.                         265”.
polishing a natural face. Also, this inference is supported by two
data as regards the elliptic' analyser, and by the results obtained with
the simple analyser.
    Sir John Conroy“ has come to a different conclusion.                     “ It did not
seem worth while to make any further experiments with arti<U+FB01>cial
surfaces, as it seemed certain the results would be untrustworthy.”
    Conroy’s experiments were made with the surface immersed in
water to secure a greater rotation.                I  am not sure that the greater
rotation would compensate for the loss of light which must ensue
when re<U+FB02>exion takes place at the surface of two media of nearly the
same density and refractive index.
    Another cause of error has been indicated by Conroy. There was
some uncertainty whether the face was polished parallel to itself.
Though it would not altogether account for the large changes
                                 I
observed by Conroy, yet found in the case of a crystal, with which I
performed a <U+FB01>rst set of experiments for two months, that a' percep
tible alteration of the inclination of the face was suf<U+FB01>cient to reduce
the elliptically polarised light to plane polarised.                  Thus as regards
my own experiments            such   a  change     of  inclination    would have been
quite fatal, and    I  abandoned the crystal.
    There is another point which is worthy of attention. An extreme
ill-luck seems to have befallen those who have had their crystals
 polished by others.        Thus Seebeck? found that in the ease of a glass 4
polished by an artist there was a di<U+FB01>erence of 28'5’, but that he
 himself could polish it so that the difference was only 29'.                    I  think
most likely this may be the probable cause of the large alterations
observed    by Sir   J. Conroy.
XV.     Experiments with a Cleavage Face parallel               to the Repolished   Face.
    To make the whole series of experiments as conclusive as possible,                  I
now attempted to make a series of experiments with a natural face as
at the beginning of the paper.               Unfortunately the crystal did not
cleave very readily. In splitting the base of the crystal came into two
or three pieces, which were <U+FB01>xed on to it again as accurately as
possible in their former position. As the sides of the crystal also came
off, the inclination of the face to the repolished face could not be deter
mined. There was some doubt as to whether the face of the crystal
was in the same absolute position.               The surface was not very good,
being   somewhat    broken,      and  as  the  re<U+FB02>exion      took place from a part
of the crystal   nearer    an   edge,  it had   to  be  placed so much on one side
of the brass table that the template could not be used.                        Then the
observations recorded in Table XV were taken.

     Thus we <U+FB01>nd that                I  =    88'358°,
 and                           tan  a"  = 003368.
     We have now to compare these results with those recorded in
 Table VII, taken some <U+FB01>fteen months previously.                  Originally we
 had——
                                 tan w = 003345,
 whereas the present       value  is—
                                  tan  in   =  0'03368.
      The agreement is very close, and, as might be expected from a com
 parison of Table VII with the results of Table IX, the latter number
  is somewhat larger than the former on account of the resetting of the
  instrument. Again, the <U+FB01>rst series of observations show that the
  eifect of polishing was according to Table VII to change                 I  from
  1080880 to 107819", a decrease of 02690, whereas the second series of
  experiments show that the result of repolishing has been according to
   Tables X11 and XV to change            I from 88358" to 87712", a decrease of
   0646". This result is correct as regards sense, but not so satisfactory
   as regards magnitude.         It must, however, be remembered that the
   breaking up of the base of the crystal would most probably have an
   in<U+FB02>uence on the value of I.
      We are now in a position to sum up the results of this investiga
   tion. The process of polishing a natural face of a crystal of Iceland
   spar with emery and rouge does most certainly alter the state of the
    surface. This alteration is evinced by a change both in the ratio of

                Reflexion  of Light from Iceland Spar.                 267
the axes and in the azimuth of the major axis of the elliptically
polarised light, and was observed in the case of two different crystals
which were made the subject of experiment.
   Since the light re<U+FB02>ected from the surface of the crystal is exceedingly
nearly plane polarised, the absolute value of the change in the ratio of
the axes is small; but the relative change is considerable, for tan or is
altered by polishing from 00334 to 00252. Also the change in the
azimuth of the major axis is not very large.
   As regards the disturbing causes, it is found that temperature and
time do not cause any very perceptible alterations in the surface state
of a polished crystal.
   The experiments prove a result unnoticed by Seebeck, that an
emery-rouge polished surface gives perfectly concordant results on
repolishing, and in this respect is quite as satisfactory as the chalk
polished surface recommended by him. This conclusion is supported
both by the elliptic and simple analysers. And in general the results
of the paper tend to con<U+FB01>rm the views of Seebeck rather than those
of Sir J. Conroy, for Seebeck in his paper prefers polished surfaces
because of the liability of the natural surface to tarnish.
   In conclusion, my best thanks are due to Mr. Glazebrook for his
advice, and to Professor J. J. Thomson for placing at my disposal a
room and apparatus in the Cavendish Laboratory.

 “Further Experiments on the Distribution of Micro-organisms
       in Air (by Hesse’s Method)”              By PERCY F. FRANKLAND,

                                     [PLATE 3.]
   In                                            “ The
       a previous communication entitled                Distribution of Micro
 organisms in Air,” a number of experiments have been recorded by
one of us on the relative abundance of microbes in the air of various
places and of the same place at different times.                 The numerical
determination     of the a'érial micro-organisms     in these experiments was
made by means of Hesse’s apparatus, the method of using which was
there fully described.      Since the publication of the above experiments
we have been extending our investigations by means of this method,
and the results which we have obtained form the subject of the
present communication.
   In addition to the determination of the number of micro-organisms
   VOL. XLII.                                                           x

268             Dr. P. F. Frankland and Mr. T. G. Hart.
in a given volume of air by means of Hesse’s process, we have also, as
before, determined in each case the number of microbes falling on a
given horizontal area in unit of time, by the exposure of small dishes
containing sterile nutrient gelatine, as previously described.
     During the hot weather we have experienced considerable dif<U+FB01>culty
in working with Hesse’s tubes, which are very liable to melt in
 transport and when exposed to the sun ; to obviate this we have made
 a practice on hot days of surrounding the outer surface of the tube
 with a coating of bibulous paper saturated with water, and this
 envelope was again covered with a coating of white tissue paper to
 prevent the former drying too rapidly.         Owing to this precaution
 we have scarcely ever lost a tube even on the warmest days.
     The greater number of our observations have been made on the
 roof of the Science Schools, South Kensington, which thus form a
 continuation of those already recorded.      We have also made further
 experiments in Hyde Park, the Brompton Hospital for Consumption,
 the Natural History Museum, and in the garden of the latter
 closely adjoining the traf<U+FB01>c in the Exhibition Road, South Ken
 sington.
                 1. Roof of Science Schools, South Kensington.
     The samples of air were here collected at a height of about 60 feet
 above     the ground in the manner previously            described.   The
 particulars of the experiments      are  recorded  in the  following table
  (Table I).
     These experiments, taken together with those already published,
 form a continuous series, excepting a few breaks, from January to the
  end of October of the present year, and serve to illustrate the changes
  which take place in the prevalence of aérial micro-organisms accord
  ing  to the seasons.
     In order to render    these results more readily intelligible, we have
  also   expressed   them‘  by means of a curve in the accompanying
  diagram (Plate 3), in which the ordinates represent the number of
  micro-organisms found in 10 litres of air, whilst on the horizontal axis
  the dates are marked off. Below, on the same diagram, the tempera
   ture of the air at the time of experiment is recorded.
      From this diagram it will be seen that, although the number of
   micro-organisms in the air frequently undergoes great changes from
   one day to another, yet the general tendency is for the number to
   follow the temperature. Thus, on taking the average of the results
   obtained in each month, the following sequence is arrived at :—

   From the above it will be seen that it is during the hottest
 months of the year—July and August—that the largest number of
 micro-organisms is present in the air. In September the number
 underwent a great reduction, which was further continued in
 October.
                  II.    Experiments in Interior of Buildings.
   In Table No.     II we     have recorded a number of experiments which
 we have made      in the interior of buildings, viz., in the Hospital for
 Consumption, Brompton, in Burlington House, in the Natural
 History Museum, in the Chemical Laboratory of the Science Schools,
 South Kensington, as well as in a barn and cowhouse in the
country.
   The results of the above experiments fully substantiate the previous
observations made by one of us, that in the interior of buildings, &c..
the number of organisms present in the air is almost wholly
dependent upon whether the latter is in a disturbed state or not, and
that when undisturbed the number is generally considerably less
than in the open air, whilst in crowded rooms the number rises
enormously.     Thus in the Hospital for Consumption, when only a
few persons were moving about the ward, the air was remarkably.
free from microbes, the number increasing somewhat when the
number of people in the room increased, but even then the number
fell very far short of that in the crowded rooms of the Royal Society
during the conversazione, or in the Natural History Museum on Whit
Monday, whilst the greatest number which we have ever recorded
was found in a barn in which the operation of thrashing was going
on, the number of micro-organisms falling on the square foot in
one minute amounting there to upwards of 8000.
                III.      Miscellaneous Open-Air Experiments.
   In Table    III    we have recorded the results of some experiments
                                                                           x 2

270            Dr. P. F. Frankland and Mr. T. G. Hart.                ‘
made    in the open air at other places than the roof of the Science
Schools.    This table includes,in the <U+FB01>rst place, a comparison between
the number of micro-organisms present in the air of Hyde Park, the
roofv of the Science Schools, and the entrance to the latter in the
Exhibition Road respectively, the experiments in these three places
being all made on the same day.        It will be seen that the air in Hyde
Park contained markedly less than either of the other two, and that
the air in the Exhibition Road in which a large amount of traf<U+FB01>c was
going on at the time was considerably richer in micro-organisms than
the air on the roof.
    Then follow several experiments made in the garden of the
Natural History Museum in the immediate vicinity of the Exhibition
Road. In every case, excepting one, this air was exceedingly rich in
micro-organisms, as was to be anticipated; whilst on the occasion
when the number of organisms was small, the wind, which was very
gentle, was not blowing from the road but over the grass of the
garden which was damp at the time.
    The above experiments are intended to form a supplement to those
already published by one of us, in which the same method of investiga
tion was pursued.      In the course of these experiments we have found
that the results obtained with Hesse’s              apparatus are liable to
considerable inaccuracy when the latter is employed in a disturbed
atmosphere, more especially when the aerial currents are irregular in
 direction.  This source of error has been fully discussed 'in another
paper by one of us, and a new method of examining air for micro
 organisms, in which this dif<U+FB01>culty is overcome, has been devised and
 its accuracy carefully tested.
     [Note—Since the communication of the above, we have completed
  the observations for November and December, with the following
 results :—

1.  “On Phosphonium Chloride.”             By SIDNEY SKINNER, B.A.,
       Scholar of Christ’s College, Cambridge. Communicated by
       Professor DEWAR, F.R.S. Received March 28, 1887 .
   At   the close of an interesting paper in the ‘ Annales de Chimie,’
vol. 20, 1880, Ogier describes the preparation of the compound
phosphonium chloride. When the two gases phosphine and hydro
chloric acid are mixed at 14° C. under atmospheric pressure they do
 not combine; but when the pressure is raised to 20 atmospheres
 small crystals of the compound PH4Cl form at the upper end of the
tube. At 26° C. these crystals melt, and the liquid formed was shown
 by some later experiments of van’t Hoff (‘Deutsch. Chem. Gesell.
 Ber.,’ Jahrg. 18, p. 2088) to reach the critical state about 50°. This
 was the extent of our knowledge when the following experiments
 were begun with a view to examine more exactly this dissociable
process, (1) in regard to its relations to temperature, volume, and
 pressure, and to those of the separate gases PH3 and H01; (2) in
 regard to the thermal changes involved in the formation of the
compound.
   This paper deals with the <U+FB01>rst part of the research only, but owing
 to the interesting results which it contains there can be little
 hesitation in putting it forth.
                    Experiments  on Phosphonium Chloride.
    Phosphine was prepared by dropping strong potlash' solution on a
 mixture of broken glass and phosphonium iodide. Afterlleaving the
 <U+FB02>ask in which this operation was conducted the gas passed through a
 tube containing moist broken glass kept at the temperature of
 melting ice, and then through a drying tube of GaC12 and P205. The
 gas was collected in tubes over mercury.      The hydrochloric acid gas
 was prepared from strong sulphuric acid and ammonium chloride.
 To obtain a mixture of equal volumes of these two gases, a pipette

was constructed so that it could be <U+FB01>lled to a. certain mark under
atmospheric pressure and at the temperature of the room. This
being <U+FB01>lled alternately with PH3 and HCl, was discharged into a large
glass tube.                  I
                In this way prepared a mixture of equal volumes of the
 two gases. Part of this was delivered into a Cailletet tube which was
set up in one of the iron bottles of a Cailletet pump; in the other
bottle was placed a Well tested air gauge.
    The temperature of the tube was maintained constant by a vapour
jacket of acetone, and altered by varying the pressure under which the
liquid boiled.
    Observations were then taken for isothermals. The following, as
useful for the present purpose, are extracted from those readings; the
whole mass of the gas used being 18'0 0.0. at 0° and 760 mm.

    The critical  point of the liquid was observed        at 48° C. and under
95 atmospheres.
   The temperature at which the crystals are formed under one
atmosphere pressure is given as —30° by Ogier.
    The formation of these crystals is evidently a dissociable one, for
when the pressure is removed they decompose into equal volumes of
the separate gases. The question whether any chemical combination
takes place before the appearance of crystals is one we shall discuss
 when considering the saturated volume curve of PH4CI in comparison
with those of its constituents.
                          Experiments on Phosphiue.
    This gas, prepared and dried as before, was passed for some hours
 through a Cailletet tube from which the air had previously been
 displaced with carbonic acid gas. After careful sealing the tube was
 placed in the iron bottle, and liquid was readily obtained at the
 ordinary temperature under a pressure of about 30 atmospheres.
    The critical state was reached with this liquid at 54° and 705
 atmospheres pressures ; so that it is easily observed when the tube is
 heated with acetone vapour.        It is interesting to compare this critical
 point with    that  of the nitrogen analogue, ammonia, which does not
 reach the critical state till 130° and 115 atmospheres pressure.           This

 is an unexpected result, as the substitution         of a less volatile element
 has    the effect of raising the critical temperature: thus for C02
  critical temperature is 31'9° and for 082 278°.
    1 have also noticed the formation of a crystalline                hydrate of
 phosphine when the gas is lique<U+FB01>ed in the presence of water. The
 liquid gas <U+FB02>oats on the surface of the water like benzene, and is
 apparently only slightly soluble.               By suddenly increasing and
 decreasing     the pressure    the two liquids are mixed together, and after
 a short time a mass of crystals is formed.

 saturated volume, maximum pressure, and liquid volume at di<U+FB02>erent

     The numbers in the column headed density are calculated by
 dividing the whole mass in grams of the gas by the volume of the
 liquid in cubic centimetres. The mass of the gas was 006-435 gram.
    The physical constants for hydrochloric acid gas used in the
 diagrams are calculated from Ansdell’s paper (‘Roy. Soc. Proc.,’
 vol. 30, 1880). The mass of the gas* he used was 0'08531 gram; and
 therefore the proper reduction has been made so that the volumes in
the diagram may be those occupied by the molecular mass of hydro
chloric acid in milligrams.
    In the <U+FB01>rst diagram I have plotted for comparison the maximum
pressure of the vapours at different temperatures both above and
below zero. In the case of PH4Cl the curve is drawn from my own
observations from the critical point to 7°; that point is joined by a
dotted curve to the point corresponding to 1 atmosphere at —30°, at
which temperature Ogier states that the crystals are formed under
atmospheric pressure. The curve for HCl below zero is from numbers
 given by Faraday (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1846). The curve for PH3 is from

Olszewski as —85°.
   At <U+FB01>rst sight it is evident that the form of the curve for PH4C1 is
not a normal one, for if it were it would lie in the same direction as
the other two. At all temperatures the pressure is much lower than
that corresponding to a mixture of the two gases PH3 and HCl, so
that it is evident forces of chemical attraction are acting.      From
—30° to 10° the curve runs normally, so it appears that the gas
probably consists wholly, from reasons we shall presently point out, of
PH3 and HCl molecules. Above 10° these two gases combine and the
pressure necessary to deposit the crystals very rapidly increases.    If
the temperature be maintained constant the whole of the mixture is
converted to the crystals of the compound under constant pressure by
reducing the volume, just as a saturated vapour is converted into a
liquid under similar conditions.

is analogous in this case to that of melting ice.    However, such an
alteration can scarcely be seen in the diagram, but would doubtless
be made apparent by very careful observations.

about 10° the saturated volume of the mixture corresponds to the sum
of that of its components, whilst about their critical points the volumes
are approximately equal.        This shows that at 10° we are dealing with
a mixture of the two gases, whilst near the critical point the mixture
has combined and the deposition of liquid takes place from gaseous
PH4Cl.
   The volumes which the liquids occupy near their critical points are
very nearly equal.       This may be shown to be the case in another
way.     It has been proved from van der Waals’ formula that the
result of dividing the critical temperature in absolute degrees by the
critical pressure gives a number proportional to the greatest volume a

   If then 4'6 volumes of liquid phosphine near the critical tem
perature were brought in contact with 3'7 volumes of liquid HCl
about the same temperature, combination would take place with
condensation of volume to nearly one half.            This is a case of combina
tion of liquids obeying a law very similar to Gay-Dussac's law for the
combination of gases under ordinary conditions of temperature and
pressure. A symbolic representation of this combination would be :—
                    PHS       +        HCl         =       PH4C1.
               1 vol. liquid +     1 vol. liquid =      1 vol. liquid.
   A close analogy evidently exists between the law of combination by
volume of these liquids near their critical temperatures and Gay
Lussac’s law; whether other cases of such a law of combination will
be found is a question which cannot yet be answered.
   Nevertheless the results in this paper appear to me to give answers
to these two questions        which Ogier states in his essay :—(1) Ce

II. “On        Principal Electric Time-constant of a Circular
             the
      Disk.” By HORACE LAMB, M.A., F.R.S., Professor of Pure
      Mathematics in the Owens College, Victoria University.
      Received March 29, 1887 .
   The time-constant for currents of any normal type in a given con
ductor is the time in which free currents of that type fall to l/e of
their original strength. In strictness there are for any conductor an
in<U+FB01>nite series of time-constants, corresponding to the various normal
types, but in such a case as that of a coil of wire one of these is
very great in comparison with the rest, which belong to types
in which the current is in opposite directions in different parts of
a section of the wire.   And in all cases the time-constant correspond
ing to the most persistent type which can be present under given
circumstances is, of course, the one which is most important from an
experimental point of view.
   A determination of the time-constants of a uniform circular disk
would be of interest for two reasons: <U+FB01>rst, in relation to Arago’s
rotations, which are entirely due to the greater or less persistence of
currents once started in the disk; and, secondly, in connexion with
Professor Hughes’s experiments with the induction balance, in which
the disturbance produced in the <U+FB01>eld by the currents induced in metal
disks (such as coins) was studied.      Unfortunately, the mathematical
problem thus suggested would seem to be dif<U+FB01>cult.        Restricting our
selves, for simplicity, to cases where the currents <U+FB02>ow in circles
concentric with the disk, so that the problem is not complicated by the
existence of an electric potential, then if   be the current-function, the

over the disk.
  In the absence of a rigorous solution of this problem (which seems
well worthy the attention of mathematicians), a good approximation
to the principal time-constant may be obtained on the following
principles :—*
   1. An increase of resistance in any part of the disk will diminish
the time-constant; and
   2. If the time-constant be calculated on any arbitrary assumption
as to the distribution of current, the result will be an under-estimate,
and will, moreover, be a close approximation to the true value if the
assumed law be not very wide of the mark, on account of the
“             ”
  stationary    property of the normal types.

      By Sir RICHARD OWEN, K.C.B., F.R.S., &0. Received March
      29, 1887.
                                (Abstract).
   The subjects of the present paper are additional fossil remains of
Meiolania platyceps from Lord Howe’s Island, transmitted to the
British Museum since the author’s previous paper on the subject.
Additional cranial characters are de<U+FB01>ned and illustrated by drawings
of more or less perfect specimens of the skull, of vertebrae of the
neck, trunk, and tail, of limb-bones, and portions of the dermal
skeleton.
   The author sums up the al<U+FB01>nities, deducible from the above parts of
the skeleton, to the orders Chelom'a and Sauria, with grounds for the
conclusion that the genera Megalania and Meiolania are more nearly
akin to the Saurian division of the class Reptilia, in which he proposes
to refer those extinct genera to a sub-order called Ceratosauria.

      Phenomena. Part II.” By J. J. THOMSON, M.A., F.R.S.,
      Fellow of Trinity College and Cavendish Professor of
      Experimental     Physics in the University        of Cambridge.
      Received March 31, 1887 .
                                (Abstract)
   This is a continuation   of a paper with the same title published in
the  ‘Phil. Traus.,’  1885, Part II.      In the <U+FB01>rst paper dynamical
principles were applied to the subjects of electricity and magnetism,
elasticity and heat, to establish relations between phenomena in these
branches of physics. In this paper corresponding principles are
applied to chemical and quasi-chemical processes such as evaporation,
liquefaction, dissociation, chemical combination, and the like.
   Many of the results obtained in this paper have been or can be
obtained by means of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, but one of
the objects of the paper is to show that there are other ways of
attacking such questions, and that in many cases such problems can
be solved as readin by the direct use of dynamical principles as by
the Second Law of Thermodynamics.
   A great deal has been written on the connexion between the
 Second Law of Thermodynamics and the principle of Least Action;
 some of these investigations are criticised in the <U+FB01>rst part of the

‘298         Prof. J. J. Thomson.     Some  Applications of       [Apr. 21,
paper.      After this it is shown that for a collection of molecules in a
steady state, the equation (which for ordinary dynamical systems is
identical with the well-known Hamiltonian principle)
                                         =  O
 is satis<U+FB01>ed, where T and     v  are respectively the mean values of the
 kinetic and potential energies taken over unit time, and where the
 variation denoted by 8 is of the following kind.
     The coordinates <U+FB01>xing the con<U+FB01>guration of any physical system,
 consisting according to the molecular theory of the constitution of
 bodies of an immense number of molecules, may be divided into two
 classes:—
     (a.) Coordinates, which we may call molar, which <U+FB01>x the con
 <U+FB01>guration of the system as a whole; and
     (1).) Molecular coordinates which <U+FB01>x the con<U+FB01>guration of individual
 molecules.
     We have the power of changing the molar coordinates at our
 pleasure, but we have no control over the molecular coordinates.
     In the equation—
                                a('I‘-V) =   0
 only the molar coordinates are supposed to vary, all velocities remain
  ing unchanged. Hence_ in a_pplying this equation we need only
  consider those terms in T and V which involve the molar coordinates.
  and expressions for these terms for gases, liquids, and solids are given
  in the paper; the rest of the paper after these have been obtained
  consists of applications of the above equation.
      The density of a vapour in equilibrium with its own liquid is
  obtained as a function of the temperature, and the e<U+FB02>'ect upon the
  density of such things as the curvature or electri<U+FB01>cation of the surface
  of the liquid is determined.
      The phenomenon of dissociation is next investigated, and an
  expression for the density of a dissociated gas obtained which agrees
   substantially in form with that given by Professor Willard Gibbs in
  his well-known paper on the “Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Sub
  stances.”
      The e<U+FB02>'ect of pressure upon the melting point of solids and
   the phenomena of liquefaction are then investigated, and the results
   obtained for the effect of pressure upon the solubility of salts are
   shown to agree with the results of Sorby’s experiments on this
   subject. The effect of capillarity upon solubility is investigated, and
   it is shown that if the surface-tension increases as the salt dissolves
   then capillarity tends to diminish the solubility, and vice rersd.
      The question of chemical combination is then considered, par

ticularly the results of what is called by the chemists   mass-action,”
 of which a particular case is the division of a base between two
 acids.
   The general problem investigated is that in which we have four
 substances  A, B, C, D present, such that A by its action on 13
produces C and D, while C by its action on D produces A and B. The
relation between the quantities of A, B, C, D present when there is
equilibrium is obtained and found to involve the temperature; when
the temperature is constant it agrees in some cases with that given by
Guldberg and Waage, though in others it di<U+FB01>'ers in some important
respects. Thus if f, 17, §, 6 be the number of molecules of A, B, C,
D respectively, when there is equilibrium, 9 the absolute temperature,
11 the amount of heat given out when the chemical process which
results in the increase of E by unity takes place, and k a quantity
which is the same for all substances, then it is proved that—

where   C is a constant; p, q, r, s are quantities such that if (A)
represents the molecule of A, with a. similar notation for the other
molecules, then the chemical reaction can be represented by the
equation—
                          rlAl+qul            = 7"laid-MD}
   Thus if A, B, C, D be respectively sulphuric                   acid, sodium nitrate,
nitric acid, and sodium sulphate, in which                        case the reaction is
represented      by—
                     stO4 + 2NaN03            = 2HNO3 + NaQSOv
  Then    if    the molecules of sodium nitrate and nitric acid be repre
sented by       NaNOs and HNO3,
                  13:1,       q=2,                r=3,        ands=1.
  If, however, the molecules of sodium nitrate and nitric acid                            are
represented  respectively by NaQNQO6 and HBNQOG, then since                               the
chemical reaction may be written——

this when the temperature is constant, agrees with the above
expression if}; = q = r = s.
   We see that the state of equilibrium will vary rapidly with the
temperature if H be large, that   is,   the chemical process
                                        if                  is attended
by the evolution of a large quantity of heat.
   The e<U+FB02>r'ect of alterations in the external circumstances such as
those which may be produced by capillarity, pressure, or electri<U+FB01>ca
tion are investigated, and  it   is shown that anything giving rise to
potential energy which increases as the chemical combination goes on
tends to stop the combination.
   The last part of the paper    is taken up with the consideration of
irreversible effects such as those accompanying the passage of electric
currents through metallic conductors or electrolytes.        These are
looked upon as the average of a large number of discontinuous
phenomena     which succeed each other with great rapidity.         The
ordinary electrical equations with the usual resistance terms in,
represent on this view the average state of the system, but give no
direct information about its state at any particular instant.      It is
shown that  if  we take this view we can apply dynamical principles to
these irreversible effects, and the results of this application to the
case of electrical resistance are given in the paper.
V. “Conduction of Heat in Liquids.” By C. CHREE, B.A.,
    King’s College, Cambridge. Communicated by Professvr
       J.
      J.  THOMSON, F.R.S.  Received March 31, 1887.
                              (Abstract)
  In this   research  the liquid layer through which the conduction
takes place  is  of    moderate thickness, the object being to obtain
                       a
results not open to the objections which can be raised against most
previous methods, in which conduction has taken place through
layers of very small thickness.
   Two similar forms of apparatus, diifering chie<U+FB02>y in size, were
employed, but from the larger apparatus few results were obtained,
and to these little independent weight       is
                                             assigned.
   The liquid was contained in a wooden tub, and heat was applied
by pouring hot water into a metal dish supported so as to be in con
tact with the liquid surface.      At a given depth was <U+FB01>xed a <U+FB01>ne
platinum wire, and the variation in its temperature was determined
 by observing the variation in its electrical resistance. By this means
 the temperature at a given depth in the liquid   is   determined for any
 instant subsequent to the application of heat.
    In applying the heat a given quantity of water, heated to a given

 1887.]                Conduction of Heat in Liquids.                301
temperature, was suddenly poured into the metal dish, and the time
noted.     In one set of experiments this water was after a given
interval siphoned from the dish, in another set it was left undis
turbed.      In either case the variation in the temperature of the
platinum wire, as indicated by the change in its resistance, was
determined by observations of the readings of a delicate galvano
meter, which was affected by the variation in an electrical current
traversing the platinum wire.       The galvanometer readings supplied
data from which could be calculated the interval that elapsed after
the application of heat before the temperature in the liquid surround
ing the platinum wire was rising fastest._ An independent series of
experiments gave the rate at which heat passed into each liquid from
the dish.
   To calculate the conductivity a mathematical investigation is
carried out, which leads to an equation connecting the conductivity,
density, and speci<U+FB01>c heat of a liquid with the time elapsed after the
application of heat at the surface before the heating at a given depth
should be most rapid.        Though this equation cannot be directly
solved, solutions of a close degree of approximation can be obtained.
The density and speci<U+FB01>c heat being known, these solutions enable the
conductivity to be calculated in absolute measure.
   The liquids examined were water, para<U+FB01>in and turpentine oils,
bisulphide of carbon, methylated spirit, and solutions of various
strengths of sulphuric acid and water. In the case of paraf<U+FB01>n oil,
methylated spirit, and water, the. two different methods were
employed, and the results agreed fairly well.     In the case of turpen
tine the water was never siphoned, and in the case of the remaining
liquids the siphon was always used.       It was found that the con
ductivity of the various sulphuric acid solutions, some of consider
able strength, diifered very slightly from that of water, and thus there
is a marked distinction between conducting powers for heat and for
electricity.   The presence of small impurities in the liquids, such as
small quantities of salt, had no appreciable effect on the conductivity.
   The intervals that elapsed after the application of heat before the
temperature at the given depth was rising fastest did not differ very
largely for the various liquids.  It was shortest for the bisulphide and
longest for turpentine.    Owing to the comparatively small variation
in this interval the value of the conductivity depends largely on the
product of the density into the speci<U+FB01>c heat, a quantity to which it is
directly proportional.
   The values actually obtained are the following :—In those under
column 1 the water was siphoned from the dish, in column 2 it was
not.   The units are centimetre and minute.

   The temperature of the various experiments diifered somewhat,
but as a rule was a little under 20° C. The difference of temperature
in the two series of experiments on water tends partly to explain the
discrepancy in the above results, as the results of previous observers
indicate a considerable rise in conductivity with the temperature.
For water and the methylated spirit results of a con<U+FB01>rmatory nature

        remains in the Lower and Upper Greensand of the South
        of England’ (‘Philosophical Transactions,’ 1885, p. 403)."
        By EDWARD HULL, LL.D., F.R.S., &c., Director of the
        Geological Survey of Ireland. Received March 17, 1887.
    In a valuable communication read before the Society in May, 1885,
 Dr. Hinde has given an account of the bands of siliceous material,
                                “
generally in the form of chert,” found at intervals in the two Green
sand     formations   of the Cretaceous period throughout the south of
England—clearly indicating              the extent to which siliceous sponges
contributed to the formation of the successive sea-beds of this period;
an extent to which, as the “Challenger” soundings show, has its
parallel in some parts of the ocean at the present day.
    In discussing the origin of the chert and chalcedonic bands in
which the spicules are imbedded, or out of which they have been dis
solved, leaving cavities in their place, Dr. Hinde states his opinion that
“There can scarcely be room for doubting that the beds and irregular
masses of chert        .     .  .   have been derived from the silica of these
sponge-remains;        and from the same source has also originated the
silica* which, in many of the deposits—more particularly in the
Blackdown Hills—has replaced the shells and tests of the mollusca
and other calcareous organisms.”              He proceeds to say, “ The theory
has, however, been advocated that the silica of the chert has been
derived rather as a direct deposit of this mineral from solution in sea
water, than as the product of the decomposition of the siliceous struc
ture of the sponges.           Thus Dr. Bowerbank held that the sponges
imbedded in the chert of the Greensand possessed horny and not
siliceous skeletons, and that the silica in the chert in which they were
imbedded was attracted from the exterior medium by the animal
matter, and not secreted from the living sponge.                  Professor T.
Rupert Jones maintains the view that the silica of the chert is derived
                         ‘l‘ The italics are not in the original.

directly from sea-water; and similar opinions as to the origin of the
chert bands in the Upper Carboniferous limestones of Ireland have
been put forward by Messrs. Hull and Hardman, and by M. Renard)“
with respect to the phthanites in rocks of the same age in Belgium. It
is a signi<U+FB01>cant fact, however, in connexion with the chert-beds of the
Irish Upper Carboniferous strata that some have been discovered <U+FB01>lled
with sponge-spicules like the chert of the English Greensand, and this
indicates a similar origin for the silica, and negatives the supposition
of Professor Hull that it was deposited “from warm shallow water
charged with silica in solution, in which chemical reactions would
be at once set up, favoured and promoted by tidal and other
currents”?
     I have taken       pains to quote the entire passage in Dr. Hinde’s paper
 in order to avoid the possibility of misrepresentation; and                    I  must
 confess my inability to understand the reasoning of the author.                     He
regards the sponge-spicules as “the source” of the silica, and by their
 decomposition in the presence of sea-water as having given origin to
 the beds of chert; but the question arises, from what source did the
 sponge-skeletons themselves derive the silica from which they were
 formed ? This could not have been from repeated solution and re
 construction, because by this process the supply of silica would have
                                                             “ the beds and
 been used up. The statement, therefore, that                                 irregular
 masses of chert have been derived solely from the silica of the sponge
 remains instead of from that held in solution by the sea-waters them.
          ”
 selves      is altogether unintelligible.         The real “ source ” of the silica
 is that small amount of this mineral which is always present in ocean
 waters; from this source the sponge-structures have been de<U+FB01>ned by
 organic agency, and without that agency the silica would seldom be
 solidi<U+FB01>ed.       Sponge siliceous skeletons are in reality the result of the
 presence     of  silica. in sea-water—not its cause.          If there had been no
 soluble silica there had been no siliceous sponges.                   But  I  am only
  here concerned with a defence of the views arrived at, after full in
     "' Dr. Hinde, inreferring     to Prof. Renard’s Memoir (‘Bulletin do l’Académie
  Royals de Belgique,’ vol. 46, 1878, p. 471), goes so far as to question the author’s
  determination     of the nature of the “ circular sections " shown in one of the
  <U+FB01>gures (<U+FB01>g. 2) accompanying the paper.          The author identi<U+FB01>es them as crinoid
  stems, Dr. Hinds suggests that they are really sponge-spicules ; a view that no one
  so well acquainted with the Carboniferous      Limestone as Professor Renard will for a
  moment admit.
     f  Dr. Hinde does not mention his authority for the statement of the abundance
  of sponge-spicules    in the Carboniferous Limestone of Ireland, and  I suspect that he
  has in this case, as in that of the phthanites    of Belgium, mistaken the sections of
  crinoids for those of sponge-structures.     There is no doubt some di<U+FB02>iculty in dis
  tinguishing    ections of sponge-spicules from ill-preserved segments of crinoid stems
  such as occur in chert; so that their identity must be determined by the forms
  which are prevalent in the ordinary limestones.

by their dissolution, have taken any important part in the formation
of the chert-beds of the Carboniferous Limestone either of Ireland or
Belgium, or as far as     am aware of any other country. My argument
                               I
will be based on the fact that the development of sponge-life in the
seas of the Carboniferous period was insigni<U+FB01>cant, and quite inade
quate to account for the existence of bands and masses of chert,
sometimes constituting almost a half or a third of the entire mass of
the Upper Limestone.I
   Let us now enquire what are the relative proportions of the genera
and species of siliceous sponge-structures to those of calcareous forms
both in Carboniferous and Cretaceous strata—assuming that the genera
and species indicate to some extent the numerical development of
these respective forms.     In this comparison       shall omit from con

sideration the mollusca and molluscoidea—though in themselves very
important, and altogether lime-forming organisms. In drawing up the
following table (p. 307)     have availed myself of the lists published
                                I
recently by  Mr.  Etheridge, F.R.S., which make the comparison simple
and easy.§
   The contrast of the non-molluscan fauna of the two periods will be
at once apparent (1) in the enormous proportion of siliceous sponges
in the Cretaceous as compared with those of the Carboniferous periods;
and            in                                       in the Carbonife

rous   period. The insigni<U+FB01>cant representation of siliceous sponge
structures in the Carboniferous seas as compared with the calcareous
foraminifers, corals, and crinoids will also be apparent. As compared
with the development of these forms in the Carboniferous period,                   it
will be seen that the species of siliceous sponges might almost be
counted on the <U+FB01>ngers of the two hands; both in genera, species, and
individuals they are quite unimportant as compared with the calca
reous organisms of that period, and totally inadequate to supply mate
rial for the formation of such beds of chert as are formed in the
Carboniferous Limestone formation.      The enormous predominance of
the calcareous organisms in this formation        a fact' which cannot be

disputed by those who have had opportunities of studying its charac
ters, either in the north of England, in Ireland, or in Belgium, where
whole beds may be observed composed almost entirely of crinoid stems
and corals; while the microscope generally reveals other calcareous
forms, such as those of foraminifera, which are invisible to the naked
eye, or under the lens.     If, then, these original calcareous structures
have become silici<U+FB01>ed, whence could the silica have been derived if not
from the circumambient waters of the ocean under certain special and
favourable conditions of temperature P
   In his paper on the origin of the beds and nodules of chert (phtha
nite) in the Carboniferous limestone of Belgium, M. Renard expressly
identi<U+FB01>es crinoid structures, not only in circular disks of the cross
section of the stems or ossicles, but in the more solid and structure
less masses of the chert when treated with acid ;* and he expressly
states that the silici<U+FB01>cation has supervened in the case of an originally
calcareous rock-compound chie<U+FB02>y of foraminifera, crinoids, and corals                                          ;1'
and, as Dr. Hinde himself admits, M. Renard distinctly states that
there is no evidence that the in<U+FB01>ltered silex into the limestone                                               is
derived from the decomposition of sponge-spicules or frustules of

who considers that M. Renard has mistaken sponge-spicules for
crinoid stems<U+FB01>“
    In conclusion, it may be asked what is the evidence which Dr. Hinde
can assign for his statement—that the silica of Carboniferous chert
has been derived from sponge-spicules?               Absolutely none, except a
fanciful analogy between these peculiar masses and the sponge-beds
of the Cretaceous formation.          On the other hand, it has been shown
that no such analogy exists, inasmuch as there was a marked contrast
between the organic beings in the waters of the Carboniferous seas as
compared with those of the Cretaceous period. In the former siliceous
sponges were exceedingly rare ; in the latter they abounded; so that,
whatever part they may have played in the construction of the Creta
ceous bands of chert, it is clear they could have taken no important
part in the formation of the chert-bands 0f the Carboniferous Lime
stone.     The relative weight of opinion as expressed in the papers
dealing specially with this subject must be left to individual judgment;
in forming this judgment, however, it will not be overlooked that
identical conclusions have been arrived at regarding the mode of
formation of the Carboniferous chert-bands by two sets of observers
working independently, one in Ireland the other in Belgium, almost
at the same period, and both using chemical and microscopical
appliances.
    I trust, therefore, that I have succeeded in showing that there are
good grounds for the opinion of those who consider that the beds
and nodules of siliceous material in the Carboniferous Limestone have
been formed by a direct replacement of original calcareous matter of
the limestone itself by silica held in solution in the ocean-waters, and
that, consequently, Dr. Hinde is not justi<U+FB01>ed in referring them' for
their origin to sponge-structures.

    Dr. Alleyne Nicholson, a paleeontologist of no small repute, refers
to this     subject in his work on the ‘Ancient Life History of the
 Earth,’ p. 34. He considers that the silica which has surrounded and
in<U+FB01>ltrated the fossils which <U+FB02>int contains, must have been deposited
 “from sea-water in a gelatinous condition, and subsequently have
   * Dr. Hinde’s words are: “There are shown, however, in one of the <U+FB01>gures
 (<U+FB01>g. 2) accompanying M. Renard’s paper, circular sections which more nearly
resemble those of sponge-spicules than of crinoid stems, to which they are assigned.”

  hardened.”     Also that “the formation        of <U+FB02>int may therefore be
 regarded as due to the separation of silica from sea-water, and its
 deposition round some organic body in a state of chemical change or
 decay.”
    This is essentially the theory     I  advanced in our joint paper, and
 that independently arrived at by the Abbé Renard, namely, pseudo
 morphism.
    Dr. Nicholson says further: “ It has been asserted that the <U+FB02>ints of
 the chalk are merely fossil sponges.        No explanation of the origin of
 <U+FB02>int, however, can be satisfactory, unless it embraces the origin of
 chert in almost all limestones from the Silurian upwards, as well as
 the common phenomenon of the silici<U+FB01>cation of organic bodies (such
 as corals and shells) which are known with certainty to have been
 originally calcareous.”
    In our paper the prevalence and thickness of the chert of the
 Carboniferous Limestone of Ireland is referred to.          I have since had
 an opportunity of seeing the siliceous alteration of limestone on a
 very large scale, and in diiferent formations, in the tropical region of
 “’estern Australia, when engaged there as Government Geologist. It
 is seen in the Lower Silurian, Carboniferous, and Upper Tertiary
 deposits. The transition from the limestones into chert, <U+FB02>int, and
 calcedony, is clearly visible in many places where these minerals                7
form ranges often miles in extent, and where the thickness of the
<U+FB02>inty material occasionally reaches 300 feet.
    It is curious that these <U+FB02>int beds nearly always form the capping
of the hills, but that they are of the same formation as the under
lying limestone is proved by the gradual passage of that rock into
<U+FB02>int; and where fossils occur in the limestone similar fossils are
observed in the <U+FB02>int, until they become obliterated towards the
summit.*      I  am inclined to attribute this to the action of highly
heated rain-water since the rocks have been deposited.           In the warm
season—which is also the rainy season, from about November to
March—the rocks become intensely heated, and consequently, also the
water lying in pools and cavities.         I have been assured by settlers
who have had to wade through <U+FB02>ooded country, that at such'times they
could hardly endure the heat of the water, and I have experienced this
to a slight extent myself. It is certain that under these circumstances
silica would be more largely dissolved from one part, and more
quickly deposited in another portion of the same rock; it is in fact
on similar reasoning—the          in<U+FB02>uence of sunlight and heat—that
Professor Martin Duncan, F.R.S., explains the silici<U+FB01>cation of the
West Indian Miocene Corals.

    Whether it be heated rain-water, or heated sea-water containing
silica, the principle of the transmutation is the same.
    These siliceous beds are found, not only in the marine Silurian
(and possibly older) beds of tropical Australia, in which sponges are
comparatively rare, and in the Carboniferous rocks, but also in a
fresh-water deposit which caps a hill south of Mount Elder on the
0rd River, and about 500 feet above the level of the country, showing
that it must at one time have been the bed of a very extensive lake.
The upper beds are white limestone merging upwards as usual into
<U+FB02>int, calcedony, and green agates.      These are 50 feet thick, and all
abound in a fossil, Planorbis, as determined by Professor McCoy, of
Melbourne University, who named it as a new species, Planorbis
Hardmami.       His decision was con<U+FB01>rmed by R. Etheridge, Junr.,
and Dr. Woodward, and the specimens are at present in the Museum
at South Kensington.
    This rock is simply one mass of Plano'rbis shells all highly silici<U+FB01>ed.
I can hardly conceive that it was formed from sponge spicules,
especially as according to Ernst Haeckel (‘History of Creation,’
p. 139) the main class of the Sponges lives in the sea, with the
single exception of the green fresh-water Sponge (Spongilla).
    It is not probable then that these organisms would have existed in
these regions in su<U+FB02>icient numbers to form a rock 50 feet thick and
over two miles square at present.
    We have therefore examples at both ends of the scale in this one
country showing how improbable is the Sponge theory of chert.

    The true homologies of the different teeth in the Marsupialia, and
 especially in the Dasyu'ridw, have long been in a state of confusion,
 largely owing to their perplexing super<U+FB01>cial resemblances to the teeth
 of the Carnivora and other Placentals, and to the incorrect homo
 logies thereon founded. This confusion has been chie<U+FB02>y in regard to
 the premolars, of which some members of the family have two, others
 three, while generalised Placentals have four, and it is therefore
 necessary to prove which teeth have been successively lost in order
 to <U+FB01>nd out the correct homologies of the remainder.

     Firstly, as to which of the three premolars of such genera as
 Thylacinus and Phascologale have been lostin Dasyurus and Sarco
philus, each with only two—a study of the di<U+FB02>’erent members of the
 genus Phascologale         shows that, judging by the great variability in
 size   of  the  last premolar or pm.4 of the typical mammalian dentition,‘
 which is sometimes even altogether aborted, it is this tooth that is the
 one lost in Dasyurus and Sarcophilm, the total loss of the changing
 tooth naturally accounting for the non-discovery of a tooth-change
 in   these genera.
     Next, since the original       number of premolars was clearly four in
 the Marsupials        as well as in the Placentals, it was necessary to <U+FB01>nd
'out which of these had disappeared               in the ordinary three-toothed
 genera      of the  Polyprotodonts,    and  this  has been able to be done by
the fortunate discovery of a specimen of Phascologale in which there
 are four premolars on one side, the additional tooth being inserted
between       the ordinary <U+FB01>rst and second premolars.               The missing pre
molar is therefore pmfz, asshown both by this instance and by the
relative p0sitions of the teeth in other Polyprotodonts, the resulting

     The milk dentition in several of the Dasyum'dw is then described,
among others that of the Purbeck Mesozoic Marsupial Triacanthodon
sew-rule (Owen), which is proved to have, as had been suggested                      by
 Professors      Owen   and  Flower,   a milk   dentition      identical with   that  of
the modern Marsupials.
     An attempt is then made to trace out the history of the evolution
of mammalian teeth in general, and as a preliminary it is insisted (1)
that the rudimentary tooth-change of the Marsupials is not a remnant
of a fuller one, but a low and early stage in the development of com
plete diphyodontism, a stage out of which the Eutheria have long ago
passed; and (2) that, as maintained by Professor Flower, the milk
 teeth are the superadded and not the primary set.
     It is then suggested that the process by which a milk tooth was deve
 loped consisted of two stages, <U+FB01>rstly, a preliminary retardation of the
 permanent tooth, and secondly, of the development of a temporary
 tooth in the gap in the tooth-row caused thereby; the retardation in
 the <U+FB01>rst case being useful for packing purposes in a large-toothed
    " Although     the homology of this tooth with the pm.‘ of Placentals, <U+FB01>rst made
 out by Professor Flower, has been called in question, there can be no doubt that it is
 entirely correct.
    1- This method of writing dental formulae is recommended as showing not only the
 total number, but the homologies of the teeth, each of which has its own number in
 the series.

animal, while in a small-toothed form the same retardation, if present
by inheritance, would cause a more or less disadvantageous gap, best
<U+FB01>lled by the assumption of a milk tooth.
   The <U+FB01>rst stage, or stage of retardation, appears to be still repre
sented in the anterior upper incisors of many Polyprotodont Marsupials,
and it is therefore believed that these teeth now represent the stage
at which the ancestors of the Marsupials and Eutheria diverged from
one another, a stage at which the further development of milk incisors
                                 '
was just commencing.
   Following out this idea, it is shown how easily the transition from
the Metatherian to the Eutherian stage of tooth-change may have taken
place, a transition by the help of which a complete series of diagrams
can be drawn up, following the history of each individual tooth, from
the dentition of the earliest Mammals, homodont and monophyodont,
as no doubt the unmodi<U+FB01>ed Prototheria. were, down to the varied
forms of dentition, heterodont and diphyodont, existing at the
present day.
   All the orders of M'amrnalia fall easily enough into their places in
the main line of this scheme with one exception, namely, the
Edentata, in whose case the evidence all tends to prove the correct
ness of Professor Parker’s suggestion as to their nearly direct
derivation from the Prototheria, a suggestion that the characters of
their teeth most fully support. 011 the same principles, therefore,
as the main Proto-meta-eutherian line of tooth development is drawn

up, a side branch, for which the name                        suggested, is
made for the Edentates. Within that branch very little heterodontism
has ever been developed, but otherwise the changes, except in the case
of the as yet inexplicable dentition of O'rycte'ropus have been of the
same nature as those in the main line, the superaddition of a milk set
of teeth in Tatusia being, as in the Meta- and Eu-theria, the last and
most highly specialised development.
IV. “Note     on Protection    in Anthrax.”     By L. C. WOOLDRIDGE,

   Hitherto in the few     cases   in which protection against zymotic
disease has been found possible, it has been effected by the communi
cation to the animal of a modi<U+FB01>ed form of the disease against which
protection is sought.
   I  have succeeded in protecting rabbits from anthrax by an alto
gether different process, and although this is scarcely, at present, of
practical utility, it may perhaps be found to be of some interest as

 1387.]               Note on Protection in Anthrax.                            313
regards the general nature of protection in this and other diseases
depending on micro-organisms.
   I  use as a culture <U+FB02>uid for the anthrax bacillus a solution of a
proteid body which is obtained from the testis and frcim the thymus
gland.    I  have described this substance to the Society on a previous
occasion,“l so that   I  need not repeat the description of the process
used in its preparation.
   The proteid substance is dissolved in dilute alkali and the solution
sterilised by repeated boiling. It is then inoculated with anthrax
and maintained at 37° C. for two or three days.
   The growth is generally not very abundant, and at the end of the
period mentioned is removed from the culture <U+FB02>uid by <U+FB01>ltration.                   A
small quantity of the <U+FB01>ltered culture <U+FB02>uid is injected into the circula
tion of a rabbit, and it is then found that the animal will not take
anthrax.
   A subcutaneous inoculation of extremely virulent anthrax blood
made at the time of the injection of the protecting <U+FB02>uid, and two sub
sequent inoculations at intervals of <U+FB01>ve and ten days, remain entirely
without effect.     The animals used as a control invariably die.              Four
rabbits have been protected in this way.
   If the anthrax growu in the <U+FB02>uid be inoculated it either kills or it
has no effect.    It does not protect in the slightest degree.
   The injection of the culture <U+FB02>uid in which no anthrax has grown is
without effect.      The animals die as usual when inoculated.                  The
injection of the    <U+FB02>uid   itself causes  no   ill symptoms whether anthrax
has grown in it or not.
   If other albuminous <U+FB02>uids, e.g., blood-serum, be used as a culture
medium and the <U+FB01>ltered culture <U+FB02>uid be injected, it exerts no pro
tection. It may be fairly concluded that the growth of the anthrax
bacillus in the special culture <U+FB02>uids used in these experiments gives
rise to a substance which when injected into the organism protects
against an immediate and subsequent attacks of anthrax.
   It would obviously be of very great advantage if some such method
as this could be used for the zymotic diseases a<U+FB02>ecting man for which
no protective inoculation in the ordinary sense, appears possible.
   I am indebted to the Medical Of<U+FB01>cer to the Local Government Board
for permission to publish this short account of these experiments,
the full description of which will appear in his report.             I   must also

   The following experiments give additional weight to the previously
described results.
   In the one case the anthrax grew with very great rapidity in the
culture <U+FB02>uid, and the clear <U+FB01>ltrate contained but a very small quantity
of proteid matter. Forty cubic centimetres of this <U+FB02>uid was injected
into a rabbit, and the rabbit immediately inoculated in the ear with
virulent anthrax blood; in two days there was very marked (edema
at the seat of inoculation, which increased to an enormous extent
during the next few days, and then gradually subsided.         The rabbit
is now perfectly well, twenty-four days after the inoculation.
   In the second case the growth of anthrax had been very slight;
20 0.0. of the <U+FB01>ltered <U+FB02>uid was injected, and the animal immediately
inoculated in the leg with virulent anthrax blood. In three days
there was marked oedema at the seat of inoculation.        This spread up
the leg   to the  back,  so  that  there  was enormous  mdema   occupying
nearly the whole posterior part of the animal ; this persisted for ten
days, and then gradually subsided.       The animal is quite well, twenty
eight days after inoculation.
   These cases are of interest, since they are obviously instances of
partial protection.   The animals are still affected by anthrax, but it
is only as a severe local affection, and does not kill them.

        August 29, 1886, made at Carriacou.” By the Rev. S. J.
        PERRY, S.J., F.R.S. Received April 5, 1867.
                                   (Abstract.)
     Carriacou is a small island situated about twenty miles to the north
 of the island of Grenada, the chief of the Windward group, and
 furnished an excellent site for.the observation of the last solar eclipse.
 Most of the observers sent by the Eclipse Committee of the Royal
  Society to the West Indies in August of last year remained at
  Grenada, or on the small islands in its immediate vicinity, whilst
 Mr. Maunder and myself occupied the more distant northern station,
'where the totality was slightly diminished in duration.
     The work proposed for Mr. Maunder was to secure a series of
 photographs of the corona, with exposures of 40s. and under, and also
 to obtain two photographs of the spectrum of the corona with the
 longest exposures possible.      The coronal pictures were successful, and
 they  are  at present in  the hands  of Mr. Wesley, Assistant Secretary of

 the Royal Astronomical Society. The results of his careful examina
 tion, and of the collation of this with other eclipse photographs, will
 form the subject of a later communication. The spectroscopic cameras
 mounted on the same equatorial framework failed to give any useful
 result.
    The instrument used by myself was a 5é-inch equatorial, by Alvan
 Clark, with aRowland grating 14,438 lines to the inch, and the work
 assigned by the Committee was an examination of the spectrum of
 the inner corona immediately before and after totality, and a search for
 the carbon hands during totality.      I was assisted by Sub-Lieutenant
          of  H.M.S.   “
 Helby,                  Sparrowhawk,” who pointed the slit of the spec
 troscope,   whilst my undivided: attention was given to the bright lines
 in the <U+FB01>eld of view of the small observing tellescope. The object
 glass cast a most perfect picture of the corona on the white enamelled
 cap of the slit plate, so there could have been no- di<U+FB01>culty in directing
 the slit to any assigned position.
     In the search during totality for the carbon bands a and        which [3,
 should have been well within the <U+FB01>eld of view, extending as            did      it
 from wave-length 5600 to considerably beyond       I),the radial slit was
 placed near the solar equator, at distances from the moon's limb vary
 ing from 0‘1 to 0'5 of a solar diameter, and was then removed to one
 of the sun’s poles, and placed tangentially at successive distances as
 before.    In none of these positions could detect the slightest trace
                                           I
 of the carbon bands.      The conclusion indicated by these observations
 seems to be that the vapour of carbon,    if present in 1886, was not of
 suf<U+FB01>cient intensity to make an appreciable impression'on the retina.
 The dispersion was considerable, as  I    was using the second order of
             with  a power  of  about43, but the fainter lines in the solar
spectrum
spectrum, and the coronal lines when seen, were so distinct, that                     I
                                                                          '
scarcely think the dispersion could have been excessive.
    The observations both before and after totality were greatly inter
 fered with by the clouds and heavy rain, but although rain fell within
a   few minutes from the beginning, and also very soon after totality,
 the sun seemed perfectly clear during the whole of the totality itself.
 As soon as the sun broke through the clouds and became visible on
 the slit of the spectroscope, Lieutenant Helby placed the slit at the
centre of the rapidly decreasing crescent, and the <U+FB01>rst line that                     I
detected was 1474 K, which extended to a distance of perhaps                          8'
from the limb. Almost at the same instant saw mass of lines of

form no idea of their relative intensities. This observation seems to
favour the view that the absorption producing the Fra-unhofer lines
takes place in successive layers of the solar atmosphere, and not in
any one layer exclusively.     Within 20s. from the end of totality, the

 11.  “Note on the Microscopic Structure of Rock Specimens
       from three Peaks in the Caucasus.”            By T. G. BONNEY,
       D.Sc..   LL.D.,   F.R.S.. Professor of Geology in University
       College, London.        Received April 5, 1887.
   Although our knowledge 'of the petrology of the Caucasus has been
considerably augmented of late years through the labours of Abich,
Favre, Tschermak, and others, so much ground still remains un
trodden among its mountain peaks that hardly any specimen can be
entirely without interest. Those described in the present note have
come from the following localities:-—(1) The summit of Tau Tetnuld;
 (2) rocks from the upper part of Guluku ; (3) the summit of Elbruz,
    The specimens from Tau Tetnuld and Guluku were collected by
Mr. W. F. Donkin, during his expedition in company with Mr.
Clinton Dent in the summer of 1886, and to the former I am indebted
for the following note on the localities.                              -
    “ Tau Tetnuld is one of the
                                    peaks of the central Caucasian chain,
in the great Koschtan-Tau group which lies about midway between
Elbruz to the N.W., and Kasbek to the E.S.E. From Koschtan-Tau
the main ridge forming the watershed runs somewhat north of west,
dropping gradually in height; but for some three or four miles
forming a magni<U+FB01>cent wall on the northern side, covered with a
succession of steep snow-slopes and hanging glaciers.       A long portion
 of this ridge, including three more or less well-marked elevations, is
 called Djanga; the next elevation on the ridge—a much more obvious
 one, forming indeed a symmetrical snow pyramid—is           Tau Tetnuld.

1887.]           Structure     of Rocks from    the Caucasus.                 319
From the north it     appears to have     a sharp conical summit, but it is
really wedge-shaped.      Further westwards      the ridge falls continuously,
a few rocky peaks protruding from it, to a well-marked snow col.
The drainage from the whole of this vast wall, from Koechtan-Tau to
the col inclusive, collects in a basin, and <U+FB02>ows northwards as the
Bezingi glacier.      The glacier is remarkably level and free from
ice-falls, and appears to start almost direct from the foot of the
wall, with but little sloping névé.        Its course is soon narrowed to-a
channel of some 1200 yards wide by spurs from the high ridges
running northwards on either side.           On the west the ridge does not
attain any great elevation, but     on  the east the glacier is bounded by a
group of mountains culminating in the great rook-mass of Guluku.
This group is completely separated from the Koschtan-Tau chain by
the glacier basin above mentioned. Guluku itself is granitic in
character, but the lower and surrounding peaks and ridges are
schistose and shaly, in parts exactly like the Ober- and Unter
Rothhorn on the north side of the Findelen glacier.* The upper
rocks of Guluku are grey in colour and look very like granite from
some distance below; then comes a belt of whiter rocks (A), and
below that a. well-marked red belt (B); both these belts are con
tinuous and nearly horitontal for a long way round the southern side
of the peak. Below the red belt the rocks are darker and more
mixed (C, D, and            On the moraine on the east side of the Urban
glacier, under Guluku, vast masses of granite had fallen, many of the
blocks recently.    It is <U+FB01>ne grained, and of grey colour (5‘).”
    (1.)  Tau Tetnuld.-—Specimen       from the highest rocks about 100
feet below the actual summit, which was covered with snow.                    Mr.
Donkin states that the rock traversed in the ascent appeared to be
exactly of the same character. This is a <U+FB02>at fragment of a brownish,
rather <U+FB01>ssile, but strong, mica schist, about % inch thick and nearly
2 inches broad and long.          The broad surfaces are spangled with
small <U+FB02>akes of a silvery      mica,  and appear to be those of a " cleavage
foliation."    Examined microscopically, the chief constitutents are
quartz and mica, besides which an iron oxide occurs, frequently in
small granules and rods, and more rarely in larger grains.                    The
quartz and    mica   have    a  general elongated       lenticular   arrangement
parallel with the broader surfaces of the fragment, and cracks
traverse the slide in the same direction.         The quartz on applying the
polarising apparatus is broken up into a mosaic of different sized
grains united by diverse tinted margins, so that we are evidently
dealing in each case with one or more grains which have been crushed
up and re-cemented.         Cavities are sometimes rather numerous, and
   * Near Zermatt in the Pennine Alps. These schists are referred to the upper
most group (Graue kalkhaltige Schiefen) inthe crystalline series of the Alps.

occasionally tend to range themselves perpendicularly to the lines of
cleavage.   They are generally minute, sometimes stained internally,
both ovoid and irregular in form, usually containing <U+FB02>uid, and with
bubbles which, as a rule, are about one fourth the volume of the
cavity, but not rarely exceed this. Some of the large grains exhibit
the usual indications of being in a state of strain.
   The mica is brown, greenish, or colourless. The <U+FB01>rst and second
are biotite, more or less altered.       The colourless mica resembles
muscovite,   but 1 think that at any rate some of it is a magnesia
potash mica, possibly hydrous, a secondary product after biotite, the
iron having separated out. This often remains between the cleavage
planes in rods and plates.       Possibly some of the smaller <U+FB02>akes of
mica may be altogether of secondary origin, but 1 have no doubt that
most of     it,
            including all the larger <U+FB02>akes,    is   an orginal constituent.
These <U+FB02>akes   often  a<U+FB01>ord  marked  evidence    [of mechanical disturbance.
They are bent, twisted, crumpled, and in some cases crushed up.
Portions of them, viewed with the polarising apparatus, have a peculiar
“                             <U+FB01>nd very characteristic of a mica that has
  powdered” look, which   I
been to a   certain  extent  crushed   in situ, so that, while the general
outline of a crystal is preserved, there are constant ruptures of con
tinuity and slight displacements of the constituent parts.           A few
small mineral granules also occur in the slide; some    I   am disposed to
refer to epidote, others to a very impure garnet.
   (2.) The specimens from Guluku were collected, partly in sifu at a
height roughly of 14,500 or 15,000 feet above the sea, partly from a
moraine, as above-mentioned, on the Urban glacier; hence they repre
sent a considerable mass of the mountain below the level just men<
tioned. The highest point of Guluku       is   about 16,500 feet above the
sea.
  (A.) From the highest rocks reached.         small fragment of rock
                                               A
with indications of a slight cleavage, consisting of a porcelain-white
mineral irregularly mottled with one of    a pale pistachio-green colour.
The former on microscopic examination proves to be a plagioclastic
felspar, considerably decomposed, but in parts showing very clearly a
lamellar twinning.    The extinction angles are generally rather small,
probably oligoclase predominates; microlithic <U+FB02>akes of a micaceous
mineral, and other decomposition products, are frequent.        The other
mineral     an epidote, varying from a pale yellow tinge to colourless,
            is
and rather impure. It occurs in aggregated and sometimes rather fan
]ike groups of longish crystals.     There are also a few spots of       a
serpentinous or chloritic  mineral.  The  mechanical disturbance of the
rock   isobviously posterior to the crystallisation of the felspar, as its
crystals are cracked and even sheared, but, at any rate in the main,
prior to that of the epidote.

dently containing a considerable amount of a darkish mica, on the
weathered surfaces reddish-brown (the “red band ”).                 Under the
microscope it is seen to consist chie<U+FB02>y of biotite, felspar, considerably
decomposed, in part at least plagioclase, and quartz.          The biotite is in
places altered into a greenish chloritic mineral, in others is “bleached”
by parting with its iron.        A white mica, however, which occurs in
good sized <U+FB02>akes, appears to be an occasional original constituent.
The rock has evidently been much crushed. The quartz is cracked
and displaced, the felspar has been broken up, and parts of the
original crystals are now occupied by a sort of irregular mosaic or
mixture of felspar, quartz, kaolin, and white mica.                The felspar
crystals are occasionally interrupted by roundish inclusions of quartz,
such as one often sees in the oldest gneisses.              These may be of
 secondary origin,   but  I <U+FB01>nd  nothing   to prove it. The original quartz
grains, where adjacent to the crushed felspar, appear to have been

 The mica in parts of the slide shows marked indications of mechanical
 disturbance, and a reddish garnet at the edge has been distinctly
 crushed out, as is more fully described in                                      .
     Guluku (C).—This specimen, in shape roughly a right-rhomboidal
prism about 1" X l” X g”, has for its larger faces parallel joint
 surfaces; two others are “sheen surfaces,” parallel with which the
fractured faces exhibit a. foliated structure.        The rock appears to be a
strong rather compact mica-schist, dark in colour, with a few very
thin lighter-tinted bands.
     The principal minerals are quartz, mica, garnet, iron oxide, and a
quantity of a brownish mineral, sometimes very <U+FB01>brousf The quartz
occurs mostly in granules of moderate size, occasionally including a
 little minute rutile      and mica.    It is on the whole fairly clear, but
 here and there cavities are pretty numerous.           These frequently con
tain bubbles, which, though very variable in relative size, are gene
rally smaller than in the Tau Tetnuld rock, perhaps commonly about
one-sixth or one-seventh of the whole volume. The mica constituent
is chie<U+FB02>y biotite or its alteration products, often a greenish chloritic
mineral, sometimes a whitish hydrous mica, both with interlamination
of iron oxide. The garnet is colourless in thin slices, and occasionally
exhibits, along cracks, alteration for a short distance into a chloritic
mineral.     Some of the larger granules of iron oxide are hematite.
The pale-coloured rather <U+FB01>lmy or <U+FB01>brous mineral is certainly in some
cases a secondary product after a felspar, the usual aggregate of a
minute micaceous or kaolinitic mineral.            Other parts, however, con

  ments are dif<U+FB01>cult to obtain) for it seems markedly oblique.
     It is evident at a glance that this rock has been subjected to a great
  pressure normal to the conspicuous foliatiou.          The garnets have been
  cracked and crushed out, so as to have become elongated ovals in
  shape.    A  glance at the diagram will render a more minute descrip
  tion needless, and will show that the garnet was more or less <U+FB02>attened
  out before it broke. The quartz grains also are cracked, being some
  times only a little, sometimes much displaced.         This mineral, however,
  does not appear to have been so completely crushed upas in the Tau
  Tetnuld schist.     Occasionally a small grain, adjacent to the (original)
  felspathic constituent, has escaped altogether.             The felspar has, I
  kelieve, often been crushed out, and then converted into, the above
  named microlithic mineral.        The larger mica <U+FB02>akes are twisted about
  in the manner usual       in  a rock which has been crushed,            Study of,
  this slide seems to me to show conclusively that this rock, anterior to!

numerous large blocks of granite fallen from west side of Guluku.
    This is a fairly coarse-grained rock, chie<U+FB02>y consisting of a white
felspar and dark mica, not rich in quartz.                    The mica is mainly
biotite in good preservation. There is also a certain amount of a white
mica which appears to be an original constituent and to belong to
the muscovite group. The felspar is occasionally replaced by kaolinite
and micaceous minerals, but much of it is in good preservation;

of plagioclase, generally on the albite type, but occasionally on the
pericline,       One of the- grains appears. to be microcline.                 I‘have
measured the extinction angles of several parallel lamellae; it is
dif<U+FB01>cult to get very satisfactory results, but, as in two of the best
cases, they appear distinctly too large for albite, between 30° and 40°,
 the felspar is. probably oligoclase.            There are two or three small
 colourless garnets, with probably a little apatite.           The quartz contains
 cavities,_in which small bubbles are usually present, about one-sixth or
 one-seventh of the volume.
     This rock has evidently been subjected to a. certain amount of
 mechanical disturbance since its consolidatiom The quartz grains
 are cracked and show strain-polarisation.               The felspar lamellae are
 occasionally bent, now and then cracked across, but the e<U+FB01>ects are,
 slight compared with the other cases.
     Mr. Donkin also collected a specimen some miles further down the
 valley which resembled the rock in a neighbouring cliff. This ap
 pears to be a reddish rather <U+FB01>ne-grained felspathic granite, but as it
 was not obtained in situ I have not had a slice prepared.
     The evidence of these specimens does not appear suf<U+FB01>cient to
 warrant any positive statement as to the origin of these Caucasian
 rocks. The structure of one (D) seems rather to favour the idea of
 its having been a true granite (i.e., an igneous rock); the same is
 true also of (F); while in another (B) there is a structure, which
  I have some reason to think characteristic of the Archaaan gneisses<U+FB01>"
  But in the present state of our knowledge it would be unsafe
  to rely too much upon the latter criterion, because we do not
 yet know what modi<U+FB01>cations may be introduced by subsequent re
  arrangement of mineral constituents.              It has indeed been proved in
  the case of hornblendic rocks, that the original structures, character
  istic of crystallisation from a state of fusion, may be wholly obliterated;
    =' The same ditiiculty exists in the case of some of the more highly crystalline
  rocks of the Alps.   Favre (‘ Recherches—Chaine     du Caucase,’ p. 70) states that the
                                   “
  central part of the Caucasus is granite,” which he compares with the protogine of
  the Alps, with a considerable belt of crystalline schists on the north, and an inter
  111th one. of the same, followed by slates, on the south.

the same may take place also with granitic reeks.  Still, even   this           if
mode of metamorphism has occurred, there      some reason to believe
                                                          is
that   it   dates usually,   ifnot invariably, from a very remote period.
We can,     however,   in  my opinion, venture to assert that these Cau
casian rocks, after they had assumed             crystalline condition, under
                                                   a
went great pressures, regional rather than local in their operation,
which to some extent crushed the constituents, and gave rise to cer
tain mineral changes.        It seems then a legitimate inference that in
this part of the Caucasus, as in the Alps, the fundamental rocks con
sisted of crystalline rocks of more than one type, at               period long

      If this expression be positive for any shell, the shell is stretched; if

      To apply this problem to the case of the earth, the law of cooling
  taken is that which follows from. Sir W. Thomson’s solution, in his
  memoir on the secular cooling of. the earth. The expression in the
  form (2) proves unserviceable, and therefore the expnession (1) is
  made use of as follows :—                                                              ‘
      Taking the time since solidi<U+FB01>cation provisionally. at 174,240,000
  years, it is shown that the rate of cooling (dc/alt) is practically insen
  sible at a depth of‘400 miles. The radius of a sphere equal to the
  earth in volume being about 3959 miles,. the earth is supposed to be
  constituted as follows :—A central globe, 3559 miles.in radius, at the
  initial temperature of the earth, which as yet has not sensibly
   cooled, surrounded by 400 concentric spherical shells,. each one mile
   in thickness, the rate of cooling in each shell being uniform through
   out, and equal to its value at the outer surface at that shell.

      The results of the calculation are shown by the curve in the <U+FB01>gure
   accompanying the paper, and the following conclusions are deduced,
   taking the time since consolidation provisionally at 174,240,000
  years     :—                          _
      1.   Folding by lateral pressure takes      place only to a certain depth
   (about     <U+FB01>ve  miles)  below  the  earth’s   surface,    and below this depth
   changes to stretching by lateral tension.
      2. Stretching by lateral tension, inappreciable below a depth of
   490 miles, increases from that depth towards the surface ; it is
   greatest at a depth of 72 miles (i.e., just below the-depth at which the
  rate of cooling is greatest); after this it decreases, and vanishes at a
   depth of about <U+FB01>ve miles.
      3. Folding by lateral pressure commences at a depth of about
   <U+FB01>ve miles, and gradually increases, being greatest near the surface of
   the earth.
      No great importance is attributed to the numerical results. The

  ‘1887           Distribution of Strain in     the  Earth’s Crust.            327
  conclusions are given for their qualitative rather than their quantita
  tive value. They depend also on the assumption that the earth’s
  surface is smooth and spherical.        ‘
      The following laws are also shown to be approximately true :—
      1. The depth of the surface at which folding by lateral pressure
  vanishes, and the depth of the surface at which stretching by lateral
  tension is greatest, both increase as the square root of the time that
  has elapsed since the consolidation of the globe.
      2. Folding by lateral pressure was effected most rapidly in the early
  epochs of the world’s history as a solid globe, and, since then, the
  total amount of rock folded in any given time decreases nearly in
  proportion as the square root of the time increases.
     3. A law, similar to N o. 2, for stretching by lateral tension.

                                       Theory.
     The argument is described (see ‘Phil. Mag.’ for Feb, 1887). It
 is shown to be inconclusive on the following grounds ;—
     1. It assumes that the cooling of the earth to its present condition
 was instantaneous.                                                              ,
     2. If instantaneous cooling were possible, there would, it is shown,
 be no folding at all, but only stretching by lateral tension.
     3. It assumes that the earth’s        surface was initially smooth and
 spherical, whereas Professor B. Peirce and Professor G. H. Darwin
 have both shown that vast continental wrinkles would be formed on
 the surface of a once viscous earth by the diminishing velocity of
                                                          '
 rotation resulting from tidal friction.

                              Earth’s Surface-features.
     1.  Owing    to the pressure of the continental masses, crust-stretching      _
 by lateral     tension takes place principally beneath the ocean-basins,
 therefore deepening them and contributing to their permanence.               This
 effect must have been greatest in early geological periods, when the
surface of greatest stretching was close to the surface of the earth.
     2. In another part of the paper it is shown that the amount of
 crust-stretching is considerably greater than the amount of crust
 folding, due directly to secular cooling. Folding beneath the ocean
 bed will therefore do little but diminish its rate of subsidence.             The
 e<U+FB01>ects    of folding  in  changing  the forms   of the earth’s  surface  features

           By T. G. BONNEY, D.Sc., LL. D., F.R.S., Professor of
           Geology in University College, London. Received April 7,
           1887.
      The results obtained by Mr. Davison throw light upon one or two
   matters    in regard to the petrology of the older rocks, which have
   always‘appeared to me di<U+FB01>icult of explanation. I venture therefore
   to add a brief note to his paper, written from the point of view of a
   geologist. He throws light especially on the following matters :—
      (1.) Among the older rocks the great foldings and their results,
   such as cleavage, appear to have occurred when the beds formed the
   upper layers of the earth’s crust.           Thus the Ordovician rocks of
   North Wales were cleaved anterior to the deposit of the Silurian;
   the Carboniferous, and other Palaaozoic                rocks of South-west
   Britain and Britanny were plicated and cleaved, geologically
   speaking, shortly after their deposition.             The great foldings in
   the Scotch Highlands occurred, in great part at least, in Silurian
   time.     The disturbance of the Lake District rocks, resulting in
  cleavage, must be placed between the end of the Silurian and the
   very beginning of the Carboniferous; that of Southern Scotland,
   between perhaps yet narrower limits.           The <U+FB01>rst epoch of mountain
  vmaking     in  the Central Alps,  with   its  plication and cleavage, imme
   diately followed the deposition of the Eocene rocks. The list might
                                                                             '
   easily be extended.
      (2.) The crystalline substratum often appears to be less modi<U+FB01>ed than
   the overlying softer and more recent beds.           This I had attributed to
   the greater resistency of   the  former, but then could not see how to
   explain the foldings of the latter, if the others were comparatively
   uncompressed.       This, however, accords with Mr. Davison’s results of
   the diminishing effects of compression, while the fact that in early
                           “              ”
  geological times the neutral. zone between compression and tension
   was comparatively near the surface of the earth, may explain the
  .frequent parallel arrangement of the minerals in the older Archwan
    gneisses.    I do not now refer to the more marked changes, such as
  .the intercalation of calcareous or micaceous rocks, of more felspathic
    or quartzose layers, whereby a strati<U+FB01>cation is simulated, if it be not
  recorded, but to the fact that very often a general parallelism may be

  noted in the <U+FB02>akes of mica or any other mineral of somewhat like
  form scattered through the mass of the rock, sometimes approximating
  to a banding of the constituents, without any indication of this being
  the result of crushing.     In regard to this particular structure, it is
   worth notice that it often lies in planes making a low angle with the
  horizon.
      (3.) The same result may help to explain the assertion so frequently
   made, that among the older rocks the foliation (or minor mineral
   banding) is commonly- parallel to the apparent) strati<U+FB01>cation (or
   major mineral banding).        This also  I have noticed in cases where
   either there was no indication of subsequent crushing, or the latter
   had not e<U+FB02>i'aced, and its effects could be distinguished from, the earlier
   structure of the rock. I once supposed this parallelism and tendency
   to horizontality to be due to the weight of superimposed beds, but for
   some time have been dissatis<U+FB01>ed with this explanation, because I could
   <U+FB01>nd no evidence that any heavy burden had been laid upon the older
   rocks till long after they had assumed a foliated structure.      Tension,
   however, would probably producelthe structure at least as readily as
   pressure, and the former of course would, as a rule, act parallel with
   the surface of the earth’s crust, while compression should be exhibited
  commonly in planes making a high angle with it.

           J. F. MAIN, M.A., D.Sc. Communicated by Prof. W. C.
           UNWIN, F.R.S.      Received April 13, 1887.
                                    (Abstract)
      The paper contains an account of some experiments on the con
  tinuous extension of bars of ice subjected to tension, made during
  the last winter in the Engadine.       To eliminate the in<U+FB02>uence of rege
  lation, the experiments have been carried on at such low temperatures
  as preclude the possibility of any effect being produced by this cause.
  The highest temperatures during the experiments were —2'6° C. in
  Experiment     I;   —1'O° C. in Experiment II; and —0'5° C. in Expe
  riment III.     These maximum temperatures only obtained for a very

          time on one or two days.                    _
      The bars were tested in a compound lever testing machine with
 accurate knife edges, the load being a known weight of shot. , The
  whole apparatus was enclosed in a double wood box.                A delicate
  thermometer graduated totenths of degrees, attached inside the box,
  ‘gave the temperature at any given time, and the range of variation
  of temperature was recorded by two maximum and minimum ther
  mometers, <U+FB01>rel inside to the roof of the inner box.            To obtain ice

 free from air, water was boiled and then frozen. It was then melted
 and again frozen in a mould.        Some dif<U+FB01>culty was found in holding
 the ice-bars in the testing machine.      The mode which answered best
 was to freeze the ends of the ice bar into conical metal collars, which
 <U+FB01>tted the shackles of the machine. Extensions were measured by
 vernier callipers reading to one-<U+FB01>ftieth of a millimetre between marked
 points on the metal collars.      To determine if any appreciable effect
 was due to distortion of the enlarged ends of the bars in the metal
 collars, pieces of paper were gummed on the ice, and the extensions
 also measured between <U+FB01>ne pencil marks on these pieces of paper.      It
‘was found that nearly all       the  stretching observed in measuring
 between the metal collars was due to stretching of the bar of ice, and
 only a very small part to shearing action in the collars. In conse
 quence of rapid evaporation from the surface of the ice bar, the stress
 with a <U+FB01>xed load on the lever increased. from day to day.
     Three experiments are given on bars initially about 234 mm. in
 length, loaded to stresses of from 413 to 2'0 kilos. per square cm.,
 and lasting from four to nine days.
     The three experiments show that ice subjected to tension stretches
 continuously by amounts which depend on the temperature and the
 tensile stress.   When the stress is great and the temperature not very
 low, there are extensions amounting to per cent. of the length per
 day. So continuous and de<U+FB01>nite is the extension, that it can even be
 measured from hour to hour. These extensions took place at tem
 peratures which preclude the possibility of melting and regelation.
     The author hopes that on resuming the experiments next winter
 at St. Moritz, he may be able to determine more exactly the
 law of the extension.       He has shown already that the extension
 increases continuously with all stresses above 1 kilo. per square cm.,
 and at all temperatures between —6° C. and freezing.           When ice
 is in a condition such that the Point of a needle will cause a set of
 radiating fractures to pass from the point of contact in all directions,
 it stretches as certainly, though not by so great an amount, as when
 it will permit the passage through it of the same needle without
 showing <U+FB02>aw or scar.
     In the <U+FB01>rst experiment there was a total extension of 11 mm. in
 nine days; in the second of 1‘8 mm. in <U+FB01>ve days; in the third of
  1'7 mm. in three days.    If we assume the extension proportional to
 the time, there was a mean daily extension of 1'2 mm., 0'36 mm., and
 0‘56 mm. respecti‘vely.      The stress in N0. 1 was greater than in
 Nos. 2 and 3. and the temperature not so very low in the day, though
 low at night. In No. 3 there was a low stress, but comparativer
 high temperature.

   The author <U+FB01>nds that the tubercles on               the    roots of the Legu
minoseas are due to the action of a parasitic fungus.             Not only has he
produced the       tubercles  by infection from without, but he has also
found the infecting agent, and repeatedly seen and <U+FB01>gured the infect
ing hypha passing down inside a root-hair and across the cortex of the
root into the young tubercle. Here the hyphal branches bud o<U+FB01>
yeast-like cells, which are extremely minute and numerous, and
resemble bacteria at <U+FB01>rst sight; they differ in their mode of multi
plying by budding.
   The action of these minute germ-like bodies causes the protoplasm of
the cells of the root to assume plasmodium-like characters,                    and
induces the <U+FB02>ow of nutritive substances to these cells, and hypertrophy
results.    On the decay of the tubercles, the germ-like bodies pass
into the soil (where they can always be found) and infect other roots ;
it is very probable they may be of extreme importance in agriculture.

   The proteids of the seeds of Abrus, the Indian liquorice, are im
portant physiologically, because they have been shown (by Warden
and Waddelh“) to be possessed of poisonous properties.                      To the
poisonous     product   extracted   by these     observers   the   name  “abrin”
was given ; and though it was decided that abrin was closely allied to
“ plant-albumin,” yet no experiments were recorded to show whether
the product was a mixture or a single proteid. They obtained it by

making a watery extract of the crushed seeds and precipitating with
alcohol, the precipitate being afterwards collected and dried.
    Before proceeding to an examination of the physiological action of
the jeqnirity, it seemed to me desirable to determine the kind of
proteids present in the seeds, and the present communication em
bodies the results of the inquiries made with a view to such deter
mination.
                    llIethod of Extraction of the Proteids.
     The method used was based on the supposition that the proteids
present in Abrus were similar to those in other seeds, consisting
chie<U+FB02>y of proteids of the globulin and albumose classes.
     The <U+FB01>nely ground seeds were shaken <U+FB01>rst of all with chloroform to
remove the red cuticle which sinks in this liquid, so that the yellow
kernel-powder could be readily removed, and obtained in the dry state
by allowing the chloroform to evaporate.
     The powder obtained was then extracted with 15 per cent. sodium
chloride solution for twenty-four hours, and the mixture <U+FB01>ltered. The
yellowish <U+FB01>ltrate was distinctly acid and gave a copious precipitate on
boiling.      The proteids were separated from this <U+FB01>ltrate in two
ways :—
     (1.) Saturation with neutral ammonium sulphate and shaking for
four hours throws down all the proteids in solution; the <U+FB01>ltrate, after
 saturation, giving none of the proteid tests.
     (2.) Saturation with sodium chloride and shaking for many hours
gives only a scanty precipitate, which becomes copious on adding a
large excess of glacial acetic acid.         All the proteids are only with
 dif<U+FB01>culty precipitated by     this mode of  saturation, even after prolonged
                                           '
shaking.
     Since ammonium sulphate so readily throws down all the proteids
 in solution, the precipitate caused by it was used in the following
 manner in the examination of the proteids:-—The precipitate was
 collected and dissolved by adding distilled water, and the solution
 dialysed in running water (with thymol) for <U+FB01>ve to seven days.
     Dialysis caused a copious precipitate, which was collected and
 washed with distilled water (previously boiled to remove carbon
 dioxide) until no proteid in solution was present in the washings.
  The precipitate was then dried over sulphuric acid. The residue was
  in dark-brown scales.      It consisted of globulin with some colouring
  matter.                                                                .
      It is not possible to remove all the globulin by dialysis, so the
  liquid, after dialysing for seven days, was <U+FB01>ltered into recti<U+FB01>ed spirit,
  which precipitated the remaining proteids. After standing under the
  alcohol six to eight weeks the globulin was coagulated, and the preci
   pitate was collected, dried, and treated with distilled water, which

  1887           Proteids   of  the Seeds    of Abrus precatorius.               333
 dissolved out a proteid.         This proteid is an    albumose.        The chloride
of sodium method may           be used instead of the ammonium sulphate;            it
 takes a longer time, but gives products freer from colouring matter.
    For chemical examination, the albumose is readily prepared by
 boiling and <U+FB01>ltering an aqueous infusion of the seed. The globulin
 is coagulated while the albumose remains in solution.
                               Properties of the Globulin.
    1. It is insoluble in distilled water, but readily soluble in 10 to 15
 per cent. sodium chloride or magnesium sulphate solution ; soluble to
 a less extent in 5 per cent. sodium chloride solution, and scarcely at
 all in 0'75 per cent.
    2. It is completely precipitated from solution by saturation with
sodium chloride after slightly acidifying,                 and with ammonium
sulphate, whether the solution be neutral, acid, or alkaline.
    3. It is coagulated by heat in 10 per cent. magnesium sulphate
solution, between 75° and 80° 0., the liquid being made distinctly
acid; in 10 per cent. sodium chloride, between 66° and 73° C.
    4. When the solution in 10 per cent. sodium chloride is placed in
the incubator at 35° to 40° (1., and allowed to remain twenty-four or
even forty-eight hours, n0 precipitation occurs; a reaction in marked
contrast to that given by some vegetable globulins.                      In its high
coagulation temperature, and in its non-precipitation from solution by
prolonged exposure to a moderate heat, abrus-globulin agrees with the
proteid    I have described in the juice of the fruit of Gartca papaya,
which, from its resemblance to serum-globulin,                I  have called vege
table paraglobulin<U+FB01>“         The vegetable myosins occurring in the cereals,
wheat, rye, and barley, have a lower coagulation temperature than the
paraglobulins, viz., 50°-55° 0., and are precipitated from solution and
rendered insoluble by a prolonged exposure to a temperature of 35°—
40° (3.1“
                            Properties of    the Albumose.
   1. Soluble in cold or boiling distilled water.               Its chemical and
physical properties are not apparently altered by boiling its solution.
   2. It is not precipitated from solution by saturation with sodium
chloride unless a large excess of glacial acetic or phosphoric acid be
added. It is readily precipitated by saturation with neutral ammo
nium sulphate.
   3. It does not form an albuminate.
   4. Nitric acid does not precipitate it in a watery solution; but a pre
cipitate falls if solid sodium chloride be added nearly to saturation.

    A diameter is the locus of mean points of a system of parallel
chords, which may be called “its” chords; but through any point
 pass two chords which have that as mean point.               Considering the
 points then on a given     diameter, its own chords through those points
are all parallel to the polar of its own mean point with respect to the
 “ centroid,” which polar is itself a double chord; the other
                                                                    system of
chords touch a parabola, which is touched by the diameter itself at its
own mean point; viz., for that point the diameter is itself the chord
of the second system; and the connector of that point with. the centre
                    ” is a diameter of the
 of the “ centroid                          parabola.      To every diameter
of the cubic corresponding to a parabola, the envelope of all these
 parabolas is a quartic curve; while the double chords, which are
otherwise distinguished as those having their mean points on the
 ?‘ centroid,” envelope a second cuspidal quartic.
    The locus of the mean points of the diameters of the cubic is a
                                                          “ centroid,” and its
second cubic, having a node at the centre of the
asymptotes as its nodal tangents. Every diameter cuts this cubic in
its own mean point, and the mean points of two other diameters;
.and this latter pair of points are harmonic conjugates with respect to
the <U+FB01>rst and the point of contact of the diameter with the “centroid.”
    If the “ centroid ” is an ellipse its centre is merely an acuode, or
conjugate point, on the locus of mean points of diameters.
    The elliptic cubic—that which has only one real point on the line
 at in<U+FB01>nity—has two real conjugate diameters, '5.e., diameters each of
 which is the locus of mean points of chords parallel to the other, viz.,
                                               “ centroid.”

    In the case of the parabolic cubic, the “ centroid ” beinga parabola,
 the preceding statements require some modi<U+FB01>cation: viz., the en
 velopes of the double chords and of the parabolas connected each
 with a diameter of the cubic in the manner above described, degenerate
 from quartics into parabolas; and on each diameter there lies only the
(<U+FB01>nite) mean point of one other diameter, this being the mid-point of
 the segment between the mean point of the diameter itself and its
                               “
 point of contact with the centroid.”
     The above are fundamental properties of the diameters of cubics.
Some of them might have been stated more generally of the second
 polars of points lying in any right line; but it has been thought
 proper in this notice to limit the statements to the diameters only,
 viz.. the second polars of points lying on the line at in<U+FB01>nity.

       Geography in King’s College, London. Received April 21,

                               (Abstract)
  The author gives a short account of the literature of Parieasaurus,
and describes a skeleton in the British Museum, received from the
Karoo deposits of South Africa in 1878.
  The head has the external bones pitted and grooved as in Labyrin
thodonts and Crocodiles, and mucus canals are developed between
the nares and orbits such as characterise Labyrinthodontia.         The
palate, as evidenced by Parieasaurus serridens (Owen), is essentially
Anomodont in structure. The dentition, with some distinctive features,
approximates to that of Dinosaurs and Crocodiles, but though the
teeth are in sockets they are cemented to the jaw by bone.

338                        Prof. H. G. Seeley.                  [May 12,
    The suture between the pre-maxillary and maxillary bones is over
lapped by a triangular sub-nasal bone, and the pre-maxillaries are
apparently small, as in Amphibians.       The maxillary bone has a row of
large supra-dental    foramina.   The  malar   bone is excluded from the
alveolar border of the jaw.      Behind the orbits the bones which form
the cheeks are arranged as in Labyrinthodonts, and completely cover
the quadrate bone as in Labyrinthodontia and Ichthyopterygia.        They
include the post-orbital, post-frontal, squamosal, supra-temporal, and
quadrato-jugal, which is of large size.      The roof bones of the head
are the nasal bones, pre-frontals,            the supra-orbital, frontals,
parietals, (P) supra-occipital, and epiotic.
    The occipital condyle, though imperfectly preserved, was single and
formed by one bone, which is named basi-occipital, and regarded as
being an inter-central ossi<U+FB01>cation of the vertebral column, which has
been received between the exoccipital bones of the Labyrinthodont
skull, but which has not penetrated so deeply between them as in
typical Anomodonts.       The nearest approach to this condition of the
occipital condyle is seen in Ichthyosaurus.       The composite character
of the occipital condyle in Anomodontia, Chelonia, Rhynchocephalia,
Crocodilia, Sauropterygia, Aves, &c.,is accordingly regarded as due to
the preservation of the original Labyrinthodont exoccipital elements
in union with the new basi-occipital element.         And the mammalian
return to articulation of the skull by exoccipital condyles is attributed
to expansion of the brain which caused the basi-occipital bone to enter
 into the <U+FB02>oor of the brain case.
    The structure of the palate is described, and shown to resemble that
of Anomodonts, certain Labyrinthodonts, and the embryonic forms
of existing Amphibia in which the para-sphenoid has not been
 ossi<U+FB01>ed.
    The lower jaw encloses a, long chamber which extends beneath the
 teeth as in Iiabyrinthodonts.
     The dentition is described, and is chie<U+FB02>y remarkable for the uniform
 character of the teeth, for their distinctive shape, mode of union with
 the jaw, and replacement by successional teeth, which are developed
 as in Ichthyosaurs.
     The skull is compared with the skulls of the types of P. sewidens
  (Owen) and P. bombidens (Owen); and the author concludes that
 there is no satisfactory dental character to distinguish the described
 species from each other, and rests their di<U+FB01>erentiation         upon the
  forms, proportions, and structure of the head.
     Comparison is then made of the cranial characters in which
  Parieasaurus resembles other animals, so as to show how far the
  Labyrinthodont     characters are common to Fossil Reptilia, and
  how far the supposed       Dinosaurian characters may be otherwise
  regarded.

    The vertebral column comprises 29 vertebrae, of which 18 are pre
 sacral, 2 sacral, and 9 caudal, though a few caudal vertebrae may
 possibly be missing.       Crescentic intervertebral wedge-bones            are
 developed   between   most of  the  vertebrae.  The  ribs   all articulate   by
 double heads.    In the cervical region both facets are on the centrum,
and the ribs have long forks for the head and tubercle, which are of a
 Crocodilian character. The neural arch is depressed and expanded,
 and the neural canal small. The centrum is comparatively long ; and
the cervical vertebrae pass into the dorsal series in the same way as in
 Plesiosaurs.
    The dorsal vertebrae are nine in number. The parapophyses are
somewhat elongated; and the diapophysis forms a transverse process
which is only separated from the post-zygapophysial ridge by a notch.
The neural spine is a short inverted cone nearly as wide at the summit
as it is high.    The neural arch is nearly three times as wide as the
centrum is long.
    The dorsal ribs are in natural contact with the vertebrse; they are
strong, expanded vertically at the proximal ends, and directed hori
 zontally outward before they curve backward.        In the last dorsal the
parapophysis is very small.         The ribs closely resemble those of
 Crocodiles and Labyrinthodonts.        There is one lumbar vertebra with
                                                           ‘
long transverse processes.
   Two vertebrae are anchylosed together in the sacral region, but the
second does not differ in form from the early caudal, and the pelvis
is supported by the <U+FB01>rst vertebra of the sacrum. The sacral rib
has a massive development so as to extend along much of the
length of the ilium: this rib is compared to that of the great Sala
manders. The same mode of support for the pelvis is found among
the Anomodontia.       The ilium has a mammalian form and position,
lying almost entirely in advance of the acetabulum; but there is no
close correspondence in form with any mammalian genus.
   The caudal vertebrae rapidly diminish in size, and show no trace of
a notochordal condition. The neural arch is reduced in width. Small
caudal ribs were developed.
   The form of the neural spine in the vertebral column is suggestive
of the recent Japanese Salamander, but as a whole the vertebral
coldmn has nothing in common with existing Amphibians.
   The interclavicle and clavicles form an anterior bow, like that seen
in Nothosaurians, toward which the clavicular arch of the Ich
thyosaurian genus Ophthalmosaurus approximates in the mode of
union of the bones.      The interclavicle is a symmetrical A-shaped
bone with its limbs diverging, and directed backward. The scapular
arch is very massive, and appears to include coracoid and scapula.
   The only remains of dorsal armour preserved consist of relatively
small and scattered bony scutes.

    There is no evidence of limb-bones.
    The other remains which have been attributed to Parieasaurus are
referred by the author to a new genus named Phocasaurus.              This is
founded upon      the ilium originally attributed   to Parieasaurus,  and  the
bones hitherto regarded as the anchylosed scapula and coracoid, are
now regarded as the anchylosed pubis and ischium of the same
individual animal to which the ilium belongs.           The ilium is inter
mediate between that of an Ornithosaur and the ilium of a seal.
The further detailed discussion of Phocasaurus is reserved. One
ilium attributed to Parieasaurus is referred to Dicynodon.
    Parieasaurus is placed in the sub-order Parieasauria, which is
grouped under the Anomodontia.
    On comparison of Parieasaurus with reputed Dinosaurs from South
Africa, it is shown that although the teeth of Anthodon resemble
those of Acanthopholis, the bones of the post-orbital region of thev
skull are arranged upon the Labyrinthodont plan which characterises
Parieasaurus.       There is no evidence of the af<U+FB01>nities of Tapinoce
phalus except the sections of the teeth, but since they are hollow and
implanted as in Parieasaurus, it is probable that that genus also is not
 Dinosaurian.       The only Dinosaurs known from South Africa are the
 genera    Orosaurus   and Euskelesaurus described by Professor Huxley
 in 1866.
    Concerning the af<U+FB01>nities of Parieasaurus, the author interprets the
blending of Labyrinthodont and Reptilian characters on the hypo-
 thesis that Parieasaurus exhibits a transition from the Amphibia to
the Reptilia.      The animal is regarded as technically a reptile ; but as
 showing both in the skull and vertebral column characters which are
 typically Labyrinthodont, though they are for the most part unknown
 among existing Amphibians.        The Reptile order to which the resem
 blances come closest is the Anomodontia.        And since the resemblance
 in the sacrum and pelvis amounts to absolute coincidence in plan, and
 in the palate to close approximation, it is inferred that the cranial differ
 ences which separate Parieasaurus from the Anomodonts are no more
 important than those which distinguish the skull of a turtle from the.
 skull of a tortoise; and that with the acquisition of the single basi
 occipital condyle there came about a gradual loss of the distinctivev
 Labyrinthodont characters.        But the Labyrinthodontia is a large,
 group including many sub-orders, some of which approximate to
 living Urodeles, others to living Reptilia, and yet others to fossil
 Reptilia.    It is urged that the Ichthyopterygia form the most primi
 tive order, derivative from the Labyrinthodont group, having lost the
 epiotic bones but retaining the post-orbital and supra-temporal with the
 covered quadrate bone ; that the form of vertebra in Ichthyosaurus with
 its articular tubercles for the rib, reproduces the vertebra of Eosaurus
 and Anthracosaurus and other Labyrinthodonts, while the dorsal ribs

 1887.]          On Parieasaurus bombidens (Owen).                    341
in the two groups are identical.       Similarly from the structure of
Parieasaurus and its af<U+FB01>nities to Mesosaurus, it is argued that the
Nothosauria and Plesiosauria are closely related; and since they have
the long bones ossi<U+FB01>ed as   in existing Amphibians, with the biconcave
vertebrae, double-headed cervical ribs on the centrum   (in many genera),
with dorsal ribs rising to the neural arch, and much in common in
the clavicular and pelvic arches, it is held to be a legitimate inference
that both the Nothosauria and Plesiosauria have undergone, with the
acquisition of the basi-occipital bone, a loss of Labyrinthodont charac
ters, which has removed from the skull every technical trace of the
group from which both of those orders are shown to have been derived,
by the Amphibian and Labyrinthodont characters which they have pre
served in other parts of the skeleton. Similarly it is concluded that the
Crocodilia derive their typical characters from the Labyrinthodontia.
The crocodilian skull preserves the anterior position of the nares and
small size of the pre-maxillary bones.       The temporal fossw are sub
stantially similar, and the unossi<U+FB01>ed condition of the post-orbital
membrane in crocodiles accounts for the absence of the post
orbital and supra-temporal bones between the post-frontal and squa
mosal bones above, and the jugal and quadrato-jugal bones below.
While if those ossi<U+FB01>cations were developed in the vacuity behind the
eye the quadrate would be completely hidden, and the skull would be
externally as Labyrinthodont as that of Ichthyosaurus.       The number
of pre-sacral vertebrae in crocodiles shows no great divergence from
Parieasaurus; while the mode of articulation of the dorsal ribs in
Parieasaurus, although not quite crocodilian, make a nearer approach
to the crocodilian type than is seen among other Reptilia, and is so
similar as to justify the conclusion which the skull suggests—that
Crocodilia have been modi<U+FB01>ed from a Labyrinthodont ancestry;            If
this conclusion is admitted for the Crocodilia, it follows for the
Dinosauria also, since that group is essentially a parallel variation
from the crocodilian type. The Proterosauria are already known to
show many Labyrinthodont characters, combined with those of reptiles
and mammals ; and the similar Ornithosaurian pelvis is essentially a
variation from that of the Anomodont, and would thus be an inherit
ance of structures which were of Labyrinthodont origin.        Hence the
Reptilia are to be regarded as related to each other as descendants
from a common and varied ancestral type; and, therefore, the orders
should be grouped in parallel rather than vertical or successive rela
tion to each other.
   The mammalian characters of the pelvis and sacrum of Pariea
saurus and the other Anomodonts are quite as striking as the Avian
characters of certain Dinosaurs, and of the same kind of importance
as evidence of a<U+FB02>inity.      If the community of structure of Iguano
donts and Birds is held to establish a common origin for both groups,

then the community of structure with mammals which appears in the
pelvis in Parieasaurus, and is variously developed in other parts of
the skeleton, in many allied genera of Anomodontia and Theriodontia,
must similarly be held to establish a common origin for these
mammalian and reptilian structures by inheritance from amphibian
ancestors.

  I. THE BAKERIAN LEGTURE.—“ On the Dissociation of some
     Gases by the Electric Discharge.” By J. J. THOMSON, M.A.,
     F.R.S., Fellow of Trinity College, and Cavendish Professor
     of Experimental Physics in the University of Cambridge.
     Received May 26, 1887 .
                                   (Abstract)
   The   gases    considered are iodine, bromine, chlorine, and nitrogen
tetroxide.      The e<U+FB01>ects of the spark on iodine and bromine were in
vestigated in two ways. In the <U+FB01>rst method the iodine was placed in
a tube from which the air had been exhausted, and which was
furnished with a gauge which served to measure the changes of
pressure in the tube.         The liquid in the manometer was sulphuric
acid, and in order to avoid any disturbance due to the absorption of

344       Dissociation     of  Gases by the     Electric Discharge.    [May 26,
the iodine vapour by this substance, the discharge tube was doubled
so that the iodine vapour was symmetrically placed with reference to
the sulphuric acid.       The system was then placed in an oil-bath and
maintained at a temperature which varied in di<U+FB01>erent experiments
from about 200° to 230°.
   On sparking through such a tube with an induction coil giving a
spark about 3 inches long in air, the pressure rapidly increases at
<U+FB01>rst, but the rate of increase gradually diminishes and the pressure
<U+FB01>nally becomes steady.        On stopping the coil by far the greater part
of this increase is permanent, or at any rate lasts for several hours.
It is not due to the decomposition of the vapour from the sulphuric
acid in the gauge, for it does not occur if there is no iodine in the
gauge, or if the iodine is replaced by bromine.                This increase of
pressure   can    be  produced by       the  silent   discharge as well as by
ordinary sparking.         In  order to simplify the conditions as much as
possible, I had an arrangement made by which instead of determining
the increase of pressure by the sulphuric acid gauge, the vapour
density of the iodine after sparking could be measured.                  In this
arrangement     the  iodine  was  never   near  any sulphuric acid.
   The result of these determinations is shown in the following table,
and it is seen that the results con<U+FB01>rm those obtained by the <U+FB01>rst
method.

                   170    ........      232     ........     86
   In the last experiment the vapour-density was determined 24 hours
after the sparking.
   These <U+FB01>gures point to very considerable dissociation of the iodine,
in fact the dissociation produced by the spark at 214° is as much as
that produced by Victor Meyer at the temperature 1570° C.
   The appearance of the dissociated iodine is not greatly di<U+FB01>erent
from that of the unsparked, its colour, however, is              I think a little
lighter and not so uniform.          I was not able to detect any change in
the absorption spectrum produced by the sparking.                    The electric
strength of the sparked gas was however less than that of the un
sparked.

                                     Bromine.
   When the experiment with the pressure gauge is made with
bromine instead of iodine, it is found that there is a considerable
increase of pressure produced by the passage of the spark, but that
this disappears almost as soon as the sparking, and on determining
the vapour-density of the sparked and unsparked bromine it is found
that they are identical. It seems most probable that the diiference
between bromine and iodine is not that the bromine is not dissociated
by the spark, but that the atoms combine very much more quickly
than the iodine atoms.         The vapour-density determinations showed
that bromine vapour is dissociated if it is heated for a long time at a
low pressure, even though the temperature is not very high.
    The results of these determinations are given in the following

    These experiments show that it takes a long time for bromine to
reach a state of equilibrium, and that for the experiments on the
vapour-density, the gas should be maintained at a constant tempera
ture for some time before the experiments are made.

in   the paper.

     The author commences by quoting the description of some apparatus
 and experiments which have led M. Thore to suspect the existence of
  a new force inherent in the human organism.               M. Thore suspends a

  small cylinder of ivory by a <U+FB01>bre of cocoon silk, forming a small
 pendulum, which hangs freely over the centre of a table. The cylinder
 having become motionless, M. Thore brings a second cylinder, called
 the “ pillar,” about a millimetre from the <U+FB01>rst cylinder, when the latter
 begins to rotate clockwise if the pillar is on the left, and counter
 clockwise if the pillar is on the right of the cylinder.   The observer
 is supposed to face the cylinder and pillar.     M. Thore says that the
 rotation is independent- of the nature of the cylinders, of their mass,
 or the dimensions of the pillar; light, heat, electricity, magnetism,
 gravity, and air currents, he says, are also inadequate to explain the
 phenomena.
    The author has repeated M. Thore’s experiments in apparatus shown
 in the accompanying <U+FB01>gure. It consists of a glass case, A, B, C, D, E,
 F, 6% inches square and 7 inches high, with a rising glass window, A,

  pulley for convenience of raising and lowering the glass.
      Ivory, ebonite, glass, and metal have been used for the cylinders
  sad for the pillars.       The pillars have also been made square, round,
  and Wedge-shaped        in section, and the surfaces have been bright and
  lamp-blacked.       The mode of experimentation is the following :—The
  cylinder being at rest, the observer sits down in front of the apparatus
  with his face 8 inches from the cylinder and pillar, taking precautions
       keep the breath as much as possible away from cylinder and pillar.
  The pillar is always placed on the right of the cylinder.              On raising
 the front glass the cylinder commences to rotate in the opposite direc
 tion to the hands of a clock, the side nearest the observer moving to
 the right?“
      In other experiments a <U+FB02>ask of boiling water, a candle, and a hot
 platinum wire have been used as the source of radiation.               The results
 of more than <U+FB01>fty experiments are given in tables, showing the
 material of the pillar, the maximum speed of one revolution, the
 number of revolutions, and the exciting agent.               Experiments tried
 with an ascending current of air of different degrees of intensity in
 front of the apparatus prove that air currents are inoperative in
 producing the action.
      The results leave little doubt that the action is one of radiation
from the face or other warm body in front of the apparatus, and
that there is nothing special in the human organism beyond the heat
it radiates to produce rotation of the cylinder.
     Radiant heat (and in less degree light) falling on the lampblacked
surfaces is absorbed, and increases the surface temperature. There
are two ways in which this increase of temperature may act :—
      1. It may produce a current of warm air, rising in front of the
surfaces of the moving body; to replace this, cold air will come in
from all sides, and striking against the delicately suspended cylinder
cause it to rotate. If, hOWever, the source of heat is of considerable
surface, such as the face or a Winchester quart bottle full of warm
water, it is dif<U+FB01>cult to imagine that there will be much tendency to
rotate in one direction rather than in the other.
     2. An increased surface temperature of the cylinder and pillar may
produce an increase of molecular pressure between the two bodies,
     * This is called the negative directlou, and when the rotation is clockwise it is
called positive.

and thus give rise to motion, after the manner of the radiometer.             In
this, as in the former case, the movement should be in the opposite
direction to what it is in reality, as it would be produced by mutual
repulsion acting between the sides nearest the source of heat.
   It seemed likely that information, decisive as regards one or other
of these two theories, might be gained by suspending the cylinder in
a glass tube attached to a Sprengel pump, and taking observations at
di<U+FB01>ercnt degrees of exhaustion.
   In experiments tried by the author in 1875* the noteworthy fact
was ascertained, that two bodies of different temperature attracted
each other at normal atmospheric pressure ; the attraction rose as the
pressure diminished, until, at a tension of 1'15 mm., it was nearly four
times what it was in dense air.         Above this exhaustion the attraction
suddenly dropped and changed to repulsion, which at the best vacuum
obtained was nearly thirteen times stronger than the attraction in
air.
   Two forms of apparatus are described by the author, wherewith
experiments were tried during exhaustion, and an exact parallelism
was established between the attraction or repulsion of the cylinder by
a hot platinum spiral, and the positive or negative rotations of the
cylinder under the in<U+FB02>uence of a warm body brought near.
   The two phenomena run absolutely in parallel lines; when there is
attraction negative rotation is also produced; when the exhaustion is
such that the attraction is ml, the rotation is nil also; when the
attraction changes to repulsion the rotation changes from negative to
positive; and when the vacuum is very good, so that the repulsion
between the two heated bodies is at its maximum, then also the
positive rotation is the strongest. It is impossible to resist the con
clusion that the two sets of phenomena are due to the same cause,
and that as air currents did not produce the attractions observed in
the 1875 experiments, so likewise are they equally inoperative in
giving rise to the present rotations of the suspended cylinder.
   If the rotation is_produced by a reaction between the suspended
and <U+FB01>xed body, it follows that were both free to move each would
rotate, but in opposite directions.          To test this, another apparatus
was made, having two delicately suspended cylinders, 1 mm. apart,
in a glass tube capable of being exhausted.            In a table the results of
twenty-two experiments are described, observations having been
taken at intervals during exhaustion. Down to 14: mm. pressure
the two cylinders rotate negatively (i.e., the right hand cylinder
rotates clockwise, and the left hand cylinder counter-clockwise).
Between 14: and 3 mm. there is no rotation, and below 3 mm. the
rotation is positive, the movement at an exhaustion of 0'0495 mm.
being <U+FB01>ve times as strong as it was originally.

1  The motive force producing these rotations is, at high exhaustions,
the molecular impacts between adjacent surfaces of the suspended
cylinders excited by the radiation falling on them from the hot water,
hot spiral, or   acandle (which   isequally effective). But what pro
duces the negative rotation at ordinary atmospheric pressure        Air
                                                                      ?
currents are the obvious explanation, but there are grave reasons for
believing this explanation inadequate.     In the <U+FB01>rst place actual air
currents when tried do not produce the desired result. Secondly,           it
is  most logical to assume that as the present set of experiments are
strictly parallel with those tried in 1875, and as in each case the
results at high exhaustions are due to molecular bombardment, so
also must the similar results at low exhaustions be due to the same
cause.
   Finally, twenty-one experiments in the form of a table are de
scribed, in which an apparatus was employed, specially designed to
eliminate the interfering action of air currents, and submit the
molecular bombardment theory to crucial experiments. The results
are considered by the author as conclusive in favour of this expla
nation.
                      Addendum, May 24,           1887   .
I     sent M. There a detailed account, of my experiments, asking him
to favour me with any comments or remarks he might wish to make.
I   have just received a long communication, partly printed and part
in MS., in which he describes many fresh experiments, and adduces
arguments to show that my dynamical explanation             not suf<U+FB01>cient to
                                                             is
account for more than a few of the facts he describes, and saying thatv
he “persists in still believing that this force emanates from the
observer, or else that the observer    is the indispensable intermediary
for its manifestation.”
    The experiments are numerous and are devised with great inge
nuity.    It is impossible in the space of a brief abstract to do more
than refer to a few of the principal facts here brought forward.
M. Thore commences by objecting to my having experimented in an
enclosed space, saying that he always operates in free air. He thinks
that enclosure may almost or quite suppress his forCe.        To this I  can
reply   that I have  myself veri<U+FB01>ed nearly  all M. Thore’s facts of rotation
 (including those just now communicated), when working in the free
air of a large room, and     it  was only when    I  found the delicacy of
the observations was impeded          by draughts and currents that       I
put screens round the apparatus.       I    have not found glass screens
interfere materially   with   any  of the  rotations. M. Thore now says
that  it     necessary to hold the pillar or the exciting body in contact
            is
 with the hand during the whole duration of the experiment.               I
                                                                  2
                                                                  c   2

was not aware that importance was attached to this point, but               I  have
since repeated many       of  my    former   observations, holding    the pillar in
the hand. The results are certainly stronger, but the extra heat
imparted to the apparatus is in my opinion suf<U+FB01>cient to account for
this. M. Thore brings forward many new and ingeniously devised
experiments to prove that heat cannot be considered the cause of the
movement.       He exposes the instrument to the full sun and then
 brings it into a cool dark room; he suspends it over boiling water;
he places a large block of ice between the cylinder and the observer;
he similarly interposes metallic vessels full of boiling water between
the cylinder and observer (the observer not moving from his place in
front), and he tries the experiment in a hot chamber alternately
moist and dry, without <U+FB01>nding the regularity of the movements inter
fered with.     I  have tried most of these, and obtained results corrobo
rating M. Thore’s, but       I   have also tried the experiment of quietly
bringing near to the stationary cylinder a bottle of hot water and
observing the movement from a safe distance through a telescope, and
I  <U+FB01>nd that the hot bottle is able to effect rotation as well as- the
observer.
   Among the curious observations mentioned by M. Thore is this :—
Placing the pillar in front of the cylinder (between it and the
observer), if the pillar is held with the right hand the movement is
clockwise, and if the left hand is used the rotation is counter-clock
wise.    The right hand is stronger in its e<U+FB01>'ects than the left hand in
the proportion of 2 to 1.
   M. Thore has given in addition a large number of curious and
interesting     observations, using          two, three, and more movable
cylinders and recording their movements under a great'variety of
circumstances.       I  admit    I  do not see at once how all- these are to
be explained on the molecular bombardment theory.                  But this theory
has not yet explained        all   the  anomalous     results  I have  recorded in
my papers on
                    “
                       Repulsion resulting from Radiation,” althOugh-             I
believe it capable of doing so; and             I  therefore think that it is not
necessary    to  call  upon    a   new   force   to  explain any of M. Thore’s
 results which    radiation   does    not  yet  seem  able to account for.

        F.L.S., and WALTER GARDINER, M.A.                    Communicated by
        Professor M. FOSTER, Sec. R.S.           Received May           31, 1887.
     The growing point of many ferns is found to be covered with a
  slimy mucilage which arises from hairs situated on the pales and the
  leaves, or where palee are absent on the leaves only.             This mucilagin
  ous secretion serves a most important physiological function, in that
  it readily takes up and retains water, and thus keeps the young bud
  moist, and at the same time tends to prevent too excessive transpira
  tion. The cells which secrete the mucilage are large and swollen,
  and the secretion escapes by the rupturing of the cell wall.                    We
  investigated two cases of mucilaginous secretion, viz.,' Bleclmu'm occi
  dentale (L.), where in each hair only the terminal cell is glandular, and
   Osmunda regalis (L.), where usually all the cells of the hair are
  equally endowed with secretory function.          We <U+FB01>nd that the mucilage
  arises from the protoplasm only and not from the cell wall, and that
  the whole process is distinctly intraprotoplasmic.            The structure of a
  mature gland is wonderfully like that of the secretory animal cells
  investigated by Langley)“ and indeed the very words used by him in
  the description of certain of the secretory cells will quite well
  apply to the particular glands investigated by us, for we also <U+FB01>nd
 that “in the mature cells the cell substance is composed of (a) a
 framework of living substance or protoplasm connected at the peri
                                                                         ”
 phery with a thin continuous layer of modi<U+FB01>ed protoplasm (our ecto
                      “ within the meshes of the framework are enclosed
 plasm), and that
 two chemical substances at least, viz. (b), a hyaline substance in
 contact with the framework, and (c) spherical granules which are
 embedded in the hyaline substance.” In our case we have also to add,
 that the whole cell is- enclosed in a cell wall. We <U+FB01>nd, in other words,
that in the glandular cells, investigated by us, mucilage is secreted
in the form of drops, and that each drop is further differentiated with
a ground substance (gum mucilage) in which are embedded numerous
spherical droplets (gum).
     The mature cells which we have described are quite full of the
secretion, so that the vacuole containing the cell sap has become com
pletely obliterated.      This is occasioned mainly by the voluminous
character of the secretion, which takes up water and becomes very
bulky. The young glands, howeVer, display the usual structure of
young cells, each containing a nucleus, plastids (which in the case of
Usmuncla form numerous starch grains), and a vacuole.                      Secretion

  354                                       of Mucilage Cells.        [June   16,
  commences      by the breaking down of a portion of the innermost layers
  of the endoplasm at a number of contiguous but isolated areas.             The
  result of these katabolic changes in the protoplasm is the formation of
  small but rapidly growing mucilage drops. The <U+FB01>rst formation occurs
  just beneath the free surface, and takes place equally around the
  whole cell cavity, and the phenomenon steadily continues from within
  outwards, producing new drops basipetally, and immediately beneath
  those already formed, until the whole of the endoplasm, together with
  the substance of the plastids (or starch grains), have taken part in
  the process, and the cell is new full of isolated drops, each enclosed
  by 'a portion of the delicate protoplasmic framework which still
  remains.
     A remarkable sequence of changes occurs in the drops themselves.
  At their <U+FB01>rst formation they are watery and by no means well de<U+FB01>ned.
  By the use of osmic acid it can then be shown that they contain no
  tannin. They shortly become denser, and at this stage tannin appears
  equally distributed throughout their structure.               And now in the
  drops   themselves   a delicate  reticulation   may  be  observed, which <U+FB01>nally
  gives way to the appearance       of   numerous   minute and brightly shining
  droplets, all separate and distinct, disseminated through the substance
  of the drop, just as the drops themselves are disseminated through
  the substance of the protoplasm. Reactions show that the ground
  substance of the drops is of the nature of a gummy mucilage, while
  the drops consist of pure gum. Our observations make us disposed
  to believe that during secretion the protoplasm gives rise to a gummy
  mucilage, and the latter undergoes further differentiation into a
  ground substance which still retains its mucilaginous character, and
  into a gummy substance (a product probably of maximum chemical
  change) which is present as a number of isolated spherical droplets.
  In the light of these remarks the structure presented by the mature
  cell becomes more clear.
     In the case of many animal glands, e.g., serous and mucous salivary
  glands, Langley concludes that the protoplasm forms the hyaline
  substance, and then out of this manufactures the granules, which
  during secretion are turned out of the cell and give rise to the parti
  cular substance which the gland secretes.           The state of active secre
  tion is   followed   by  a  resting    period  during which the protoplasm
  grows, forms new hyaline substance, and this again produces new
  granules. We believe that a series of changes essentially similar in
  character occurs in plant cells also.         Usually speaking, plant cells are
  incapable    of  uch  active  and   repeated    secretion as occurs on those of
  animals,    and in many   cases, e.g.,  Blechnum,  and Osmunda, the secretion
  changes occur in the cell     once   and for all, and at their termination the
  cell dies. In other instances, however, e.g., the glands of Dionaaa, it
  appears exceedingly probable that the phenomena which accompany

    the repeated  secretion are quite similar to those which happen in so
    many   animal glands.                            .
      The various changes which accompany mucilaginous secretion are
    not shown by Bleclmum oacidentale.     In Osmundu. the drops are much
   less de<U+FB01>ned, and, although more numerous, are smaller.      The changes
'
   which occur in the drops were observed in Blechnum occidentale.       In
    Osmunda we did not succeed in following them; but since the two
   glands practically present the same structure in the mature cells, we
   are led to infer that the various processes are similar in both.
      The secretion consisting of the mucilage drops and the disorganised
   protoplasmic framework escapes by the rupturing of the wall, and the
   disintegrated nucleus and the endoplasm are the only structures left
   in the cell.
      In Osmu'nda. the transverse walls are callussed on both sides, and
   the whole system (wall and callus plate) is obviously perforated by
   <U+FB01>ne holes, which in the functional cell are <U+FB01>lled by delicate strands of
   protoplasm. These establish a direct continuity between the proto
   plasmic contents of the various cells of the hair.
      We believe that in their main features the phenomena attending
   the formation of the secretion are such as are very widespread, and
   limited neither to the ferns nor to the particular case of secretion of
   mucilage.

 which enters the root by way of the root hairs. The ultimate branches
 of the hyphae in the cells of the tubercle bud o<U+FB01> minute bodies (gem

 resembles the budding discovered in Ustilagineze by Brefeld.            By

   After    an introduction,      in which the author sets forth the present
state of knowledge          with reference       to the electromotive properties
of the electrical organ of Torpedo, he gives an account of his own
experimental investigations in three sections.
    The <U+FB01>rst section relates to the nature of the changes produced in
the electrical organ by mechanical injury and by heat, and the relation
of these changes to those which manifest themselves under similar
conditions in muscle and nerve, a subject which has not hitherto been
inquired 'into.
    In the second, the duration and the character of the response of the
electrical organ to stimulation of its nerve are investigated for the
<U+FB01>rst time by means of the rheotome and galvanometer.
    In the experiments which are recorded in the third section, the
author has entered on the examination of the after-elfects which are
produced in the organ by the passage through it of voltaic or induc
tion currents, a subject which has been recently investigated by
du Bois-Reymond.
   The author is led by his experiments to believe that the physiologi
cal e<U+FB01>ects produced in the organ by injury, by the passage of currents,
and by the stimulation of the electrical nerve, are, notwithstanding
that they di<U+FB01>er so widely from each other in distribution, duration,

   The investigation, of which a detailed account is given in the paper,
was commenced         in 1883, and some preliminary results were commu
nicated to the Royal Society in June, 1884.

the   wire heated by an electric current, and determining in absolute
measure the electric energy necessary for this purpose. This energy
is lost in radiation and in conduction at the ends, but chie<U+FB02>y in
radiation.      The wire is contained in a long copper tube, blackened
 inside, and kept cool by a water jacket; and the surface of the wire
 may be bright and polished, or may be modi<U+FB01>ed by being coated with
 lamp-black, platinum-black, oxide of copper, or some other material.
 Polished wires have been chie<U+FB02>y used hitherto; but arrangements
 for comparison of wires with surfaces differently prepared are
 described in the paper.
    Two methods of determining the electric energy have been used.
 One consists in measuring the electric current and the difference of
potentials between chosen points in the radiation-wire; the other in
measuring the current and determining simultaneously the electric
resistance, by means of a Wheatstonc bridge, modi<U+FB01>ed to suit the
necessities of the case.                                          _
   A knowledge of the resistance of the radiation-wire gives also its
temperature,     by means of separate determinations (described in the'
paper)   of the  law of alteration of electric resistance with temperature.
The temperatures of the radiation-wire and of the envelope are all
referred to the air thermometer.
   In order to vary the air-pressure surrounding the radiation-wire,
and thus obtain data for the purpose of eliminating the heat-carrying
properties of the air or other gas, the copper tube is connected, in a
manner described in the paper, with a <U+FB01>ve-fall Sprengel pump;
and the pressures      in the extreme vacuums are measured by the
M‘Leod    gauge.                   ,
   The results of the investigation, so far as it has gone, are shown in
a series of tables and curves.
    A long and very complete series of determinations has been made
of the radiation at various given constant pressures, but at di<U+FB01>erent
gradually increasing temperatures.
   By means of curves of this kind, showing radiation in extreme
vacuum, a comparison may be made between the results of experiment
and the results calculated from Stefan’s well-known fourth power
law.     The experimental results do not appear to give any support to
that law.
    Several series of determinations have been made at different con
stant temperatures, the pressure being continuously diminished.        This
mode of experimenting, by far the most appropriate to the purpose in
hand, has only recently become convenient to the author, as it requires
a special suitable current galvanometer.        Further experiments are to
be carried out with this method.
   In the meantime it may be said that on continuously diminishing, by
means of the Sprengel pump, the air surrounding the wire, a point

 has been reached   where further exhaustion does not affect the radia

 tically, in which the radiation is independent of anything removable
 by the Sprengel pump.      The value of the radiation found is, for the
 particular bright platinum wire used :—

   The intention of this paper     <U+FB01>rst, to investigate the forms which

which must exist when the two masses approach so near to one
another as just to coalesce into a single mass.
   When the two masses are far apart the solution of the problem               is
simply that of the equilibrium theory of the tides.     Each mass may,

also exercises an in<U+FB02>uence on the other and on itself, and thus there
arises another in<U+FB01>nite series of deformations.
    It is shown in the paper how the summations of these two kinds
of re<U+FB02>ected in<U+FB02>uences are to be made, by means of the solution of
certain linear equations for <U+FB01>nding three sets of coef<U+FB01>cients.
    The <U+FB01>rst set of coef<U+FB01>cients are augmenting factors, by which the
tide of each order of harmonics is to be raised above the value which
it would have if the perturbing mass were spherical. The second
set correspond to one part of the rotational effect, and belong to
terms of exactly the same form as the tidal terms, with which they
ultimately fuse.     The third set correspond to the rest of the rota
tional effect, and appertain to a different class of deformation, which
are in fact sectorial harmonics of di<U+FB01>erent orders. The term of the
second order represents the ellipticity of the mass due to rotation,
augmented,      however, by mutual in<U+FB02>uence. All the terms of this
class, except the second, are very small; their existence is, however,
interesting.                                               _
    From the consideration that the repulsion due to centrifugal force
shall exactly balance the attraction between the two masses, the
angular velocity of the system is found. It is greater than would be
the case if the masses were spherical.
    The theory here sketched is applied in the paper numerically, and
illustrated graphically in several cases.
    When the masses are equal to one another they are found to be
 shaped like <U+FB02>attened eggs, and the two small ends face one another.
 Two <U+FB01>gures are given, in one of which the small ends nearly touch,
 and in the other where they actually cross. In the latter case, as two
 portions of matter cannot occupy the same space, the reality must
 consist of a single mass of <U+FB02>uid consisting of two bulbs joined by a
 neck, somewhat like a dumb-bell.       In the <U+FB01>gure conjectural lines are
 inserted to show how the overlapping of the masses must be replaced
 by the neck of <U+FB02>uid.

    A comparison is also made between the acobian ellipsoid of equili
 brium with three unequal axes and the dumb-bell.            It appears that
 with the same moment of momentum the angular velocity is nearly
 the same in the two <U+FB01>gures, but the kinetic energy is a little less in
 the dumb-bell.      The intrinsic energy of the dumb-bell is, however,
  greater  than   that of the ellipsoid, so that the total energy of the
  dumb-bell is slightly greater than that of the ellipsoid.
     Sir William Thomson has remarked on the “gap between the
  unstable Jacobian ellipsoid     .....    and the case of the smallest
  moment     of  momentum     consistent   with  stability in two equal
  detached portions.”     “The consideration,” he says, “ of how to <U+FB01>ll

 towards answering which we at present o<U+FB01>er no contribution?“ This
 paper is intended to be such a contribution,           although an imperfect
 one.
     M. Poincare has made an admirable investigation of the forms of
 equilibrium of a single rotating mass of <U+FB02>uid, and has specially con
 sidered the stability of Jacobi’s ellipsoids?            He has shown by a
 dif<U+FB01>cult analytical process, that when the ellipsoid is moderately
 elongated, instability sets in by a furrowing of the ellipsoid along a
 line which lies in a plane perpendicular to the longest axis.               It is,
 however, extremely remarkable that the furrow is not symmetrical
 with respect to the two ends, and there thus appears to be a tendency
 to form a dumb-bell with unequal bulbs.
     M. Poincaré’s work seemed so important that, although the <U+FB01>gures
 above referred to were already drawn a year ago, this paper was kept
 back in order that an endeavour might be made to apply the prin
 ciples enounced by him, concerning the stability of such systems.
 The attempt, which proved abortive on account of the imperfection
of approximation of spherical harmonic analysis, is given in the
appendix to the paper, because, notwithstanding its failure, it presents
features of interest.
     The calculations in this paper being made by means of spherical
harmonic analysis, it is necessary to consider whether this approxi~
mate method has not been pushed too far in the computation of
<U+FB01>gures of equilibrium which depart considerably from spheres.                    A
rough criterion of the applicability of the analysis is derived from a
comparison between the two values of the ellipticity of an isolated
revolutional ellipsoid of equilibrium as derived from the rigorous
formula and from spherical harmonic analysis. As judged by this
criterion, which is necessarily in some respects too severe, the <U+FB01>gures
drawn appear to present a fair approximation to accuracy.
     Since, as above stated, the rigorous method of discussing the
stability of the system fails, certain considerations are adduced which
bear on the conditions under which there is a form of equilibrium
consisting of two <U+FB02>uid masses in close proximity, and it appears that
there cannot be such a form, unless the smaller of the two masses
exceeds about one-thirtieth of the larger.          It seemed therefore worth
while to <U+FB01>nd to what results the analysis would lead when two masses,
one of which is 27 times as great as the other, are brought close
together.      As judged by this criterion the computed result must be
very     far from  the truth, but as the criterion is too severe, it seemed
worth while to give the <U+FB01>gure. The smaller mass is found to be

elsewhere that by thinning a acobian ellipsoid in the middle, we shall get a <U+FB01>gure
of the same moment of momentum and less kinetic energy.

to represent the truth very roughly, yet it cannot be entirely explained
by the imperfection of the analytical method employed.             It appears
then as if the smaller body were on the point of separating into two
masses, in the same sort of way that the Jacobian ellipsoid may be
traced through the dumb-bell shape until it becomes two masses.

that the conditions for the separation from a mass, which is strongly
concentrated at its centre, are necessarily very different from those
which he has treated mathematically.
   However, both his investigation and the considerations adduced
here seem to show that, when a portion of the central body becomes
detached through increasing angular velocity, the portion should bear
a far larger ratio to the remainder than is observed in our satellites,
as compared with their planets; and it is hardly probable that the
heterogeneity of the central body can make so great a difference in
the results as would be necessary, if we are to make an application of
these ideas.
   It seems then at present necessary to suppose that after the birth
of a satellite, if it takes place at all in this way, a series of changes
occur which are still quite unknown.

   The principal object of the investigation w as to ascertain whether
the values of the moduli of torsional and longitudinal elasticities, as
determined by statical methods, would be the same as when deter
mined by kinetical methods, provided the deformations produced were
very small.

   The general results of the whole investigation may be expressed as
follows :—
    l. The value of the modulus of longitudinal elasticity for hard
drawn metals, as determined by the statical method of loading, accords
with the value obtained by the method'of longitudinal vibrations, pro
vided the deformations are suf<U+FB01>ciently small.
   2. The velocity of sound in a metal wire is independent of the load
on the wire.
   3. The velocity of sound in a metal wire is not sensibly altered by
permanent extension of the wire.
   4. The value of the modulus of torsional elasticity, as determined
by the statical method, accords with the value obtained by the method
of torsional vibrations for most metals in the hard-drawn condition,
provided the deformations produced are small. For annealed iron
the value of the modulus obtained by the second method slightly
exceeds that obtained by the <U+FB01>rst method, and by an amount which is
greater than can be attributed either to the heating and cooling e<U+FB01>ects
of contraction and expansion, or to errors of observation.

                                   PART   I.
    This investigation was suggested by a careful study of the reducing
 action of normal human urine upon picric acid in presence of potash
 at the boiling temperature.
    The picric acid method for the quantitative estimation of sugar in
 urine was introduced by Dr. George Johnson in 1883.                  Whilst
 assisting him  in  working out  the  details  of the process,  the  author’s
attention was drawn to the small amount of reduction exerted by all
specimens of normal human urine.             The average picric reduction
observed was equal to that which would be e<U+FB02>ected by a solution of
glucose containing 0'6 grain to     l <U+FB02>uid ounce.
    The reduction of cupric oxide in boiling alkaline solution was
always somewhat greater, averaging 0'7 grain per 1 <U+FB02>uid ounce.
Although many physiological chemists express the opinion that
normal human urine contains always a little sugar, to which this
reducing action is to be attributed, the author’s researches have led
him to an opposite conclusion.
    The reducing agent of normal urine di<U+FB01>ers from glucose in pro
ducing some reduction of picric acid in presence of potassium hydrate
at the ordinary temperature (wide Dr. R. Kirk, ‘ Lancet,’ June 16,
1883).
   The reducing agent of normal urine cannot be made to undergo
the alcoholic fermentation in presence of yeast.               Nevertheless,
Dr. Pavy (‘ Med. Chir. Soc. Trans.,’ vol. 63, p. 222) attributes one
fourth of the reducing action of normal urine upon cupric oxide to
uric acid, and the remaining three-fourths t0 “ the small amount of
sugar naturally present in urine.”
   Briicke is also of opinion that normal human urine contains a
small quantity of sugar.
   Uric acid and kreatinin together are credited by Prof. E. Salkowski
(‘ Centralblatt  fiir die Medicinischen Wissenschaften,’ March, 1886)
with from one-sixth to one-<U+FB01>fth of the total reducing action of normal
urine, the remainder being due to “other substances,                and very
probably to compounds of glycuronic acid (Glykuronsaureverbind
ungen).”

366                         Mr. G. S, Johnson.                  [June  16,
   The author found that about three-fourths of the total reducing
action of normal urine is destroyed by prolonged boiling with potas
sium hydrate, the remaining one-fourth being due to the survival of
the uric acid, thus con<U+FB01>rming Dr. Pavy’s observation that one-fourth
of the normal reducing action is due to uric acid.
   On attempting to isolate the normal reducing agents by precipitants,
it was found that mercuric chloride gradually e<U+FB01>ected complete pre
cipitation of the reducing agent when added in suf<U+FB01>cient excess to
the unconcentrated urine. Complete precipitation can be effected in
forty-eight hours if one-twentieth of its volume of a cold saturated
solution of sodic acetate be <U+FB01>rst added to the fresh urine, then one
fourth of its volume of acold saturated solution of mercuric chloride.
The precipitate, which forms immediately, should be separated by
<U+FB01>ltration, as it contains no reducing agent except uric acid, which
is probably present in it as mercuric urate ; but the <U+FB01>ltrate from the
<U+FB01>rst amorphous precipitate begins to deposit the mercury salt of the
reducing base in about half an hour. This deposit appears granular
and crystalline, but under the microscope is found to consist of
minute spherical masses. The weight of the dry spherical precipitate
is always greater than that of the amorphous one weighed in the same
condition.    The desiccation must be conducted over sulphuric acid at
the ordinary temperature, since the compound is decomposed at 1000 C.
in presence of water.
   The <U+FB01>ltrate from this granular (spherical) mercury salt is devoid
of reducing action upon cupric oxide and picric acid. The spherical
mercury salt of the reducing base (for the basic nature of the normal
reducing agent is strongly indicated by the above results) is easily
soluble in hydrochloric acid, but insoluble in acetic acid. Moistened
with solution of potassium hydrate, the compound gradually blackens
from reduction of mercury at the ordinary temperature, and much
compound ammonia is evolved. Suspended in cold water and treated
with hydrogen sulphide, the compound is decomposed, mercuric sul
phide remaining undissolved, whilst the solution becomes acid in
reaction, and exhibits reducing properties.         On evaporating this
acid  solution a crystalline salt is obtained, which is the hydrochloride
of the reducing base. As the spherical mercury salt, obtained as
above from urine, appeared        to be always quite homogeneous and
pure, with the exception of a little colouring matter, the exact weight
of the compound obtained from known volumes of urine was next
ascertained.
   The samples of urine examined were in all cases ascertained to be
free from albumen and sugar before precipitation.       The <U+FB01>ltrates from
the <U+FB01>rst or amorphous precipitate, produced by mercuric chloride and
sodic acetate, were allowed to collect in a large glass vessel, in which
the spherical compound gradually accumulated.             After standing

some days, the total precipitate was collected, washed with cold water,
 dried in a vacuum over H,SO4, and weighed.
    (1.) 34,640 0.0. of urine gave 198 grams of Hg salt, equivalent to
 5'7 grams of Hg salt per litre of urine.
    (II) 40,625 0.0. of urine gave 293'13 grams of Hg salt, equivalent
 to 7'19 grams of Hg salt per litre of urine.
    The mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity in Experiment        I  was 1'020, and the
 mean reduction of picric acid was equivalent to 0'67 grain glucose per
 1 <U+FB02>uid ounce.
    The mean speci<U+FB01>c gravity in Experiment       II  was 1'022, and the
 mean reduction of picric acid was equivalent to 0'86 grain of glucose
 per 1 <U+FB02>uid ounce.
    In my own case     I  found that the mean quantity of mercury salt
 obtained from the urine of twenty-four hours agreed very nearly with
 the above results, the total urine of six days having been carefully
 collected and examined each twenty-four hours.
    The formula of the spherical mercury salt arrived at by analysis
 is 4(O,H-,N,O.HCI.HgO).3HgClz.
    It may here be observed that mercuric chloride has been recom
 mended by Maly (‘ Ann. Chem. Pharm.,’ vol. 159, p. 279) for preparing
 kreatinin from the urine of man or the horse.      He does not mention
 the fractional precipitation by mercuric chloride, but recommends a
 preliminary concentration of the urine by heat, and precipitation by
 basis-\lead acetate before adding mercuric chloride.   On repeating his
 process   I found that even after the removal of the uric acid, &c.. by
 basic lead acetate, the mercuric chloride still produced an immediate
 <U+FB02>occulent precipitate, followed by a granular one, and if the <U+FB02>occulent
 amorphous matter was not separated by <U+FB01>ltration, the total mercury
 precipitate yielded a gummy mass after treatment with HZS, which
 would not yield crystals until treated with alcohol, as Maly himself
 recommends.      By my method, however, the hydrochloride of the
 reducing base is obtained in crystals after the <U+FB01>rst evaporation ; these
 crystals contain chlorine in the proportion required by the formula
 C4H7N30.HCI.
    The platinum salt of the reducing base is obtained in the form of
 anhydrous crystals, when an alcoholic solution of its hydrochloride is
 mixed with an alcoholic solution of platinic chloride. If these anhy
 drou crystals be dissolved in water, and the solution evaporated, or if
 the aqueous solution of the hydrochloride of the base be mixed with
 platinic chloride in aqueous solution and evaporated, <U+FB01>ne orange
 coloured prisms separate cut, which have the formula
                       2(C4H1N30H01) .PtCl4.2HZO.
 Heated to 100° 0., these     crystals become   anhydrous, yellow, and
 opaque.

   The free reducing base is obtained from its hydrochloride by mixing
the concentrated aqueous solution with excess of pure lead hydrate
without heat, and <U+FB01>ltering ; the alkaline <U+FB01>ltrate by spontaneous evapo
ration deposits large square plates with bevelled edges, or long e<U+FB01>io
rescent prisms if great care is taken to avoid heating the solution of
the hydrochloride.      The aqueous solution of the free base is alkaline
in reaction, intensely bitter to the taste, gives crystalline precipitates
with zinc chloride, mercuric chloride, and picric acid, but none with
silver nitrate, unless the solution be very concentrated.
   The reducing base, which is undoubtedly the natural kreatinin of
urine, when anhydrous, has the empirical formula C4H1NSO, but the
e<U+FB02>lorescent kreatinin, obtained only when great care is taken to avoid
heat, has the composition O‘H1N302H20.           After e<U+FB02>iorescence this
body has the same percentage composition as the anhydrous tabular
kreatinin :—
   1 part by weight of the tabular kreatinin dissolves in 10'78 parts of
water at 17° C.
   1 part of the tabular kreatinin dissolves in 362 parts of absolute
alcohol at 17° C.
   The ef<U+FB02>orescent kreatiuin (before e<U+FB02>iorescence) dissolves in 106 parts
of water at 14° C.       The et<U+FB01>oresced kreatinin requires 14 parts of
water at 141° C. for solution.                                     ~
   The natural kreatinin of urine reduces cupric oxide in proportion
as 12 : 10 parts by weight of glucose.
   The average weight of this base passed by a healthy man in twenty
four hours (as determined by weighing the spherical mercury salt
precipitated from the urine as above) is from 1‘7 to 2'1 grams, equiva
lent in reducing action upon cupric oxide to from 1‘5 to 1‘75 grams
of glucose (= 23 to 27 grains of glucose in 528 <U+FB02>uid ounces of
urine).
   Therefore cupric oxide will be reduced by the normal urine in quanti
ties equivalent to the reduction e<U+FB01>ected by 0'43 to 0'51 grain of glucose
per 1 <U+FB02>uid ounce.      The conclusion is that the total reduction e<U+FB01>ected
by normal urine    is accounted for by the uric acid and kreatinin which

    The natural urinary kreatinin yields a kreatin when its dilute
aqueous solution is subjected to prolonged ebullition ; and this
kreatin, when treated by Liebig’s process, is converted into kreatinin
hydrochlox ide.
    This arti<U+FB01>cial kreatinin hydrochloride differs from the hydrochlm
ride of the natural kreatinin of urine, in that it crystallises from cold
aqueous solution in e<U+FB01>iorescent crystals, whereas the hydrochloride of
the natural base is always anhydrous.

   Emorescent and tabular kreatinins may be obtained from this hydro
chloride, resembling in crystalline form and percentage composition
those derived from the natural hydrochloride, but exhibiting some
important di<U+FB01>erences.        Thus the platinum salt of the arti<U+FB01>cial
tabular kreatinin requires nearly twice as much water to dissolve it
as that of the natural base at the same temperature.
   Both the natural and arti<U+FB01>cial kreatinins form well-crystallised
gold salts.    The gold salt of the natural kreatinin is unchanged by
ether, but that of the arti<U+FB01>cial base is decomposed thereby, the
kreatinin hydrochloride separating out, and the auric chloride passing
into solution.
   Finally the arti<U+FB01>cial kreatinins are less powerful reducing agents
than the natural base.
   4 mols. of the natural kreatinins are equivalent to 2 mole. of
         glucose.
   5  mole. of the arti<U+FB01>cial     kreatinins are equivalent to 2 mols. of
         glucose  in reducing   action.
Therefore arti<U+FB01>cial kreatinins must not be compared with the natural
base as to their reducing action.

   Professor W. N. Hartley has observed a marked diiference in the
absorption spectra of the natural kreatinin of urine, and of an
arti<U+FB01>cial kreatinin obtained by the author from <U+FB02>esh kreatin.

   In  the greater number of Lichenes,       the fungal constituent belongs
to the section     Ascomycetes,  characterised   by having the spores pro
duced in asci.      Recently a second group of Lichenes has been de
scribed, and called Hymenolichenes, in which the fungus belongs to
the Hymenomycetous Basidiomycetes, and closely related to the
genera Corticium and Stereum.            In the present communication, a
third type of lichen structure is described, in which the fungus
belongs to the order Gasterom-ycetes, or pu<U+FB01>'- balls.     Gasterolichenes   is
the name suggested for this group, which consists of two genera,
Emericella, Berk, and Triclzocoma, J'ingh., hitherto described as
fungi.

        Professor of Applied Mathematics in Owens College. Re
        ceived May 18, 1887.
    Three years ago           I
                        gave a sketch of a theory of the passage of
electricity through gases, in which it was assumed that in the
gaseous discharge an atom carries a de<U+FB01>nite molecular charge jut as
in electrolysis (see Bakerian Lecture, ‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 37,
p. 317).     I showed how this molecular charge if constant might be
measured, and       I
                   have since that time worked continuously in arrang
ing for the necessary experiments.
    I have, with the help of a grant from the Royal Society, mounted a
battery which gives me an electromotive force of 1800 volts, which             I
hope will be suf<U+FB01>cient for my purpose.       The experiments which       I
                                                                        have
in view, involve the accurate measurement of the electric potential at
di<U+FB01>erent points of a vessel through which a discharge is passing; but
before these could be undertaken a number of intermediate questions
had to be settled by experiment.        As these have in this way estab
lished some de<U+FB01>nite points which I believe to be of importance,                I
venture to bring them before the Society.
   'In thinking over the phenomena presented to us in vacuum tubes,
I always felt a di<U+FB02>iculty owing to our ignoranceof the conditions
 which hold at the surface of bodies, either suspended in or near the
discharge, or even at the boundary of the vessel through which the
discharge is passing. It is evident enough, that if there is a <U+FB02>ow of
electricity on the surface of a non-conductor that <U+FB02>ow must be
tangential, but it is not so clear whether we are justi<U+FB01>ed in concluding
from this that there can be no normal forces at such surfaces, for it
is not necessary that the <U+FB02>ow should always take place along the lines
of force. Imagine, for instance, a discharge to consist of particles
charging at one pole, then moving, under the action of electric forces,
to the other pole; and let the vacuum be su<U+FB02>iciently good that few or
no encounters take place while it passes from one pole to another.
Then bring an electri<U+FB01>ed body near the discharge. That body may
de<U+FB02>ect the particles conveying            but unless its electri<U+FB01>cation
                                           it,                                 is
suf<U+FB01>ciently large,     will
                         it not  draw   up  the discharge to its surface, so
that the normal forces    on  the  electri<U+FB01>ed  body which has been intro
duced need not be neutralised by the discharge.
    The question    one altogether for experiment to decide.
                    is                                           Supposing
we suspend two pieces of gold leaf, as in an electroscope, at any place
in  a  partially exhausted vessel, and render them divergent by electri
<U+FB01>cation, they should collapse as soon as the discharge begins to pass.
if tangential forces only can permanently exist at their surface. This
I  have tested by experiment and found to be the case.

372                    Prof. A. Schuster.      On the          [June  16,
   A   cylindrical glass vessel, 38 cm. high and 15 cm. wide, was
divided into two approximately equal compartments by a vertical
metallic screen.     There was an open space of about 5 mm. between
the screen and the sides of the vessel, a space about 4 cm. above, and
2'5 cm. below the screen.     One compartment contained two pieces of
gold leaf, which could be charged from the outside.             The other
compartment contained two electrodes about 5 cm. apart, and 2 cm.
from the screen; these distances could be varied during the experi
ment. The screen was always conducted to earth, and the electric
<U+FB01>elds on the two sides of the screen were therefore nearly independent
of each other.    When the gold leaves were electri<U+FB01>ed and divergent,
and discharges from the induction coil passed between the electrodes
on the other side, no eifect could be observed at atmospheric pressure :
the gold leaves remained divergent.
                                                            I
   At a pressure of about 4‘3 cm. of mercury, the effect was looking
for <U+FB01>rst appeared; when the discharge passed, the divergent leaves
slowly collapsed, and as the pressure was further diminished the
collapse took place more and more quickly.
   We have here then even with the discontinuous discharge a neutra
lisation of all normal forces at the surface of the gold leaf.
   Fig. 1 illustrates in a diagrammatic form the arrangement of the
experiment, A and B being the electrodes, S the screen conducted to
earth, and E the gold leaf.

   In previous experiments, which         were  not so satisfactory from
another point of view, and which     I therefore do not quote, the same
effects were observed both with the continuous currents from the
battery and the discharges from the coil; the only difference being,
that the effects due to the continuous discharge were more rapid and
regular than those due to the induction coil. As soon as the pressure
was su<U+FB02>iciently reduced to allow the continuous discharge to pass, the
destruction of normal forces took place.
   It seemed to me to be interesting to observe more particularly the

effects    of    the  ordinary discharges we have at our command, at
atmospheric pressure.            I took two light balls, and suspended them
so that they could be made to diverge by electri<U+FB01>cation.                                   The
electrodes (either spheres or points) of aVoss machine were placed at
a distance of 3 inches from each other, and the electri<U+FB01>ed balls were
placed at a distance of 9 inches from the discharge.                              The results
are contained in the following                  table,    in which the two <U+FB01>rst
columns indicate whether the electrodes of the Voss machine were

balls, and the fourth column the results.

    It will     be seen that when the two electrodes are similar, whether
 spheres or points, the balls collapse when they are electri<U+FB01>ed posi
 tively only; but that when one electrode is a sphere and another a
 point, the halls collapse if their electri<U+FB01>cation is of the opposite nature
 to that supplied by the point.
    I shall refer to the theoretical bearing of these experiments at the
 end of the present paper, but wish at once to point out, that the
 apparent difference in the results, for pesitively and negatively
 electri<U+FB01>ed balls, can be one of degree only, and not one of kind.
 If the balls are positively electri<U+FB01>ed, they collapse when the two
 electrodes       are similar; but in the other case, when the balls are
 negatively electri<U+FB01>ed, an equal and opposite charge will be found on
 the objects placed in the room, or on the walls.                          If this positive
 electricity is neutralised by         the  discharge, the balls must ultimately
 collapse in this case, as well as when they were originally positively
 electri<U+FB01>ed. To test this argument,               I    placed the balls in a glass
 case partially covered on the inside with tinfoil.                     The inside of the
case was nearly         a cubical space     of sides    37 cm.     long. The front of
the case was taken out, and the discharge was taken between the two
points near the open front.             The halls now collapsed, whatever their
 charge was to begin with, but more quickly when they were positive
 than when they were negative.

positive balls in its neighbourhood, the question remains whether they
will collapse ultimately, whatever their distance from the discharge,
or whether there is a <U+FB01>nite distance beyond which no effect can be
observed, even if the discharge be continued inde<U+FB01>nitely.               Without
wishing to express any <U+FB01>nal opinion on the point,          I may yet give the
impression    I  have obtained from the experiments I have made.               I
believe that, whenever we have a continuous and steady discharge in
an inclosure, however large, the complete neutralisation of all normal
forces on surfaces through which no current goes is only a question
of time, but that if there is any discontinuity in the currents (as. I
believe is the case in all discharges at atmospheric pressure) there is
a de<U+FB01>nite distance (depending on the time intervening between two
discharges) beyond which no e<U+FB01>ect will be observed.
   The conclusion thus arrived at, which will be proved beyond
possibility of doubt in the second part of this paper, is this: we can
only  have tangential forces at the surfaces of vessels enclosing a gas
through which a discharge 'is passing, provided no current crosses the
surface.    It may be that thisiconclusion will appear evident to some
                                       I
without experimean proof, but found it necessary to obtain de<U+FB01>nite
evidence, because ‘the fact itself has been constantly neglected and
disregarded.
   Thus, for instance, it is found that electri<U+FB01>ed bodies placed outside
a vessel through \which a gaseous             discharge is passing, do not
permanently     affect  the  appearance    of the discharge, and this fact is
commonly     taken   to  prove  that there  can be no free electricity of either
kind in the discharge. But it follows from the surface condition at the
inside of the vessel, that this surface must act as a complete screen
between the electri<U+FB01>ed bodies placed inside and those placed outside
the vessel ; and the experiment therefore proves nothing.
   In similar fashion, Goldstein observed that certain actions of one
negative electrode on another were destroyed when a screen was
interposed between them.           The results obtained in this paper give
the obvious explanation of this fact.                               .
   After I had convinced myself that an electri<U+FB01>ed body placed in a
partial vacuum through which an electric current is going, has its
electricity quickly neutralised, it was doubtful still whether this
neutralisation was due to an actual discharge or merely to a covering
 of electri<U+FB01>ed particles of an opposite sign. The quest-ion is avital one
in all cases where potentials have. to be measured.           For we can only
measure potentials of a gas by measuring the potential of a metal
in contact with it; and if an electri<U+FB01>ed body is covered by electri<U+FB01>ed
particles of a di<U+FB01>erent sign, there is a. <U+FB01>nite di<U+FB01>erence of potential
between the metal and the gas,_and we should have to inquire care
fully, in each particular case, how far such a difference would affect
our conclusions.

  1887.]           Discharge    of Electricity through,     Gases.              375
    Hittorf. has measured with great success the fall of potential at
 di<U+FB01>erent points of a vacuum tube through which a discharge was
 passing, and none of his principal conclusions are affected by these
 scruples, for he gives in his paper suf<U+FB01>cient evidence that his method
 is applicable to the cases he has examined.           But the purposes     I  have
 in view rendered a measurement           of potential necessary under severe
 conditions, in which a serious error might have been introduced by
 assuming without veri<U+FB01>cation that therpotential of a metal is the
 same as that of a gas in contact.
    Strictly speaking, the potential is always continuous as long as we
 are dealing with <U+FB01>nite charges, but when a layer the thickness of
which extends to molecular distances has its sides charged with oppo
 site electricity, it is customary to compare the two sides of such a
layer directly with each other, and neglecting the rapid variation of
potential within the layer, to speak of a discontinuity of potential.
It is in this sense that I. am here speaking of a possible <U+FB01>nite differ
ence of potential between a metal and the gas in contact.
    The question is settled by the principal result of this paper:
    A   steady current of electricity can be obtained in air from electrodes at
the ordinary temperature which are at a di<U+FB01>crence of potential of one
quarter of a volt only (and probably less) ; provided that an independent
current is maintained in the same closed vessel.
    In other words,    a continuous discharge throws the whole vessel into
such     a state that it will conduct for electromotive forces which               I
believe    to be inde<U+FB01>nitely small, but which the sensitiveness of the gal
vanometer      I used has prevented me from tracing with certainty below
a  quarter of 8. volt. There cannot he therefore a <U+FB01>nite difference of
potential between a gas and a metal in contact greater than that
amount.
    Hittorf<U+FB01>“ who has done more to clear up this subject than anyone
else, has found already that a current from a few cells will pas cross
ways through a discharge in vacuo, but his auxiliary electrodes were
introduced into the discharge itself, and it was doubtful, therefore,
how far the results were due to the high temperature of the particles
carrying the luminous dischargle              I was aiming, on the contrary, at
placing the secondary electrodes as far from the main discharge as
possible, and at rendering by means of screens the two electric <U+FB01>elds
as independent of each other as possible.
    I need not describe all the successive experiments in which             I  have
endeavoured to make my tests more                and  more   severe.     It will be

most conclusive.
   The same vessel was used as in the previous experiment; the screen
was not so long, but left a space of 10 cm. free at the bottom.            Fig. 2
will explain the arrangement. 88' is the screen, always conducted to

are the auxiliary electrodes, which were of the form of copper cylin
ders, 4 cm. high, and having a diameter of                 l  and 1'8 cm. respec
tively. Their distance was 2 cm., and their axis was 2 cm. away from
the screen.     Of the main electrodes, one was 2 cm. and the other
1 cm. away from the screen; their distance was about 4 cm.                    The
discharge from the battery was always used.                   Whenever a steady
current passed between A and B, an auxiliary battery of Clark cells
would send a steady current between C and D, and the lower limit of
electromotive force capable of producing a measurable current seemed
only to depend on the delicacy of the galvanometer.
    Thus, for instance, at a pressure of about 4i mm., a current of 0'11
ampere was sent from A to B; and the following currents were
obtained when the poles of an auxiliary battery were connected with
 C and D, the galvanometer being inserted in the auxiliary circuit :—

 further.   The galvanometer, howeVer, had for this purpose to be

   The main current in these last experiments was 0008 ampere.
  An electromotive force of one-sixth Leclanché is about one-quarter
of 8- volt, and a current has thus been obtained in a gas from an
electromotive force which could not maintain a current through
water.
  An electromotive force of                    0'1 volt gave    doubtful results, but this
was  probably due                 to   the   experimental      dif<U+FB01>cultyof detecting the
current.
  In    some previous experiments, which, however, were not quite free
from objection on other grounds, the lowest electromotive force for
which the currents could be measured was 0'2 volt.
    The experimental arrangement which is the best for the qualitative
 investigation of the effect is not the best for quantitative measure
ments, and I have therefore not endeavoured to follow out to any
 great extent the quantitative laws of these currents produced by low
electromotive forces. I may give, however, some facts which              have             I
observed.      The intensity of the current depends on a great many
circumstances.
    1. It increases rapidly with the intensity of the main discharge, and
also with a reduction of pressure, as far as                      I
                                                      have tried it (that is
about    31;
           mm.).
   2.  The intensity of the current from the auxiliary battery increases
less rapidly than the electromotive force.
   3.  In some experiments in which one of the electrodes of the
auxiliary battery was a copper wire and the other a copper cylinder,
the current was nearly always considerably stronger when the larger
surface was the kathode.
   4. Anything that facilitates the diffusion of gas from the main
current to the auxiliary electrodes will increase the strength of the
current observed.       In some experiments, in which the screen sepa
rating the two <U+FB01>elds was made of wire gauze instead of tinfoil, the
currents were stronger than those given above.
   5.  In the arrangement shown in <U+FB01>g. the currents were stronger

when the main electrode A was negative than when              was positive.it
    Considerable care ha to be taken, especially when no screen          used             is
or when             not conducted to earth, in order to avoid leakage
                   it   is
currents.     However well the battery may originally have been insu
lated,  the  insulation  always grows worse with time (owing to dust and
moisture).      If, then, any part of the auxiliary circuit itself  not pro          is

 378       On the Discharge    of Electricity through Gases.     [June  16,
 perly insulated, we easily get a current through the galvanometer
 which is nothing but a branch current from the main discharge.       Such
'a leakage current, even when it is weak, considerably increases the
 e<U+FB01>ects described in this paper.
    These experiments show conclusively that there is nothing peculiar
 in the gaseous state of a body to prevent any electromotive force how
 ever small from producing a current. If a <U+FB01>nite electromotive force is
 required under ordinary circumstances the fact cannot be accounted
 for, as Edlund and others have attempted to do, by a special surface
 resistance which has to be overcome by a <U+FB01>nite difference of potential
 at the surface.
    I  think the facts are very well accounted for by the theory which    I
 have proposed in my last paper.       If the two atoms of a gas making
 up   the  molecule   are charged by opposite electricities, but are held
 together in addition by molecular forces, a <U+FB01>nite force is required. to
 overcome the latter.     But as soon as that force is overcome and the
 atoms themselves are set free to di<U+FB01>use and constitute a current, these
 atoms will be able to follow any electromotive force which we may
 apply. If, then, we have auxiliary electrodes, these electrodes will
 establish their electric <U+FB01>eld which we can never screen off completely
 from any other part of the vessel except by closed surfaces.          The
 atoms, with their positive and negative charges, will diffuse across to
 the auxiliary electrodes and give off their electricity to them. No
 <U+FB01>nite difference of potential is required in the auxiliary electrodes,
 because even if there is work done in making an atom interchange its
 positive for negative electricity, that work is undone again at the
 other pole, where atoms of a similar kind interchange negative for
 positive electricity.
    This I believe to be the general explanation of the phenomena de
 scribed in this paper.    In order to account for the peculiar difference
 between positive and negative electricity which appears in the experi
 ments done at atmospheric pressure, also those mentioned under 5
 (p. 377), we must make some further supposition.         I  have already
 mentioned in my last paper that, according to the theory      I  have pro
 posed, we must imagine the molecules to be broken up at the negative
 pole, and I believe that this fact will ultimately be found to account
 for this apparently unsymmetrical property of the two electricities;
      I
 but should like to strengthen my case by further experiment before
 going into details on this point.
    I should like, in conclusion, to point out an important application of
 these results.   I  have last year obtained by calculation results which
 seem to show that the principal cause of the diurnal variation of ter
 restrial magnetism is to be looked for in the upper regions of the
 atmosphere.     Professor Balfour Stewart at various times suggested
 that the air currents in these regions may, owing to the lines of

 force of terrestrial     magnetism, have electric currents circulating            in
 them.
    The dif<U+FB01>culty against this supposition always seemed to me to lie
 in the fact that the electromotive forces required to start a current
 were larger than those which could possibly exist in the atmosphere.
 But   as there are very likely continuous electric disturbances going on,
 such as we observe       in aurorae and thunderstorms, the regions within
 which these discharges take place would act as conductors for any
 additional electromotive force however small, so that any regular
 motion, such as tidal motions, could very well produce periodic e<U+FB01>ects
 affecting our magnetic needles.
    If these original discharges increase in importance, then, according
 to the results obtained in this paper, the currents due to the smaller
 periodic causes would increase also, and they may increase in a very
 rapid ratio. We know that the electric discharges in the upper
 regions of the atmosphere are considerably stronger at times of many
 sunspots, and this may account- for the fact that at those times the
 amplitude of the daily oscillation of the magnetic needle is consider
ably increased.                                                      _

      Communicated by Prof. A. W. WILLIAMSON, For. Sec. RS.
      Received May 5, 1887.
    Some months ago" we showed that antimony pentachloride can
be distilled,    undecomposed,        under much diminished pressure; our
next step     was   the   attempt    to   determine the vapour-density under
similar conditions.       The fact   that  the boiling point of antimony penta
chloride lies much lower than that of the trichloride would seem to
show that the vapour-density of the pentachloride, as in the case of
the trichloride, corresponds to the simpler formula.                   Nevertheless,
On account    of  the  fundamental      importance    which    the  establishment of
the simple formula SbCl5 would have for the valence of antimony,
it seemed indispensably necessary to make a determination of the
vapour-density;        We will preface our further observations with the
remark that we have not yet succeeded in determining the vapour
deusity of antimony pentachloride under diminished pressure; how
ever, in the course of many unsuccessful attempts which we have
made to this end, we had one point thrust on our notice, which on

investigation led to some important results concerning our knowledge
of the chemical nature of antimony pentachloride.
    Antimony pentachloride is well known to be an extremely hygro
scopic body. Consequently in the application of La Coste’s modi<U+FB01>ca
tion of Victor Meyer’s method for the determination of vapour
densities under diminished pressure, it was necessary to substitute
liquid paraf<U+FB01>n for water; yet, in spite of numerous careful experiments,
we could not attain our object, the liquid para<U+FB01>n offered too great a
resistance to the air, and before all the air had been driven out the
antimony pentachloride distilled into the upper and cooler parts of the
apparatus. During these experiments it was proved to us that it is
next to impossible to prevent the formation of traces of the white
substance, which is the result of the action of water on antimony penta
chloride. We were accordingly constrained to put this method aside.
    Before attempting the determination of antimony pentachloride by
another method, we deemed it best <U+FB01>rst to <U+FB01>nd out the nature of the
error caused by the formation of the minute amount of the product
of water reacting on antimony pentachloride.
    After careful consideration we were struck by the contradiction
between the conclusions of Daubrawa“ and those of R. Weber<U+FB02>- con
cerning the behaviour of antimony pentachloride with water. Accord
ing to the latter, antimony pentachloride forms with water a hydrate,
which is impossible if with 1 mol. of water antimony pentachloride
is changed in the cold to SbOC13 and 2 mols. of hydrochloric acid, as
Daubrawa thinks he has proved.
    The following results of our experiments show that Daubrawa’s
 statements   concerning antimony oxychloride, SbOCl3, are entirely
 wrong. In connexion with these studies we have occupied ourselves
with the action of oxalic acid on antimony pentachloride, and have
succeeded in obtaining the remarkable product of this reaction in a
pure state.
               Reaction of Water      on  Antimony Pentachloride.
    Daubrawa allowed        1 part by weight of distilled water to drop from
a pipette into a <U+FB02>ask, surrounded by ice, containing 16 parts by. weight
of antimony pentachloride. He found the decomposition accompanied
by hissing, and by the formation of vapour, giving no white pulveru
 lent precipitate, but forming a yellowish distinctly crystalline mass,
 which adhered to the <U+FB02>ask. This crystalline mass, the behaviour of
 which with water Daubrawa describes in detail, is, according to
his analysis, antimony oxychloride, SbOCls, and he expresses its
 formation from antimony pentachloride and water by the following
 equation :—

   We proceeded exactly as above described, and joined to our <U+FB02>ask                                       a
receiver containing a weighed quantity of water in which to collect
the liberated hydrochloric acid. To 21'5 grams of well-cooled anti
mony pentachloride, which had been puri<U+FB01>ed by distillation under
diminished pressure, we added drop by drop 1'2 gram, the calculated
amount, of water, and found to our surprise that no hydrochloric acid
was liberated; also that the yellowish crystalline product was equal in
weight to the sum of the weights of the water and antimony penta
chloride originally taken.
   The resulting product was only partly soluble in chloroform, and
was therefore a mixture of different substances.
   We therefore altered the conditions of the experiment. In order
to moderate the reaction we dissolved 20'4! grams of pure antimony
pentachloride in about the same volume of chloroform, and added
drop by drop to the cooled solution the calculated amount, 1'1 gram,
of water, shaking constantly.      The formation of the new body was
soon apparent by the separation of almost colourless crystals       the                            ;
yellow colour of the chloroform, caused by the antimony pentachloride
(which according to our experience       never colourless, but always is                                 a
bright yellow liquid), gradually disappeared, and at the end of the
reaction the crystals which had separated were covered by colourless
liquid.   Under these changed conditions there was again no trace of
hydrochloric acid set free. We next heated our product nearly to the
boiling point of chloroform, adding suf<U+FB01>cient dry chloroform to dis_
solve the crystals which had separated.     From this solution a com
pound was deposited in feathery crystals. After decanting the mother
liquor, these were washed with a small quantity of chloroform, and
placed to dry in a, vacuum desiccator on     porous plate that had been    a
 previously heated.    This body    so extraordinarily hygroscopic that

   We provisionally designate this body as antimony pentachloride
monohydrate, without expressing any opinion concerning the con
stitution of this addition product of equal molecules of water and
antimony pentachloride.                  From chloroform, the monohydrate crys
tallises in leafy or feathery crystals resembling sal-ammoniac, having
a melting point lying between 87° and 92°.                         If exposed to the air it
deliquesces to a clear liquid, which over sulphuric acid gradually
crystallises again in broad needles, described by Daubrawa as a
property of his supposed oxychloride. We have not further examined
this body.
   When one tries to distil the antimony pentachloride monohydrate
under diminished pressure—under 20 mm. with the bath at 105°—a
mobile yellow liquid distils over; this, after two recti<U+FB01>cations, boiled
constantly at 73° under 17 mm. (bath 90°). Two chlorine determina
tions gave, as was expected, results for antimony pentachloride.

   Although after this experience it was not probable that we could
obtain antimony oxychloride, SbOCla, by heating antimony penta
chloride monohydrate, we repeated the experiment in another form.
We heated 24'41 grams of antimony pentachloride, mixed with about
twice its volume of chloroform and 1'41 gram water, in a closed tube
to 100° on a water-bath.                  The crystals of the monohydrate which

 were <U+FB01>rst formed went into solution, and on opening the tube before
 a  lamp at the end of six hours we found much pressure; a gas
 smelling like phosgene was liberated.            The tube was again closed
 and heated afresh to 100°.            The opening and closing was repeated,
<U+FB01>rst at intervals of six hours, and later, as the pressure diminished,
of twelve hours, until after about fourteen days the pressure was no
longer noticeable.
   On working up the products of the reaction we found, besides
antimony tri~ and penta-chlorides, phosgene in solution in the
chloroform, from which we prepared diphenyl carbamide, m. p. 239°.
For the formation of phosgene gas it is not necessary to work in
closed tubes.    A chloroform solution of the monohydrate, heated to
its boiling point on a water-bath, yields a steady stream of phosgene
mixed with hydrochloric acid. A similar decomposition takes place
when carbon tetrachloride is heated with antimony pentachloride
monohydrate in a closed tube to 100°. We will communicate the
quantitative relations of this reaction after we have veri<U+FB01>ed our <U+FB01>rst
observations by repeated research.
   One can make the tetrahydrate of antimony pentachloride even
more easily than the monohydrate.              For this purpose we dissolved
29'3 grams of antimony pentachloride in about twice its volume of
chloroform, and after surrounding the <U+FB02>ask containing this solution
with ice, let fall drop by drop 7 grams, the calculated quantity, of
water. Again, in this experiment, no hydrochloric acid was given
off.    The mixture remained at <U+FB01>rst liquid, but when placed in a
vacuum desiccator over sulphuric acid and paraf<U+FB01>n, there separated
slowly a hard crystalline mass, which was quite insoluble in chloro
form.     Two chlorine determinations made after washing the sub
stance with chloroform agree with the formula SbClSHBO4.

     Thus besides the monohydrate of antimony pentachloride a tetra
 hydrate also exists, the latter being easily prepared from a chloroform
 solution of the former by the action of water, and differing from the
 monohydrate among other things in being insoluble in chloroform.
     From the foregoing evidence it appears that antimony oxychloride,
 SbOCls, is certainly not formed by the action of water on antimony
 pentachloride; but if equal molecules of these substances are allowed
 to react, the compound SbCl5H20 is formed, which we have called
 antimony pentachloride monohydrate. This product is most con

equation—
                          Sb015 + H20      = SbClEHQO.
   When one brings together weights equivalent to 1 mol. of antimony
pentachloride and 4 mole. of water, the tetrahydrate of antimony
pentachloride is formed, as described by R. Weber.                We must put
aside Daubrawa’s contradiction of the facts of R. Weber, and strike
Daubrawa’s hypothetical antimony oxychloride, SbOCls, from the
list of the known antimony compounds.
        The Reaction of Antimony Pentachloride and Ozalic           Acid.
   As  has already* been remarked, our research on the chlorides               of
antimony sprung originally from the wish             to  <U+FB01>nd out if the reaction
of anhydrous oxalic acid and antimony pentachloride was analogous
to that of phosphorus pentachloride, forming an antimony oxychloride,
SbOCla, corresponding to the oxychloride of phosphorus.              The know
ledge   of the  action    of  water   on  antimony pentachloride, forming
mono- and tetra-hydrates, increased the interest in the attempt to
discover the action of oxalic acid on the same body.
    On mixing equal molecular weights of pure anhydrous oxalic acid
and antimony pentachloride, a. violent development of hydrochloric
acid takes place, the mixture forming a nearly solid white mass.
The generation of} hydrochloric acid soon ceases. On heating to
about 150° decomposition begins again, carbonic dioxide and hydro
chloric acid being given 01?, the mass becoming gradually liquid.
 This clearly showed that the reaction ran in two stages. In the case
of the monohydrate we had obtained our object so quickly by the use
 of chloroform, that we did not pursue the direct action of antimony
 pentachloride on oxalic acid further, but substituted a cooled solu
tion of 35'5 grams of antimony pentachloride in 833 grams of chloro
form, with 10'6' grams of anhydrous oxalic acid.                   The reaction
 commenced in the cold ; at <U+FB01>rst hydrochloric acid mixed with a small
 quantity of carbon dioxide was givenolf, but soon only hydrochloric
 acid; gradually a considerable amount of a white crystalline body
 fell out of solution. After the development of hydrochloric acid had
 ceased, we heated the product of the reaction, dissolving the greater
 part of the crystals.       We <U+FB01>ltered hot, and beautiful transparent
 colourless crystals separated from the <U+FB01>ltrate, which we had placed
 in a desiccator over sulphuric acid and paraf<U+FB01>n.               The residue, in
 soluble in the hot chloroform solution, weighed 4'9 grams, and
 consisted chie<U+FB02>y of unaltered oxalic acid. The quantity of hydro

 This reaction         was, however, impossible, owing to the small quantity
 of carbon dioxide given off. The quantity of hydrochloric acid found
 indicated that two molecules of antimony pentachloride had reacted
 with one of oxalic acid. The tabular crystals from the chloroform
 solution melted at from 148'5’ to 149°, decomposing at a somewhat

compare the compound with diammonium oxalate, and designate it as
ditetrachlorstibonium    oxalate, or as we prefer, look on it as the
mixed anhydride of oxalic acid and the yet unknown acid, SbCl4OH.
   As a result of these simple experiments we can understand the
entirely different behaviour of antimony and phosphorus penta.
chlorides towards the carbon compounds containing oxygen and
hydrogen. Antimony pentachloride unites, as we have proved, with
water.     Phosphorus pentachloride decomposes water. Antimony
pentachloride has no inclination to change chlorine for oxygen. Phos
phorus has this inclination in an extraordinary degree.    Phosphorus
pentachloride attacks hydroxyl or ketone groups, replacing oxygen
 by respectively one or two atoms of chlorine, being itself converted
into oxychloride.    Antimony pentachloride, on the other hand, reacts
on the hydrocarbon residue, substituting chlorine for hydrogen, and
itself becoming antimony trichloride.
    Phosphorus pentachloride acts similarly to antimony pentachloride,
 substituting chlorine for hydrogen in those organic compounds which
 contain no oxygen, or oxygen in such <U+FB01>rm combination with carbon
 as not to be available for the formation of phosphorus oxychloride.
    Antimony pentachloride may react as phosphorus pentachloride on
 compounds similar to oxalic acid, containing no hydrogen attached
 to carbon which can be replaced         by chlorine.   The compound
 (COOSbCh‘)2 is of especial theoretical interest, as showing the
 process of the reaction of phosphorus pentachloride on substances
 containing the hydroxyl group. The <U+FB01>rst stage of the reaction con
 sists, evidently, of the formation of compounds analogous in com
 position to the body (COOSbCl4)2.
    If, however, the oxygen of a hydroxyl group is held in loose com
 bination, the formation of phosphorus oxychloride and the substitu
 tion of chlorine take place simultaneously. What, however, will
 happen when the substitution of oxygen is difficult, as in phenol or
 the aromatic oxyacids?      Attempts to answer this question are now

       Electromotive Forces of Metals in Cyanide Solutions.” By
       SILVANUS P. THOMPSON, D.Sc., B.A.             Communicated by
       Professor G. CAREY FOSTER, F.R.S.            Received May 12,
       1887.
   It is known that the electrodeposition of such alloys as brass,
bronze, and German silver is not practicable from mixed solutions of
the sulphates or chlorides of the constituent metals, but can be
accomplished by using cyanide solutions or neutral solutions con
taining cyanide of potassium in excess, thereby apparently departing
from the law of Berzelius that out of a solution of mixed metals the
least electropositive metal is dep0sited <U+FB01>rst.
   To ascertain the cause of these facts the author has investigated—
   (ah) The electromotive forces of a number of metals in aqueous
solutions of cyanide of potassium.

of copper and zinc, upon the degree of concentration of the solution.

   (11.) The electromotive forces of zinc and copper in a       brassing
solution consisting of the mixed cyanides of zinc and cOpper, having
excess of cyanide of potassium present, and their variation at different
temperatures.
   It is found that the effect of higher concentration of the cyanide
solutions is invariably to increase the electromotive force of copper
more than it increases that of zinc.
   In a cold dilute solution of cyanide of potassium the electromotive
force of zinc against carbon is 1'158 volt, while that of copper against
carbon is 0'948 volt, or zinc is 0210 volt higher than copper. In a
boiling saturated solution of cyanide of potassium, the electromotive
force of zinc against carbon is 0768 volt, and that of copper
against carbon is 1'300 volt; or copper is 0'532 volt higher than
zmc.
   It is therefore possible to construct a voltaic battery containing one
metal only, namely copper, and one electrolyte only, namely an aqueous
solution of cyanide of potassium, kept hot at the anode and cold at
the cathode of the cell.

    In a mixed solution of cyanides of zinc and copper there is at
 neutral condition where the electromotive forces of zinc and copper
 are equal, and this neutral condition varies with the relative amounts
 of metal present, with the concentration of the solution, and with the
temperature.        The neutral temperature for a solution of given com
centration is lowered by adding cyanide of potassium, and is raised
 by adding ammonia.             The neutral point, however, is not well
 de<U+FB01>ned, the behaviour of copper being very uncertain; in general
 the electromotive force of clean copper in a cyanide solution rises, in
 some cases as much as 006 volt, in a few seconds after immersion,
 but is rapidly though temporarily            lovvered on agitation.

1887.]    The Fructzj<U+FB01>cation  of  the Carboniferous  Calamites.      389
   Since the degree of concentration of the solution greatly affects the
electromotive force of the metal, and since in the act of deposition of
a metal from its solution the concentration of the liquid around the
cathode is reduced, owing to slowness of diffusion, it follows that in
electrodeposition the counter electromotive force at the cathode will
vary with the rate at which metal is being deposited, and will,
therefore, vary with the current-density employed.     And since, more
over, the variations in electromotive force due to di<U+FB01>erences of con
centration are greater foi' copper than for zinc, it follows that in the
deposition of brass from a mixed solution of cyanides of a medium
concentration in which zinc is slightly more electropositive than
copper, there will be a certain density of current with which the
metals will be deposited in nearly equal quantities, whilst for weaker
current-densities the less electropositive metal will be deposited in
excess, and for stronger current-densities the more electropositive
metal will be deposited in excess.
   Hence to variations in the concentration of the electrolyte near the
cathode are due the departures, observed with all currents except
weak ones, from the law that out of a solution of mixed metals the
least electropositive is deposited <U+FB01>rst.

   The true systematic position of the Carboniferous Calamites has
long been a debateable subject, owing to the lack of satisfactory
evidence respecting the character of their fructi<U+FB01>cation.    Some years
ago, Mr. Oarruthers and the late Mr. Binney expressed their con
viction that Calamostaohys Binneya'na stood in that relationship to
 Calamites, a conclusion which the author was unable to accept; but
in 1869 he obtained a fragment of a new Cryptogamic fruit, of which
he published an account in the ‘ Memoirs of the Literary and Philo
sophical Society of Manchester.’      The central axis of this Strobilus
presented so many details of structure hitherto seen only in Calamites
as convinced the author that it was the true fructi<U+FB01>cation of these
                                                                  ‘

preservation to enable him to illustrate almost every detail of their
structure.     They not only support his previous conclusions, but
they supply irresistible evidence that those conclusions are correct
ones.   Fortunately, at least three of the Strobili have attached to
them the ends of the twigs which supported them; these peduncles
are indisputably Calamites of the type to which G-oppert assigned
the generic name of Arthropitus, which genus several of the French
Paleeontologists  have long insisted upon classing with the Gymno
spermous plants.
   The fruit is beyond question that of a true spore-bearing Crypto
gam; a fact which determines the Equisetiform af<U+FB01>nities of the
entire Calamitean group; since if any members of that group might
possibly have been regarded as Gymnosperms, it certainly was those
of the Arthropitean type. But of all such possibilities there is now
an end.

   Patella vulgcta (Limpet), with its conical shell adhering to the rocks
of our   coasts, is well known to every sea-side wanderer.     This member
of the Gasteropoda has been the subject of many scienti<U+FB01>c memoirs

    The nephridia. of Patella vulgata consist of two parts, left and
right lobes.      The left nephridium is very small in comparison to the
right nephridium.         The anatomy and histology of these organs have
 been fully described by Prof. Lankester, F.R.S. (‘ Ann. Mag. Nat.

   After dissecting the nephridia from the bodies of a large number of
fresh limpets, the secretions of the left nephridia were examined
separately from those of the right nephridia.
    Both secretions were examined chemically by two separate methods
 as follows :——
    (a.) The clear liquid from the nephridia was treated with a hot
          dilute solution of sodium hydrate.
       On the addition of hydrochloric acid a slight <U+FB02>aky precipitate is

          examined microscopically are seen to consist of small rhombic
         plates and other forms. On treating the secretion alone with

    (1).) Another    method was used for testing the secretion of the
          nephridia of Patella.
       The secretion was boiled in distilled water, and evaporated care
          fully to dryness.       The residue so obtained was treated with
          absolute alcohol and <U+FB01>ltered. Boiling water was poured upon
          the residue, and to the aqueous <U+FB01>ltrate an excess of pure acetic
          acid added.        After standing about seven hours, crystals of
          uric acid (CSH4N403) were deposited, and easily recognised by
          the chemico-microscopical tests mentioned above.
   The secretions both of the left and right nephridia yield uric acid.
It   has been suggested by Mr. R. J. Harvey Gibson, M.A., F.R.SE.

secretions of the two nephridia may be chemically distinct.                    The
author could not extract or detect (after a most searching investiga
tion) the presence of any other ingredient besides uric acid in either
secretion.
    From this investigation, the isolation of uric acid proves the renal
function of the nephridia of Patella vulgata.

         reactions were observed :—-On running in between the slide and
         cover-slip a solution of iodine in potassium iodide, a brown
         deposit was obtained.      On running in concentrated nitric acid
         on another slide containing a drop or two of the secretion, a
         yellow coloration was formed, due to the formation of xantho
         proteic acid.     These two reactions show the presence of albu

         Kistiakowsky method (‘ P<U+FB01>iiger, Archiv Physiol.,’ vol. 9, pp.
         438—459).       The isolated ferment converts <U+FB01>brin into leucin
         and tyrosin.

         Pettenkofer and other tests.      No glycogen was found in the

          The secretion contains leucin and tyrosin.
   From      these investigations  the conclusion to be drawn is that the
so-called “liver” of Patella vulgata is similar in function to the
pancreas of the vertebrate division of animal life.
XVII.      “  The Air of Sewers.” By Professor CARNELLEY, D.Sc.,
       and J. S. HALDANE, M.A., M.B., University College, Dundee.
       Communicated by Sir H. ROSCOE, F.R.S. Received May 21,
       1887.
                                  (Abstract).
    Owing to the complaints which had been made of bad smells in
the House of Commons a Select Committee was appointed in the
spring of 1886 to inquire into the ventilation of the House.       By that
 Committee the authors were instructed to make a series of analyses
of the air in the sewers under the Houses of Parliament, and to
 report thereon.        Since then they have examined a considerable
 number of sewers in Dundee, and have also made a number of
 iaboratory experiments. The object of the research was to obtain
 a general idea of the amount of some of the more important im
 purities in sewer air, and to throw some light on their sources, and
 the conditions affecting their dissemination.
    After giving a brief résumé of the results of the analyses which
 had been previously made of sewer air, the authors describe the
 methods they have employed, and the nature and condition of the
 sewers they have themselves examined.
    As a result of their investigation they      found—(1.) That the air of

                             The  Air of Sewers.                         395
the sewers examined was      in a much better condition than might have
been expected.     (2.) That the carbonic acid was about twice, and the
organic matter rather over three times as great as in outside air at
the same     time, whereas    the number of micro-organisms       was   less.
(3.) That in reference to the quantity of the three constituents
named the air of the sewers was in a very much better condition
than that of naturally ventilated schools, and that with the notable
exception of organic matter it had likewise the advantage of mechani
cally ventilated schools (cf. paper by the authors and Dr. Anderson
in ‘Phil. Trans,’ 1887).           That the sewer air contained a much
smaller number of micro-organisms than the air of any class of
house, and that the carbonic acid was rather greater than in the air
of houses of four rooms and upwards, but less than in two- and one
roomed houses.       As regards Organic matter, however, the sewer air
was only slightly better than the air of one-roomed houses, and much
worse than that of other classes of houses.         (The data for all the
classes  of houses    refer to sleeping rooms when occupied during the
night.)
   The amount of carbonic acid found by the authors was much less
than that noted by earlier observers, showing that the sewers they
examined were much better ventilated than those previously investi
gated.
   On. taking the average    of a comparatively large number of analyses
it was found that the quantity of organic matter in sewer air increased
 with the carbonic acid, whereas the micro-organisms on the whole
decreased with increase of the other constituents.
   With regard to the sources of the several impurities in sewer air the
following conclusions are drawn :—(1.) The carbonic acid in excess of
outside air may be partly due to diffusion from the neighbouring soil,
 but its chief source is probably the oxidation of the organic matter in
the sewage and in the air of the sewer.               The organic matter in
excess of outside air is most probably wholly or for the most part
gaseous, and is of course derived from the sewage itself.          (3.) The
 micro-organisms    in  sewer  air come entirely,  or  nearly so, from the
 outside, and are not derived, or only in relatively small numbers, from
 the sewer itself.     This is proved by the following facts :—First, the
 average number of micro-organisms in sewer air was less than in out
 side air at the same time-~viz., about 9 in the former to 16 in the latter.
 Second, the number increased with the e<U+FB01>icieucy of the ventilation.
 Third, the average proportion of moulds to bacteria in sewer air was
 almost exactly the same as in outside air at the same time, whereas
 one would expect the proportion to be very di<U+FB01>erent were the outside
 air not the source from which they were derived, seeing that such
 a difference has been proved to exist in the air of houses, schools, &c.
  Fourth, the naked eye appearance of the colonies from sewer air is

 similar to that of those from ordinary air. Fifth, the state of <U+FB01>lthi
 ness of a sewer seems to have no perceptible e<U+FB01>ect on the number of
 micro-organisms.       Sixth, the view that the micro-organisms          in
 sewer air chie<U+FB02>y come from outside, is in perfect agreement with
 what is known as to the distribution of bacteria in air.           Seventh,
 results obtained in the laboratory with an experimental sewer prove
 that the micro-organisms present in air are diminished to nearly
 one-half in passing along a moist tube 5 feet long and 1% inch in
 diameter at a rate of nearly 1 foot per second.          Although most of
 the micro-organisms in sewer air come from outside, yet there was
 distinct evidence of their occasional dissemination from the sewage
 itself.    This is the case when splashing occurs, owing to drains
 entering the sewer at points high up in the roof. It is, therefore, of
 great importance that drains should be so arranged as to avoid
 splashing as much as possible.
     In view of the fact that ordinary sewer air is to all appearance
 comparatively innocent as regards its micro-organisms, experiments
 were also made to see whether it contained any poisonous volatile
base of the nature of a ptoma'ine.       These experiments so far as they
                                                                           '
 went had negative results.
    Experiments as to the e<U+FB02>icacy of ordinary water traps in preventing
 the escape of sewer gas into houses con<U+FB01>rmed and extended the results
previously obtained by Fergus.
    Though the authors do not discuss the eifect ot' the inhalation of
 sewer air on health, yet the results of the above investigation are
clearly such as to make one much more suspicious as to supposed
evidence of the bad e<U+FB01>ects of ordinary sewer air (at least when not
vitiated by splashing), such as that examined by them.

                On the Composition of Water by Volume.”                  By
      ALEXANDER      SCOTT,   M.A.,   D.Sc.    Communicated       by  Lord
      RAYLEIGH, D.C.L., Sec. R.S. Received May 23, 1887.
    In   1805 Gay-Lussac    and Humboldt published their classical re
searches on the composition of the atmosphere,         and to them we are
indebted for our knowledge of the proportion by volume in which
hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water." Without this know
ledge the determination of the relative densities of the two gases
would be of no use in <U+FB01>xing or checking their atomic weights.          This
is often overlooked, and Avogadro’s law taken as absolutely true for
these gases at ordinary temperatures and pressures.        That this cannot
safely be assumed    is conclusively proved by  the researches of Regnault,
Amagat, and others on the effects of change of temperature and pres
sure upon them.       Not only do they not follow Boyle’s law as usually

 1887.]        On the Composition   of Water  by Volume.           397
 understood, but their deviations from it are in opposite directions;
 hence it can only be by the merest chance that at our ordinary
temperatures and pressures the combining volumes should be exactly
 two of hydrogen to one of oxygen.        Moreover, when we consider
that it is more than eighty years since these researches were carried
out, that the instrument used in all the measurements was Volta’s
eudiometer, and that the gases were collected and measured over
 water and so contained impurities to the extent of 0‘4 per cent. in'
the oxygen and 0'6 to 0'8 per cent. in the hydrogen used, a redetermi
nation of this ratio with the greatly improved means for attaining
accuracy now at our command seemed to be of extreme importance.
The exact ratio as given in the memoir referred to is 19989 volumes
of hydrogen to 100 volumes of oxygen, and this the authors say is
almost exactly as 2 : 1.
   To arrive at greater accuracy the author of this note has given
especial attention to the following points :—
   (1.) The preparation of purer gases.
   (2.) The use of larger volumes.
   (3.) The measurement of both gases in the same vessel.
   (4.) The analysis of the residue after explosion and determination
of the impurity in each experiment.

    These ends were more or less satisfactorily attained by the use of
the apparatus employed, which was entirely of glass with the excep
tion of the junctions at H and O. The gas generators contained only
small volumes of gas, and could easily be exhausted by means of the
apparatus itself. It is evident that by <U+FB01>lling A and B with mercury,
completely closing all the stopcocks, and then lowering M and open
ing e, the air in the oxygen generator would be in great part drawn
into A; on now closing e and raising M this air could be expelled by
opening         By repeating this several times an almost perfect vacuum
could be produced. Before collecting the gas for the experiments,
after exhausting the air gas was evolved and exhausted, and this
again repeated.      The gases were measured saturated with moisture,
and after measurement were expelled into G; from this they were
drawn into E and exploded, and the residue measured in a small tube
and analysed by explosion with either hydrogen or oxygen as re
quired. The results of every experiment made are given in the
following table, from which it will be seen that in no case, even when
the maximum value is given to it, does the ratio exceed 2 vols. of
hydrogen to 1 vol. of oxygen, although in four cases it is exactly
                        l
 2  :  1.
    The mean of the twenty-one experiments gives the ratio—
                          1'9857   : 1 from Column E.
                          1'9941   : 1        ,,       F.
Excluding experiments IV and           VI, in which  the gases contained much
 impurity, we get the ratio—
                          1'9897   : 1 from Column E.
                          19959    : l        ,,       F.
     Taking experiments I, III, XV, and           XVIII,  in which the purest
 gases were used, we get—
                          1'9938   : 1 from Column E.
                          19964    : 1        ,,       F.
 or taking experiments      I, III, XIV, XV, XVIII,       and XX  we get-—
                          19938     =1  from Column E.
                          19967     =1         ,,      F.
      Taking  as the most probable ratio 19%. : 1, and the density of
 oxygen    referred  to hydrogen as 15'9627, we get the atomic weight of
 oxygen    as 1601.

   The facts described by Kiihne relating to the properties of the
muscle plasma of cold-blooded animals are true in great measure for
that of mammals.
    Admixture of muscle plasma with solutions of neutral salts prevents
the coagulation of the latter.            Dilution of such salted muscle plasma
brings about coagulation; this occurs most readily at 37—40° C.
 Saline extracts of rigid muscle differ from salted muscle plasma in
being acid, but resemble it very closely in the way in which myosin
can be made to separate from it; myosin in fact undergoes a recoagu
lation. This is not a simple precipitation; it is <U+FB01>rst a jellying through
the liquid; the clot subsequently contracts, squeezing out a colourless
<U+FB02>uid or salted muscle serum.               This does not take place at 0° C.; it
occurs most readily at the temperature of the body, and is hastened
by the addition of a ferment prepared from muscle in the same way
 as Schmidt’s ferment is prepared from blood.                    The ferment is not
identical with <U+FB01>brin         ferment,   as  it does not  hasten   the coagulation of
 salted blood plasma; nor does the             <U+FB01>brin  ferment   hasten    the coagula
tion of muscle plasma.           The recoagulation of myosin is also accom
panied by       the formation     of lactic acid.
    The proteids of muscle plasma are-—
    1. Paramyosinogen, which is coagulated by heat at 47° C.
    2. Myosinogen,* which is coagulated at 56° C.
    3. Myoglobulin, which differs chie<U+FB02>y from serum globulin                     in its
 coagulation temperature (63° C.).
    4. Albumin, which is apparently identical with serum albumin                      a,
 coagulating at 73° C.
     5. Myo-albumose; this has the properties of deutero-albnmose, and
 is identical with, or closely connected to, the myosin ferment.
     The <U+FB01>rst two proteids in the above list go to form the clot of
 myosin; paramyosinogen is, however, not essential for coagulation;
 the three last remain in the muscle serum.
    1'  It is on the presence of this proteid that the power of fresh muscle juice to
hasten the coagulation    of blood plasma depends.

       .Paramyosinogen, myosinogen, and myoglobulin are proteids of the
    globulin class. They are all completely precipitated by saturation
    with magnesium sulphate, or sodium chloride, or by dialysing out the
    salts from their solutions. They can be separated by fractional heat
   coagulation, or by fractional saturation with neutral salts.
        When muscle turns acid, as it does during rigor mortals, the pepsin
    which it contains is enabled to act, and at a suitable temperature
    (35—40” C.) albumoses and peptones are formed by a process of self
    digestion.     It is possible that the passing OR of rigor mortis, which is
   apparently     due   to the reconversion of myosin into myosinogen, may
   be the <U+FB01>rst stage in the self-digestion of muscle.

                     Ph.D., F.R.S. Received May 24, 1887.                                    .
       The idea of refraction equivalents has become familiar to those who
   work on the borderland of optics          and chemistry, and the value of that
   property as a means of investigating the chemical structure of com
   pounds is becoming more and more recognised. There is a similar
   property, perhaps equally valuable for the same object, which has
  attracted little attention hitherto;             I  allude to the equivalent of
   dispersion. During the last twelve months, however,                  I have collated
   old measurements of the length of the spectrum, whether made by
   myself or by others, and have added many new determinations, and                         I
   am now in a position to submit some of the results to the Society.
       The history of the subject goes back to the <U+FB01>rst paper of Mr. Dale
   and myself upon the refraction of lightf" in which we gave as one of
   the conclusions “ the length of the spectrum varies as the temperature
   increases.” In our second paperf we came to the conclusion that
   “there is no simple relation holding good for different liquids between
   the increase of volume and the decrease of dispersion by heat,” con
   trary   to what we found to be the case           with refraction.      We adopted
  ,uH—FA, 'i.e., the difference between the refractive                indices      for the
  .solar lines A and H as the measure of dispersion.                 This divided by
   the density gave the speci<U+FB01>c dispersion.                When, however, Landolt

       In two communications made to the British Association ,* we
  stated that the dispersion equivalent of any substance is little affected
  by the manner in which it is combined with other bodies, and we
 gave as the mean value of CH2 0'35 in the vinic group, but higher
  <U+FB01>gures in the benzene and pyridine groups; phosphorus equal to 2'9;
  chlorine 0'5; bromine 1'3; and iodine 2'6. In my subsequent paper
  in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions,’f in which the refraction equivalents
  of forty-six elements were worked out,                 I remarked, “ the question of
 dispersion equivalents is also of interest; the data for the investigation
 of the matter are given in the Appendix.”                         But there the matter
 rested.           The paramount interest of the refraction equivalents in
 truth caused both the Continental observers and myself to neglect the
 question of dispersion; and with the exception of brief references to
 it in papers on Refraction,I nothing was published on the subject till
 last summer, when                I  applied the measurement of dispersion to the

      Almost simultaneously with these appeared a paper by Briihl,1]' in

 the refraction equivalents of highly refractive bodies.                        In this he
 seems to establish the fact that for such bodies at least, the theoretical
 formula of Lorenz,                          gives more     uniform     results than the

 “the dispersion exercised by different bodies stands in no relation
 which is as yet clearly recognisable and measurable either with the
 refraction exerted by them, or with the chemical nature of the sub
 stances.”           In this and a following paper** he gives additional proof'
 of the worthlessness of Cauchy’s dispersion formula, or any of the
suggested modi<U+FB01>cations of it, to eliminate the in<U+FB02>uence of dis,

     It      will   be seen that       Briihl’s conclusion is inconsistent with the

  published; but while     I am free to confess that there are many dif<U+FB01>
  culties in the investigation of dispersion which have not been felt in
  dealing with refraction,    I  hold that the following conclusions are
  fully warranted by the data :—
     lst. That dispersion, like refraction, is primarily a question of the
  atomic constitution of the body; the general rule being that the
  dispersion equivalent of a compound is the sum of the dispersion
  equivalents of its constituents.
     2nd. That the dispersion of a compound, like its refraction, is
  modi<U+FB01>ed by profound differences of constitution ;. such as changes of
  atomicity.
     3rd. That the dispersion frequently reveals differences of constitu
  tion at present unrecognised by chemists, and not expressed. by our
  formulae.
     In this paper my object will     be to point out the   uniformity that
  does exist, leaving apparent exceptions for future consideration.
     Before entering upon an attempt to determine the dispersion
  equivalents of the different elementary substances, it may be well to
  consider the di<U+FB02>‘iculty which occurred at the threshold of the enquiry,
  and another which appears to have deterred Briihl from prosecuting
  his enquiries in the direction of dispersion.
     The original experiments of Mr. Dale and myself led to the belief
  that the “ speci<U+FB01>c dispersion,             slightly diminishes  with in
                                   (“1%.1'“,
  crease of temperature ”; but more accurate experiments made on the
  same specimens of bisulphide of carbon, benzene, brombenzene, and
  mint terpene, at the temperature of the observing room in the height
- of summer and depth of winter, have made me less con<U+FB01>dent of this
  conclusion.    The variations are certainly within the limits of experi
  mental error. The observations of Wiillner both upon bisulphide of
  carbon and water, those of Baille and v. d. Willigen upon water, as
  well as those of Pisati and Paterno on benzene and cymene, show
  that there is little, if any, appreciable di<U+FB01>erence in the speci<U+FB01>c dis
  persion at different temperatures.         The general tendency of the
  observations on the seventy substances which have been examined
  more or less carefully, appears to be that the small di<U+FB02>‘erence of
  speci<U+FB01>c refraction that exists at di<U+FB01>erent temperatures is a little
  greater in the case of H than in that of A.
     Briihl gives three cases of isomeric or quasi-isomeric bodies. He
  measures the speci<U+FB01>c dispersion by the B of Cauchy’s formula divided
  by the density.       He shows that cinnamic alcohol, 0911100, and
  cinnamic aldehyde, 091130, both of which he conceives to contain four
  pair of doubly-linked carbon-atoms, have a widely different speci<U+FB01>c
  dispersion;   that allyl parac'resolate and anethol, CHHHO, having
  four pair of doubly-linked carbon-atoms, are also quite different in;

 dispersion; and that, on the other hand, cymol and hexahydro
 naphthalin, both having the formula C1011“, but the <U+FB01>rst three pair,
  and the second two pair of doubly-linked carbon-atoms, have nearly
 the same dispersion. But if we reckon out the refraction equivalents
 for cinnamic aldehyde and for anethol from the numbers given in the
 same table, it will be seen that they are inconsistent with the sup
 position that these bodies have the chemical structure that he
 attributes to them; in fact the extremely high dispersion in each case
 only tells the same tale as the extremely high refraction.                As to the
 two substances of the formula C1011“ it is open to question whether
 hexahydronaphthalin         has only two pair of doubly-linked              carbon
 atoms; and the refraction equivalent calculated for each of the
 specimens throws some doubt upon their purity.                    Briihl also com
 pares met-hyldiphenylamine with cinnamic aldehyde, but the presence
 of nitrogen in the <U+FB01>rst body, and the uncertainty as to the constitu
 tion of the second, render it unsafe to draw any conclusions from the
comparison; That the speci<U+FB01>c dispersion of isomeric or polymeric
bodies is practically the same, except where the constitution is very
di<U+FB02>’erent (as in aniline and picoline), was shown in my paper in the
‘                              ’
   Philosophical Magazine six years ago; and this must be set against
the doubtful cases mentioned above.
                                    The Elements.
    There are but few of the elements of which the dispersive energy
can be directly determined; but it so happens that two or three of
these are among the most dispersive of bodies.
    Phosphorus was determined by Mr. Dale and myself in a melted                     ,
condition, and also by Damien both in that and the solid state.                 Our'
observation gives 3'1; those of Damien* work out at 2'9 and 2'8
respectively.
    Sulphur.—An old observation of mine on this body lique<U+FB01>ed, gave
0'90 for E—A;_ and recent observations from its solutions in bisul
phide of carbon give 1'2 for F~A. These agree in indicating about
2'6 for H—A.
    Selenium—According         to the observations of Sirks,1- the refractive
indices for A and D are respectively 2653 and 2'98; taking the speci<U+FB01>c
gravity at 4'5, the dispersion equivalent of this element would be the
extraordinary amount of 5'67 for D—A alone.
    Hydrogen.—Ketteler’s1          observations give a dispersion equivalent
of 00152 for the difference between the green line of thallium and.
the red line of lithium.

     Carbon.—Schrauf’s* observations upon diamond give 0'058 for the
 dispersion equivalent of the same range.
    Iodine, in the state of vapour, or dissolved in bisulphide of carbon,
 gives a spectrum in which the order of the colours is abnormal.
    Far more important results have been obtained from organic sub
stances, by following a method similar to that which Landolt adopted
in his determination of the refraction equivalents of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen. The materials for such an enquiry are very abundant.
They consist of the observations published by Mr. Dale and myself in
 1863, and my more recent determinations published and unpublished,
the very valuable lists of Landolt and Briihl, numerous observations
by Kanonniko<U+FB01>, Nasini, and others.       The Continental observers have
usually adopted the lines a, <U+FB02>, and q of the hydrogen spectrum.
    On comparing the refraction equivalents of organic liquids of the
fatty acid series which di<U+FB01>er from one another by CH,, or multiples
of it, my best determinations lie between 0‘33 and 0'36, averaging
about 0'35 for each CH2. On treating in a similar manner <U+FB01>fteen
series of such bodies in Briihl’s tables, some of which contain many
terms, the dispersion equivalent for q—a. works out very uniformly at
an average of 0215.       This answers to 0342 for H—A. Armstrong’s
cymhydrene, which is a saturated substance of the formula (3101120,
has a dispersion equivalent of 3'44, giving therefore 0344: for each
 CH2. Kanonniko<U+FB01>’s determinations of tetraterpene and naphthene, also
Clngo, give similar numbers. It may therefore be assumed that the
value of CH2 in saturated organic compounds lies between 0'34! and
0'35, answering to the well known 7'6 as the refraction equivalent of
the same combination.        When, however, we examine unsaturated
 compounds     in a  similar manner,  we <U+FB01>nd that the value rises to at
least 0'40.
    Hydrogen—While the value of CH; may be fairly taken at 0'34, it
is more dif<U+FB01>cult to say what portion of this is due to the carbon, and
what to the hydrogen.          Ihave endeavoured to determine           byit,
 deducting n times CH2 from the para<U+FB01>ines CMHMH; by comparing
 the monatomic, diatomic, and triatomic alcohols, and by other
similar means.      The results are somewhat irregular, as might indeed
                      '
be expected from the smallness of the residual <U+FB01>gure, but give                  a
mean of 004 per each hydrogen.                                             .
    Carbon—If the H2 in CH2 be taken at 0'08,            follows that the
                                                         it

unsaturated organic compounds, there         an increase of refraction, for

Assuming this to be due to a different value for carbon, we
refraction equivalent of 5'O+1'1, 'o'.e., 6'1. In all such   cases  there is
a great increase of dispersion; this increase, however, is not always
the same.     In the allyl compounds, whether determined by Briihl,
Kanonniko<U+FB02>', or myself, it is uniformly very close to 0'5.           In the
ole<U+FB01>nes it is the same.     In the whole of the aromatic series     it  is at
least 0'8.   Coincident therefore with the higher refraction equivalent
for carbon, we have two dispersion equivalents of about 0'26+0'25,
and O'26+0'40, i.e., 0'51 and 0'66.
    It must remain for future consideration, whether there may not be
an intermediate refraction equivalent, corresponding to the dispersion
equivalent of 0'51.
    On the appearance of Briihl’s papers in 1880,    I ventured to suggest
that there was a still higher refraction equivalent for carbon, in those
cases in which it
                     “ has all four of its units of atomicity satis<U+FB01>ed by
other carbon-atoms, each of which has the higher value of 6'0 or 6'1,"
as in naphthalene or pyrene.          This view has been, and is, the
subject of controversy, but on turning to the dispersion equivalents of
these bodies, they are found to be always enormously high, far higher
than can be accounted for by the <U+FB01>gures with which we have hitherto
been dealing.
    Oxygen—It    has   been established by    Briihl, that in the    case of
aldehydes and ketones, oxygen has a refraction equivalent of 3'4. As
these have the general formula CnHMO, and the dispersion of CH, is
known, it is very easy to determine the dispersion equivalent of the
oxygen. Various determinations of these bodies give a fairly uniform
result; viz., 0'18 for H—A.
    In the case of the alcohols, the oxygen has a refraction equivalent
of only 2'8. Comparing the dispersion equivalents of the alcohols of
 different atomicities in the published lists, the mean value for oxygen
in this condition comes out at about 0'10. Nevertheless, in the
 organic acids and compound ethers, the value of the two oxygens
 together seems rarely if ever to exceed 0'24.
     Chlorina—Our lists also give us the means of determining the
 value of chlorine in organic substances of the fatty acid series.         As
 reckoned from such substances as chloroform, chloral, ethylene, and
 ethylidine chloride, and bichloride of chlorethylene, the dispersion
 equivalent of this halogen appears to be 0'50, though in the simple
 chlorides of the compound radicles it appears to be a little less.
    Bromine.—The dispersion equivalent of bromine varies in a similar
 way to that of chlorine.         As deduced from bromoform and the
 dibromides of the ole<U+FB01>nes, it is 1'22; but in the bromide of ethyl it is
 lower.

thylene was found to be 3'65, and in iodoform in solution it seems
to be about the same; while in the ordinary iodides of the compound
radicles it is much less.                                _
   Nitrogen.—-Nitrogen appears to have a lower value in nitriles,
cyanides, and sulphocyanides than in organic bases: but the <U+FB01>gures
obtained so far, for each condition of nitrogen, are not accordant.
The lower value, however, probably does not exceed 0'10. The
values of NO2 in the fatty acid series, as deduced from substitution
products of the alcohols, glycerine, mannite, &c., are, however, fairly
accordant, giving about 0'82.

It appears that the value of sulphur in mercaptans, sulphocyanides,
and sulphides of ethyl, butyl, amyl, and allyl,     about 1'21 answer    is                ;

    It will be seen by a glance at- this table, that the dispersion equiva
lents of the elementary substances are not in proportion to their
atomic weights, or, in other words, that they have di<U+FB01>erent speci<U+FB01>c
dispersive energies.       Thus the analogous elements, sulphur and
oxygen, are strongly contrasted in this respect, their speci<U+FB01>c refrac;
tive energies being respectively 0'081 and O'Oll. Again it will be
evident that the proportion between the refraction and dispersion is
not the same even in the case of analogous elements.               Thus, taking
the three halogens, the ratio between the refraction for A and the
dispersion for H—A for chlorine is about 100 to 5, for bromine 100 to
                                                                 ‘
8, and for iodine 100 to 15.
    Metals in Salts.—-In 1869, as already-stated,        I   suggested that the
same data from which the refraction equivalents of the metals had
been determined, would be available also for their dispersion equiva
lents.     I  have many observations in addition to the data then
published; and Kanonniko<U+FB01>‘ has been over part of the same ground,
measuring the a and B of the hydrogen spectrum. Unfortunately,
however, the errors of observation bear so considerable a proportion
to the whole am0unt observed, at any rate in dilute solutions, that
we cannot look upon single determinations of the dispersion equiva
lent of a salt as of much value.      Thus, even when great care has been
taken in measurement, each index of refraction is liable to an error of
 5:0'0001, and as the error in determining A and H may be in
opposite directions, ,uH—FA cannot be relied upon within iO'OOO‘Z:
 Now among solutions of salts the speci<U+FB01>c dispersion rarely amounts to
0'02   ; the error of observation may therefore be more than 1 per cent.,
and if   the salt should form only 5 per cent. of the solution, the        error
 might exceed 20 per cent.      Such solutions, therefore, are practically
 valueless for this purpose. Yet it would be easy to publish a table of
miscellaneous salts, the dispersion equivalents of which had been
 deduced from several fairly accordant observations on fairly strong
 solutions, or which have been corroborated from some independent
 source.‘ It has appeared preferable, however, to con<U+FB01>ne attention at
 present'to the series of potassium and sodium salts, which are far the
 most complete and the most instructive.                   .   .        ,  .
    It is evident at a glance, that the <U+FB01>gures in the sodium columns are
 invariably lower than those in the potassium columns, and that the
 difference is fairly uniform.    In regard to the refraction equivalent,
 it is about 3'33,* and in the dispersion equivalent it is about 009.
    It follows, that if we can determine the value of potassium, that of
 sodium‘may be at oncei'calculated: and presumably the same process
 may be extended to all other metals that form soluble salts.
    But it is not so easy to determine the value of potassium. In

regard to the refraction equivalent, my original determination was
8'1; but Kanonnikoff gives only 7'75, which led me, three years ago,
to recalculate the observations, taking Briihl’s values for oxygen, and
to reduce my previous estimate to 7‘85.                            This is determined mainly
from     the   organic      salts,   and      the nitrate,   and     cyanide.         I   did not draw
any_conclusion from the haloid salts, as the chlorine, bromine, and
iodine in them appear to have somewhat higher values than what they
have in organic compounds.                                       _
    .How are we to determine the corresponding equivalent of disper
sion? From the haloid salts it would seem to be about 0'8, but it
seeins likely that the disturbing in<U+FB02>uence, whatever it be, which
increases the refraction of the haloid salts, would affect the
dispersion.           The formate and acetate, KCHOQ and KCzHaOi, pro
mise      more       trustworthy results, as we can subtract from their
dispersion equivalents the numbers already determined for carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen. This will give respectively 053 and 0'44 for
the dispersion equivalent of K.                                                                       _
     If we view potassium hydrate, KHO, as water in which one
hydrogen atom is replaced by potassium, water being 0'265, we obtain

 wide to give a good average.             I doubt if such variations can be
 attributed wholly to experimental error; but on the other hand, it is
 dif<U+FB01>cult to imagine that potassium should have more than one
  dispersion equivalent, while in the same series of dissolved salts it
  has apparently one and the same refraction equivalent.            I  am more
  disposed to believe, that the uncertainty lies in the value of the
  radicles to which the metal is joined; but this will require a more
 extended research.
      It is also an important enquiry :——To what extent does the modi<U+FB01>ca
 tion of the dispersion equivalent affect the refraction equivalent for
  the line A? On this question, and others of a similar nature,           I hope
  shortly to submit a further communication.         I think it will be already
 suf<U+FB01>ciently obvious that the speci<U+FB01>c dispersive energy of a compound
  body is a physical property analogous to, but distinct from, its speci<U+FB01>c
  refractive energy, and that it is capable in like manner of throwing
  light upon chemical structure.

      The experiments here described were undertaken to test whether
 the rate at which electricity leaks through a liquid which conducts
electricity badly, does or does not follow Ohm’s law.
      The method used is described later on; it consists in establishing
 by a battery a difference of potential of about 100 volts between the
plates of a condenser, in which the dielectric is the faulty insulator to
be experimented on, then disconnecting the battery, and measuring
with an electrometer the rate at which the difference of potential
dies away.

of an interval T, and let

  x—l/w per   cent. in E, and     a deviation from Ohm’s law to this extent.
     The liquids tried were benzene, olive oil, carbon bisnlphide, and
 paraf<U+FB01>n oil. We could detect no deviation from Ohm’s law for the
 <U+FB01>rst three of these substances, though the diiference of potential fell
 from 500 scale divisions to 20. For parai<U+FB01>n oil, however, the con
 ductivity seemed slightly greater when the di<U+FB01>erence of' potential was
 large than when it was small. The departure from Ohm’s law even
 in this case was small.
     Quincke* has found that when the E.M.F. is comparable with that
 which would cause a spark to pass through the liquid, Ohm’s law
 ceases to be even approximately obeyed.                 Thus, for carbon bisnl

 when the              was   4774:,   the  current   was   36;   showing that with
 large electromotive forces the current increases much more rapidly
than the
    With the small electromotive forces which we used, the current,
 however, is proportional to the E.M.F., showing that when the

 other methods of dissipating the energy of the electric <U+FB01>eld must
 exist besides those which are active in conductors conveying a current
 according to Ohm’s law.
    We found that carbon bisnlphide showed a phenomenon analogous
to electric absorption, the only case we know where this has been
observed in a liquid dielectric.
    The conductivity of all the liquids on which we experimented
increases as the temperature rises, so that in this respect they behave
like electrolytes.

                            Description of Apparatus.
      The condenser consisted of two copper cylinders, the outer one
   being formed into a pot 12 inches deep and 4! inches in diameter,
   closed at the bottom by a rounded end carefully worked inside, the
   inner one, 8 inches long and 3 inches in diameter, being closed,
   rounded off at both top and bottom, and carefully worked outside. The
   outer cylinder was held in position on a bracket attached to a brick
   wall, and was always connected to earth through the gas-pipes; the
   inner one was suspended by a silk thread, 5 feet long, also from a
   bracket on the wall, vertically above the <U+FB01>rst, and was connected to
   an insulated mercury cup by means of a thick wire, which was care
   fully soldered into the top of the cylinder, and bent into a loop to
   attach the silk thread to. The <U+FB01>gure shows the arrangement in eleva
   tion, the outer cylinder being represented as transparent, to show the
  inner cylinder and attachment.
      The liquid to be experimented on was poured into the outer pot,
‘
  and the inner cylinder was lowered into it, both being set vertical by
  means of a plumb~1ine.        It was found necessary to load the inner
  cylinder with shot to keep it sunk in the liquid.
      The suspension by a single silk thread was found very satisfactory,
  as it insulated well, and avoided the introduction of solid dielectrics,
  and the suspended cylinder if disturbed came again to rest after a
  'very few oscillations.

    In testing the arrangement the condenser was used as an air-con—
 denser, and it was found that there were signs of some electrical
 absorption.        These were traced to the paraf<U+FB01>n key and the wire con
necting it with the electrometer. The key was improved by the use
 of very clean mercury, and very careful amalgamation of the ends of
 the copper wire dipping into the mercury cups.                   The wire at <U+FB01>rst
 used to connect the cup A in the key with the electrometer was
 covered with gutta-percha, and the whole passed through lead pipe,
 put to earth to protect it electrically from the experimenter. But it
 was found that there was absorption on charging and the appearance
of residual charge on discharging the electrometer; the gutta-percha
covered wire was therefore discarded, and bare wire stretched between
insulating points, and this was then protected electrically by a shield
of zinc, enclosing it and put to earth.
    In testing, the condenser was connected with the electrometer by
laying a piece of wire, so as to connect the cups C and A. A second

either A or C, and the condenser and electrometer were then charged ;
the cells were then disconnected, and the fall of potential as noted by
the electrometer readings was observed at equal intervals.           A metro
nome was used to beat half-seconds ;       the  position of the  spot of light
on the scale was noted every 5 seconds generally, and a curve was then
plotted with the time for abscissa: and the potentials as denoted by
the electrometer de<U+FB02>ection for ordinates.
    In preliminary experiments, in which a- sample of benzene (later
experiments showed it to be very impure) was used in the condenser,
it was found desirable to introduce an air condenser, so as to diminish
the rate of fall of potential, and to get more reliable readings. The
air condenser consisted of two worked brass plates, held very slightly
apart by three dots of shellac. One plate was attached to the inner
cylinder, the other connected to earth with the outer cylinder of the
experimental condenser.
    From time to time throughout the course of the experiments, which
were continued through about three months, the apparatus was tested
for leaking         through the electrometer, (ii) through the key,
 (iii) through the air condenser, (iv) through the attachments of the
experimental condenser.
    To get rid of dirt and dust from the liquids to be placed in the
condenser, very careful <U+FB01>ltering was necessary; but generally after
ten or twelve times, <U+FB01>rst through Swedish <U+FB01>lter-paper, and <U+FB01>nally
through a tight plug of “glass-wool,” as much as could be done by
<U+FB01>ltering had been done.
    Di<U+FB02>iculties were at <U+FB01>rst met with on account of what were probably
chemical impurities in the samples used. We <U+FB01>nally decided to use
much smaller quantities of the liquids in the condenser.            There was
scarcely   ever more   liquid  than wonld  half  immerse  the  inner cylinder,
that is, more than would        extend 4 inches   up the straight part of it;
but there was never less than would extend three-eighths of an inch
up the straight.

    The potential of the inner cylinder was noted at equal intervals of
time (generally <U+FB01>ve seconds) from the de<U+FB02>ection of the electrometer
needle.     These de<U+FB02>ections were recorded in tables, and the ratios of
succeeding de<U+FB02>ections were deduced.           Two curves are drawn, one
showing the fall of potential with the lapse of time, the other showing
the value of the ratio of successive values of the potential.       The mean
value of the ratios is found, and a line drawn with this value. This
cuts the curve of ratios, and shows at a glance the departures from the
constant ratios, which would obtain if the leak through the dielectrics
took place according to Ohm’s law.

    The <U+FB01>rst successful experiments were made with an impure sample
of  benzene, and the method was shown to be practicable.                                  But before
more careful readings were taken the cylinders had to be re-worked,
because of some irregularities on the surfaces.                            On setting the appa
ratus up again,       it    was found  that       the    impure       benzene        no longer insu
lated well enough to allow us to get readings. The reason of the
change we have not been able to discover.
    A pure sample of benzene was got, and after the usual <U+FB01>ltering
processes, the condenser was <U+FB01>lled and charged, and readings were
taken at <U+FB01>ve seconds intervals.                                       ‘

    When carbon disulphide was used as the leaking dielectric, con
 siderable discrepancies appeared; the ratio curve fell or remained
 steady in what seemed a capricious manner.    Filtering seemed to make
 no difference, although again and again repeated; the condenser
icylinders were cleaned carefully; the liquid was distilled several times,
Land the discrepancies only seemed to be exaggerated, especially in
éexperiments made very soon after distillation.      The still was cleaned
 and again used, but to no effect.  The irregularities still remained, the
gratio curve in some instances being as steadily horizontal as in the
lease of benzene and paraf<U+FB01>n

 that we had to deal with something analogous to electric absorption.

variable in the circumstances for the di<U+FB01>'erent curves being the time
of charge. It will be seen that the curve corresponding to a long
charge is much less steep than that corresponding to a short charge.

Curves plotted for carbon disulphide from Tables X and XI.
Upper curve from readings taken after a long period (10 minutes) of charging the
   condensers; lower curve after a short period (2 seconds).      Otherwise conditions
   similar.
The curves of ratios are on the same scale and have the same zero line about    3 inches
   below the lower edge of the <U+FB01>gure.
    We    deal later    with further experiments on           these   phenomena of
absorption and residual charge.
                             Experiments on Olive Oil.
   Very little trouble was experienced with olive oil. The sample
used proved to be the best insulator of all the liquids we tried, After
<U+FB01>ltering once through Swedish paper and once through a glass-wool
plug, it insulated as well as after numerous <U+FB01>lterings,
   Readings of the de<U+FB02>ections were taken, as before, every <U+FB01>ve seconds ;
but in Tables XII and XIII, only those taken at intervals                             of
25 seconds are recorded, the former being taken after a short time
of charging, the latter after a long time. Fig. 7 is plotted from
Table XIII, but is on a di<U+FB01>erent scale from <U+FB01>gs. 3—6, so far as the
time coordinate is concerned, in order to bring more of ‘the curve into
the plate.

          Experiments on Rate of Leak at Di<U+FB01>'erent Temperatures.
   In all the liquids experimented on (benzene, olive oil, carbon disul
phide) the leak was quicker at higher temperatures than at lower.
   These liquids then must be classed in this respect with electrolytes,
and not with metallic conductors.
  ‘A metal vessel was put round the outer'cylinder of the condenser,
and was connected by a tube with a second vessel, which could be
heated or cooled, and raised or lowered. By these means the condenser
could be surrounded by hot or cold water without having its position
disturbed in any way.
   Readings were then taken at 15 seconds intervals, the condenser
being in one set of observations under the same circumstances in
every way except with respect to temperature. Each set contained
three (or <U+FB01>ve) readings, one reading at a high or low temperature‘

   In  the tables the values of the ratios have been put down, and they
will  be seen to be    fairly constant in each table.
   Table XVII contains readings for benzene at 5'40; the leak was
so slow in this case as to attract attention, and it was found that the
benzene was partially frozen; hence the curve in <U+FB01>g. 8 is dotted to
show that the benzene was in a di<U+FB01>erent state.
   The curve corresponding to Table XVI would come very close to
that corresponding to Table XIV, and is therefore omitted from
<U+FB01>g. 8.

 Curves plotted for olive oil at different temperatures from Tables  XXIII    and XXV.
 The dotted curve is got by a process of interpolation roughly from Table XXIV.
    At  the    higher temperatures the rate of leak was so great that
 there is some doubt as to the <U+FB01>rst reading of the de<U+FB02>ection: hence
 the discrepancies in the values of the ratios.
    Tables XXIV and XXVII are abridged from fuller tables which
 give readings taken at 15 seconds intervals.              These are given below.

      The condenser was charged to about 100 volts, and readings were

 ‘less regular than in the earlier experiments.

                        Experiments on Residual Charge.
     Carbon disulphide showed peculiarities in the above experiments.
With a short and sudden charge the rate of fall of potential was much
quicker at the beginning than at the end of the readings. This is
 what would be expected if there were electrical absorption, part of
 the fall being due to true leaking, part to absorption.                 If the rate of
 leak is according to Ohm's law, the ratio curve for such a liquid
 would be inclined to the horizontal at <U+FB01>rst, but the inclination would
diminish with time. This is what is found in the case of carbon
 disulphide when the condenser is charged for a short time.
      Again, the condenser, with carbon bisulphide between the cylinders,
 was charged for a time, then quickly discharged, and its inner cylinder
 connected with the electrometer. The de<U+FB02>ection was at <U+FB01>rst connex
 ion zero, then shortly rose to a maximum value, and <U+FB01>nally diminished
 again after some time to zero.             If the condenser was charged with
 opposite sign,'the de<U+FB02>ection from zero was in the opposite direction.
  If the condenser was charged <U+FB01>rst with one sign and then with
  the other, the de<U+FB02>ections from zero were much smaller, but they
 appeared in the sense expected from residual charge phenomena.
      These effects were greatest just after the CS, had been redis
  tilled, but at times were totally absent.              The still was cleaned, but
  the e<U+FB01>ects after fresh distillation were as marked as before.
      Attempts to increase the effects by rendering the liquid less homo
  geneous were successful, for heating or cooling the condenser un
  equally always exaggerated the de<U+FB02>ections.

XXII. “The       Development of the Branchial Arterial Arches in
       Birds, with special Reference to the Origin of the Sub—
       clavians and Carotids.” By JOHN YULE MAOKAY, M.D.,
        Senior Demonstrator of Anatomy, University of Glasgow.
       Communicated by Professor CLELAND, M.D., F.R.S. Re
       ceived May 29, 1887.
                                 (Abstract)
    According to the theories of Rathke, which        are universally accepted
at the present day,   the subclavian     artery is supposed to take its origin
from the aortic root or fourth embryonic branchial arterial arch. In
the adult bird the subclavian on each side is found springing from
the extremity of an innominate artery along with the common carotid.
 It is presumed that the right subclavian has been, by a shortening of
 the aortic arch, carried forwards until it meets and fuses with the base
 of the common carotid artery; and the left subclavian is regarded as
 representing by its basal portion the fourth left arch or left primitive
 aorta. The subclavian of birds is thus regarded by Rathke as being
 developed in a manner similar to that of mammals. The author
 points out, however, that there is a marked difference in the rela
 tions of the artery to the surrounding parts in these two groups. In
 mammals the subclavian artery is crossed on its ventral aspect by the
 jugular vein and the pneumogastric nerve, and the recurrent branch
 of the latter turns round it upon the right side, but in birds the nerve

 and vein are dorsally placed as regards the artery, and the recurrent
  laryngeal nerves turn round the ductus arteriosus or vestiges of the
  <U+FB01>fth arches, a relationship which cannot be accounted for by supposing
  with Rathke that the vessel takes its origin <U+FB01>rst, from the aortic
  root, because, if so arising, it would occupy a position dorsal to vein
  and nerve, and it is impossible to .imagine a method by which the
  artery could pass from the dorsalto the ventral aspect of these struc
  tures without cutting them through. in its course.

     In these circumstances the author has undertaken an investigation
 into the manner in which the subclavian artery <U+FB01>rst makes its-appears
 ance in birds.     He <U+FB01>nds that it occupies from the <U+FB01>rst a ventral posi
 tion arising from the truncus arteriosus at the ventral end of the
 third arch. The vessel may be seen in the freshly removed embryo
 duck or chick on the third or fourth day, at a time when the pectoral
 limb is merely a small projection from the body-wall, and on the <U+FB01>fth
 day in the chick it may, while still <U+FB01>lled with blood, be traced by the
 eye from the ventral end of the third arch across the superior cardinal
-vein to the limb. The presence of this ventral vessel is also demon
 strated during the third, fourth, and <U+FB01>fth days in the chick by micro
 scopic sections of hardened embryos, but, owing to the oblique course
 which the artery holds in. the body-wall, it is impossible in one series
 of sections to trace its entire length, and this is probably the cause

 of its having    been overlooked by previous observers.     In chicks at
 the   close of the sixth day and in older forms it is pointed out that
  the artery may be followed by dissection under water. The innomi
  nate artery has been observed to be formed, not by the gradual
 fusion of the subclavian and carotid arteries at their bases, but by
 the splitting up of the truncus arteriosus into canals continuous
 with the three permanent arches, the innominate artery belonging to
 the third, and the basal portions of the aorta and pulmonary artery
 to the fourth and <U+FB01>fth respectively.
     The author has also examined the relations of the subclavian
 artery in the di<U+FB01>erent groups of vertebrate animals, and <U+FB01>nds that
 instead of there being but one artery prolonged into the limb, as
 Rathke held, there are in reality two such vessels. One is represented
  by the mammalian subclavian, and also in lizards and amphibians
 is found arising from the aortic root, and passing outwards to
 the limb dorsal to the pneumogastric nerve and jugular vein. The
 other, present in birds and in crocodilian and chelonian reptiles,
 arises from the ventral end of the third arch, and crosses outwards
  ventral to vein and nerve. In most of the lower forms representa—
 tives of both _vessels are present, and :one or other is specially
 enlarged and supplies the greater part of the limb, but it is
 {pointed out that in the forms where the two vessels co-exist they
 anastomose with one another in the body-wall at the base of the limb.
  This anastomosis may be dissected out in lizards, where the dorsal
 vessel is specially enlarged, and in crocodilian reptiles, where the
 ventral artery plays the important part.
    In the higher forms (birds and mammals) one of the arteries alone
 is present, but the cetacean group of mammals forms an exception to
 this rule. In this group both arteries are to be found, and it is the
 Ventral, not the dorsal as in mammals lgenerally, which specially
 supplies the limb.
    With reference to the development of the carotid artery in birds,
 Rathke believed that the external carotid was the prolongation of the
 ventral trunk from the extremity of the third arch towards the head,
 and regarded the branches of the external carotid as derivatives of
 this ventral vessel. The internal carotid he looked upon as represent
 ing the third arch and its dorsal continuation towards the head, while
the common carotid was believed by him to be the portion of the
 ventral vessel between the third and fourth arches.
    It is pointed out that if the observations already explained as to the
origin of the subclavian artery be accepted, and that vessel be held to
arise from the ventral extremity of the third arch, then, if Rathke’s
theory of the external carotid be true, the subclavian should be found
in the adult as a branch of the external carotid; but this is not the
case.    The common carotid artery, which Rathke regarded as a ventral

vessel, runs towards the head   in the adult bird, upon the dorsal aspect
of the alimentary canal, and distributes intervertebral branches as it
goes.    Rathke believed that this artery was originally ventral in
position, and passed gradually round the oesophagus in the course of'
growth until it <U+FB01>nally reached the dorsal aspect; but the author"
points out that while the artery does change its position somewhat,
it is to a much more limited extent than Rathke believed.          In the
chick of the third or fourth day, the main vessel for the supply of the
head is the dorsal continuation from the third arch, the ventral
vessel being small.    The examination of the further development by
sections and dissections makes it evident that the ventral vessel
dwindles in importance, and becomes <U+FB01>nally a small branch'passing
from the subclavian to the ventral aspect of the trachea, while the
dcrsal prolongation becomes the sole supply of the head.           At the
close of the sixth day the dorsal connexion between the ends of the
third and fourth arches is still present, and it is continuous with the
common carotid, which may be easily followed to the head as a dorsal
vessel, and its external branches, as well as its internal, are therefore
to be regarded as derivatives of a dorsal stem.         In the adult the
common carotid lies in the middle line of the neck in ,contact with its
fellow of the opposite side, but in the embryo the vessels of opposite
sides are at some little distance from one another; by the seventh day,
however, they have approached one another so as to be almost in con
tact. This change, however, is not, as Rathke supposed, the passage
of a ventral vessel to a dorsal position, but a slight alteration in the
line of a vessel already dorsal.
   When the carotid system of di<U+FB01>erent groups of vertebrate animals
is examined, it is found that in those forms where, on account of the
preservation of the dorsal connexion between the third and fourth
arches, the continuous dorsal longitudinal vessel can be traced, the
branches for the supply of both internal and external aspects of the
head arise from this dorsal vessel.     In these forms the ventral pro
longation supplies only the tongue. This is the case in most lizards.
As the higher stages are reached the disappearance of the portion of
the dorsal vessel between the ends of the third and fourth arches
 makes a comparison of the vessels uncertain, but the author has dis
covered in the crocodile, and as an abnormality in a guillemot, solid
 cords stretching between the common carotids and aortze on the dorsal
aspect of the alimentary canal.      In these cases it is seen that the
 greater part of the common carotid is to be regarded as the dorsal
 prolongation from the third arch towards the head. The ventral
 vessel in birds and crocodiles is not, therefore, the external carotid, as
 Rathke has  it, but an artery running upon the trachea and supplying
 branches to the muscles on the ventral surface of the neck.

       J. T. BOTTOMLEY,             M.A., F.R.S.E.         Communicated by
       Sir W. THOMSON, Knt., F.R.S. Received May 26, 1887.
   -In connection with      an investigation on heat radiation       which   I have
been carrying on for some time past, and on which                  I recently pre
sented a communication to the Royal Society,             I have had occasion to
examine the important results obtained by Mr. Mortimer Evans on
the radiation of light and heat from bright and dull surfaces when
incandescent (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 40, 1886, p. 207) ; and               I have
repeated and veri<U+FB01>ed some of his experiments.                 Mr. Evans experi
mented on carbon <U+FB01>laments of incandescent lamps; and in calculating,
for my own use, the resistances of the <U+FB01>laments at di<U+FB01>erent degrees                     -

of incandescence was led to an unexpected result, and hence to an

investigation of which desire just now to offer a preliminary notice.
    In order to explain, it is necessary for me to state brie<U+FB02>y the object
and nature of Mr. Evans’ experiments.               Their object was the com
 parison of the radiation from surfaces having a bright, polished
appearance with that from dull surfaces having the appearance                     of
lampblack; and he was led to an important practical conclusion as to
the superior light-giving e<U+FB02>iciency of the brilliant-looking <U+FB01>lament.
 For these comparisons the same <U+FB01>lament was treated in such ways as
to alter the surface from dull to bright and back again.              It was taken
out of the glass globe for the purpose, and after treatment placed in
a fresh globe, which was then exhausted. The lamps thus constructed
and reconstructed were tested at various candle-powers, the energy
for each candle-power being determined.
    The tables given in Mr. Evans’ paper show for the <U+FB01>laments in
different conditions the potential and the current required to maintain
different cahdle-powers fronr four candles upward. Using his numbers,
and supposing Ohm’s* law to hold for the carbon <U+FB01>laments,                    I have
calculated the resistances of the <U+FB01>laments at diiferent candle-powers.
    Two <U+FB01>laments used by Mr. Evans afforded satisfactory data for my'
calculations.      They are designated in his paper D, DD, DDD, and C,
CC, 000. They had been treated in the following manner :—The
<U+FB01>laments D and C were “ <U+FB02>ashed so as to have a dull surface with

the appearance of lampblack.            DD and CC are the same <U+FB01>laments
<U+FB02>ashed so as to have a brilliant surface, which, though black, has
something of the appearance of frosted silver. DDD, CCC, are the
same <U+FB01>laments again rendered dull as at <U+FB01>rst.               The following table
shows the volts, amperes, and calculated resistances at the candle
                                                                           ‘         -‘

    Now if we suppose the resistance of the carbon <U+FB01>lament to depend
on the temperature, the resistance diminishing as the temperature
increases (though very probably not in simple proportion) ; and if (as
we should do in the case of a metallic Wire) we use these resistances
in order to compare the temperatures of the <U+FB01>laments at different
candle-powers, we are led to a remarkable result. Taking the <U+FB01>la
ment D and dividing the resistances of D, DD, and DDD at four
candles by those at the higher candle-powers, we obtain numbers,
which may be looked on as ratios of conductances, and which may be
taken as indicating, though not exactly representing, corresponding
changes in the temperature of the carbon.

 Comparing these numbers we are led to the result that, if we admit
the assumptions       I  have made, the temperature to which the carbon
must be raised in order that it may give out light of a de<U+FB01>nite candle
power is higher when the surface is in the dull condition than when
it is in a brilliant metallic-looking state.
   This result was to me so unexpected that                I  proceeded to test it
directly by the following experiments :—Two glass tubes, similar in
every respect, were constructed, containing two precisely similar
platinum wires cut from the same hank, which had been specially
drawn for me some months before by Messrs. Matthey and Johnson.
One of the wires was in its natural bright condition, while the other
was covered with the thinnest possible coating of lampblack, which
was put on by passing the wire quickly and steadily through the
<U+FB02>ame of a parai<U+FB01>n lamp.            The construction of these tubes is shown
in <U+FB01>g. 1.       The platinum wire ab is kept stretched by two spiral

springs of copper, being silver-soldered to two extremities of these
springs.     Two loops 1 at the other extremities of the spirals pass over
two pieces of glass rod gg, gg, which are passed in by side tubes,
blown on to the main glass tube; and the spirals pull on the glass
rods. The ends of the side tubes are sealed up after the glass rods
are in their places, with the exception of one, which is used for con
necting to the Sprengel pump, and is <U+FB01>nally sealed when a complete

  436        On Radiation from         Dull and Bright Surfaces.      [June 16,
  vacuum has been made.             Flexible copper electrodes, ee, are silver
  soldered to the loops at the ends of the copper springs, and to
  multiple platinum wires which are sealed into the glass tube at A
  and B. Fine platinum wires, pp, are attached to the main wire, and
  are brought through the sides of the glass tube; and these serve as
  potential testing electrodes.        The two tubes and their <U+FB01>ttings are, as
  has been said, perfectly similar in every respect, except that one
  platinum wire is covered with an extremely thin coating of lamp
I
  black.
      The two tubes were attached to a glass fork, and were simul
  taneously exhausted with the Sprengel pump down to about two
  millionths of an atmosphere, all the well-understood precautions as
  to drying, &c., being carefully attended to; and they were then at
  the same moment sealed 05 from the pump. The length of the tubes
  AB is 22 inches over all; and the internal diameter of the tubes
  % inch.   The distance between the potential electrodes pp is 15 inches
   (38'1 centimetres).      The diameter of the platinum wire ah is 00%
  inch (0'0599 centimetre).           On testing the resistance of the two
  platinums   between     the   potential electrodes, cold and at the same
  temperature, it was found to be the same for both to less than one
  one-thousandth part of the resistance of either of them.
      The tubes having been prepared as described above,- they were
connected in parallel arc to a battery of six secondary cells in series,
  a variable platinoid wire being added in series with the tube con
  taining the bright platinum, in order to regulate its current; and a
  rheostat designed for carrying strong currents was used to control
   the whole. The connexions will be readily understood from a glance
  at <U+FB01>g. 2.

electrodes were measured by means of a high resistance re<U+FB02>ecting
galvanometer, suitably arranged, with shunt and interposed resistance,
for the purpose in hand.
_ The result of my experiments is to bear out completely the deduc
tion which I had made from Mr. Mortimer Evans’ numbers; and to
.show that, the temperature which produces, for example, the appear
 ance of a certain red heat, is very much higher when the surface of
 the heated body is dulled than when it is bright as in a polished
 metal.     I  am not yet prepared to give a de<U+FB01>nite numerical com
 parison; but in order to show that the di<U+FB02>erence of temperatures
 referred to amounts to many degrees of temperature,           I may be
.allowed to give the following statement.
     The two wires being at the same dull red heat, which from previous
experience     I estimate at perhaps 600° 0., in the case of the bright
 surfaced wire, the ratio of the resistance of the lamp-blacked platinum
 ,to the bright platinum was 130: 93.      Platinums diifer very much as
 to variation of resistance with temperature; but in most specimens
  the resistance is doubled, when the temperature is raised from 0° C.
 ,to a temperature of from 300° C. to 400° C. ; and for any particular
  platinum wire the change in resistance is almost in simple proportion
  to the change in temperature. From this statement it may be judged
 that the di<U+FB01>erence of temperatures between the two platinums, dull
 and bright, when giving out the same light, was a great many degrees
centigrade.
     The diiference of temperatures of the two glass envelopes was also
  very striking.     The glass tube containing the bright wire was not
 .even unpleasantly warm; while in the case of the other it was so hot
  as to blister the skin of the hand ; and in this connection it is to be
  remembered that the vacuum in the two tubes was the same.
     I propose as soon as possible to continue this investigation and
 render it more complete.

caudad of the pituitary fossa.
    I  <U+FB01>nd that this anastomotic trunk is present in Mustelus antarcticus,
in which species, however, it hardly deserves the name of sinus,
being only 1 mm. in diameter in a dog-<U+FB01>sh 1 metre long. Its median
portion is situated, not in the actual cartilage of the skull-<U+FB02>oor, but
in the thick perichondrium of the pituitary fossa, where it lies
immediately dorsad and caudad of the arterial commissures 10 (<U+FB01>g. 6,
 Plate 35) at their point of crossing. Passing laterad on either
side it pierces the cartilage of the cranial <U+FB02>oor, and <U+FB01>nally enters the
orbit by an aperture placed just cephalad of the trigeminal foramen,
and about 5 mm. caudad of the carotid foramen.
   I  doubt whether this can be the anastomotic trunk described by
Robin (see p. 712), since it is not situated “ derriere les orbites,” and
can hardly be described as “ un sinus plus ou moins vaste.”
   The vessel in question ought to have been shown in the diagram,
<U+FB01>g.B (p. 723) as a narrow trunk connecting the orbital sinuses (orbit. s.),
and should have been referred to in the general account of venous
anastomoses on p. 722.

                 Rigor Mortis in Fish, and its Relation to Putrefac
      tion.”    By J. C. EWART, M.D., Regius Professor of Natural
      History, University of Edinburgh.           Communicated by       J.
      BURDON SANDERSON, F.R.S.           Received June 6, 1887.
                       1.  The Nature of Rigor Mortis.
   It   has been long recognised]    that rigor varies extremely not only
in the time of its appearance, but also in its intensity.      It may be
well marked and resemble closely a spasm, or so indistinct that it is
better compared to a stiffening than to a contraction of the muscles.
So much is this the case that it might be convenient to describe
rigor as accompanied with contraction in some cases and with
stiffening in others.     I have often noticed that when rigor comes on
immediately after the loss of muscular irritability, it looks extremely
like contraction; but when it is postponed for days, by lowering the
temperature or otherwise, it more closely resembles coagulation.          I
am inclined to believe that whether the rigor resembles a contraction
or a mere stiffening depends on the condition of the nervous system.
If the coagulation of the myosin takes place at or about the same
time as the death of the nerves, the rigor will to a certain extent
be physiological, and simulate a contraction in the extension of
the <U+FB01>ns, the bending of the trunk, &c.; whereas if the coagulation
only sets in some hours, or it may be days, after the death of the

1887.]              and its Relation   to Putrefaction.                439
nerves, the rigor will be purely pathological, and consist of a mere
<U+FB01>xing of the muscles in whatever position they happen to be. Another
important consideration is what determines the time of appearance
and strength of the rigor.                           I
                                In some instances have been unable to
detect rigor, in others, it has appeared at ordinary temperatures, a
few minutes after death, while in other cases it appeared from ten to
twehty hours after death.      Again in some cases it is extremely weak
and of short duration, whilst in others it is well marked and pro
longed.    It may be safely asserted that if all the nerves in a given
muscle were destroyed, that muscle would still pass into rigor.        But
although the rigor would probably set in were all the nervous ele
ments destroyed, the nervous system has apparently considerable
in<U+FB02>uence in determining the time of appearance of rigor.             Some
physiologists seem to believe that the rigor comes on when and
only when death has reached the muscles, by travelling in some
cases hurriedly, in others slowly, from the central nervous system
along the motor nerves.         I  hope to show that the longer the
central nervous system continues to act, not only will the muscles
sooner die, but the rigor will be the weaker and shorter, though in
some cases from the arching of the trunk and extension of the <U+FB01>ns, it
may appear to be otherwise.
   Let us suppose that two <U+FB01>sh are instantaneously killed, the one
in a vigorous, the other in an exhausted condition.       In the former a
considerable time will elapse before the energy of the muscles is
exhausted, before the explosive material is all used up, while in the
latter the muscles having already expended nearly all their energy
during life, and little or no new productive material having been
formed after death, they will soon die.      Further, in the <U+FB01>sh killed in
an active condition, the muscles will give rise to awell-marked lasting
rigor, whilst in the other it will be weak and of short duration.     The
result of arti<U+FB01>cial exhaustion is the same as that of natural.        If a
rabbit is killed and immediately after death the muscles of one hind
limb exhausted by an interrupted current, rigor sets in in the ex:
hausted limb two to three hours sooner than in the other.           In the
same way, if a <U+FB01>sh is tetanised immediately after death, rigor sets in
quicker than in another <U+FB01>sh which has escaped stimulationf But
further, if two <U+FB01>sh are killed and the central nervous system at once
                                                                           ‘
destroyed in one, but left intact in the other, rigor will be considerably
later in appearing in the pithed <U+FB01>sh.      The explanation possibly may
be that the central nervous system after death tends to exhaust the
latent energy of the muscles by constantly stimulating them into
action; while, on the other hand, when the central nervous system is
destroyed, the muscles are not stimulated into action, and there
 fore their <U+FB01>nal passage into rigor depends chie<U+FB02>y on the tempera
 ture and other surroundings.

                    2. The Ordinary Phenomena        of Rigor in   Frisk.
      The changes which take place before and during rigor will be best
  illustrated by the following experiments :— '
      (1.) Physiological Laboratory, Oxford, 4th February, 1887, 3 P.M.—A
  large active perch (Perca <U+FB02>uviatili's) was taken from the tank and aid
  on the <U+FB02>oor of the Laboratory, temperature 48° F. For about twenty
  minutes the perch at irregular intervals was very active, but the move
  ments gradually diminished, and about thirty-<U+FB01>ve minutes after it left
  the water, all movements had ceased and there was no response to
  mechanical stimulation.            When stimulated at 3.45 by induction
  shocks,      there was no response until the secondary coil indicated
  15     cm.* The muscular irritability gradually diminished, and at 5.45
  there was only a slight response at the break with the secondary coil
  at 0 cm.         At 5.50 the lower jaw and gill-covers were nearly rigid,
  and the irritability had quite gone in the muscles near the root of the
  tail, the last to survive.          At 6.0 the pectoral and dorsal <U+FB01>ns were
  rigid,    and    at 6.10  the  rigor had extended as far as the pelvic <U+FB01>ns.
  At 6.15 the whole <U+FB01>sh had passed into a pronounced rigor, the
  mouth was open, the gill-covers projected outwards, all the <U+FB01>ns were
  extended, and owing to the shortening of the muscles of the left side,
  the <U+FB01>sh (which was 9 inches in length) was suf<U+FB01>ciently curved to form
  an arc of a circle 30 inches in diameter.           While the muscles remained
  irritable, they were neutral or amphichroic, but as the rigor extended
  from before backwards they became distinctly acid.
      As soon as the rigor had set in the perch was placed under a bell
  jar in a porcelain dish containing suf<U+FB01>cient water to keep the skin
  moist. At 10 P.M. the rigor was still well marked, but next morning
   (5th February) at 10 A.M., the rigor had disappeared from the lower
  jaw, gill-covers, and pectoral <U+FB01>ns.             When placed with the convex
   side looking upwards, the lateral curvature of the trunk soon
  gave way and at 12 noon the whole <U+FB01>sh, except about 3 inches at the
  tail end, was quite limp.
       At 10.30 A.M., the muscles in front of the dorsal <U+FB01>n were neutral,
  those. behind distinctly acid, at 12 noon the muscles of the anterior
   half were slightly alkaline, those near the root of the tail were still
~
   neutral.       Numerous bacteria were found in the layer of muscles lying
   around the body-cavity, and a few were found in the muscles under
   the skin in front of the dorsal <U+FB01>n, but no bacteria could be discovered
  either by direct observation or by cultivation in the muscles near the
   root of the tail.
       On the 6th February putrid odours were discernible, all the

 muscles were getting soft, and bacteria, plentiful in the muscles around
the body-cavity, were extending into the caudal region.
    In this case death occurred about 35 minutes after the <U+FB01>sh was
taken from the water: muscular irritability disappeared and rigor
 began to appear 2 hours 15 minutes after death, the rigor was com
pleted in ‘25 minutes after it set in, and it had vanished about

21 hours after death.
    (2.) Zoological Laboratory, Edinburgh, 25th March, 10 A.M.—A
common eel (Anguilla uulgaris) 18 inches in length, was killed by
 knocking on the head. At 6 P.M. (8 hours after death) the whole
 trunk responded freely to mechanical stimulation and the heart was
still beating. At 10 A.M. of the 26th (24 hours after death) there
 was only a feeble response to mechanical stimulation, but strong con
tractions were produced when the electrodes from an induction coil
 were applied to the skin,—-the secondary coil at 15 cm. At 1 PM. the
 muscular irritability had slightly diminished in the anterior third, at
6 P.M. it was still less marked, and at 10 A.M. of the 27th (48 hours after
death), with the secondary coil at zero, the muscles of the anterior
third contracted very slightly. At 12 noon the muscles of the anterior
5 inches gave no response, but those of the middle third still con
tracted readily, and the muscular irritability increased towards the
tail end. Two hours afterwards (i.e., 52 hours after death) the
greater portion of the anterior third had become rigid—the rigor
beginning in the lower jaw and passing backwards a<U+FB01>ecting the gill
covers and pectoral <U+FB01>ns and then the muscles of the trunk. At
4 P.M. the muscles of the anterior portion of the middle third of the
 eel no longer responded to electrical stimulation, and at 8 P.M., the
 anterior half (about 9 inches in length) was rigid while the posterior
half still responded when. stimulated—the strength of the contractions
 still increasing from before backwards. The muscles of the rigid half
had a distinctly acid reaction, those of the posterior half were neutral
or very faintly alkaline—a narrow zone near the centre being amphi
croic. The muscles of the anterior third immediately under the skin
were neutral and contained no bacteria, but those next the peritoneum
had a few bacilli and micrococci, and were alkaline in reaction.
    On the morning of the 28th (9 A.M.) the rigor had all but dis
appeared from the anterior third, the middle third was quite stiff, and
the posterior third, except near the tail end, contracted very feebly
with the secondary coil at zero.
    At 1 P.M. rigor had passed from the anterior half, but the
muscles of the posterior third were still irritable.      The reaction of
the muscles in the anterior third was now slightly alkaline, and they
contained a few bacilli and micrococci similar to those found on the
previous day in the muscles around the body-cavity.          At 5 P.M. only
the terminal 3 inches responded when the electrodes were introduced

of the posterior third. At 6 RM. the rigor had all but gone from
the middle third, and a weak rigor had set in in the posterior
third. At 8 RM. (82 hours after death) the whole eel was quite
limp—the rigor on the posterior third having been weak and of short
duration.   The alkaline reaction increased from before backwards, to
about 3 inches from the tip of the tail, where it was neutral, and
bacteria could be detected in the muscles a little beyond the middle
half. Next morning (29th March) all the muscles were alkaline, and
a few bacteria were present even in the muscles near the tail end,
and the anterior portion was smelling slightly.      This eel was under
observation until the 13th April, when putrefaction had considerably
advanced.    While under observation the eel was kept in water which
 varied from 48—52" F.        I may add that the blood and peritoneal
<U+FB02>uid were examined immediately after death, and that though small
bacilli were fairly abundant in the lymph, it was impossible to dis
cover any organisms in the blood. In this eel the muscular irritability
lasted in some of the muscles for nearly eighty-two hours after death.
As a contrast to this above experiment,         I may describe shortly
another.
    (3.) On the 6th April, an eel, also about 18 inches in length, which
was killed by an electrical shock from a Holtz machine, passed imme
diately into rigor—what might be called “cataleptic rigor.” The
posterior half—in which there is no body-cavity—was sterilised (by
placing it for a short time in a 5 per cent. solution of phenol) and
then introduced with the usual antiseptic precautions into a jar of
sterilised distilled water. The rigor still (June 16th) continues on
this portion (the posterior half) of the eel, while the anterior half,
which was introduced into a 5 per cent. solution of phenol after the
'rigor had disawea'red, is now quite limp and soft.
    From these experiments it may be inferred that under ordinary
conditions there is an intimate relation between loss of irritability
and the setting in of rigor, and that rigor vanishes as the bacteria
invade the tissues.
                   3. The Time at which Rigor appears.
    Under ordinary circumstances the setting in of rigor in the various
kinds of <U+FB01>sh seems to depend on the amount of irritability of the
muscles at death.       In all probability it might be possible to dis
cover when the rigor would come on by determining the amount
of free acid in the muscles; in other words, there is a relation
 between the appearance of the rigor and the amount of catabolic
 material in the muscles at death.      This seems to vary in an unac
 countable way; e.g., if three two-year-old trout of as nearly as

1887.]                and its Relation to Putrefaction.                     443
possible the same size, which have been living under as nearly as
possible identical conditions since the day of hatching, are captured
at the same moment while lying quietly in the corner of a tank, and
allowed to die in the landing net, the rigor may appear in one (A)
15 minutes after death, in another (B) 30' minutes, and in the third
(C) 40 minutes after death. We must suppose that this variation
results either from the condition of the muscles at death, or from the
in<U+FB02>uence of the nervous system.
    If at death the muscles of (C) contained (owing to the oxygenation
of the blood continuing longer) less bye-products than (A), it might
be possible to understand why the time at which the rigor set in
differed. Again, if in (A) the nervous system continued to produce
muscular contractions longer than in (C), i.e., led to the more com
plete exhaustion of the muscles of (A) than (C), the difference might
be easily understood.       It is of course di<U+FB02>icult, if not impossible, to
determine which (if either) of these explanations is thecorrect One,
but that they may both have some in<U+FB02>uence in the result‘ma'y be in
ferred from the following facts. (1.) If two trout are taken from the
water at the same time, and one is left with its gills freely open in
the landing net, while in the other the gills are kept <U+FB01>rmly closed by
an elastic band, the one with the gill-covers extended will die, it may
be 20 minutes before the other,"E but will be 30 to 40 minutes later in
becoming rigid, the reason apparently being that the closed gill-covers
prevent the evaporation from the gill-chamber, and the consequent
increase in temperature and loss of function of the gill-<U+FB01>laments.
(2.) If two trout are taken from the water at the same time, the one
allowed to die in the landing net, while the other is at once killed and
pithed, the rigor sets in in the former several hours (4—8) sooner
than in the latter, i.e., it is later in appearing in the <U+FB01>sh in which the
brain has been destroyed.
    Although in some cases it is di<U+FB02>icult to account for the time at
which the rigor sets in, fairly satisfactory explanations can be given
 in others. It is well known that most <U+FB01>sh can live for months with
                                                                “
out food. In fact <U+FB01>sh in con<U+FB01>nement often appear to thrive ” best
 when not fed, they are less sensitive and less liable to suffer from
 disease.   Even in a wild state <U+FB01>sh seem to all but give up feeding for
 weeks at a time, more especially during the spawning season, and the
 chief diiference between under-fed and well-fed <U+FB01>sh appears to be that
 in the former there is little or no growth, and the spawning period is
 delayed or the formation and maturation of the roe and milt are
arrested.     But although many <U+FB01>sh are capable of living for months
 without food in aquaria, now and then one sickens and dies without
 any apparent cause.
    * This was <U+FB01>rst pointed out to me by Sir James Maitland, Bart., when visiting
 the Howieton Fishery.

444         Dr.   J.    C.   Ewart.     On Rigor Mortis in Fish,   [June 16,
    As in warm-blooded animals which die before maturity is reached
from wasting diseases, the rigor soon appears and as rapidly goes, so
in young <U+FB01>sh which have been living in con<U+FB01>nement, the rigor is
 often weak and evanescent.
    For example, a young roach about 6 inches in length, which for
 some hours had barely managed to survive was killed, and, though
carefully watched, it was impossible to detect any rigor, and equally
impossible <U+FB01>fteen minutes after death to obtain any response from
 electric stimulation with the secondary coil at zero.      Again, as in a
 “hunted hare ” the rigor sets in rapidly and is of short duration, so
                           ”
it is in a long “ played <U+FB01>sh. On April 14th a trout was chased for
nearly half an hour before it was landed. About 20 minutes after it
was taken from the water, even although the brain was destroyed
immediately after death, the muscular irritability had disappeared,
and the rigor was complete before 30 minutes had elapsed with the
temperature at 9'5” C. Under ordinary conditions, if an active two
year-old trout (S. levenensis) about 9 inches in length is taken from
the water and left in the landing net, it usually lies perfectly still,
only giving an occasional wriggle.     During the <U+FB01>rst few minutes the
breathing movements       are  performed, but as soon as the <U+FB01>sh realises
fully it is out of the water, the mouth and gill-covers are tightly
closed—an instinct which <U+FB01>sh display, whereby they better their chance
of surviving until they again perchance reach their native element.
In from 20 to 30 minutes, probably owing to the muscles being ex
hausted, the mouth is opened and the gill-covers are widely extended,
and in a few minutes later (5—10) the <U+FB01>sh dies.        If it dies in about
25 minutes, the muscles will respond to mechanical stimulation
10 minutes after death, and 60 minutes after death all the muscles
will respond freely to electrical stimulation with the secondary coil
at 15 cm.     Gradually the muscles from before backwards lose their
irritability, and      135
                       hours after death, though the muscles near the
tail still respond  with the secondary coil at 15 cm., the muscles of the
lower jaw will only respond when the indicator               at zero, and
                                                             is
2  hours after death only the muscles of the posterior half of the trunk
retain their irritability. At 2% hours after death even the caudal
muscles require the secondary coil at 12 cm.; 10 minutes later at
8  cm., and in 15 to 20 minutes more (about       hours after death) only
                                                    3

                       is                                             Two
hours after death—before muscular irritability has gone from the
caudal muscles—the muscles of the jaw become rigid and the stiffen
ing extends backwards, overtaking the gill-covers, the pectoral,
dorsal, and pelvic <U+FB01>ns and one myotome after, until the rigor is
complete.                                                                   ,
   The time required         is   never the same, but on an average the rigor
is accomplished in           a   trout allowed to die in a landing net, and

kept afterwards in the air at a temperature of 9° 0., in from 1 to
1% hours—3 to 3%- hours after death.       “When a trout is taken from the
landing   net immediately   after all signs of life have gone, and placed
in water at the same temperature (9°C.) the irritability continues
about 10 minutes longer, and the rigor is from 15 to 20 minutes later
in setting in. When the temperature is raised to 15° C. the irrita-'
bility goes, and the rigor appears in from 20 to 30 minutes, and
reaches the caudal muscles about 45 minutes after death. At a tem
perature of 25° C. the rigor may set in in 15 minutes, and be complete
in about 25 minutes after death, while at a temperature of 30° rigor
often comes on in the trout 5 minutes after death, and vanishes 15 or
20 minutes later. At a temperature of 38° 0. heat rigor at once sets
in. As the temperature is lowered the rigor is later in making its
appearance, and a considerable period elapses between the loss of mus
cular irritability and the setting in of rigidity. At low temperatures
it is often extremely dif<U+FB01>cult to say at what time the stiffening begins.
A trout in water at 1° C. seemed to pass into rigor about 23 hours after
death; at —1° C. there was no distinct rigor 30 hours after death,
but well-marked sti<U+FB01>ness 10 hours later, but at lower temperatures
(— 7° to —20° C.) neither rigor nor stiffening could be detected in
four trout which had been respectively 2, 3, 4, and 5 days in the
freezing mixture. Further, trout which had been subjected to a tem
perature below —7° C. never sti<U+FB01>ened, even when introduced imme
diately after thawing into water at a temperature of 25° C.
   Judging from the above and other experiments, it seems that
raising the temperature either before or after death has the same
in<U+FB02>uence as muscular or nervous exhaustion in hastening the rigor.
The increased temperature quickens all the chemical ,and other
changes, and thus leads to the rapid and all but complete destruction
of the catabolic material stored up in the muscles.          On the other
hand, cold either diminishes or arrests the metabolic changes.           At a
temperature     below freezing point    the  muscles  contract,  even   when
stimulated less quickly, and hence they long retain almost unaltered
the contraction-producing material which happens to be present when
death sets in; so that when the rigor eventually appears        it,
                                                                  as already
mentioned, more resembles a mechanical coagulation of the muscles
than a strong contraction.       It dif<U+FB01>cult to determine whether the
                                    is
rigor, which appears at a low temperature (5° to ——1° (1.),            really
                                                                      is
stronger than the rigor that comes on at a high temperature. When
a trout, in which the rigor has set in at a temperature of 2° 0.,           is
placed in water at    a  temperature of 25° C., sti<U+FB01>ening vanishes in
about the same time as    itwould had the rigor set in at   a  temperature
of 20° C.
   The intensity and duration of the rigor which follows death in
warm-blooded animals from lightning has been again and again

446            Dr. J.  C. Ewart.      On Rigor Mortis       in Fish,      [June 16,
discussed. It is stated by some that rigor never appears, whilst
others assert that the rigor which follows death by lightning is often
well marked and of considerable duration. From experiments made
with <U+FB01>sh it seems that in some cases the rigor may be instantaneous
and well marked, or it may appear some time after death and be of
short duration, whilst in others it may resemble closely the rigor that
sets in after death from ordinary causes.             When a trout receives a
suf<U+FB01>ciently strong electric shock it is instantaneously killed, and at
the same moment thrown into a well-marked tetanic spasm which
passes directly and almost imperceptibly into rigor.                 A trout about
10 inches in length which received a strong shock“ by placing one
electrode under the left gill-cover and the other (a chain) round the
tail, was thrown into a pronounced spasm which closely resembled a
heat rigor; the lower jaw was depressed, the gill-covers widely opened,
the <U+FB01>ns fully extended, and the trunk strongly arched. After the
shock the gill-covers and tail quivered two or three times, and in
about <U+FB01>ve minutes the muscles lost their irritability, and in three
minutes more were strongly acid. Ten minutes after the shock the
<U+FB01>ns became if possible more extended than before; this further
extension indicating probably the passage of the tetanic spasm into a
true rigor.
    In all the experiments when a suf<U+FB01>ciently strong current was used
the result was the same, but on several occasions, though the current
was strong enough to cause death, the muscles recovered from the
tetanic spasm, and rigor set in about one hour and twenty minutes after
wards.       On other occasions, though the <U+FB01>sh was thrown into a strong
spasm and seemed dead, there was in from ten to <U+FB01>fteen minutes com
 plete recovery. When <U+FB01>sh, which had not only been killed by the
 shock, but had apparently also passed into a strong rigor, received
several additional shocks not later than thirty minutes after the <U+FB01>rst,
 the rigor disappeared, and although the muscles failed to recover their
 irritability, rigor did not again set in for nearly an hour. This seems
 to con<U+FB01>rm what has already been observed by others, that rigor up to
a certain limit may be broken down and kept at bay for some time.
 The breaking down of the rigor may be accounted for by supposing
 that only a certain proportion of the <U+FB01>bres had stiffened, or that
coagulation had been incomplete.               It was especially noticed that
 when the muscles recovered from the <U+FB01>rst tetanic spasm in <U+FB01>sh which
 had been killed, it was impossible to bring on a second spasm suf<U+FB01>
 ciently strong to pass directly into rigor, and further that the spasm
 which appeared in <U+FB01>sh stimulated after death was never so well
 marked as in <U+FB01>sh which were simply under the in<U+FB02>uence of ether.

 Nevertheless,       when both the brain and spinal cord had been de
 stroyed, the      spasm was suf<U+FB01>ciently strong to pass directly into rigor,
 showing that however much the peripheral nerves were concerned,
 “ oataleptic rigor ” was possible without the central nervous
                                                                                  system.
    It has always been extremely di<U+FB02>icult to account for partial cata
 leptic rigors, such as sometimes occur in the battle<U+FB01>eld from gunshot
 wounds. It has been supposed by Falk and others that these obscure
 rigors result from injury of the spinal cord.                   I  had no dif<U+FB01>culty in
 producing      partial   rigors   in  <U+FB01>sh,    e.g., when    one   electrode  was intro
 duced   into   the  brain  of  a <U+FB01>sh,  and     another   into the   muscles   half along
 the lateral line, the anterior half of the <U+FB01>sh was thrown into strong
 rigor, from which there was no recovery, while the rest of the <U+FB01>sh
remained quite limp for <U+FB01>ve hours after death.                     Before the posterior
half  of  the    <U+FB01>sh  had    become     stiff,  the   rigor  had   all but disappeared
from the anterior half ; the posterior half remaining rigid for nearly
twelve hours. In the same way, in a <U+FB01>sh in which the brain and
spinal cord had been destroyed, the posterior half could be thrown
into rigor which almost vanished before the anterior half became rigid.
Hence we may suppose that in partial rigor a strong tetanic spasm
has been produced directly in<U+FB02>uencing the muscles, or by injury of
the nerves or the nerve-centres by which a particular group of muscles
is controlled.       1 may mention that in several instances the electric
current was seen to <U+FB02>ash along the surface of the skin, and that when
this happened there was often marked pigmentation of the one side,
while the other remained pale, and further the muscles under the
darkened skin were often quite rigid, while those under the unaltered
skin remained for a time elastic and extensible.
    The in<U+FB02>uence of Faradaic currents and of often repeated continuous
currents was very marked. A trout, e.g., in which after death <U+FB01>rst
the brain and afterwards the spinal cord were stimulated, was thrown
into spasms which became weaker and weaker until, 10 minutes after
death, no response was obtained.                 In this case the rigor set in 20
minutes after death, and 20 minutes later it had extended to the
caudal muscles.           The appearance and nature of the rigor were
always directly related to the previous exhaustion produced in the
muscles.
    The effect of animal electricity seems to correspond to that of
ordinary electricity, except that in <U+FB01>sh killed by electricity from
electric organs the rigor seems later in setting in. For example, in
two small roach killed by the electric eel (Gymnotus electricus) in the
insect house of the Zoological Gardens, London, on the 21st March,
and kept under observation in water at a temperature of 45° F., no
distinct rigor had set in twelve hours afterwards.* Two roach killed
on March 31st about 5 P.M., after receiving numerous weak shocks

from the apparently exhausted electric organs, began to stiffen 10
hours afterwards, and were quite rigid 11% hours afterwards, the
temperature varying from 50—114!o F. On the 3rd April two other
roach were “struck ” when the <U+FB01>sh was vigorous, one was killed by
the <U+FB01>rst shock, the other after receiving two shocks, and both were
quite rigid 5% hours afterwards.         We thus see that the setting in of
the rigor is related to the strength of the shock received, but that
even when the shock is strong enough to cause instantaneous death
the rigor is delayed for several hours.         The advantages of being able
to kill the <U+FB01>sh instantaneously without producing immediate rigor is
evident enough.         It would he often uncomfortable if not impossible
for Gymnotus (and still more for the small-mouthed torpedo) to
swallow a <U+FB01>sh in strong rigor, and yet unless the <U+FB01>sh were suf<U+FB01>ciently
“ numbed ” they would readily escape from their sluggish destroyers.
It may be mentioned that a trout which had been pithed immediately
after death and placed in arti<U+FB01>cial gastric juice at a temperature of
100° F., became rigid in less than a minute, and the rigor com
pletely disappeared 35 minutes later. A similar <U+FB01>sh in water at the
same temperature became at once rigid, but the rigidity persisted
for an hour and ten minutes.
    Experiments were made to determine the in<U+FB02>uence of acid, alkaline,
and other solutions in bringing on and keeping back rigor.                   Salt
solution, as is well known, prevents rigor setting in in proportion to
its coming into contact with the muscles.           Alkaline and septic solu
tions seem to have no in<U+FB02>uence either way, while acid and corrosive
solutions seem to hasten its appearance, but the latter only to a limited
extent.     Generally speaking, whatever tended to in<U+FB02>uence the rigor
in<U+FB02>uenced the irritability of the muscles, but at low temperatures
there was no relation between the disappearance of the irritability
 and the setting in of the rigor.        The muscles lost beyond recovery
 their irritability in the trout when the temperature was kept for a
 few minutes at —70° 0., but while this temperature was maintained
 no rigor appeared, and, as mentioned above, <U+FB01>sh which were kept
 under ~70° C. for several days never became rigid when removed
 from the freezing mixture; in some cases, however, they seemed to
 become slightly <U+FB01>rmer—the continued freezing probably so alters the
 tissues that the usual coagulation or sti<U+FB01>ening is rendered impossible.
                             4. The Duration of Rigor.
     There is, as generally believed under ordinary circumstances, a
 close relation between the duration        of a rigor and the time at which
 it sets in ; i.e., if a rigor sets in half an hour after death, it is not likely
  to last long, while if it appears twelve hours after death, there is a
  probability that it will continue for several hours. On the other hand,

1887                 and its Relation to Putrefaction.                 449
there does not seem to he usually an intimate relation between the
apparent intensity and the duration, for a short-lived rigor produced
at a high temperature may look most pronounced, while a <U+FB01>sh
in a strong rigor (which may last for twenty-four hours or more)
has often neither the gill-covers nor <U+FB01>ns extended, nor the body dis
tinctly arched.    We must suppose that there is some relation between
the duration of the rigor and the condition of the muscles when it
sets in.    If before the rigor appears the latent energy of the muscles
has been all but exhausted, either before or after death, naturally or
arti<U+FB01>cially, the rigor though well marked will be of short duration,
while on the other hand if a considerable amount of rigor-producing
material is left when the stiffening supervenes, the rigor, though not
strikingly resembling a tetanic spasm, will be more intense and more
persistent.
    As the rigor comes on, all the muscles shorten (or contract), the
extensors usually overcoming the <U+FB02>exors and the muscles of one side
 (or probably the red muscles of one side) overcoming the muscles of
the other, and thus leading to arching or lateral curvature of the
trunk. This curving is sometimes so intense that a <U+FB01>sh 10 inches in
length may form the arc of a circle little over 6 inches in diameter.
 Up to a certain time after the rigor sets in it may, either by electrical
 stimulation or mechanically, be broken down, not once, but several
 times; but the oftener the coming on of the rigor is interfered with,
 the <U+FB01>nal rigor is the weaker and the less persistent.      Apparently at
ordinary temperatures there is a regular order, not only in the sti<U+FB01>en
 ing of the various groups of muscles, but also of the various bundles
 of the individual muscles.     If this is the case, the alternate appear
ance and disappearance of the rigor may, as already indicated, be
 accounted for by saying that when a partial rigor is broken down, the
 sti<U+FB01>ening of certain muscles or portions of muscles has been arrested
 or destroyed, and when the rigor sets in again new muscles or muscular
 bundles have sti<U+FB02>'ened, while those in which the rigor had previously
  appeared either remain limp or have their rigidity completed. When
 rigor which has been fully established in isolated muscles or groups
 of muscles is destroyed, it never reappears.    I  have not yet succeeded
 in recording in a satisfactory manner the strength of the rigor under
 di<U+FB02>'erent conditions, but from the results already obtained, it appears
 the more rapidly the rigor comes on the more closely it resembles an
 ordinary muscle contraction.

  mentioned that in <U+FB01>sh, as in other vertebrates, as the rigor comes on
  there is a rise in temperature, and the reaction changes often
  rapidly from slightly alkaline or neutral to distinctly acid. In a

 trout about     10 inches in length the temperature during life was
 10' 15° C., the temperature of the water being 9° (1, and the air 93° C.
  After death the temperature fell to 95", but as soon as the rigor had
  set in, the temperature of the muscles rose rapidly, reaching when the
  rigor was all but completed 103° C. Ten minutes after the rigor had
  been completed the temperature was 10'2", and it gradually fell until
  it reached 9° 0., forty-<U+FB01>ve minutes after the maximum had been
  reached.    In this <U+FB01>sh rigor began to disappear two hours after death,
  and as the rigidity vanished the temperature again rose, being 10° C.
 three hours after death, 10'05° when the rigor, four hours after death,
 had vanished from the anterior third of the <U+FB01>sh, and 1003" when only
 the muscles of the tail continued rigid, when the <U+FB01>sh became quite
 limp; six hours after death the temperature was again 9° C. As
 putrefaction proceeded the temperature again rose to 10° 0., and it
 varied between 95° C. and 10° C. for two days, after which it was
 the same as the temperature of the laboratory.         The acidity increased
 as the rigor came on, and then gradually diminished until the muscles
 were neutral.     As putrefaction advanced the tissues became decidedly
alkaline.
    The rigor is least persistent in <U+FB01>sh which die in an exhausted con
dition at a high temperature.            If an exhausted trout is placed
 immediately after death in water at a temperature of 35° C., rigor
appears in from 3 to 10 minutes and disappears             in from 15 to 30‘
minutes, i.e., at the most 40 minutes after death.
    If a trout is killed and pithed and then introduced into water at a
temperature of 35° C., the rigor appears in from 10 to 15 minutes,
and persists from 50 minutes to 1 hour.         In a <U+FB01>sh treated in the same
way    at a temperature   of 25° C., rigor appears in from 60 to 65 minutes,
and persists for 2% to 3 hours; while a similar trout placed in water
at 15° C. does not begin to sti<U+FB01>en for 5 hours, and the rigor may only
be completed 7 hours after death, and begin to pass 0E about 20 hours
after death.     The nervous system has doubtless considerable in<U+FB02>uence
in determining the length of the rigor, as it has in deciding its time
of setting in. If an active trout (A) is carefully captured and allowed
to die in the landing-net, which when undisturbed it usually does,
without a struggle ; and if when all signs of life in (A) have vanished,
a second trout (B) is secured and at once killed and the brain and
spinal cord destroyed; in (A) the rigor may begin to disappear 2 hours
after it has been completed, and may only last altogether 7 or 8 hours,
while in (B) it may last at least 24 hours.        When the brain only is
destroyed it disappears from 1 to 1% hours sooner, the temperature
being from 9——10o C.
    The di<U+FB01>erence of the duration of the rigor in <U+FB01>sh which are
allowed to die and in <U+FB01>sh which are knocked on the head or have both
brain and spinal cord destroyed is well marked at all temperatures above

 5° 0., but at temperatures below 5° 0. the difference is less evident,
 the cold serving either to paralyse the nervous system or to prevent
 the muscles responding to the weak stimulations which reach them.
    If two <U+FB01>sh, one (A) with brain and cord destroyed, the other (B)
 with both intact (B having been allowed to die slowly in the net), are
 placed in water at a temperature of 25° 0., the rigor in (A) persists
for 2% to 3 hours, while in (B) it vanishes in 1% to 2 hours. If two
 similar <U+FB01>sh are kept under observation at a temperature of 5° 0., in
 the pithed specimen the rigor may last three days, while in the other
 it may not last 48 hours. As it is impossible to suppose any vital
 changes take place after the rigor appears, its duration must depend
 on the condition the muscles are in when they become rigid, so that
 we must account for rigor in pithed <U+FB01>sh persisting longer than in <U+FB01>sh
allowed to die naturally, in the same way as we account for rigor
 setting in at different times in <U+FB01>sh di<U+FB01>'erently treated.
    There is little to add to what has been already said as to the
 in<U+FB02>uence of temperature in driving off or maintaining rigor.          In
 unpithed <U+FB01>sh the rigor at a temperature of 35° 0. may only last 30
 minutes, at 25° 0. it may last 5 hours; at 15° 0. it may persist for
24: hours; at 10° 0. 36 hours; at 5° 0. 46 hours; at 1° 0. three
 days. At —2° C. it continues unchanged for an inde<U+FB01>nite time. On
 the other hand, in <U+FB01>sh which after the rigor had set in were kept for
vseveral days at a temperature between —7° 0. and —20° 0., the rigor
 disappeared before the thawing was completed.
    Perhaps the rigor was destroyed by alterations produced in the
 muscular <U+FB01>bres during freezing. It was certainly not owing to the
direct contact of the salt and ice freezing mixture, for the same
 results were obtained when <U+FB01>sh were frozen in air, and in fresh water
in stoppered bottles. That the rigor persists until the <U+FB01>sh are thawed
 does not seem probable, because it persists for some time after thawing
 in <U+FB01>sh which have been for ten days at —2° 0., and true rigor never
appears in <U+FB01>sh which have been kept for several days below -—7° 0.
    The duration of rigor which occurs after death from an electric
.shock varies considerably, the variation evidently depending either
-on the direct in<U+FB02>uence the charge has had on the muscles or on the
condition of the central nervous system after the shock. In a trout
 which was killed and thrown into instantaneous cataleptic rigor
at one and the same moment, the rigor began to disappear from
 the jaw and gill-covers 7% hours afterwards, and 16 hours later
it had completely passed off. In another trout in which only
the anterior half was stimulated, the rigor had passed off 9 hours
afterwards, about 3 hours after the rigor appeared in the pos
terior unstimulated portion.         Conversely when the shock was
passed through the posterior half of a trout, the rigor continued
 until 8%; hours after death, while the rigor in the anterior half,

452          Dr.    J.   C. Ewart.   On Rigor Mortis in Fish,       [June 16,
which was completed 6 hours after death, lasted 11 hours, the
order of appearance and disappearance in this case being practically
reversed.
  In          in which one electrode was in contact with the skin
       a trout,
while the other was in the water, the <U+FB01>sh was thrown into a strong
spasm, but not instantaneously killed. The skin of both sides behind
the point of contact of the electrode (which was near the head)
became deeply pigmented, the jaws and gill-covers continued to
mcve at intervals for 30 minutes, after which there were no signs of
life.   The tetanic spasm seemed to pass off to a certain extent, but
as soon as the gill-covers stopped acting, the muscular irritability
was lost, and a strong rigor set in which lasted for nearly 15 hours.
    Another trout, which was tetanised and killed by an electric shock,
recovered from the spasm and passed into a rigor             hours after
                                                             22L
wards, which only lasted      hours.
                               7
   Another trout, which was killed, but not permanently tetanised by
the <U+FB01>rst shock,-received seven other shocks, some of them of great
intensity.   In less than an hour after the <U+FB01>rst shock rigor set in, but
it was of short duration, for in 20 minutes after the stiffening
appeared the jaw and gill-covers were relaxed, and the whole <U+FB01>sh was
soft and limp      1%;
                   hours after death.
   It may be taken for granted, from the experiments made, that the
prolonged rigor of pithed <U+FB01>sh       closely related with the destruction
                                     is
of the central nervous system, but       does not necessarily follow that
                                          it
the strength of   the rigor in <U+FB01>sh, instantaneously killed and sti<U+FB01>ened
by an electric shock, has the same explanation.           It     doubtless
                                                                   is
possible that a single strong shock may, by destroying the nervous
apparatus, produce the same results as pithing, but     it   also possible
                                                             is
that the appearance and duration of the rigor in <U+FB01>sh killed by
electricity may be largely in<U+FB02>uenced by chemical changes in the
muscles.
  The observations made as to the appearance and duration of rigor
in the trout have been con<U+FB01>rmed by control experiments on other
<U+FB01>sh. It will be suf<U+FB01>cient in the meantime, to refer to the behaviour
of the perch (Perca <U+FB02>uviatilis), roach (Lenoiscus rntilus), and eel
(Anguilla vulgaris), under conditions similar to some of those above
mentioned.
   In a roach, which died in an exhausted condition, there was no
response to mechanical stimulation, and 30 minutes after death only
a weak response at break, with the secondary coil at 00 cm.    It was
almost impossible to say either when the rigor set in or disappeared,
and four hours after death the muscles of the trunk were alkaline,
and contained bacteria. A similar roach, which was killed by a blow
on the head and afterwards pithed, responded freely to mechanical
stimulation for hour and 20 minutes. At <U+FB01>rst the movements were

vigorous, e.g., when held in the vertical position half aii hour after
death, all the swimming movements were repeated.             At 1 hour and
40 minutes after death the muscles responded with the secondary coil
at 15 cm., and they still responded 9 hours afterwards with the
secondary coil at 0'0 cm. Soon after the irritability of the muscles
was lost, rigor set in, and extended. slowly backwards without produc
ing very marked extension of the <U+FB01>ns, and was completed about
19 hours after death.         The rigor persisted unaltered for 11 hours,
when it slowly vanished in the same order as it appeared, leaving the
anterior two-thirds of the <U+FB01>sh quite <U+FB02>exible about 36 hours after death,
but remaining in the posterior third for nearly 7 hours longer. The
temperature in both cases varied from 11° C. to 12° C.
   When a somewhat exhausted roach was placed in water at a
temperature of 35° C., the muscles rapidly lost their irritability and
the rigor set in 30 minutes after death, was well established in 45
minutes, and was disappearing 2 hours after death, and quite 01$
2 hours 45 minutes after death.
   At a temperature of 20° C. the rigor set in 1 hour and 30 minutes
after death, and had all but passed off 4 hours after death.             At
a temperature of      —l°    C. the rigor came on extremely slowly. On
placing several roach in water at a temperature of ——1° C. and taking
them out at intervals,     I came to the conclusion that in small roach the
rigor set in between 24: and 27 hours after death. In roach which
had been in water at a temperature of —1° C. for 9 days, the rigor
persisted for several hours after thawing, even when this was done
very slowly. In the perch, generally speaking, the irritability of the
muscles lasts longer the later the rigor is in appearing; e.g., in a perch
about 11 inches in length, which had been killed and pithed, the muscles
were slightly irritable 13 hours after death, and the rigor was only
fully established 9 hours later, and it had only disappeared from the
anterior two-thirds of the <U+FB01>sh 48 hours after death.            But even a
vigorous perch,    if   allowed   to  die in  the  usual way, may lose its
muscular irritability and pass into rigor 2% hours after death, and
become <U+FB02>exible again 16—18 hours after death, at a temperature of
                                                      '

   It has long been admitted that there is some relation between the
disappearance of rigor and the beginning of putrefaction, that in fact
putrefaction assists in driving away the rigor.         While endeavouring
to discover a simple means for preserving <U+FB01>sh in a fresh condition
last autumn, it occurred to me that there might be a closer relation
 between rigor and putrefaction than had hitherto been determined,
and that it might in fact be possible to prevent putrefaction by main
 taining the post-mortem rigidity of the muscles          In order to ascer

454           Dr. J.   C. Ewart.    On Rigor Mortis in Fish,       [June  16,
 tain what ground there was for entertaining this notion,        I proceeded
 to study the origin      and nature of rigor in <U+FB01>sh and other animals.
                           I
 At a very early stage learned that the longer the rigor lasted the
 longer putrefaction was delayed, and also that putrefaction set in
 quicker in <U+FB01>sh in which there was a large amount of putrescible
 matter in the alimentary canal, than in <U+FB01>sh in which the alimentary
 canal was practically empty. For studying the relation of bacteria to
 the disappearance of rigor,   I at the outset used sea <U+FB01>sh, but afterwards
 trusted chie<U+FB02>y to fresh water forms, owing to the great dif<U+FB01>culty
 in obtaining haddock and other <U+FB01>sh in a perfectly vigorous condition.
 I  soon observed that haddocks and whiting which were knocked on
 the head when captured (after the manner long practised by the
 <U+FB01>shermen who send “live” cod to Billingsgate) were longer in
 stiEening than <U+FB01>sh which were left wriggling as long as their energy
lasted in the hold of the boat. Later I found that the rigor per
 sisted longer in haddocks and whiting which were gutted immediately
after capture than in ungutted <U+FB01>sh.          It, e.g., we take six haddocks
 (about  the  same   size  and captured   on   the same <U+FB01>shing bank at or
about the same time) and, (1) leave two (Series A) to die in the
usual way (temperature 7—8° 0., (2) kill two (Series B) by
knocking on the head and then pith, and (3) kill the other two
(Series C) and both pith and gut; in Series A the rigor may
appear 10 minutes after death, but in B and C it may not set
in for 2 or 3 hours. Further, in A the rigor may have disappeared
from the trunk (the portion cosextensive              with the body-cavity)
10 hours after death, while in B it may persist for 13 hours, and
in G for 20 hours, and while A might be quite limp 21 hours after
death, B might continue rigid for 25 hours and C for 30 hours after
death.
    It may be taken for granted that rigor results chie<U+FB02>y from the
formation and coagulation of myosin, and further, that the intensity
of rigor depends on the amount of myosin formed in the various
muscles.     If nearly all the myosin-forming material has been used
up before rigor appears in producing muscular contractions, compara
tively little myosin will be formed, while in <U+FB01>sh which have been
pithed (if pithing diminishes the muscular contractions) there will be
(except when the rigor is greatly delayed, as in the tail of the eel)
sufficient material left to admit of a considerable amount of myosin
appearing in the substance of the muscles.
    But after all the amount of myosin formed in any given muscle
accounts rather for the <U+FB01>rmness of the muscle during the rigor than
for the duration of the rigidity. Why does the myosin not continue
unchanged ? Why does it not, as it were, liquefy ? And why does the
rigor persist not only longer in some <U+FB01>sh than in others, but also
 longer in some parts of individual <U+FB01>sh than in others P

 1887.]              and its Relation to Putrefaction.               455
    Experiments show that the rigidity is easily overcome (1) by
alternate <U+FB02>exion and extension; (2) by raising the temperature;
(3) by freezing; (4) by the actibn of acids and alkalies; and (5) by
means of organisms. That this last cause is more important than
all the others put together might, perhaps, be inferred from the
fact that in <U+FB01>sh in which bacteria abound in the tissues at death,
either no rigor or a very weak one makes its appearance.            This
inference is con<U+FB01>rmed by the following observations and experi
ments.          A septic solution was injected into the right femoral
artery of a newly killed rabbit, the rigor, though it appeared about
the same time in the right limb as in the left, disappeared much
quicker from the right.           A large roach was killed on the 4th
February and at once ‘gutted. The muscles of the right side, imme
diately in contact with the peritoneal lining, were inoculated by        '
septic bacteria (introduced by pricking the peritoneum with a rosette
of needles <U+FB01>xed in a piece of sealing-wax) and the peritoneum covering
the left side of the body-cavity was washed with a solution of
corrosive sublimate (1 in 10,000).       The rigor was to my surprise
equally   well  marked   on  the two  sides;  but 24: hours after death,
when the rigor began to disappear, the right side became limp about
2% hours before the left, and 36 hours after death the muscles of the
right side were soft and beginning to putrefy, while those of the left
were still <U+FB01>rm; further, a piece of muscle taken from under the skin
of the right side opposite the anterior margin of the dorsal <U+FB01>n swarmed
with bacteria, while a piece of muscle from a corresponding point
on the left side contained comparatively few bacteria.            Roach
and trout, which were gutted immediately after death, and dipped for
a time in solutions of phenol (5 per cent.) and corrosive sublimate
(1 in 1,000), and afterwards introduced into sterilised water, retained
their rigor unimpaired for an inde<U+FB01>nite time. Whenever the <U+FB01>sh,
however, were transferred from the sterilised into ordinary water,
rigor began    to disappear—the passing off being always accelerated
when organisms were introduced into the water, or when the tempera
ture was raised.      Believing the rigor in the above <U+FB01>sh might be
mere stiffening produced and maintained by the action of the phenol
and corrosive sublimate solutions,     I introduced <U+FB01>sh from which the
rigor had been driven off by heat into similar solutions of phenol
and corrosive sublimate. Limp <U+FB01>sh treated in this way never became
stiff—the natural <U+FB01>rmness of the fresh muscles was simply maintained.
(4.) Eels which were thrown into instantaneous rigor by strong
electric shocks behaved in the same way. The posterior half of a
large eel (the part behind the body-cavity) in cataleptic rigor was
placed in phenol and then in sterilised water on the 8th April.        A
similar portion was introduced on the same day into sterilised'water
after the skin had been rendered aseptic by corrosive sublimate.

456          Dr.  J.  C.  Ewart.    On Rigor Mortis in     Fis/z,   [June l6,
Both specimens are still (June 16th) in well marked rigor, and in the
                                 I
muscles near the cut surface have been unable to detect any bacteria,
and the reaction of the muscles is still slightly acid.
    These and other experiments justify the conclusion that rigor,
under ordinary circumstances, is in all probability driven away by
putrefactive organisms. One of the most remarkable changes which
accompanies the disappearance        of rigor is the change of reaction of
the muscles from acid to alkaline.          As soon as the rigor begins to
lose its hold the acidity diminishes, and gradually or rapidly dis
appears; for a time the muscles are neutral, but sooner or later they
are distinctly alkaline.     The muscles around the body-cavity become
alkaline <U+FB01>rst, from these muscles the alkalinity extends outwards
towards the skin, and later extends into the muscles of the tail, but
in some cases a long interval elapses between the appearance of the
alkaline reaction in the sub-peritoneal muscles and the myotomes
situated behind the body-cavity.        A point of considerable interest is
that the reaction    of  the  muscles  under  the skin passes from acid to
alkaline before they are invaded by bacteria.            This can be readily
proved by introducing into a culture-medium a fragment of muscle
from under the skin of the trunk from which the rigor has just
gone, and which is already faintly alkaline, and as a test experiment
a similar fragment from under the peritoneum from a point as nearly
as possible opposite where the <U+FB01>rst was taken.             In the latter case
 bacteria rapidly appear, while no bacteria (if all the necessary condi
tions have been observed) will appear in the former.              By a series of
experiments    I have proved    that  while weak   solutions of hydrochloric
and sulphuric acids are incapable of preventing the putrefaction of
<U+FB01>sh, they have the power of arresting or at least greatly retarding the
 development of ordinary bacteria. Seeing that the alkaline wave
 radiates from around the body-cavity in advance of the bacteria, it is
 extremely likely that the one results from the presence of the other.
 In fact we may, until further experiments have been made, suppose
 that rigor disappears in the presence of a species of fermentation,
 that the bacteria which reach the tissues from the body-cavity manu
 facture ferment-like substances, which as they diifuse through the
 muscles drive the rigor before them, adapting the tissues on the
 way for the suitable reception and nourishment of a crop of putre
 factive bacteria in much the same way as the husbandman breaks up
 and otherwise prepares the soil before sowing his corn. In all pro
 bability the duration of the rigor partly depends on the readiness
 with which the tissues can be made alkaline, and partly on the
 amount of mechanical obstruction the bacteria have to overcome in
 the muscular <U+FB01>bres.         It is well known that gelatine and other
 culture-media, when slightly acid, or when too much dried, are
  rendered for a time altogether unsuitable for the cultivation of

1887.]                and its Relation to Putrefaction.                  45?
certain bacteria.     In the same way the muscles of certain <U+FB01>sh, either
because of their      peculiar chemical composition, or because of the
peculiar disposition and structure of the tissues composing them, lend
themselves less readily than the muscles of others to the invasion of
the putrefactive organisms.        It is well known that at even compara
tively  low  temperatures    <U+FB01>sh  rapidly putrefy when the atmosphere is
loaded with moisture, and that when the atmosphere is dry even at
fairly high temperatures putrefaction is comparatively slow, and as
dried gelatine is protected from the attacks of most organisms, by
drying <U+FB01>sh putrefactiou is arrested generally in ratio to the complete
ness of the desiccation.
   It is scarcely necessary to point out the practical bearing of this
inquiry.
   In <U+FB01>sh putrefaction, when it         once sets in, proceeds   much more
rapidly than in other vertebrates.          This being the case, <U+FB01>sh should
be used as soon as possible after the rigor disappears.           Inspectors
of <U+FB01>sh markets and <U+FB01>sh dealers have various empirical tests by which
they believe they are able to determine whether <U+FB01>sh are or are not <U+FB01>t
for food. They especially trust to the colour of the gills, the <U+FB01>rmness
and colour of the muscles, and the nature of the odour.          As a matter
of fact, it is often almost impossible to say whether a <U+FB01>sh is or is not
fresh after the rigor has disappeared. There is often a pause in the
putrefactive process (caused probably by the <U+FB01>rst crop of bacteria
being destroyed by their own bye-products).             For this reason it is
 desirable <U+FB01>sh should be used as soon as possible after the rigor has
vanished, and that <U+FB01>sh, intended for preservation (it matters little
how), should be treated, if possible, while the rigor lasts.
   I  have made numerous experiments with ice for preserving <U+FB01>sh.
It is generally alleged that <U+FB01>sh which have been preserved for some
time in a frozen state have lost much of their <U+FB02>avour. This            I <U+FB01>nd
depends    partly  on  when   the   freezing  is e<U+FB01>ected  and  partly on  the
temperature maintained.         Fish which are frozen after the rigor has
gone have either very little <U+FB02>avour or they are tainted with offensive
 septic products.     But <U+FB01>sh which have been frozen before rigor sets in
 (which   have probably   never stiffened) are equally without <U+FB02>avour, and
they rapidly   soften  and disintegrate when raised to ordinary tempera
tures.    On the other hand, <U+FB01>sh which are frozen immediately after
the rigor sets in remain almost unaltered, and when cooked can
scarcely be distinguished from fresh <U+FB01>sh unless the temperature has
been unnecessarily low.        The most perfect results were obtained by
keeping <U+FB01>sh (both salt and fresh water) at a temperature varying
from —1° to —2° 0. Haddocks which were pithed and gutted and
preserved in water-tight insulated chambers at a temperature of — 2° 0.

were <U+FB01>rmer and better <U+FB02>avoured than ungutted <U+FB01>sh only ten hours out

of the water. For    some reason not easily understood, the <U+FB01>sh preserved
in water   at —1° C. were <U+FB01>rmer and better      in every way than <U+FB01>sh at
the same temperature in boxes from which the water escaped as the
ice melted. Fish intended for drying and pickling, i.e., for preserving
for a long period, should also be treated before or as soon as possible
after the rigor goes.    When a <U+FB01>sh has once begun to disintegrate it
is impossible to restore the original freshness, and unless all the
<U+FB02>avours are destroyed during the preserving process the results of
previous decomposition can easily be detected.       Some <U+FB01>sh, as curers
well know, are incapable of being preserved even with salt, e.g., <U+FB01>sh
which have died struggling in the water entangled in gill nets are
dif<U+FB01>cult to preserve, because under these conditions, as experiments
prove (probably in consequence of the acid reaction thus determined),
no distinct rigor ever sets in—death being at once followed by pntre
 factive changes.
    Fish hitherto have usually either been lightly salted and sun-dried,
»or after being saturated with salt pickled in strong brine.      A 20 per
cent. salt solution almost completely alters the tissues. Apparently salt
owes its preserving power to the fact that it arrests (though it fails
to destroy) putrefactive organisms by a process of desiccation—ex
tracting the <U+FB02>uids, without which growth is impossible.
    Unfortunately we are acquainted with extremely few substances
able in small quantities to arrest the growth of bacteria without
rendering the <U+FB01>sh un<U+FB01>t for food. It is extremely desirable to at least
greatly diminish the amount of salt required.       This has recently been
rendered possible by a process introduced by Mr. Sahlstrom of the
Normal Company. In this process the <U+FB01>sh are introduced into a
cylinder, and, after all the air has been removed by pumping, pressure
 (5 to 6 atmospheres) is applied to drive the preservative solution
 (which may contain salt alone, or salt along with other preserving
reagents) into the tissues.     I  have made an extensive series of ex
periments by this method, and in all cases when <U+FB01>sh in a rigid condition
were treated, succeeded in arresting putrefactive changes, either per
manently or for a limited period according to the strength of the
solution used.
    This inquiry throws some light on another question which has long
been discussed, viz., whether line-caught <U+FB01>sh are preferable to <U+FB01>sh
taken by the beam trawl. In order <U+FB01>nally to settle this question, it is
only necessary to ascertain whether the rigor disappears quicker in
the one case than in the other.     I have already mentioned that a line
caught haddock, which has been killed and pithed the moment it leaves
the water, may at a temperature of 8° 0. remain sti<U+FB02>f for 30 hours, i.e.,
putrefaction may be retarded from 25—30 hours. On the other hand
haddocks, captured by a 25-feet beam trawl which had only been two
hours at work (large trawls are often down for six hours), even when

1887.]       Electrochemical    Efects  on Magnetiaing  Iron.         459
killed and pithed immediately after taken from the net, may pass into
rigor in 30 minutes and be again quite limp 6 hours after death.
Sometimes, however, the rigor may not set in for 2 hours after the <U+FB01>sh
are landed, and it may continue for 17 hours, the di<U+FB01>erence doubtless
resulting partly from the difference in the time the <U+FB01>sh were in the
trawl net, and partly from the energy expended in attempting to
escape, or in endeavouring to maintain the respiratory movements
under somewhat dif<U+FB01>cult circumstances.        It may therefore be a<U+FB02>irmed
that though the rigor may persist as long or nearly as long in some
trawled <U+FB01>sh as in <U+FB01>sh caught with a line, in most cases the rigor
disappears sooner from trawled than from line-caught <U+FB01>sh; in other
words, putrefaction sets in sooner as a rule in <U+FB01>sh taken by the trawl
than in <U+FB01>sh taken by the line, granting, of course, that the line <U+FB01>sh
are pithed and gutted as soon as they leave the water.
   I have. in conclusion, to express my gratitude to Professor Burden
Sanderson and Mr. Gotch for valuable assistance rendered with the
experiments made in the Oxford Physiological Laboratory.         I am also
indebted to Professor Tait for kindly allowing Mr. Lindsay, of the
Natural Philosophy Laboratory in the University of Edinburgh, to
assist with the electrical experiments.        I am further indebted to

XXVI.     “ Electrochemical       Effects on Magnetising Iron.” By
     THOMAS ANDREWS,        F.R.S.E.,  F.C.S.    Communicated by Pro
     fessor G. G. STOKES, F.R.S. Received June 2, 1887.
   Having for many years past been engaged in researches relating
to the various aspects of the corrosion and oxidation of metals,
nearly two years ago it occurred to me to investigate the probable
e<U+FB01>ect of magnetisation on the relative electrochemical position of a
pair of bright iron bars, one magnetised by a coil, the other un
magnetised, when thus simultaneously exposed in circuit, in a suit~
able apparatus, to the action of various powerful oxidising agents
and saline solutions.     I   accordingly specially prepared numerous
long polished rods of soft wrought scrap iron 0.261 inch diameter,
for use in the investigation.    I  was not able to commence the pre
liminary  observations  until  towards   the end of 1885, and, after much
consideration and various trials then made, decided to adopt the
following method of experimentation as perhaps calculated to yield
the most delicate and accurate results; pressure of other work has,
however, delayed the earlier completion of the work.          The general

    Two   pieces     were adjacently cut from a long <U+FB01>nely polished iron
 rod, so that     the pieces might as near as practicable be of identical
 chemical composition and molecular constitution.       After being <U+FB01>rmly
 placed and adjusted as to equal length, &c.,   in  the wooden supporting
 frame W, they were immersed to an exactly equal depth in the solu
 tion contained in the U-tube, which latter was also rigidly supported
 by a stand. In the duplex experiments made with apparatus <U+FB01>g. 2,
 the U-tube was immersed in a large volume, four pints, of cold water
 to ensure equal temperature conditions during experimentation for the
 respective solutions in each limb, the cold water being maintained in
 steady circulation around the tubes. The rods were connected in circuit
 with a sensitive galvanometer, having a resistance of 521 ohms, and
  of known calibration, the galvanometer being under constant tele
  scopic observation during the experiments, and the normal galvanic
  action between the two bars previously observed in every experiment.
  Considerable care was requisite to obtain this accurately, so as not
  practically to interfere with the subsequent results seemingly due to
  magnetic in<U+FB02>uences. A removable coil 0, of stout silk-covered copper
  wire (No. 16 gauge) mounted on a large wooden bobbin 6 inches long
  enclosed the limb A of the U-tube, or when using apparatus <U+FB01>g. 2,

the coil surrounding the upper portion of the long bar requiring
magnetisation. The coil used in the experimentswith apparatus <U+FB01>g. 1
consisted of six depths or wraps of the insulated copper wire, each
wrap having 81 turns, making in the whole a coil of 486 convolutions.
The other coil employed in the experiments with apparatus <U+FB01>g. 2 was
of similar construction, but had ten depths of insulated copper wire of
the same thickness, constituting a coil with a total of about 750 con
volutions.
    A single cell bichromate battery, easily put in or out of operation,
was attached to the coil, and the battery was recharged with the same
strength of solution for each observation. After a suitable time had
been allowed in each experiment for steady galvanic equilibrium to be
established between the two iron rods, in the solution in the tubes,
which took place at periods varying with the nature of the solution,
the coil was put into operation. In the experiments with <U+FB01>g. 2 the
end of the bar in the solution was the S seeking pole. It was most
interesting to observe the result. The rod A thus magnetised in most
 of the solutions became the metal positive, the galvanometer indicating
its steadily increasing electrochemical positive position compared with
that of the unmagnetised bar B.          Repeated careful experimentation
appeared    to  indicate  that  the increased    positivity of the rod A ob
served under these conditions was due to the increased action of the
acid or saline solution on the iron rod which was under magnetic
 in<U+FB02>uence, owing to which it became surrounded by a slightly stronger
 saline solution than the other unmagnetised rod B, which was appa
 rently less acted upon. In some cases in the more powerfully acid
 solutions, Table A, columns 4, 5, 7, 8, a kind of maximum point
 seemed to be generally reached, and after the more violent action of
 the acid had expended itself, a reduction of the E.M.F. between the
 rods was generally noticed as the solution in the B-tubc gradually
 approached an equilibrium of composition compared with the solution
 in the A limb of the U-tube, and subsequently a reverse action in
 some cases was observed.       The unmagnetised rod B appeared to be
 less rapidly acted upon than the one under magnetic in<U+FB02>uence.           On
 magnetisation of the bar the above full effect on the galvanometer was
  not always of an instantaneous character, though a short time only
 appeared requisite for its development.        The solutions employed are
  given  in Table  A,  and  the results therein  recorded were derived from
 a series of constant observations, a comparison in some instances being
  afforded between the respective effects obtained by the two forms of
 apparatus employed.
     It may be noticed that a fresh pair of the iron rods, cut adja
 cently from a long polished rod, were used for each experiment, and
  123 pairs were used in course of this part of the investigation, the
  whole of the experiments being many times repeated to ensure

  accuracy, the results recorded being the average of many observa
  tions. In some instances somewhat higher results were noticed.
      It is almost impossible to obtain two pieces of iron (even when
  forming adjacent parts of one polished rod) which when in solution
  are devoid of some slight galvanic action between themselves; but
  the greatest care was exercised in the special preparation of the iron
  used, so that this variation might be reduced to a minimum.
     To ensure success in the experiments it was found essential that the
  iron bars should possess an excellent polished surface, free from mag
 netic or other oxide or impurities; the solutions were also concen
 trated, and both discrimination and manipulative skill were requisite
 in obtaining the practical galvanic equilibrium of the bars at com
 mencement.         The time needed to ensure this seemed to vary consider
 ably    with  di<U+FB02>’erent  solutions according to circumstances. A sensitive
 galvanometer       was   also  a requisite of success in these observations,
 and telescopic readings were necessary, as in some cases the effects
 were small.
     It seems desirable here to add a few remarks on the possible
 in<U+FB02>uence of temperature on the reactions, and to state the means
 used in the endeavour to minimise errors from this source.              In con
 ducting the experiments,           I  should have preferred using greater
battery power, but employed only one bichromate cell; the wire of
the coil was also of considerable thickness to prevent undue heating
from resistance. The centre of the wooden coil bobbin was also about
    inch in thickness, so as to act as a central non-conductor.            More
over, an air space was allowed of i} inch between the wooden centre
of the coil and the enclosed limb of the U-tube.              The other limb for
the unmagnetised bar was enclosed by another coil, which, when not
in use, acted as an external protective jacket. Notwithstanding these
precautions, there was a slight increase of temperature in the interior
of the coil C.       Thermometers inserted in test solutions, one in each
limb, gave an average difference of about 1° Fahrenheit at the end of
an hour, this increase of temperature in the solution in the coil tube
being, however, very gradual.               It would be untenable to state that
this    difference  of temperature,    arising   from the action of the coil, did
not to some slight         extent   in<U+FB02>uence    the  results of the experiments
with apparatus <U+FB01>g. 1; but the results obtained therewith could
certainly not be regarded as due only to differences of temperature
conditions between the two tubes.               Most of the experiments with
that apparatus        aiford   within  themselves     evident proof to the con
trary; thus, it will be seen, that the magnetised bar assumed a pro
minent positive position almost immediately after magnetisation, in
the case of nitric acid, before any perceptible difference of tempe
rature could obtain between the respective tubes (see Table A,
columns 6 and 7).

    Moreover, the exceptional negative position of the magnetiscd bar
under the same temperature conditions, in the case of sulphuric acid,
atfords evidence that the effect was not due to these temperature
causes.    To more clearly demonstrate, however, that the results were
mainly due to the in<U+FB02>uence of magnetisation, and acting on the kind
suggestion of Professor G. G. Stokes, it was decided to make a duplex
series of observations.    I accordingly devised the modi<U+FB01>ed form of
apparatus <U+FB01>g. 2,    which was  intended to eliminate possible sources of
error from temperature diiference, by keeping the U-tube surrounded
by a large volume of cold water during the experiments; the solution
in the respective tubes being thus maintained under equal conditions.
In comparing the results obtained with the two forms of apparatus,
it should be borne in mind that, when using the apparatus <U+FB01>g. 2, the
cold water surrounding the U-tube would have a tendency to retard
the increase of the temperature of the solutions naturally arising
from chemical combination.       Further, the coil in <U+FB01>g. 2 being at one
end of the long bar would be calculated to modify the magnetisation
of the other end of the metal in the solution, compared with its
action in <U+FB01>g. 1, where the coil almost entirely surrounded the bar:
hence in <U+FB01>g. 2, the coil was made somewhat larger to overcome this
to some extent, and the end of the bar B was shortened in expe
riments with <U+FB01>g. 2, so that this bar would be less 'liable to be a<U+FB01>ected
magnetically by the external in<U+FB02>uence of the larger coil. 1 hope that
the con<U+FB01>rmatory results obtained in the two sets of observations may
be considered as fairly satisfactory.

    The records in the above table under divisions     I were experiments
 made with apparatus, <U+FB01>g. 1, the records entered under divisions II,
 relate to observations made with apparatus, <U+FB01>g. 2.
    The records of the effects in the stronger solutions do not indicate
 the full extent of the electric action compared with that of the weaker
 solutions; because in the former case the tubes could only be par
 tially <U+FB01>lled, so as to prevent boiling over.
                               General Remarks.
    Potassium Chlorafe and Nitric Acid Solutions, Columns 1 and 2.—
 At the termination of some of these experiments, the depth of colour
 of the solution surrounding the magnetised iron was perceptibly of a
 darker shade than the colour in the tube surrounding the un
 magnetised bar, this was con<U+FB01>rmed by Eggertz’s carbon coloration
 test.
    Ferric Chloride and Nitric Acid, Column 5.--At forty minutes from
 the commencement of one experiment in apparatus <U+FB01>g. 1, the record
 was an            of 0023 volt, the magnetised bar being positive; the
 battery was then attached to a smaller coil surrounding the other
 bar B, which was then magnetised instead of the bar A, and in
 course of <U+FB01>ve minutes a reduction in the positive position of bar A
 to an extent of 0021 volt occurred.           At forty-<U+FB01>ve minutes the
battery   was  reconnected to the coil surrounding the bar A, producing
a steady increase of positive position in that bar as recorded in
 Table A, column 5.
    Aqua Regia, undiluted.—With          this reagent in <U+FB01>g. 1 no very
decided galvanic      reaction  took  place until the bar had remained
magnetised for some ten minutes, when violent eifervescence occurred
accompanied by evolution of dense reddish-brown fumes, the magne
tised bar then becoming rapidly electropositive to an extent yielding
an E.M.F. of about 0110 volt.        This position was subsequently more
or less maintained for some ten minutes, the galvanometer, however,
gradually falling to zero as the ebullition in both tubes subsided.
This was a di<U+FB01>icult experiment to make, owing to the very violent
eifervescence.
   Aqua Regia, diluted, Column 8.—Up to the commencement of the
effervescence    no perceptible difference in the colour of the solution
in the respective limbs of the U-tube was noticed ; but immediately
on the violent ebullition occurring, which took place generally about
ten minutes from commencement, the solution surrounding the mage
tised bar frequently became of a very much darker tint.               This
marked difference between the colour of the respective solutions in
the two tubes was maintained for some time, afterwards the two
solutions became apparently nearly chromatically equal.       The electro

chemical elfect appeared to be less marked when using aqua regia
containing excess of HCl.      The relative electrochemical position of
the two bars in such case being less divergent, the HCl appearing
to act somewhat as a strong diluent.
   Hydrochloric Acid and Sulphuric Acid, Columns 9 and 10.—Singular
to say, the previously described magnetochemical e<U+FB01>ects were com
paratively small when using such a powerful reagent as hydrochloric
acid alone, either concentrated (sp. gr. 1‘16) or diluted. When this
acid was employed in conjunction with concentrated solution of
potassium chlorate (Table A, column 3), the effects there recorded
appeared due rather to the oxidising agency of the evolved chloric
compounds; in the presence of magnetism, the reactions with this
electrolyte were occasionally irregular, the excess of H01 appearing
sometimes to interfere.     Sulphuric acid, conc., also seemed to behave
abnormally, though this acid does not ordinarily act strongly on iron.
The experiments with both the above acids in course of a large
number of observations, proved exceptions to the general rule. The
magnetised bar in the sulphuric acid, cone, and also in the hydro
chloric acid, diluted, became the electronegative metal, not only in
the case of H2804, when using the apparatus <U+FB01>g. 1, but also when
experimenting with the modi<U+FB01>ed form, <U+FB01>g. 2.            Occasionally, with
sulphuric acid, conc.,  the  magnetised bar  was, on  <U+FB01>rst magnetising it,
slightly electropositive for  a    few minutes only; but afterwards
became steadily negative.
   Under the conditions of experimentation, the magnetised bars in
the powerful oxidising reagents used almost invariably assumed the
electropositive position, the presence of H.NOB appearing essential
to the full development of the positive position of the bar under the
in<U+FB02>uence of magnetism. On the contrary, the magnetised baa
seemed to be the electronegative metal in H2804, conc., and also in
the HCl (diluted), as electrolytes. The two latter reagents by their
action on the metal generate gases of a reducing character. These
exceptions are not, however, averse to the principle that magnetica
tion exerts an in<U+FB02>uence on the relative electrochemical position of a
pair of iron bars, varying according to the nature of the solution and
the extent to which one of them   is   magnetised. In the above excep
tions,it   is possible that the magnetised bar assumed the negative
position consequent on its being the one more attacked, under
magnetic in<U+FB02>uences, by the reagent; thus producing a greater evolu
tion of reducing gases in the tube     A containing the magnetised bar
than in the other tube; this may perhaps explain the negative e<U+FB01>'ect.
The observations of this memoir therefore indicate that, under the
powerful and rapidly oxidising conditions described,      a   magnetised
bar becomes metal positive to an unmagnetised one, whereas in the
exceptional instances above alluded to, the electronegative effect           -

                                (Abstract)
   The   object of the paper is to disprove the present apparently
accepted idea, that the sinuses of Valsalva are mere bulgings of the
arterial walls, formed by a re<U+FB02>ex current induced by the sudden
closure of the semilunar valves.
   The existence of a re<U+FB02>ex current is shown to be impossible, and the
theory of the sudden opening and closure of the semilunar valves is
strongly opposed.
   The presence of the sinuses of Valsalva is urged as an absolute
essential to the mechanism of the heart’s action. The paper then
treats of the action of the auricle and the part played by the auricular
appendix, the latter being considered as the only part of the auricle
that sensibly and vigorously contracts.
   The causes of the <U+FB01>rst sound of the heart are next alluded to, and
the theory that the closure and vibration of the tricuspid and mitral
valves assist in its production is refuted. The action of the ventricle
and the mode of the injectibn of its contents into the aorta is dwelt
upon at some length.
   The latter part of the paper is devoted to the mechanism of the
pulse, and an explanation is given of the so-called dicrotism.
   The paper terminates with a summary of the chief points of the
conclusions arrived at.

    In the year 1786 Erland Samuel Bring, Professor at the University
of Lund in Sweden, discovered that by the method of Tschirnhausen
it was possible to deprive the general algebraical equation of the 5th
degree of three of its terms without solving an equation higher than
the 3rd degree.       By a well understood, however singular, academical
<U+FB01>ction, this discovery was imputed by him to one of his own pupils,
one Sven Gustaf Sommelius, and embodied in a thesis humbly sub
mitted to himself for approval by that pupil, as a preliminary to his
obtaining his degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the University.* It
seems to have been overlooked or forgotten, and was subsequently
                                                J
re-discovered many years later by Mr. errard. In a report contained
in the ‘ Proceedings of the British Association ’ for 1836, Sir William
Hamilton showed that Mr. Jerrard was mistaken in supposing that
the method was adequate to taking away more than three terms of the
equation of the 5th degree, but supplemented this somewhat unneces
sary refutation by a profound and original discussion of a question
raised by Mr. Jerrard, as to the number of variables required in
order that any system of equations of given degrees in those variables
shall admit of being satis<U+FB01>ed without solving any equationof a
degree higher than the highest of the given degrees.

degree   higher than M.      The numbers furnished by Hamilton’s
method, it is to be observed, are not minima unless a more stringent
condition than this is substituted, viz., that the system of equations
which have to be resolved in order to take away the proposed
terms shall be the simplest possible, i.e., of the lowest possible
weight and not merely of the lowest order; in the memoir in
‘Crelle’ above referred to, he has explained in what sense the
words weight and order are here employed.        He has given the name
of Hamilton’s Numbers to these relative minima (minima, i.e., in
regard to weight), for the case where the terms to be taken away
from the equation occupy consecutive places in       beginning with the it,
second.
  Mr. James Hammond                                     by the method

of relation, whereby any one of these numbers may be expressed in
terms of those that precede it: his investigation, which constitutes
its most valuable portion, will be found in the second section of this
paper.    The principal results obtained by its senior author conse
quential in great measure to Mr. Hammond’s remarkable and unex
pected discovery, refer to the proof of   theorem left undemonstrated

their differences are subject, by a mixed kind of reasoning, in the
main apodictic, but in part also founded on observation. It thus
became necessary to calculate out the 10th Hamiltonian        Number,
which contains 43 places of <U+FB01>gures. The highest number calculated
by Hamilton (the 6th) was the number 923, which comes third in
order after (the Bring number), 11 and 47 being the two intervening

disprove conclusively the presumptive law of the asymptotic branch

XXIX. “On         the Induction of the Explosive Wave and an
      Altered Gaseous Condition in an Explosive Gaseous Mixture
      by a Vibratory Movement.” By LEWIS T. WRIGHT. Com
      municated by Professor ODLING, F.R.S.           Received June 13,
      1887.
                                 (Abstract)
    The author refers to the conclusions of Berthelot and Vieille that
the phenomenon of the explosive wave is quite distinct from that of
ordinary combustion, each being marked by well-de<U+FB01>ned limits called
by them the 're'g'ime of detonation and combustion respectively.      The
transition from the one to the other is accompanied by violent vibra
tory movements.
    Mallard and Le Chatelier separate the combustion of an explosive
mixture in<U+FB02>amed at the open end of a tube, closed at the other, into
four diiferent and succeeding phases—
    (l.) Uniform   propagation of <U+FB02>ame;
    (2.) A vibratory movement; followed in       some cases by
    (3.) The explosive wave of Berthelot and Vieille.
    (4~.) Spontaneous   extinction of <U+FB02>ame.
    The author has specially studied the connexion between the vibrating
stage and the explosive wave with a certain mixture of coal gas and
 air (in large glass tubes) which sharply exhibits the various features
of the four stages described by Mallard and Le Chatelier.
    The points determined were these, that the detonating stage (explo
 sive wave) is never initiated without preceding vibratory movements
 on the part of the <U+FB02>ames.
     That with the same mixture the vibrating period is of de<U+FB01>nite
 duration culminating in the explosive wave stage.
     The necessary connexion between the two stages being proved, the
 author investigated the question whether the explosive wave condition
 is communicated layer by layer by the contact of the <U+FB02>ame itself, or
 whether the whole column of unignited gas in the tube adjacent or
 distant from the <U+FB02>ame is “induced” by the vibrating <U+FB02>ame into a
 more receptive condition which enables the chemical reaction between
 the molecules to proceed at a more rapid rate than usual.
     The phenomena exhibited by the <U+FB02>ame suggest this latter explana
 tion, and the author by the application of a weak spark test has been
 enabled to prove that the whole column of gas, either adjacent or dis
 tant from the vibrating <U+FB02>ame, is in an altered condition after being
 submitted to but a portion of the vibratory action which normally
  initiates the explosive wave.

1887.]        On a Balanoglossua Larva from the Bahamas.            473
   An electric spark of low tension not capable of igniting the unin
duced explosive mixture invariably does so, after the vibrating has
been set up.
   It is suggested that the tremor sent through the nnignited gas
synchronised some of the molecular vibrations, so that the molecules
capable of reacting perform their translatory movements in some
measure together, and that when a focus of in<U+FB02>ammation is present
more reacting molecules come into the sphere of in<U+FB02>ammation in a
given time, and therefore the rate of in<U+FB02>ammation is more rapid.

     a Balanoglossus Larva from the Bahamas’ (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’
     vol. 42, p. 146).”    By W. F. R. WELDON, M.A.         Communi
     cated by Professor M. FOSTER, Sec.R.S. Received June 16,
     1887.
   In  a paper, communicated to the Royal Society in March last,       I
described a series of Balanoglossus larvm, found by me in the Bahama
Islands.    The series extended from a larva with one pair of gill-slits
to a form resembling in many ways a normal Tornaria; but the dif
ferences between this larva and the normal European form were so
great as to induce me to believe that a process of degeneration was
going on, and that the Tornaria-like creature was the oldest, not the
youngest, of the series.
   On seeing my paper, Professor Spengel, whose researches on
Balanoglossus are well known, wrote to me, informing me that I was
altogether mistaken in my interpretation of the larvae which I had
found, and that my series belonged in fact to the normal order of
development.
   By the courtesy of Dr. Spengel   I have been enabled  to inspect his
magni<U+FB01>cent series of preparations, illustrating the whole life-history
of Balanoglossus, and so to become convinced of the truth of his
statement;    I now, therefore, take the earliest opportunity of with
drawing my previous statement, and desire to express my regret at
                                                                  ‘

   I beg also to thank Dr. Spengel most sincerely for his kindness to

XXXI. “Note on        the Anatomy of Asiatic Cholera as exempli<U+FB01>ed
        in Cases    occurring in Italy in 1886.”         By CHARLES S.
        SHERRINGTON, M.B., M.A.        Communicated by Professor M.
        FOSTER, Sec. RS.       Received June 16, 1887.
     Last summer when cholera again appeared in Italy      I  determined to
 seize the opportunity   that seemed to o<U+FB02>fer itself for re-examining the
 disease, especially with regard to some questions raised by the work
 of the previous year.
     Although, on grounds which I have already detailed in a letter to
 the Secretary of the Society, Professor Michael Foster, the conditions
 imposed by the state of the country quite precluded the carrying out
 there and then of trustworthy experiments with the living contents
 of the dejecta and of the viscera of the cholera patients, still it was
 possible to collect a satisfactory amount of anatomical material. The
 results in this direction of an expedition, a part of the expenses of
 which were generously borne by the Society, were promised to the
  Society in the letter above alluded to.        The investigation of the
 material has now been completed, and may brie<U+FB02>y be stated as
‘follows :—
     The material collected consists in all of specimens and preparations
  made from twenty-<U+FB01>ve fatal cases.       Of these cases twenty-two were
  indubitable examples     of rapidly fatal cholera asiatica. These were
  obtained exclusively out of the Province of Puglia.        The remaining
  three cases were from Venetia, and were in the opinion of myself and
  Dr. Rouse, who in Venetia assisted me, not examples of true cholera.
  At each autopsy the specimens taken for preservation and subsequent
  detailed microscopical investigation were portions of the stomach and
  intestinal canal at various points, of the thoracic and abdominal
  organs, and of the mesenteric glands.         From the contents of the
  stomach and intestine preparations for the microscope were made at
  the same time by the Ehrlich-Koch method.          From the vomit and
  dejecta of six moribund patients cover-glass preparations were also
  made in the same manner.        With regard to the hardening of the
  tissues for microscopical examination, the portions of the tissue
   preserved were at the autopsy carefully placed separately into speci
   men glasses containing absolute alcohol, and the alcohol was at the
   end of six hours renewed, the specimen being at the same time quickly
   cut into pieces never more than 3 mm. thick.      The alcohol was then
   changed at the end of twelve hours, and again at the end of twenty
   four, then not again for a week.
      The microscopical investigation has been carried on in the labora
   tory of Professor Vii-chow at Berlin; in his debt     I  stand for much
   kindness and liberality.

 1887.]           On  the Anatomy  of Asiatic Cholera.              475
    One of the main objects of the renewed inquiry was to ascertain
 the presence in, or the absence from, the anatomy of cases of cholera
 from another epidemic than the Spanish of certain appearances that
 the microscopical preparations from the Spanish epidemic of 1885 had
 presented. The appearances referred to were described in a Report
 made to the Society in June of last year, and printed in the Proceed
 ings of the Society for that year, so that it is unnecessary for me to
 repeat them here. The more so since in this year’s work I have com
 pletely failed after minute, long and repeated search, with the use of
 good lenses (new apochromatic system of Zeiss), and after employ
 ment of various methods of staining including that by which the
 Spanish preparations were coloured, to <U+FB01>nd any trace of the above
 mentioned appearances in any of the material obtained in Italy.
 Neither in the specimens of the tissues nor of the intestinal <U+FB02>uid
 post mortem, nor of the vomit or dejecta during life is any trace of
 them to be found. Any view that suggested itself of a causal con
 nexion of them with cholera must therefore meet the dil<U+FB01>culty that
 they form no constant anatomical feature of the disease.
    With regard to the presence of comma-shaped bacilli in my
material, such forms have been found in altogether thirteen of the
 cases from Puglia, although always with dif<U+FB01>culty, and seven times.
only after extremely patient and rigorous search.     The method found
most satisfactory for their detection has been that of Lo<U+FB02>ier with a
methylene-blue solution made according to the receipt given by him.
 The chief dif<U+FB01>culties of the investigation have lain in the facts, that
the comma-bacilli are among the bacilli which are earliest decolorised
by the solutions for removing the excess of stain, that the morpho
logical characters of the comma-bacilli are not so distinctive as to
make their recognition from bacilli of some other species always
certain, and that in none of my specimens have        I found them free
from admixture with other microorganisms, and in none in very great
abundance.       Having only the morphological characters of the bacilli
for  criterion, I have compared them always with specimens from pure
cultivations of Koch’s comma-bacillus freshly prepared for the purpose,
and I have only accepted them as such when they have agreed with
the latter standard form.
    Of the cases in which the comma-bacilli have been found, in three
                                                  “
they may be called “fairly numerous,” in <U+FB01>ve        sparse,” and in <U+FB01>ve
“
   very scanty.” The bacilli have never been found in any other situa
tion than in the wall of the alimentary canal, and in the wall only in
the most super<U+FB01>cial portion of the tissue, in the mucosa.
   The three cases in which they are fairly numerousare characterised
clinically by the fatal ending having supervened without any stage of
febrile reaction, and anatomically by the changes in the wall of the
intestine being con<U+FB01>ned to partial denudation from epithelium of the

 476               On the Anatomy    of Asiatic Cholera.         [June 16,
 villi, especially, to the presence of an excessive number of leucocytes
 in the meshes of the mucosa and submucosa, and to evident engorge
 ment of the portal venules.     The comma-shaped bacilli lie in the fundi
 of the tubular glands of, especially. the ileum, and in the tissue in
 which those glands are imbedded in the immediate vicinity of the
 glands. Their distribution is not uniform, but is patchy. They occur
 with various other forms of bacteria in the same situation. Generally
 of these other forms some have penetrated more deeply into the tissue
 than have the comma-bacilli; especially is this true of certain <U+FB01>ne,
 straight bacilli resembling morphologically the bacterium coli com
 mune of Escherich.
    In the other cases in which comma-bacilli are found, the signs of
 acute severe in<U+FB02>ammation are more obvious, many of the denuded
 villi are in part necrotic. Shallow sloughs occupy the surface of the
 mucous membrane, together with small extravasations and patches of
 “coagulation-necrosis.”       Here the comma-shaped     bacilli are within
 the mucosa, and with them occur a multitude of micrococci and
 bacilli of various shape and size. Although in two of these cases
                                                    I
 bacilli are to be seen in the distended venules, have in no instance
found comma-bacilli within any blood-vessel.
    Of those cases in which comma-bacilli have not been found, the
impression left upon me is that in some of them it is possible that
still further examination of a still more extended series of prepara
 tions from them might have revealed comma-bacilli in the wall of the
intestine in some of them.         They are all cases that, although of
rapidly fatal issue, had passed into a stage of febrile reaction.
    In them often the surface of the ileum and large intestine was
thickly set with little patches of super<U+FB01>cial sloughing, and micro
scopical preparations made through these areas forcibly recall prepara
tions of a mucous membrane diphtheritically in<U+FB02>amed. The attached
face of the slough is occupied frequently by an almost continuous
sheet of bacteria, and bacteria in<U+FB01>ltrate the in<U+FB02>amed submucosa, and
often the super<U+FB01>cial regions of the muscularis.        In three of these
cases micro-organisms are present in the blood-vessels, more especially
numeroust in the venules of the portal system.
    With regard to the preparations made from freshly evacuated
dejecta and vomit from living cases, the six cases examined reveal
commmbacilli in the stools in <U+FB01>ve.      There is no evidence of blood in
these <U+FB01>ve stools, but blood is mixed with the intestinal <U+FB02>uid in the
case in which no comma-bacilli are seen.        The vomit also in three of
the cases shows a small number of comma-bacilli.            In none of the
preparations   do  the  comma-bacilli make  up more than   a small fraction
of all the bacterial forms present.
    With regard _to the statement by Cohnheim that the shedding of
the intestinal epithelium is purely and merely a process setting in

1887.]                 On certain Definite Integrals.                      477
post mortem, this, which has always been denied by Virchow and
others, is negatived by the occurrence in the stools here examined of
an   abundance of epithelial cells, often very slightly differing in
appearance from the normal.              Occasionally they are coherent as
groups of four and <U+FB01>ve; there are, however, no <U+FB01>nger-shaped casts of
complete villi.
   The cases of a doubtful        nature from Venetia have not disclosed
any comma-bacilli under microscopical examination. In one of them
the ulcers present in the ileum, which to the naked eye resembled
those of enteric fever, pass deeply into the thickness of the muscular
coat of the intestine, a condition to which         I have only once seen any
close approach in Asiatic cholera.

“Note on some Experiments on the Viscosity of Ice.” By
      J. F. MAIN, M.A., D.Sc. Communicated by Prof. W. C.
      UNWIN, F.R.S.       Received April 13,—Read May 5, 1887.
   Owing to the uncertainty prevailing as to the continuous exten
sibility of ice under tensional stress, it appeared to me desirable to
institute a series of experiments directed to this point, conducted
according to the methods, and, as far as possible, with the exactness
of modern experimental testing.
   In order to eliminate the in<U+FB02>uence of regelation, the experiments
have been carried on at such low temperatures as preclude the possi
bility of any effect being produced by this cause, the highest tem
perature recorded in Experiment No. 1 being —2'6° C.; in N0. 2,
 -1'O° C.; and in N0. 3, —O'5° C. It must be remarked, moreover,
that these maximum temperatures only obtained for a very short
time, on one or two days, as will be seen from the records.
   The testing machine which         I used was constructed for me by
Herr Ingenieur Usteri-Reinacher, of Ziirich. It was on the com
pound lever principle, the ratio of the arms of the equivalent simple
lever being 1 : 20. All parts where friction could be prejudicial were
provided with knife-edges. The design of the machine is obvious
from the <U+FB01>gure, in which A represents the specimen of ice to be
tested, held by the collars at B and C.      D is an equipoise, to balance
the weights of the levers and of the vessel E, through which the
power is applied by means of shot.        F is a hand-wheel <U+FB01>xed to the
screw   G,   by means   of  which,  as  the specimen extends, the under
collar C may be lowered, so that the position of the upper collar B
and of the two levers may remain the same. An index at H shows
when the parts of the instrument are in the relative position required,
and by its motion enables a rough estimate to be formed of the
extension of the specimen.
   The temperature was rendered more equable by enclosing the appa
ratus in two wooden boxes, KL and MN.
   A delicate thermometer, graduated to tenths of a degree centigrade,
and reading from —6° C. to +6° C., was attached to the central

                           On the Viscosity  of Ice.                  493
   The ice specimen was formed by freezing water in a cylindrical
iron mould, with    a conical expansion at one end.      To obtain ice as
free as possible from included air,      I in some cases (but not in all)
boiled the water and then froze it. Afterwards it was melted in the
mould, boiled, and then allowed again to freeze.       In this way nearly
all the air was expelled, only a small core of minute bubbles up the
axis of the cylinder remaining.      In Experiment No. 1, however, these
precautions   were  not   taken, and  thus the cylinder of ice had linear
bubbles of air, radiating in horizontal straight lines from the axis of
the cylinder.    These were due to expulsion of the air from the water,
in which it was dissolved, as the latter froze in concentric cylindrical
shells from outside inwards.
   After the ice cylinder had been freed from contact with the mould,
by bathing the latter in warm water, it was passed through the
conical iron collar (C in <U+FB01>gure) which the conical expansion of the
ice <U+FB01>tted, and which had been screwed to the upper part of a wooden
frame. The other collar (B) was then attached to a moveable plate
in the wooden frame, which was capable of motion vertically and
horizontally, and, by adjusting screws, both the frame and the collar
B could be made accurately horizontal. By a small plummet the ice
cylinder was made to hang vertically, by placing small pieceslof cork
between it and the edge of the opening in B. Water was then run
into B, and, when frozen, a cylinder of ice was obtained, held above
and below in two conical collars. By the above-mentioned adjust
ments it was ensured that the cylinder of ice was perpendicular to
the surfaces of the two collars B and C.
   As the weight of the two iron collars was over 4'5 kilos, much
care was needed to prevent fracture of the ice, which, unless handled
tenderly, broke with the least jar, on being inserted in the machine.
   The lower surface of the upper, and the upper surface of the lower
collar had been planed true, and brass rings <U+FB01>tted on them.         These
rings were also made plane surfaces.        They extended so far from the
ice specimen that it was possible to use callipers between the surfaces
of these brass rings, without interference with the larger ends of the
conical collars. The ring on B was provided with four small holes,
 90° apart on the circumference, and by means of a small plummet
the points on the ring of C (which ring was graduated roughly) that
were vertically under the four points on the ring above, were deter
mined. By noting these graduations it was rendered certain that the
 measures would always be taken between            the same points in the
upper and under rings.        Since the ice specimen was inserted in the
 apparatus with its axis vertical, the lines measured between the
 points thus determined on the two rings, were, in each case, parallel
 to the axis of the cylinder.    The callipers used measured to the one
 <U+FB01>ftieth of a millimetre.

494                           Dr.  J.  F. Main.
   I used   the rings because  I  have not been able to devise means, as
yet,  for  so  <U+FB01>rmly <U+FB01>xing objects in the ice that there would be no
danger of displacement by their own weight, or during the measure
ment by callipers.      The results obtained are therefore affected by
errors, if any, which may be due to action at the collars, such as
slipping through, owing to distortion of the conical enlargements.
This effect is but slight at temperatures below the freezing point;
though near and above freezing point the collars, when the ice is
under tensile stress, will not hold it, but, in the course of a few hours,
by distortion of its conical enlargements, it slips through them. At
lower temperatures, to act as a check on the measurements taken
between the rings on the collars, and to determine if any appreciable
effect was due at those temperatures to slipping through the collars,
I gummed two pieces of paper on the ice specimen near the top and
bottom. On each of these a small pencil mark was made, and by
means of a. rule,   I got a measure of the distance between the points.
By repeating this measure on a subsequent day, a rough value was
obtained of the extension between the marked points.           The distance
could be estimated     to about  the  quarter of a millimetre,  and showed
that, with low temperatures, nearly all the extension observed was due
to the stretching of the piece, and not to a shearing action of the ice
in the collars.
   In the tabular results of three experiments which follow, the <U+FB01>rst
column gives the date; the second the hour, reckoned from Berne
mean midnight, at which the observations were taken; the third
column gives the temperature in degrees centigrade, read by an
attached Kew-veri<U+FB01>ed thermometer, graduated to tenths of a degree;
the fourth column gives in millimetres the mean of the distances of
the points on the upper from those on the lower ring.            These dis
tances, four in number, Were taken at opposite extremities of two
perpendicular diameters of the rings.       The next column furnishes the
mean extension in millimetres in the interval that has elapsed since
the last observation. The sixth column gives, in hundredths of a
millimetre, the hourly mean extension deduced from the preceding
column, and the interval which has elapsed between the two observa
tions.    The two next columns give, in kilogrammes per square
centimetre, the mean and the maximum stress respectively. By the
rapid evaporation from the ice cylinder, even at low temperatures,
the amount of this stress increased from day to day, with the same
load at the further end of the compound lever. Since the evaporation
was different at di<U+FB01>erent parts of the ice cylinder, owing probably to
variations in texture, and still more to the effect of the proximity of
 the collars to the ice above and below, which protected the ice near
them from evaporating so quickly as in other parts, the diameter of
 the cylinder at different heights varied. Thus the mean stress, as

 deduced   from three measurements of the diameter, at the top, in the
middle, and at the bottom, differed from the maximum stress, as
deduced from the total load and the least area of section.
    The last column but one in Experiment No. 1 gives the minimum
temperature the preceding night, measured, not in the box, but by a
thermometer freely exposed out of doors.         Since the ice specimen was
enclosed in the double box its temperature did not sink as low as those
given in this column. The numbers here are only to be taken as sig
nifying that the night was or was not specially cold. Unfortunately
in this experiment no maximum and minimum temperature observa
tions were taken. In Experiments 2 and 3 the maximum and
minimum temperatures were observed, when recorded, by a maximum
and a minimum thermometer suspended in the box, and their deter
                       “ the
minations furnished          range of temperature.”

                        On the Viscosity   of Ice.                    499
    The specimen broke by a jar due to the falling of a weight on the
<U+FB02>oor of the room.
   On February 27th the three observations were taken, with different
loads on the specimen, directly after one another.       With a load of
5'5 kilos. (the weight of the lower collar) there was an immediate
extension of 0'22 mm.; and when the load was increased to 125 kilos.
the extension at once increased by 0‘04 mm.
   The three experiments, of which the results are given above, show
that ice subjected to tension stretches continuously by amounts which
evidently depend on the temperature and on the tensile stress. When
the stress is great, as in No. l, and the temperature not very law,
there are appreciable extensions, as on February 15th, amounting to
as much as 1 per cent. of the whole length per day.      When the tem
perature is lower, and the stress is less, the extension is less, but still
such as can be measured. So continuous and de<U+FB01>nite is the extension,
that it can even be measured from hour to hour, as seen in Experi
ment No. 1, when for February 15th and 16th easily measurable
 extensions were obtained for intervals of two and three hours. The
quantities actually measured were generally both notably greater and
less than the mean, since, owing probably to inequalities in the dis
tribution of the stress and to variations of texture in the ice,
due to internal strains produced in freezing, one side of the specimen
would sometimes stretch 50 per cent. more than the other. Hence
di<U+FB02>‘erential motions resulted in the ice. These motions and exten
sions took place at temperatures which preclude all possibility of
melting and regelation, expecially in Experiments 1 and 2. In Ex-l
periment No. 1, it was found that in three days, from February 13th'
to February 16th, the distance between two marks on pieces of paper
gummed on the ice increased from 200 mm. to 203 mm., giving an
 elongation of 15 per cent. per day.     This method fails at tempera
tures very near the freezing point, owing to the danger that by
thawing the pieces of paper may slip, but is free from this risk at
lower temperatures.      It is in any case very rough, and is only
useful as a check on the other measures, since there is no question
here of slipping through the collars. How close the correspond
ence in the results obtained is may be seen by observing that in
Experiment 1 there was an extension in nine days of 11 mm. in the
case of a cylinder of ice, which at‘the beginning of that time was
235 mm. long, and this gives an elongation of just about % per
cent. per day, the same as resulted from the three days’ observa
tion with the marked bits of paper.                         ,
   The experiments are to be regarded rather as proving the exist
ence of continuous extension under tensile stress than as deter
mining its amount. The quantities observed are functions of the
stress, of the time between two observations, and of the time integral

 500                          Dr. J.  F. Main.
 during that interval of the temperature. Owing to the rapid evapo
 ration from ice, even at low temperatures, when the surface is never
 lique<U+FB01>ed, at such an elevation (6100 feet above sea level) as St.
 Moritz, in the Engadine, where the observations were carried on, the
 specimen is subjected to a continually increasing stress.     This varia
 tion in the stress can no doubt be diminished by clothing the speci
 men in <U+FB02>annel.      The change of temperature I expect to diminish by
 <U+FB01>lling the interval between the two surrounding wooden boxes with
 some non-conducting material.                    I
                                     In this way have good hope that,
 on resuming the experiments next winter at St. Moritz,     I  may be able
to determine more nearly the law of extension.         That there is such
 extension, and that it goes on continuously with all stresses above
 1 kilo.   per square centimetre, and at all temperatures between
 —6° C. and freezing point, is shown by the above experiments. When
 ice is in a condition such that pressure with the point of a needle will
 cause a set of radiating fractures to pass from the point of contact in
 all directions, it stretches as certainly, although not by so great an
 amount, as when it will permit the passage through it of the same
needle without showing the least trace of <U+FB02>aw or scar.
    In the discussions, for the most part a priori, on the extensibility of
ice, suf<U+FB01>cient importance has not usually been assigned to the neces
sity of distinguishing between the effect of even a small blow 0r jar
and that of a much greater force applied gradually and steadily
during a long interval. A bar of ice may bear a stress of 4 and
5 kilos. per square centimetre if the load is steady, which would
fracture at once with a much smaller sudden stress, especially if not
uniformly distributed.
    In the <U+FB01>rst experiment we notice a total extension in nine days of
11 mm.      In No. 2 there is an extension of 1'8 mm. in <U+FB01>ve days, and
in No. 3 of 1'7 mm. in three days.      If we assume for the moment an
extension proportional to the time, we should thus get a mean daily
extension in the three experiments of 1'2 mm., 0'36 mm., and 0‘56 mm.
respectively. To account for the discrepancy we remark that the
stress in No. 1 is much greater than in 2 or 3, and the temperature
not so very low during the day, although low at night.        The effect of
increased stress is well shown in Experiment No. 2, on February 23rd
and 24th, where, on increasing the stress from 2'28 to 3'65 kilos,
the extension in a day rises at once from 008 to 0‘69 mm.        In No. 2,
for three out of the <U+FB01>ve days, the temperatures were below —6° C,
whilst in No. 3 there was a low stress but comparatively high tem.
peratures.
    1n Experiment No. 2 the large numbers obtained at <U+FB01>rst probably
arose from the fact that in preparing the specimen its conical ex
pansion had frozen to the collar C. When the water run into the
collar B began to freeze it expanded, and thrust the ice upwards.

                            The Air of   Sewers.                     501
 As it   was frozen to the collar C, and therefore unable to expand
 upwards, since both collars were <U+FB01>xed to a frame, the cylindrical part
 of the ice bulged outwards,     as in the usual case of a long column
 under compression. When the specimen was subsequently exposed
 to tension, the e<U+FB01>ect of the latter was to straighten it, so that in a
 few days it no longer bulged out.     The straightening of the central
 line of the ice cylinder thus gave rise to greater extensions than were
 due simply to the extension of a straight bar of ice with an equal dis
 tance in all azimuths between the rings.
“The Air of        Sewers.”     By Professor THOMAS CARNELLEY,
      D.Sc., and J. S. HALDANE, M.A., M.B., University College,
      Dundee.     Communicated by Sir H.         ROSCOE,  F.R.S.    Re
      ceived May 21.—Read June 16, 1887.
    Owing to the complaints which had been made of bad smells in the
 House of Commons, 3. Select Committee was appointed in the spring
of 1886 to inquire into the ventilation of the House. In consequence
of the experience we had gained in the course of an extensive exami
nation of the air of houses and schools in Dundee (see ‘ Phil. Trans.,’
vol. 178 (1887), B, p. 61), we were instructed by the Committee to
make a series of analyses of the air in the sewers under the Houses
of Parliament, and to report thereon (see ‘Second Report of the
Committee,’ Appendix).       Since then we have examined the air in
a considerable number of sewers in Dundee.
    Our object was, in'the <U+FB01>rst place, to obtain a general idea of the
amount of some of the more important impurities present in sewer
air. But we have also endeavoured to throw some light on their
sources, and on the conditions affecting their dissemination.      With
this view we found it desirable to supplement our observations in the
sewers by a certain number of laboratory experiments.
    In spite of the great amount of discussion which has taken place
in connexion with real and supposed danger from sewer air, there
have hitherto been but few analyses published of the air of sewers of
modern construction.
    The <U+FB01>rst and most complete set of analyses was that made by
Dr. Letheby in 1857—58 (‘Report to the City of London Commissioners
of Sewers,’ 1858). He examined the air of thirteen sewers in the
City of London. The following are the means of his analyses :—

                                                  as to the condition and means
of ventilation of these sewers.
    In 1867 Dr. Miller,* in an investigation on the action of charcoab
air <U+FB01>lters, made anumber of analyses in two London sewers. The <U+FB01>rst
series was made in a clean and well-ventilated sewer, and the second
in a sewer described as “ tide-locked and ill-ventilated.”                 In the <U+FB01>rst
series (eighteen analyses)          he  found  on   an average     106    vols,  and in
the second (six analyses) 30'? vols. of carbonic acid per 10,000 vols.
of air. In neither series could sulphuretted hydrogen be detected,
and in both series the ventilation was by means of open gratings.
    In 1877 Beetzf in Munich found 31'4 vols. of carbonic acid, and
2'2 vols. of ammonia per 10,000 as an average of <U+FB01>ve analyses.
    As regards the micro-organisms present in sewer air the only
analyses hitherto published are those of Miquel.1                    He says, “ The
atmosphere of sewers, always saturated with moisture and constantly
in contact with water more or less <U+FB01>lthy and loaded with putrefying
substances,lis heavily charged with bacteria. Judging from a series
of experiments made in the sewer of the Rue de Rivcli in the neigh
bourhood of the point at which this sewer joins the large collector of
the Boulevard Sébastopol, there are present in the air circulating in
this gallery 800 to 900 bacteria per cubic metre ”§ (= 0‘8 to 0'9 per
litre). He also states that the air of the sewer contains an almost
constant number of bacteria, and that in summer the air of the Rue
de Rivoli may exceed in impurity by <U+FB01>ve or six times that of the
sewer, while in winter the air of the sewer may be <U+FB01>ve or six times
more impure. No details are furnished as to the condition and means
of ventilation of the sewer, nor as to the number of analyses on which
                                                   0
these conclusions are based.                                         -

   Mi<U+FB02>et (‘Biedemann’s Centralbl.,’ 1880, p. 227) states that air taken
from above a sink was rich in micro-organisms.
   In detailing our own observations it may be as well, in the <U+FB01>rst
place, to give some account of the sewers in which they were made.
The main sewer of Westminster Palace<U+FB01>" in which our <U+FB01>rst observa
tions were made, ran along underneath the open courts in the centre
of the building from the neighbourhood of the Victoria Tower to
that of the Clock Tower, a short way beyond which it joined the main
low-level metropolitan sewer.        Along its course it varied irregularly
in height from 41% to 10% feet. It was ventilated by suction from the
large furnace at the foot of the Clock Tower, and was cut off by a
penstoek from the metropolitan sewer.           The air drawn into the shaft
of the furnace almost all came from openings near the Clock Tower
end of the sewer.       In the rest of the sewer there were no open
gratings, and the draught was feeble.          On opening the trap-door of
a man-hole near the Victoria Tower there was an upward rush of air
and condensed vapour, in spite of the very powerful suction at the
other end of the sewer.       The sewer was <U+FB02>ushed daily. It was clean,
and the <U+FB02>ow of sewage was pretty rapid.                  The water frequently
accumulated in the sewer during rain owing to rise of the level of
the water in the metropolitan sewer.          Our analyses were made when
 the water was escaping freely.
    The second set of analyses at Westminster was made after the
ventilation of the sewer had been altered by carrying an additional
 shaft to the furnace and placing inlet gratings in suitable positions.
 By this means the draught along the sewer from the neighbourhood
 of the Victoria Tower was much increased.
    We owe the facilities which were a<U+FB01>orded us for examining the air
 in the Dundee sewers to the courtesy of Mr. Mackison, Burgh Engi
 neer. We met with a variety of conditions in these sewers.                  They
 are all ventilated by open gratings placed in the roadway at distances
 of about 50 yards apart, and also by the open drain grids placed along
 each side of the road at distances of about 40 yards.               The <U+FB02>ow of
 sewage    was in   almost  every case   pretty rapid     at  the time when our
 analyses were made. The sewers in Commercial Street, Overgate,
 and Nethergate are egg-shaped; that in Murraygate is a large circu
 lar sewer. Those in Reform Street and Duck Street had originally
 been large, old, <U+FB02>at-bottomed stone sewers, but had been partially
 altered by the substitution of a bottom similar to that of an egg
 shap'ed sewer. The Dock Street sewer is alternately <U+FB01>lled and emptied
 by the tide, as is also the sewer in Commercial Street, opposite Ex
 change Street.      The approximate heights of the several sewers are

given in the table of results (pp. 504—507).                 It will be seen that
the sewers which we examined were all of considerable size, large
enough to be entered without great dif<U+FB01>culty.                 Our data, therefore,
do not apply to small sewers and drains.
    In each sewer examined we estimated simultaneously the amounts
of carbonic acid, “organic matter,” and micro-organisms, as in the
case of our observations referred to above on the air of houses and
schools.      Analyses of outside air in the immediate vicinity of the
sewers examined were made at as nearly as possible the same time.
In order to avoid as far as possible contaminations due to our own
presence we kept to leeward of the apparatus employed in collecting the
samples. The methods employed were that of Pettenkofer for carbonic
acid, Carnelley and Mackie’s modi<U+FB01>cation of the permanganate process
for organic matter} and Hesse’s method for micro-organismssf                  The
results obtained are given in the preceding table.
   For the purpose of giving a general idea of the relative impurity
of sewer air we have taken the averages of analyses A and B of
sewer air and placed them alongside of the averages for outside air
at the same time, and for various classes of houses and schools, 'as
determined by us in the winter of 1885—86 and detailed in the paper
mentioned above.
   The above table shows (1) that the air of the sewers was much
better than one might have expected; (2) that the carbonic acid was.
about twice, and the organic matter rather over three times as great
as in outside air at the same time, whereas the number of micro
organisms was less; (3) that in reference to the quantity of the three
constituents named, the air of the sewers was in a very much better
condition than that of naturally ventilated schools, and that with the
notable exception of organic matter it had likewise the advantage of
mechanically ventilated schools; (4) that the sewer air contained a
much smaller number of micro-organisms than any class of house.
 The carbonic acid was rather greater than in the air of houses of four
rooms and upwards, but less than in two- and one-roomed houses. As
regards organic matter, however, the sewer air was only slightly better
than the air of one-roomed houses, and much worse than that of the
other classes of house}:           These facts are brought out more clearly in
the following table, in which the average quantity in excess of outside
air of each constituent in sewer air is taken as unity.

   On comparing the average amount of carbonic acid found by us in
sewer air with that found by earlier investigators (see above), it
appears that the sewers we examined must have been much better
ventilated than those previously examined.
   In our paper on the air of schools and houses, we pointed out
that in individual cases the amount of carbonic acid is n0t_a measure
of the amount of the organicmatter and number of micro-organisms
present in the air at the same (time; and that it is only when the
average of a comparatively large number of cases is taken that the
organic matter is seen to increase with the carbonic acid, while the
micro-organisms show no evident connexion with the carbonic acid
and organic matter. In the air of sewers the relation to one another
of carbonic acid and organic matter is similar. The micro-organisms
on the whole decrease as the other constituents increase.      This is
shown in the following table, in which the organic matter and micro
organisms are compared in amount with the carbonic acid as a
standard. The table is constructed by dividing all the carbonic acid
determinations into three equal groups according to the amounts of
carbonic acid found, and then taking the average of the corresponding
organic matter and micro-organism determinations in each group.

                 Sources of the several Impurities          in Sewer Air.
     The source of organic matter present in sewer air over and above
 that present in outside air at the time is of course the sewage
 itself. The organic matter arising from the sewage is most pro
 bably wholly or for the most part gaseous, for the conditions which
cause the number of micro-organisms in sewer air to be less than
in outside air would also affect any solid organic matter or dust in
a similar manner, so that we should expect the solid organic matter
in sewer air to be less than in outside air at the same time. The
gaseous organic matter arising from the sewage itself will pro
bably be of two kinds, that volatile per se, and that volatile with the
aqueous vapour from the sewage water. Organic matter may also get
into the air in cases where splashing occurs from the entry of a side
drain high up in the wall of a sewer.
     The carbonic acid in sewer air over and above that in outside
air may have two sources.                It may be due to diffusion into the
sewer from the neighbouring soil; but probably its chief source is
oxidation of organic matter in the sewage and the air of the sewer.
Miller many years ago demonstrated the existence of such oxidation
in the Thames, when it was the recipient of all the London sewage.
He showed by a series of analyses of the gases dissolved in
Thames water, collected at various points above and below London,
that from Kingston to Greenwich the carbonic acid increased, while
the oxygen rapidly diminished.
    Two possibilities occur as to the source of the majority of the
micro-organisms in sewer air.                  They may in the <U+FB01>rst place be de
rived from the sewage and sewer walls. If this were so to any
great extent we should expect their numbers to increase with the
    * The irregularity here is due to the results in the Dock Street sewer, which was
examined on a dry and windy day, when the micro-organisms               in the outside air
were very numerous, owing to dust, so that the difference between outside air and
sewer air was very great (see the large table of results, p. 506).            In the <U+FB01>rst
classi<U+FB01>cation  one of the Dock Street analyses falls into each class, in the second
classi<U+FB01>cation  two fall into the third class, leaving none in the second class.      If the
Dock Street analyses were left out, or if the third class began at 4'9 ‘vols. of carbonic
acid instead of at 4'7, the decrease in micro-organisms would run quite regularly.

 length of time during which the air is present in the sewer, and there
 fore with increase in the carbonic acid. But it has been shown above
 (p. 509) that the very opposite is the case, the micro-organisms be
 coming less numerous with increase of carbonic acid.                                  We have also
classi<U+FB01>ed the whole of our observations according to whether they
 were made at points where there was a strong, moderately strong, or
 very feeble draught.             Here again it will be seen that the results are
 against     the   theory     that        the micro-organisms come from the sewer
 itself.

    The only other source for the micro-organisms of sewer air is con
tamination from the outside air. The same arguments which have
just been applied against the sewer itself being a source of micro
organisms may be urged in favour of their origin from outside air.

 512                 Messrs. Carnelley and Haldane.
 The mere fact that the average number found in the sewer air (8'9)
 was less than that in outside air at the same time (159) is itself
 a strong argument in favour of the origin of most of the micro
 organisms from outside air. If the air takes up micro-organisms in
 its course along a sewer, we should expect the number to increase
 rather than diminish during its passage, whereas the opposite is the
 case, doubtless from gradual settling of solid particles.    This settling
 is perhaps even greater than appears from our analyses, as it was not
 practicable to take specimens of outside air at the gratings in the centre
 of the roadway with the tra<U+FB01>ic proceeding as usual. At these points the
 contamination of the air by solid particles of organic origin would of
 course be at its maximum.
    It will be noticed that in the analyses made at Westminster the
 numbers obtained for the sewer air close to the Clock Tower were
always larger than those for outside air (see Table, pp. 504—505). Not
 much stress can, however, be laid on this fact, as a great part of the
 air passing along the sewer at this point came from a side drain near
 the Clock Tower, leading from a point where the outside air was much
 more likely to be contaminated by dust from tra<U+FB01>ic than in the central
 court, where the outside air analyses were made.      The outside air de
terminations at Westminster apply strictly to the sewer determinations
near the Victoria Tower and kitchen, as these determinations were
made just at the opening of the inlet grating ventilating this part of
the sewer.    It will be seen that the micro-organisms inside the sewer
decreased in proportion to the decrease in those present in the outside
air.
    Another argument in favour of the origin of most of the micro
organisms from outside may be derived from the fact that the
average proportion of moulds to bacteria was nearly the same in the
sewer air and corresponding outside air, 1 to 9 in the former and 1 to
8 in the latter.   Were the micro-organisms in sewer air mostly de
rived from a diiferent source than outside air we should expect the
proportion to be different. Thus in two cases referred to below, in
which the micro-organisms were evidently derived from splashing in
the sewer, among 128 micro-organisms there were no moulds. In the
micro-organisms present in the air of naturally ventilated schools and
one-roomed houses, the average proportion present was found to be
1 : 132 and 1 : 49 respectively, as against 1 : 2'5 in the corresponding
outside air (‘ Phil. Trans.’ 1887, B, p. 99).
    A <U+FB01>nal argument is that so far as a naked-eye examination of the
colonies allowed one to judge, the micro-organisms in the sewer air
we examined were, with perhaps one exception, similar to those in
outside air. The exception referred to was in the case of some very
rapidly liquefying colonies which occurred in several samples of sewer
air, collected at points where there was more or less splashing.

 These possibly came from the sewer itself, as we have not observed
 in outside air or in buildings any colonies which lique<U+FB01>ed the jelly
 as rapidly or so extensively.
    The conclusion thus arrived at as to the source of most of the
 micro-organisms     present in sewer air is, perhaps, at <U+FB01>rst sight,
contrary to what one might have expected.             It is in agreement
 with the fact that the state of cleanliness or <U+FB01>lthiness of a sewer
seems to have no perceptible e<U+FB01>ect 0n the number of micro-organ
 isms present in the air of the sewer.         Thus two observations on
two different days     and  at two  di<U+FB01>erent  points of the dirtiest sewer
we examined, gave only 21; and 12 micro-organisms respectively,
as compared with an average of 4% and 9 in other and cleaner
sewers on the same days.        Our conclusion is also in agreement with
what is known as to the distribution of bacteria in air. Niigeli
 (‘Die N iederen Pilze,’ pp. 109, 111) has shown that liquids or damp
substances do not, with ordinary air currents, give off micro;
organisms to the surrounding air. He even found that air drawn
through gravel which had been saturated with <U+FB01>lth and then dried,
gave o<U+FB01> no micro-organisms (p. 169). Miquel (‘Oomptes Rendus,’
vol. 91, p. 64) states that the vapour of water rising from the soil, from
rivers, or from masses in full putrefaction, is free from germs; that
the gases evolved from decaying substances, and the air passed over
putrid meat are free from germs, provided that the putrefying sub
stance is as moist as soil taken 0'3 metre from the surface.           The
experiments of Professor Frankland (‘ Roy. Soc. Proc.,’ vol. 25, 1877,
p. 542) also point to the improbability        of micro-organisms being
disseminated in air by such agitation of a liquid as that produced by
the <U+FB02>ow of sewage along a sewer.           On the other hand, it is well
known that the micro-organisms already present in air are always
tending to sink to the ground.      On this fact Hesse’s method depends.
Hence air in its passage along a sewer will presumably tend to
gradually deposit its micro-organisms, especially if the air-current is
slow.
   In order further to elucidate this point, and in particular with
regard to the drain pipes leading into houses, we made some experi
ments with an arti<U+FB01>cial drain-pipe.       Through the side of a wooden
box, AB, there was passed the end of a piece of glass tubing, CD,
5 feet long and 1% inches in diameter, and open at both ends.       In the
opposite side of the box there was a hole, by means of which the air
inside the box could be connected with the entrance to a Hesse’s tube,
and the micro-organisms thus determined. Through the roof of the
box there passed a chimney, in which a draught was maintained by
means of a small <U+FB02>ame, F, kept burning at the bottom.              This, of
course, caused a corresponding draught through the long tube and into
the box.    A constant stream of water was kept running along the

514                      Messrs. Carnelley and Haldane.
bottom of the experimental sewer, the sides of which were also
moistened before each experiment. By estimating the micro-organisms
in the air at the mouth of the tube and in the box, the di<U+FB02>erence
caused by passage of the air along the tube could be determined.
The rate of the current of air through the long tube was in all the
experiments 5 feet in six seconds.                  The determinations were made
simultaneously, after the draught had been established for a short time.

   would settle out of a drain-pipe especially with great rapidity.
   Judging from the rate at which they settle in a Hesse’s tube, air
   standing in, or passing along, a 4-inch drain-pipe would become
   entirely free of micro-organisms within three or four minutes. Hence
   it seems improbable that micro-organisms can penetrate into a house
   from a sewer unless with a pretty rapid current towards the house.
      It will be seen from the table that the moulds are more numerous
   in proportion to bacteria after the air has passed through the tube
   than before.     This is due to the fact, <U+FB01>rst observed by Hesse, that
   moulds fall through air less rapidly than bacteria. We should expect
   to <U+FB01>nd a similar alteration in the proportion in badly ventilated.
   sewers, but our observations in such sewers were not suf<U+FB01>ciently
  numerous to enable us to say whether this is actually the case.
      Although, as has been seen, most of the micro-organisms present
  in the air of the sewers we examined seem to have come from the
  outside air, yet in some cases we had distinct evidence of the
  dissemination of micro-organisms from sewage itself.            In Dundee a
  few, and at Westminster a large proportion of the drains were found
  to enter the sewers through the roof. This gave rise to a considerable
  amount of splashing, the e<U+FB01>ect of which on the dissemination of
   micro-organisms in the air it seemed of great importance to investi
  gate. The following observations in the sewers bear upon this point.
  An analysis was made within about 2 feet of a shower of water pro
  ceeding from the roof of (the Dock Street sewer, the draught being
  very slight.      The number of micro-organisms present was 103 (all
  bacteria).     An  analysis made shortly afterwards a few feet to wind
  ward of the shower of water gave only twelve micro-organisms.
  During one of the analyses made at Westminster, a sudden and very
  violent shower of sewage occurred about 10 feet to windward of the
  tripod. carrying the Hesse’s tube.        In this case the number found
  was 25 (all bacteria), whereas an analysis made at the same point
  a few minutes later, after the dripping had ceased, gave only eight
  micro-organisms.       One of the analyses in the Murraygate sewer was
  made within about 30 feet of the point where the Hill Town sewer
  enters the Murraygate sewer,.there being a draught of about 2 feet
  per second from this point to the spot where the analysis was made.
  The Hill Town sewer has a steep incline, and the water contained in
  it rushes down with great force, forming a sort of water-fall, the roar
  of which sounded most impressive as it echoed along the sewer. The
  analysis only gave three micro-organisms per litref"
     * The low number thus obtained was possibly owing to the fact that the waste

   From the <U+FB01>rst two observations it appears that micro-organisms
are undoubtedly disseminated in sewer air by splashing ; but whether
they are carried far in the air cannot be decided from the above
experiments. The point is one of great practical importance, as the
micro-organisms in question are those on which most suspicion
of properties injurious to health naturally falls. Hence we thought
it desirable to make some laboratory experiments with a view to
elucidating the matter.
   In connexion with the e<U+FB01>ects of splashing we also investigated the
e<U+FB01>ects of the bursting of bubbles.       Professor Frankland (‘ Roy. Soc.
Proc.,’ vol. 25; p. 54.2) has already made experiments on this point by
means of lithia solutions.      He found that lithia was disseminated in
the air and carried to a considerable distance, when a solution of
lithia was made to effervesce.       Hence the presumption is that micro
organisms might be disseminated in a similar way.
    Our experiments were made with the arti<U+FB01>cial drain-pipe arrange
ment described above (pp. 513—5M).           Control determinations of the
air in the box were <U+FB01>rst made after the draught had been established
some little time. A putrefying solution was then poured from a height
into a vessel placed at about 6 inches below the end of the glass
tube, so as to imitate the splashing in a sewer; or e<U+FB01>ervescence
was brought about in the same solution, placed at the mouth of the
long glass tube by adding sodium carbonate and hydrochloric acid,
or by blowing small and numerous jets of air through the putrid <U+FB02>uid
by means of a <U+FB01>ne rose from an ordinary garden hose pipe.
water from a dye works was discharged into this sewer, accompanied by a distinct
smell of chlorine at the time of our experiment.      These conditions possibly
exerted a disinfecting action.

    These results are very decided, and con<U+FB01>rm and extend for micro
organisms the results obtained by Professor Frankland for lithia
solutions.      They show conclusively not only that micro-organisms are
disseminated in sewer air by splashing, but that those having this
origin may be carried to a considerable distance along a sewer or
drain-pipe.        Calculating from these experiments, air vitiated as
above described, and to a similar extent, would still contain about
400 micro-organisms per litre after travelling about 60 yards, in a
sewer 5 feet high, and with a draught of about 1 foot per second.                   It
is therefore of the greatest importance that sewers and drains should
be so arranged as to avoid splashing as much as possible.
17w Physiological Efects         of Unorganised      Organic Matter in Sewer Air.
   In view of the fact that ordinary sewer air, in the absence of splash
ing, turned out to be to all appearances comparatively innocent as
regards its micro-organisms, and assuming that it has an injurious
effect on health, we directed further attention to the unorganised
organic matter present in it. Of organic compounds most likely to
produce some of the bad eifects ascribed to sewer air, volatile
ptoma'ines’l“ at once suggest themselves,            on account of the intensely
poisonous properties possessed by              various    known ptoma'inesxf'      We
therefore endeavoured to ascertain whether sewer air contains any
poisonous volatile bases. For this purpose air was drawn continuously
for thirty-four days from the sewer side, below the trap, of an earthen
pipe, which acted as the drain from the College water-closets and
urinals.      This air was bubbled continuously through very dilute sul
phuric acid, in order that any basic substance which the air contained
might be retained. The solution thus obtained was subsequently
neutralised exactly with ammonia, and evaporated to dryness on a
water-bath.        The residue was dissolved and injected subcutaneously
into rabbits, but produced no eifect whatever, even in doses of a
gram of ,the dry substance.             Evidently if there was any poisonous
substance in the air, it was not contained in the residue injected.
Unfortunately this experiment is not conclusive, on account of the
instability of many of the organic bases in question.
   If poisonous organic substances had been present in serious quanti
ties in the air of the sewers we examined, we should presumably have
ourselves felt some eifects from them, as we were sometimes in the
sewers for several hours, more or less continuously.                We could never
observe any bad effects, however, from our stay, although we were
previously quite unaccustomed to entering sewers.

   The means commonly employed for preventing the escape of sewer
air into houses   isthe ordinary water-trap.   Since the experiments of
Nageli (‘  Die Niederen Pilze,’ p. 109)      has been known that these
                                                it
traps, when acting properly, absolutely prevent the passage of micro
organisms. But       it evident that they cannot altogether prevent the
                          is
passage of volatile constituents of sewer air, and we thought it worth
while to make    afew experiments on this point. We were not aware
that the matter had already been experimentally investigated by
Fergus (‘The Sewage Question,’ 1874), who employed methods simi
lar to those used by us. As, however, the test substances used by us
were nearly all different from those employed by Fergus,         may be   it
well to give the results of our experiments. A leaden U-shaped trap,

being perforated by     hole in the middle. The trap was then <U+FB01>lled

neck of a <U+FB02>ask D, containing the substance under investigation, was
<U+FB01>xed through the india-rubber sheet at A. The whole was then left at
rest, and observations made from time to time by removing the stopper
and ascertaining whether the smell of the substance in D could be
detected at E. In other cases        tightly <U+FB01>tting inverted test-tube,

the glass stopper, and observations made as to when the test-paper
was <U+FB01>rst distinctly affected.  The results obtained are given in the

   Fergus found that free ammonia came through a somewhat similar
trap in 15 minutes, carbonic acid in     1%,»
                                          hour, sulphuretted hydrogen
in to hours, &0. He also refers to similar experiments in which
  3    4
a ventilating pipe was placed between the substance experimented on
and the trap, in which the result was much the same, except that the
time occupied in penetrating the trap was longer.
   Though   it   thus the case that water-traps after some time allow a
                 is
certain amount of various volatile substances to pass through, yet  it is
hardly conceivable that the small amount thus allowed to pass can
have any appreciable in<U+FB02>uence on health.
   We do not propose to enter here on any general discussion of the
e<U+FB01>ects of the inhalation of sewer air on health.      The results of the
foregoing investigations are clearly such as to make us much more
suspicious as to supposed evidence of the bad e<U+FB01>ects of ordinary sewer
air, such as that of the sewers examined by us. At any rate        it  is
evident that “sewer gas,” unless   it  has been vitiated by splashing,
has a much less deadly composition than       often supposed.
                                                is               It must
be remembered, however, that the matter cannot in the present state
of our knowledge be settled by analyses alone, though analyses may
serve asa  guide in the investigation.

      OBITUARY         NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
    JOHN THEOPHILUS BUILEAU, son of Thomas Boileau, at one time a
 well-known solicitor in Calcutta, and afterwards Chief Magistrate of
 that city, was born there May 26th, 1805. His maternal grandfather,
 Colonel Jessup, was an American Loyalist who suffered severely for
 the support he gave to the King’s cause.             The Boileau family are of
 Huguenot descent.
    In 1819, when still much under <U+FB01>fteen, he was nominated a cadet
 to   Addiscombe by Charles Marjoribanks                 of the E1. Direction.
 Among    his  contemporaries    were  several     whose  names are more or less
 prominent    in modern Indian history, such as Henry Lawrence and his
 elder brother George, James Abbott (of Khiva), with his brother Sir
 Frederick.      Boileau, aged 15%, passed out of Addiscombe for the
 Engineers, December 19, 182-0, and after a short practical training on
 the Trigonometrical Survey, and at Chatham under Colonel Charles
 Pasley, went to India, arriving at Fort William September 22nd, 1822.
    The Corps of Bengal Engineers was in those days a. very small one,
its cadre including only thirty-six of<U+FB01>cers, and, if they entered it with
 a somewhat imperfect training, the manifold and incessant work into
which the young of<U+FB01>cers were speedily plunged afforded them at least
 a very varied experience.       During the <U+FB01>rst twelve years of Boileau’s
 service we <U+FB01>nd him engaged as executive engineer in the construc
 tion of forti<U+FB01>cations, roads, barracks, an important church and gaol,
 a considerable suspension bridge, and what not, and (among other
 duties when stationed at Agra) on measures for the conservation of
the splendid buildings left there by the Mogul dynasty, including the
Taj itself.
    He married in 1829, and made a voyage to Europe with his
family in'1837.      Whilst at home he published a work which has had
extensive use among surveyors, and of which he had already issued a.
lithographed edition in India, (1836).             The London publication is
            “ A

Differences of Latitude and the Departures to Every Minute of-the
Quadrant, and to Five Places of Decimals; together with a. Table of

of Longitude from the Equator to the Poles; with other Tables useful

   * A
       note in General Boileau’s handwriting, dated 12th November, 1880, says :
“ These Traverse Tables were prepared to facilitate the computation of the areas of
                                                                         b

    It  also exempli<U+FB01>es       Boileau’s constant activity         of mind, that he
                                                                “ On the Practica—
published, at this early date, a report of his own
bility and Expense of a Plan proposed for Constructing Docks in
Diamond Harbour on the River Hooghly, and for uniting them
with Calcutta by a Railroad, together with an Estimate for the
same.”
     It  was    at this time that the interest of the Royal Society in
magnetic observation, which had been originally stimulated in 1836
by a.letter of Humboldt’s to the then President (the Duke of
Sussex), and had been maintained by the zeal of Major Sabine,
was at its height.           The Society recommended           the Court of Direc
tors of the El. Company to take part in the institution of mag
netic and meteorological observations, which (chie<U+FB02>y through the
in<U+FB02>uence of Colonel Sykes) they decided to do.                     Boileau and two
o<U+FB01>icers of the         Madras    Engineers,     Lieutenants    Ludlow     and Elliott,
were appointed to establish and take charge of observatories at Simla,
Madras, and Singapore respectively, and all three went to Dublin in
 November, 1839, to receive from the late Rev. Dr. Humphrey Lloyd, of
 Trinity College, a course of that preparation for their duties which
that eminent philosopher alone could then impart.                   Captain Boileau,
 before he left again for India, was elected a Fellow of the Royal
 Society, and also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.
     The three Indian Engineer of<U+FB01>cers embarked in February 1840
 for Madras, reaching that port in June, where they separated, and
 Boileau with his instruments proceeded to Calcutta. He reached
 Simla on the 24th of September, some weeks before the arrival of'
 his assistants with the instruments.               He had taken observations of
 dip on his palankin journey, by            the   way, at Allahabad, Futtehgurh,
 Bulandshahr, Karnal, Ambala, and Bar (at the foot of the hills on the
 road to Simla).        He was also fortunate in securing for his magnetical'
 campaign the hearty interest of the Rev. John Henry Pratt, after
 wards Archdeacon of Calcutta, a man not less well known for his,
 scienti<U+FB01>c acquirements than beloved for his character.
      Captain Boileau selected for his observatory a site on what was then
 called Bentinck Hill, but which has since been known as Observatory
 Hill, and which in the rapid revolution of administrative events in.
 village   lands by the o<U+FB02>icers of the Government Revenue Survey, and have gone
  through several editions.     They are the <U+FB01>rst ever published for angular values to
  single minutes of are, or to <U+FB01>ve places of decimals for distances.         Their great
  utility, both for the above purposes and for surveying in general, has been acknow
  led ged by letters from the United States of America, from the Brazils, from Australia,
  and from India.”      Boileau’s tables are in habitual use at Cooper’s Hill College.
  Traverse tables are intended to save the calculations of triangles in ordinary surveys,
  by showing by inspection the amount in linear measurement of the difference oflati
  tude and departure (i.e., of longitude) for any bearing and distance.

 India  has recently been selected as the site for the Viceroy’s    of<U+FB01>cial
residence.
   The observations were continued from 1841 to 1846, though their
maintenance had been occasionally menaced with interruption.           This
is referred to more than once by Boileau in the correspondence
which he maintained, during the earlier years of his work at Simla,
with Dr. Humphrey Lloyd. Under date 15th September, 1842,11e
writes :—
   “ We have now in Simla all our Chiefs, viz., Lord Ellenborough, the
Governor of the N.W. Provinces, and the Commander-in-Chief.
The Governor-General has not yet been to see my works, but he has
expressed himself in such terms respecting the Observatory that if it
is left to his Lordship’s pleasure, the continuance of its observations
will be short indeed.      He calls the establishment of the Company’s
corresponding     stations an English (or rather a Home) job; and         I
have not the least doubt that both himself and the Government of
 India at Calcutta are doing all they can with the Court of Directors
 to procure the abolition of the Indian Observatories.               .  .  .
 Government have twice applied to me 'to know how long my “ experi
ments” and “the Magnetic Survey” are to continue, and               I  have
both times replied that the series of corresponding observations upon
 which 1 was engaged could not terminate until the 30th June, 1844:,
at midnight.”
    18th December, 1842: “ We have got rid of all our great people,
 but my Lord Ellenborough has bid me attend his grand doings at
 Ferozpore on Christmas Day, whither accordingly      I am bound on the
 21st.    This will cause a delay of three days in our opening the New
 Year, but there is no help for it. The return of our armies from
 Cabul promises a lasting peace to India, and    I hope will also extend,
 almost inde<U+FB01>nitely, the existence of the Observatory.”
                            I
    17th October, 1842: “ see by the paper that H.M.’s Observatories
 are to be continued for three years, and if any good is to come out of
 our work, ours must be so too; though the Governor-General told me
 a few days ago that    I must not reckon upon more than one year more
 at Simla.     Since then the news of our victories and the re-establish
 ment of British supremacy in Afghanistan has come in, and a few
 days since the accounts of peace with China, so that the mollia
 tempura fandt' have arrived, and if you desire our co-operation for a
 further period, this is the time to ask for it.    The peace saves our
  Government at least one and a half millions a year.          The extra
 expense   of four (three?) observatories is about £3,000 sterling per
 annum only. Lord Auckland absurdly estimated it at £10,000 a year,
 which was enough to frighten the Court of Directors out of their
                                                                  ’
 senses.”
    The same correspondence     'shows that Major Boileau not only kept

                                        iv
the regular term-days, but certain others also privately arranged by
Sir James Ross. Disturbances proved to be of pretty frequent
occurrence.     He sent home traces of eight in 1841, of three in the
month of February, 1842, and others in August and September, 1842.
These and the whole of the six years’ magnetica] observations remain
unpublished—a circumstance which might have lent greater force to
the objections of Lord Ellenborough had he been able to foresee it.
There are some circumstances not easy to explain in connexion with
this fact.   That the magnetic observations were not published and do
not exist in print is indubitable.        But whether they were not printed
is subject to a curious doubt.        The Government did sanction for this
purpose a printing establishment on a liberal scale, which was set up
by Major Boileau <U+FB01>rst at Simla, then at Ambala (in or about 1847),
and subsequently at Meerut, when he had been transferred to that
station. And in a memorandum of his employments and services, in
his own handwriting (dated 21st March, 1867) he enters :—-“ Super
intended the printing of the whole of the observations taken at the Simla
station.   .  .  .    This press was exclusively employed by the Govern
ment N.W. Provinces in printing Government work, and acquired a
high reputation for the accuracy and neatness with which especially
its tablework (forms of <U+FB01>gures) was executed.            After completing the
object for which   it was established  in  connexion with  the Simla ltIagnetic
 Observatory, it was transferred to        the College for   Civil Engineering
 at Roorkee. to which it is still attached.       .  .  .”
    Also in a letter to Sir Henry Lefroy, dated 18th July, 1883,
 General Boileau writes :—“ The whole of the records and instruments
 of the Simla Observatory were destroyed by <U+FB01>re in the year 1858,
 owing to the cases in which they had been packed for transmission to
 England, on my retirement from the Service in the beginning of
 1857, having been transferred during the Mutiny from the safe
 depository in which they had been placed by me, into a, store-room in
 which large quantities of dooly bedding had been stored away, and
 which had taken <U+FB01>re, or been set on <U+FB01>re, to the utter annihilation
 of the instruments, records, and printed observations of the Simla
 Station.”
    The letter last quoted proceeds :—“ Copies of the monthly abstracts,
 however, of the magnetic and meteorological observations of the
 Simla Station had been regularly forwarded by me to the Royal
 Society, and from them, with the sanction of the Government of India,
 and by the kind aid of the Royal Society, themeteorological observa
 tions of the Simla Observatory were printed and published under
 my superintendence in the year 1872.
    “None of the magnetical observations of the Indian Observatories
 have been printed ,- although even at this distant time the results, it
 published in a condensed form, would be of great interest.”

                                     Y
  It    would appear that the meteorological observations,   till printed
in London in 1872,       stood on the same platform with the mag
netical. And in the       absence of any exact information, perhaps
the impossibility of now recovering      it, what
                                               I     should deduce from
Boileau’s statements   is   this :——that all the Simla observations were
printed by him at his Observatory press, but that for some reason,
very possibly his desire to accompany the publication with prolegomena
and some indication of results, for which he never found time in
India, he was induced to defer their issue: that he had intended to
carry the work to completion in England after his retirement and
establishment in home there but that, in consequence of the break
                   a             ;
ing out of the Mutiny shortly after his departure from India, the
despatch was delayed, and in the following year the <U+FB01>re occurred
which consumed the whole.
   We may here insert a list of books of tables of divers useful kinds
which were prepared and issued by Boileau during his residence at
the Observatory, or in the immediately succeeding years.
   1. Tables (from Apjohn’s formula) for determining the Elastic
Force of Aqueous Vapour.
   2. Ivory’s Tables of Mean Astronomical Refractions;      Revised and
Augmented.
   3. Mathematical       Tables
                             ;     comprehending Logarithms of all
Numbers from      1 to 10,000, also Logarithms, Sines, Tangents, and
Secants, to Six Places of Decimals.
   4. Oltmann’s Barometrical Tables.
   5.  A Collection of Tables—Astronomical, Meteorological, and Mag
netical; also for Determining the Altitudes of Mountains; Com
parison of French and English Weights and Measures, &c.
   6.  Tables of Wages and Rent; of the Value of Goods; for convert
ing Seers and Chittacks into Decimals of a Maund, also Annas and
Pice into Decimals of  a    Rupee.
   7.  Tables for facilitating the Computation of the Time from single
Altitudes.    Roorkee, 1858.
   To these we may add :—
   8. Meteorological Observations made at the Magnetic and Meteoro
logical Observatory at Simla during the years 1841—45, under the
direction of Lieut.-Colone1 J. T. Boileau, F.R.S., Superintendent of
the Observatory.      Published by Order of the Right Hon. the Score
tary of State for India in Council.
   Boileau’s work while at Simla was by no means con<U+FB01>ned to that of
the Observatory.      During the years he spent there a great variety of
Occasional and useful tasks were either committed to him by Govern
ment, or voluntarily undertaken.
    After the Observatory work came to an end, Boileau <U+FB01>lled the o<U+FB01>ice
 of Superintending Engineer successively at Ambala and Meerut, till

                                       vi
  in   1854. he was transferred   to  Agra, on the reorganisation of the
  P.W. Department,     as Chief Engineer to the Government of the    N.W.
 Provinces.     In addition to the duties of the former o<U+FB02>ice, while at
  Ambala he undertook to codify and co-ordinate the chaotic mass of
  Standing Orders of the Department, extending over a period of nearly
  seventy years. The result of this voluntary labour, Boileau’s Code as it
  was called, to which he added a full Index and Series of Forms, was
  printed at the expense of Government, and became some years later a
  most valuable aid when a Committee was appointed by Government to
  draw up a systematic code of rules and procedure for the Department.
      Colonel Boileau retired from the Service February 24th, 1857, with
  the usual honorary step which made him Major-General.
      Boileau’s life in India had been characterised by acuteness and
  vivacity of intellect, by an unresting and devouring activity of mind,
  and by extraordinary versatility and variety of work.         He hardly
  attained the success that some of these qualities would have led one
   to expect, but at the same time the list perhaps suggests some reasons
  for this. And it is a, fact that his joyous and buoyant temperament,
  indeed his exuberant spirits, often showing themselves in proceedings
  of an eccentric character, made him better known to the Anglo-Indian
  community than his intellectual gifts or practical accomplishments.
   Indeed, his sayings and doings were the subject of many widely
   current anecdotes, which, in some cases, were founded on the merest
  iota of fact, and in some others were purely mythical.
      It was really in the thirty years of life following his retirement
  that Boileau’s best qualities were drawn out to most valuable
   purpose, and won him wide and warm regard.        He was, to be sure, as
   versatile and active as ever; thus he became the most energetic of
   vestrymen at Kensington, and as Chairman of the Building Committee
   which erected the handsome Town Hall there, he was indefatigable
   in his supervision of the work and of its <U+FB01>nancial details. He was
> for
        years a most zealous member of the Volunteer body, in which,
   however, he steadfastly declined the command of his corps (the
   1st Middlesex Ri<U+FB02>es) which was pressed on him, insisting on carrying
   his ri<U+FB02>e as a private in the ranks. He was for some time on the
   Council of the Royal Society, and acted as auditor of its accounts;
   besides serving actively at one time or another on the Committees of
   various charitable, religious, or other useful Societies. But that
   which especially developed in General Boileau, and characterised him
   for the last twenty years of his life, was the active practical benevo
   lence and devotion to the work he took upon himself as Committeeman,
   and eventual Chairman, of two noble institutions, viz., that of the
   Soldiers’ Daughters’ Home at Hampstead, and that of the Of<U+FB01>cers’
   Daughters’ School at Bath (the latter having also for some years a
    succursal at Rochampton).        To these institutions he grudged no

                                       vii
 labour, and spared no fatigue.       The children of the Soldiers’ Daugh
 ters’ Home were always termed by him his “ red chickens,” and when
 \vearied  with work his greatest refreshment was to visit the Home and
 to  get surrounded by their smiling faces and happy voices.        “ At
                                                                         any
 hour of the day or night, and in any weather, he would go to the
 Home, if his presence was required; and, as long as his strength
permitted, he would sometimes walk the whole distance from his
residence at Notting Hill before breakfast.         On occasions of joy or
sorrow at the Home he was never absent, and he was ever at the beck
and call of the excellent matron, with whom he Worked in unbroken
harmony for the twenty years he occupied the chair. . . . All his
own servants were drawn from the Home, and he would always
declare that they were unsurpassed.”         He cared for them as if they
had been his own children, and he was repaid by their attachment to
him.      Every girl brought up in the Home who was in London at the
time of his death sent a wreath to be laid upon his co<U+FB02>in. Beyond
his constant weekday visits to Hampstead, he for many years before
his last illness maintained a practice of going there on Sunday after
 noon to be present at the Bible classes which the children attended.
    His exertions on behalf of the Royal School for Oi<U+FB01>cers’ Daughters
were not less devoted.       He joined the Committee of this Institution
in 1872, and ir 1880 became Chairman in succession to Sir Henry
Lefroy, when the latter went as Governor to Tasmania.          When it was
deemed expedient some years ago to close the succnrsal at Roehampton,
and to extend the buildings at Bath to receive the additional pupils
 there, all the details of this change and the new construction at Bath
 were conducted under General Boileau’s close Supervision.
    Till his last illness he never altogether lost his buoyant spirits or his
oddities; but in the constant exercise of benevolent effort these latter
had taken a riper and sweeter form than in the old Indian days.            In
May 1886 the illness began which, with sundry <U+FB02>uctuations, and borne
with patience and devoutness for six Weary months, terminated in his
death, Sunday, November 7th.
    I have given some examples of his ever-active mind and versatile
capacities.    I may add that till he left India he played both the <U+FB02>ute
and the violin.       He could, I am told, quote Ha<U+FB01>z with faultless pro
nunciation    and   expression; he  spoke Hindustani,   I know, with a ver
nacular swing which was rarely equalled in the mouth of an English
man; whilst his memory was stored with old Hindu saws and rhymes,
ever ready to be produced on appropriate occasions to appreciative
hearers.     He was also a fair Latin scholar. And for a long time
he was a diligent attendant at and participator in the proceedings of
the Royal United Service Institution.       During the earlier discussions
on ri<U+FB02>e construction he took a serious part in them, and himself
invented a ri<U+FB02>e.                                                    H. Y.

     Sm WALTER ELLIOT, K.O.S.I., LL.D., who died at his seat,
 Wolfelee, near Hawick, N.B., 0n the lat March, 1887, at the mature
 age of 84.- years, was born in Edinburgh,        January 16th, 1803, the
 eldest son of James Elliot, Esq., of Wolfelee, by his marriage with
  Caroline, daughter and co-heiress of Walter Hunter, of Polmond,
 county Peebles.      Sir Walter was educated at Haileybury College,
  where he obtained the certi<U+FB01>cate of “highly distinguished,” and
  entered the service of the East India Company in 1820.         In 1823 he
  received his <U+FB01>rst appointment as Assistant Political Agent for the
  South Mahratta District. After holding various other of<U+FB01>ces in the
  Revenue and Political Departments of the Madras Government, he
  was made, in 1837, Private Secretary to his cousin, Lord Elphinstone,
  then Governor of Madras. From 1837 to 1854! he was a Member of
  the Board of Revenue, and during that time was intrusted with
  the supervision of the Northern Circars, then in a very unsatis
  factory condition.     In 1854 he became Member of Council, and
  retained this position until he retired from the Indian Service in
  1859.
     Throughout his career in India and during the whole period of his
  subsequent life in this country until a very recent date, when his eye
  sight failed him, Sir Walter Elliot was constantly at work on various
  points connected with the Natural History, Ethnology, Antiquities,
  and Languages of India, in all of which subjects he was deeply
  versed and took the most profound interest.       Though his publications
   were not very numerous, his notes and collections in all these
   departments were extensive, and were in many cases utilised in the
  way of contributions to the writings of his fellow-workers in these
  various branches of science.    One of his most important earlier papers
  was a Catalogue of the Mammals found in the Southern Mahratta
  country, published in the ‘Madras Journal of Science’ for 1839
  which was one of the <U+FB01>rst attempts made to give a connected account
. of the mammal-fauna of the Indian Peninsula.          In the same journal
  and in the ‘Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,’ will be found
   other zoological contributions from his pen.     Sir Walter was also well
  acquainted with Indian plants, and after his return to this country
   contributed several articles to the ‘Edinburgh New Philosophical
   Journal’ on the farinaceous grains and the various kinds of pulse
  .used in Southern India.     But it is, perhaps, as an Indian antiquarian
  that his name will be ultimately best known to posterity.             The
  sculptured slabs from the famous Buddhist Tope of Amravati which
  adorn the walls of the great staircase in the British Museum, were
  procured by him, and presented to the Court of Directors, who
  transferred them to the national collection. Besides these, a splendid
  collection was accumulated at Wolfelee of coins, copper plates, arms,
   and other Indian ethnological objects.        Sir Walter Elliot was for

                                   in
many years a constant attendant at the meetings of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science.
   Sir Walter was an ardent collector of Indian coins, and a leading
authority on the subject. His principal numismatic work was a
memoir on the “ Coins of Southern India,” which forms the second
part of the third volume of the International ‘ Numismata Orientalia.’
Sir Walter is in fact the only man who has worked systematically on
Southern Indian coins, a neglected subject to which Marsden and
Prinsep made some small contributions.        In the work above men
tioned, he has laid a solid platform, on which future Indian
numismatists may proceed to build. With his habitual liberality he
transferred more than 300 of his most valued coins to the collection
in the British Museum.        Besides this most important work, Sir
Walter published two papers on the same subject. in the ‘Madras
Journal of Literature and Science ’ (new series, vol. 3 and 4), under
the title of “ Numismatic Gleanings.”
   In private life, it may be said in conclusion, Sir Walter Elliot
was one of the kindest and most amiable of men. His sweet and
genial disposition, and great liberality in every way, endeared him not
only to his immediate friends and relations, but to all those with
whom in various ways he came in contact.           In 1839 he married
Maria Dorothea, eldest daughter of Sir David Hunter Blair, Bart, 0F
Blairquhan, who survives him, and by whom he leaves a family of
three sons and two daughters.
    Sir Walter was elected F.R.S. in 1878, and LL.D. of the
University of Edinburgh in 1879.         He was made a Knight Com
mander of the Star of India in 1866.
                                                              P. L. S.
   SIB. J osnru Walrwon'rn   was born at Stockport on December 21st,
1803.     His school education terminated at the age of fourteen.    He
was then sent to an uncle, a cotton-spinner in Derbyshire, with the
intention of his being brought up to that business.       His mechanical
tastes  were,  however,  too  strong,  and in 1821  the  idea of cotton
spinning was given up, and he obtained employment and experience
for four years in the works of different machine-makers in Man
chester.     In 1825 he went to London, and was engaged successively
with several of the most important engineering <U+FB01>rms, amongst them
Maudslay and Holtzapffel.       He also worked with Clement, who was
engaged in the construction of Babbage’s calculating machine.          In
1825 he married his <U+FB01>rst wife, Fanny, youngest daughter of Mr.
 Richard Ankers.      In 1833 Whitworth returned to Manchester, and
set up as a tool-maker on his own account.        His business and repu
 tation rapidly increased.   In 1840 he read a paper before the British
 Association on his method of preparing accurate metallic plane sun
                                                                 01

faces, a method which he had devised when       with Maudslay in London,
and in 1841 he read a paper before the Institution of Civil Engineers
on “ An Uniform System of Screw Threads.”            During the next ten
years   he introduced   his system  of  standard gauges and perfected his
measuring machine, an instrument which is capable of detecting a
dilference in size of one millionth of an inch.          In 1853 he was
appointed as one of the Royal Commissioners to the New York Exhi
bition, and in the following year his attention was directed, at the
request and with the aid of the Government, to the improvement of
<U+FB01>re-arms. Since that time the subject of <U+FB01>re-arms, large or small,
interested him more than any other to the day of his death.       He was
President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1856, and in
1857 he was elected a Fellow of this Society.          In 1868 Whitworth
founded the Engineering Scholarships which bear his name.         He pro
vided an annual income of £3000, to be distributed as scholarships
for the encouragement of the study of the theory and practice of
mechanics. In July, 1869, he was created a baronet. In 1870 his <U+FB01>rst
wife died, and in 1871 he married Mary Louisa, widow of Mr. Alfred
Orrell.    The present works of Sir Joseph Whitworth and Company,
Limited, were opened in 1881.       Since then they have received a rapid
extension and development, and now undoubtedly contain the <U+FB01>nest
collection of powerful machine tools in the world.       Of late years the
state of Sir Joseph Whitworth’s health usually necessitated             his
spending the winter in the South of France.         He died on the 22nd of
January, 1887, at Monte Carlo, and was buried in Darley Dale church
yard, near his country residence at Stancliife.
    One characteristic ran through the whole of Whitworth’s work as an
 engineer—insistance upon the very highest standard of excellence both
 of workmanship and material; and it is to this rather than to any
 speci<U+FB01>c inventions or discoveries that his great success and reputation
 are due.    The principle of his method of preparing true planes was
 the simple one that if any two of three surfaces accurately <U+FB01>t each other,
 each of the three must be plane; in addition to adopting this funda
 mental principle, he used a scraper for forming the surfaces, instead
 of the practice previously in vogue of grinding the surfaces together.
    In the matter of screw threads and standard gauges, Whitworth
 insisted on the desirability of all engineers adopting the same
 standards, and working with them to the utmost attainable accuracy.
 He adopted the inch as his unit, but divided it decimally; and this intro
 duction of the decimal system to the British workman must in itself
 have had a very material educational effect.      In <U+FB01>re-arms, both small
 arms and artillery, the principal points on which Whitworth insisted
 were, the use of a long projectile with a great angular velocity of
 rotation about its axis, and the use of polygonal ri<U+FB02>ing of the barrel
 instead of grooves, the projectile being formed to <U+FB01>t the barrel and so

                                                .                                         I
                                              31
secure a large bearing surface.    Probably the improvements in the
manufacture of steel which are associated with the name of Whit
worth have done more for the development of the most modern artil
lery than has either of the features of his system of ri<U+FB01>ing.         His
improvements may be. broadly said to consist in three points: <U+FB01>rst,
insistance upon obtaining the best material for the purpose in the
highest purity; second, in compressing the molten steel in the ingot;
third, in forging under a hydraulic press instead of a steam hammer.
Whitworth’s published writings are comparatively few in number, but
these have a permanent interest and will always be instructive.       His
fame is rather written in iron and steel, and in the daily practice of the
mechanics who have been directly or indirectly trained by him, than
in the journals of the learned or technical societies.
                                                                                   J.     H.
  Dr. ALLEN Tuonsou,      one of the most distinguished anatomists and
 embryologists   of his time, was born in Edinburgh, Midlothian, Scot
 land, on the 2nd of April, 1809, and died in London at 66, Palace
 Gardens Terrace, on the 21st of March, 1884, in the seventy-<U+FB01>fth
 year of his age.
    His father, Dr. John Thomson, was a remarkable man, who at
 eleven years of age began life as a silk weaver’s apprentice. To this
 trade he was bound for seven years; and he continued to follow it
 in the town of Paisley for nearly two years after his apprenticeship
 had expired. His father, however, seeing that his son “took little
 interest in his trade,” bound him in 1785 (at the age of twenty years)
to Dr. White, of Paisley; and in this medical apprenticeship he con
 tinued for three years.    Subsequently, he became a pupil, in London,
 of William Hunter (brother of John Hunter), in his School of Anatomy
 at Leicester Square; and again returning to Edinburgh in 1793, he
became a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons there at the age
of twenty-eight.     Having the year before “ entered into engagements
to form an alliance in business with Mr. Arrott (a Fellow of the
 College), he continued to live under Mr. Arrott’s hospitable roof till
the autumn of 1798—a period of <U+FB01>ve years.” In 1815 he became a
Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh; and in
1808 he obtained from the University of King’s College, Aberdeen,
the degree of Doctor in Medicine.      Having <U+FB01>rst practised in Edin
burgh as a surgeon, he eventually rose to extensive practice as a
physician.    He was the <U+FB01>rst occupant of the Chairs of Military
Surgery in the University of that city, and subsequently of General
Pathology, both of which were founded on his recommendation<U+FB01>"
In 1835, at the age of <U+FB01>fty-eight, he retired from active outdoor

                 and                                          He retired
                                in          “
with the reputation   of  being    his time   the most learned physician
in Scotland. To almost the last week of his life he was a hard
student; and not even fourscore years could quench his ardour in
discoursing science, morals, or politics.      .  . He was one of the
marked men of that resolute and public-spirited class—the true Whig
party of his day—which is now (1836) rapidly disappearing.            His
peculiar usefulness arose neither from,his talents, his learning, his
warmth of heart, nor his steadiness of principle, but from his
enthusiasm.    He never knew apathy; and medicine being his <U+FB01>eld,
he was for forfy years the most eroiting of all our practitioners and of
all our teachers.   .   .  Men, especially young men of promise, were
inspired by his zeal and his con<U+FB01>dence in the triumph of truth."*
“His example had, perhaps, more in<U+FB02>uence than that of any other
individual in exciting the emulation of others.”1'
   John Thomson was therefore a man acknowledged to be of great
erudition, as his works show; and he made many important con
tributions to the medical science and literature of his time from 1765
to 1846.    He contributed valuable papers to the earlier numbers of
the ‘Edinburgh Review’; and continued (till his death in 1846) in
habits of intimate friendship with its editor, Lord eifrey; continuing        J
throughout his long life to be a man of great mark and in<U+FB02>uence in
politics and science.
   Such was the father of Allen Thomson—the subject of this notice.
   To be the son of such a father was already to be born distinguished,
and it was a still greater distinction that throughout the life of
Dr. Allen Thomson, the best characteristics of the father came to be
repeated        in   the son.               I
  His mother, Margaret Millar, was the third daughter of Mr. John
Millar, Professor of Jurisprudence in the University of Glasgow, to
whom Dr. John Thomson (then in the forty-<U+FB01>rst year of his age) was
married in 1806.
   It may be said, therefore, that Allen Themson inherited by his birth
a family connexion with two out of the four Scotch Universities—an
inheritance which at once gave him a position of in<U+FB02>uence, of much
advantage to him in future years.
   Thus it came to pass that Allen Thomson was born, nurtured, and
trained up in an atmosphere of learning and science; so that from his
very earliest years the teaching of the son by the father was such as
to lay the groundwork of a solid and purely scienti<U+FB01>c career, especially
as an investigator and teacher of Anatomy and Physiology.

    With such a father and such surroundings, he was sure to have
 the best up-bringing and best direction.             For the education of his
 boyhood he was sent to the Edinburgh High School, and had
 amongst his school-fellows John Murray—the eminent publisher—
 with whom he maintained a life-long friendship, also the present
 Lord Monerief, and Thomas Constable. His professional education
 (mainly directed by his father) was begun at the Extra-mural School,
 and completed at the University of Edinburgh, and at the medical
 schools of Paris.          In August, 1830 (at the age of twenty-one)
 he graduated as M.D. of the University of Edinburgh, when his
 graduation thesis “on the development of the heart and blood
 vessels in vertebrate animals,” was signi<U+FB01>cant of the bent of his
 mind towards embryology, and foreshadowed the honourable dis
 tinction which he subsequently achieved in that branch of biology
 which deals with developmental anatomy and physiology.                    It was
                       ‘

 Journal’), commencing in 1830, p. 295, and continuing through three
 consecutive parts of that journal—a long contribution, fully and
 beautifully illustrated by drawings mostly the work of his own facile
 pencil, and many of them coloured. At the time of his graduation
 he was Presidentof the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh—a
 students’ society, which has contributed, and continues to contribute,
 not a little to the fame of the Medical School of that city, inasmuch
 as on the roll of its Presidents will be found the names of many, who
 in after-life became distinguished members and leaders in the pro
 fession."I    The year after graduation (1830) Allen Thomson became a
 Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, as a necessary
 preliminary to his being quali<U+FB01>ed as a teacher there. It was his own
 wish and his father’s great desire that he should become a teacher of
anatomy, and devote himself to anatomical and physiological pur
suits, for which he had displayed a decided predilection, and to which
 (as his thesis showed) he had already given a considerable share of
attention.
     With this object in view, and following the example of his friend
Dr. Sharpey, he travelled by himself on the Continent in 1831. His
copious notes show that he then particularly interested himself in
the preparations          in Vrolik’s Museum at Amsterdam, which he
describes as a valuable collection in a state of excellent preservation.
In it he notes a very <U+FB01>ne collection of skulls of different nations and
   l" “ On its roll are inscribed the honoured names of Thomas Addison, Richard
Bright, Marshall Hall, Henry Holland, and others of Metropolitan fame, with
those of equal distinction associated with the Scottish and Irish Universities and

ages; and among those of executed criminals, of which several were
those of murderers, “there is the skull of Renier, a celebrated
murderer of the worst class, which Gall, when asked regarding the
collection, singled out and set aside as one clearly not belonging to a
murderer l” He also notes “a protuberance inside the inner canthus
                      J
of the orbit in a ew’s skull, which Vrolik considered as peculiar to
that race.”       Next came notes of the Strasburg and the Berlin
Museums. In this latter he made a great number of notes, especially
bearing on the embryos of animals and the details of embryology
generally; dissections of varieties in the arrangement of the aorta
and adjoining vessels; transpositions of viscera and teratology—
making drawings as well as notes of what he saw.                 He was particu
larly interested in a human foetus 481) at three weeks, in which the
branchial arches are seen ; as well as the split between them into the
               “ He was allowed to take this
pharynx.                                          preparation from its bottle,
to place it in a watch glass to make a drawing of it”; and to note
its measurements.        The marks of the eye and ear were both easily
seen, and the superior maxillary fold connected                with the inferior
round the angles of        the   month.    He  notes  also   the  heart partially
divided into two ventricles.
    On his return to Edinburgh after this short sojourn on the Conti
nent, he commenced his career as a teacher by starting as an extra
acadcmical lecturer on anatomy and physiology.                  “In this under
taking he was associated with the late Dr. William Sharpey—(his
senior by only seven years)——-who ultimately became Professor of
Physiology in University College, London, and with whom Allen
Thomson maintained a life-long friendship of the closest possible
character.” Six years ago (March, 1881), when writing to his pupil,
John Struthers, the distinguished Professor of Anatomy in Aberdeen,
he says: “Sharpey and             I  lectured together at No. 9, Surgeou's
Square,     from  1831   till  1836,  when 1 left on account of my health
being rather impaired.        He   taught the Anatomy and I the Physiology
but in the later years, as my father urged me very much to prepare
myself for Anatomy, I took a share in the Anatomy teaching by
attending in the dissecting room and giving some demonstrations.”
At this time a keen competition existed among the four teachers,
 who, in addition to the Professors within the University, divided
 among them the students who applied for instruction.                   It was no
 light undertaking      at   that  time  to  become  a teacher    of Anatomy in
 Edinburgh.       In 1828      a  series  of murders were brought to light
 which had been e<U+FB01>ected by two notorious criminals—-Burke and
 Hare—for the money they would obtain for the bodies of their
 victims as material for the dissecting rooms; and for many years

afterwards the public mind continued to be excited by the recollec
tion of tragedies unprecedented in the history of mankind, and which
scarcely subsided even with the passing of Warburton’s “Anatomy
Act ” in 1832, which made it possible to obtain and dissect the
human body in a legal way. In the University of Edinburgh, the
third Monro <U+FB01>lled the Chair of Anatomy, himself a good anatomist
of the old school, who looked upon the new teachers with an easy
disregard.      But while Sharpey and Allen Thomson’s class between
1831 to 1836 had increased from twenty-two to eighty-eight, the
majority of the students <U+FB02>ocked to the brilliant but egotistical
lectures of the famous Robert Knox, who in one year about this time
had an extra-mural class of over 500 students. With unscrupulous
virulence he brought his powers of ridicule and sarcasm to bear on
all opponents, so that Allen Thomson and Sharpey came in for their
full share<U+FB01>" About this time also a number of men who afterwards
became famous were either students or extra-mural teachers, so that
there was the keen contest of able intellects, and the rivalry of a
noble ambition—the names of John Reid, Martin Barry, the two
Goodsirs (John and Henry), Edward Forbes, W. B. Carpenter, John
Hughes Bennett, are names which became distinguished in biological
science; and in such an atmosphere of thought it is no wonder
that Allen Thomson was encouraged to prosecute a purely scienti<U+FB01>c
careersf'          ,
    All are gone;      none now remain, and the melancholy death of        Dr.
Carpenter in 1885 severed the last link which connected them with
what was undoubtedly “a. brilliant epoch in the history of the Edin
burgh Medical School.”
    In 1833, Dr. Allen Thomson travelled with his father on the Conti
nent for nearly three months, visiting the principal medical schools in
Holland, Germany, Italy, and France.              It is interesting to <U+FB01>nd in
Dr. Allen Thomson’s brief journal of his travels, now before the
writer, such entries regarding museum specimens as he saw might
be useful for teaching purposes.          In these notes he frequently makes
a special memorandum of the preparations which should be made
for the use of his class when he had the chance of doing so on his
return to Edinburgh.          He gives an amusing account of his journey
to London by sea in those days.
                                                                      “ Soho,”

from Newhaven, on the afternoon of Saturday, 6th July, 1833, after
two days’ sailing he reached Blackwall, whence he drove to London,
and “put up at the Burlington Hotel, held by Atkinson Morley, in
Cork Street, No. 35.”

   His <U+FB01>rst visits in London were to Dr. and Mrs. James Somerville,
John Allen, and John Murray; and at 30, Old Burlington Street,
while waiting for John Allen, he <U+FB01>rst made the acquaintance of
Sydney Smith. Medical education was then (1833) as now (1887),
the serious subject of discussion; and Mr. Allen was of opinion
that “ superior degrees should be granted by Universities, with full
preliminary education ensured by a degree of M.A., and diplomas for
general practitioners should be granted by chartered bodies, after
wards to be decided upon.”       He disapproved of legal prosecution of
the unlicensed, unless they do harm, or take titles they have no
right to.
   Mr. Allen introduced his namesake, Allen Thomson, at this time to
Lord and Lady Holland; and he was afterwards introduced to Lord
Melbourne by Lady Holland, at Holland House, with the words,
“Melbourne, allow me to introduce to you the future Professor of
Anatomy in the University of Glasgow.” Allen Thomson hadto wait,
however, for <U+FB01>fteen years before that promotion took place.          During
this visit to London he also spent some of his time with his half
brother, Dr. William Thomson, James Simpson, and Dr. Carswell,
who was then lecturing at University College, London.
   Dr. Allen Thomson was then much interested in the work of Clift
and of Owen, at the Hunterian       Museum, especially in the admirable
series  of preparations of comparative anatomy, and the beautiful
manner in which vegetable structure is illustrated.         He also records
                                  “ Make some
the signi<U+FB01>cant memorandum,                        preparations of this kind
for myself.” Breakfasting at, Sir Astley Cooper’s. he had “a very
i Iteresting demonstration from him of his preparations of the thymus
                                               “
gland and testicle,” and mentions that           Sir Astley lectured with a
great deal of spirit, and took the trouble to carry about 100 prepara
tions from one room to another.” Allen Thomson admired particularly
the dry preparations of the thymus gland at different ages, in'which
the sacculi of the body itself are injected with wax, the arteries, veins,
and particularly the lymphatics being injected and painted of various
colours. Again he makes the memorandum, “ Make some of these
preparations in the foetal calf.”      Sir Astley then demonstrated his
preparation   of the structure  of the testicles; and again, the memoran
dum, “Dr. Sharpey and I must have some similar injections of the
tubes with wax, &c.”         He visited Guy’s Hospital Museum with
Hodgkin, and there he bears his testimony to the beauty and accuracy
of the wax models of diseases of the skin and of healthy anatomy,
made by Joseph Townes.         His father joined him on 15th of June, in
London. On the 17th they started for Rotterdam. Thence by Dussel
dorf and Delft to Bonn.         He gives a very detailed account of the
contents of the Museum at Bonn.           He also describes the surgical
“ klinik,” “ conducted by questioning the students
                                                         respecting patients

                                       xvii
committed to their care. There were then two “ kliniks” for medicine,
by Nasse, an advanced one, and an elementary one, intended to teach
students how to conduct the advanced one. Meyer he also met, who
had been Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Bonn, and pupil
of Kielmeyer, “ of whose views and lectures he spoke in terms of high
admiration.”     He met also Treviranus (the younger), Professor of
Botany,    Bischoff, Neumann. and Weber, the then Prosector.                  He
notes a case in the dissecting room of the whole body of a man in
whom there was complete situs inversus of all the viscera; and the
writer well remembers what interest Allen Thomson took in the dis
section of a similar complete case of inversion of the viscera, which
occurred in the dissecting room of the Glasgow University."
   At Heidelberg he met Tiedemann, and carefully noted the contents
of his museum.       At Strasburg he met Ehrmann, and made copious
notes   of   his museum.     At Tiibingen he met Autenrieth and his
prosector, Professor Bauer. There he visited “the little dirty class
room in which Haller and Cuvier studied.” Thence to Stuttgart
and on to Freyburg, in Baden, and to Zurich.               Here he met. with
Oken, then Rector of the University; also Schoeulein, Professor
of Medicine, and other distinguished teachers; thence to Berue,
Lausanne, and Geneva.        He next visited Aix-en-Savoie, or Aix-les
Bains, and Milan.
   At Milan he was shown great attention by Professor Panizza, the
successor of Scarpa; and at Parma, by Professor Tommassi, and by
Pasquali, the Professor of Anatomy.          Here he found the University
partly broken up, and about half the building occupied as a
bar-rack for soldiers, in order to repress the revolutionary spirit
of the students.      He notices in Professor Pasquali’s Museum of
Anatomy, that “the dried muscular and arterial preparations were
entirely painted,” and puts the question, “Why is this so seldom
done; it seems to preserve the preparation well, and to make it more
clear P” He afterwards, in Glasgow, adopted this method to a great
extent in all dried preparations.       At Bologna he notes that at present
(August, 1833), the University is “in disgrace, and no lectures except
the experimental ones are allowed to be given. The Professors are
obliged to give their lectures at their own homes, and soldiers are
placed at the doors."        He notes that “Comparative Anatomy is
taught by Professor Alessandrini, under the name of ‘Veterinary
Anatomy,’ the former title being considered by the Pope as of a
revolutionary nature.” He saw some beautifully injected fcetal mem—
branes, more particularly of the true allantoid of the mare, and of the
endochorion and the decidua in the bitch.
   At Home he notes that, “ as in the rest of the Papal States, science

is at present (September, 1833) much repressed by the fear of insub
ordination among the students; and that there is great dif<U+FB01>culty in
publishing or procuring scienti<U+FB01>c works.”
     At Naples, with Dr. Vulpes, he met Dr. Asalini, of Messina, and
visited the Museo Borbonico, the collection of antiquities from Pompeii
 and Herculaneum.       He then visited both those places, and ascended
 Mount Vesuvius, the craters of which are minutely described in his
 carefully written journal.    At the Grotto del Cane he saw the usual
 experiment    of asphyxiating the dog.     “The animal fell into a faint
 without convulsions, and the pupil dilated at the same moment that
 the voluntary motions ceased, which took place in from two and a. half
 to three minutes after the animal was placed in the cave.”          Genoa
 and Montpellier were next visited.      There, he notes, a “ capital series
 of sterno-hyoid bones, bones of the skull, &c., for anatomical demon
 stration, of which we ought to have some.”
     At Lyons he met Dr. Bennett, who was travelling with Lord
 Beverley and the Percy family, and renewed his acquaintance with
 M. Bouchet and M. Gensoul, who had both been in Edinburgh.
     A very detailed but concise account is given of the anatomical,
 pathological, and comparative anatomy preparations in Meckel’s
 Museum, illustrated with some very beautiful pen and ink drawings,
 especially one of the heart in a case of partial inversion of the viscera,
 in which there was no vena cava. inferior, but the cave. superior was
 joined by the vena azygos before entering the auricle, the name hepa
 ticaa going directly into the auricle through the diaphragm.      There is
 also a specimen with the aorta on the right       side.  Similar  detailed
 records are given of Vrolik’s Museum at Amsterdam in 1831, and of
 the Berlin Museum.
     Lastly, out of the experiences of these travels he formulates an
 extensive list of preparations “ to be made” for teaching purposes.
     At Paris, he met Rayer, Lerminier, Bouillaud, Roux, and Dalmas;
 and visited a separate ward for cholera patients in La Charité, where
 he “saw three women who were recovering under the in<U+FB02>uence of
 opium, ice, and bleeding 1"
     It was by such Continental travel, with the one object before him
 of preparing himself for his duties as a teacher of anatomy and
 physiology, that he devoted himself with the greatest diligence and
 care to literary and scienti<U+FB01>c study, and to the study of languages.
 As travelling physician with the Duke of Bedford, he again spent a
 considerable time on the Continent, thereby perfecting his knowledge
 of German, French, and Italian.
     Of the men who mainly in<U+FB02>uenced the scienti<U+FB01>c life of Allen
 Thomson (besides his father’s in<U+FB02>uence) there are three especially
 to be noted, namely, John Allen, Dr. John Gordon, and Dr. Sharpey.
     While still a house surgeon in the Royal In<U+FB01>rmary of Edinburgh,

                                              xix
 the father of Allen Thomson became the friend of John Allen, who
 was associated with him in the duties of the house, and with whom,
 up to the time of Mr. Allen’s death in 1843, he maintained an unin
 terrupted friendship, and to the powerful in<U+FB02>uence of which over the
 fortunes of his life he has himself borne testimony in the dedication
 to Mr. Allen of the <U+FB01>rst volume of his ‘ Life of Cullen.’*
     Dr. John Thomson named his son Allen after his distinguished
 friend.
     Dr. John Gordon died in 1818, thirteen years before Allen
 Thomson began to lecture and teach Anatomy.                           After Dr. John
 Allen had ceased to lecture, Dr. John Gordon (having taught
 Anatomy and Physiology together for two years, 1808—1810) gave a
 course of Physiology separate from his course of Anatomy either in
 the winter ensuing or in the summer session; and for his character
 and work Allen Thomson had a great veneration. In writing, three
 years before he died, to Professor John Struthers, and referring to
 Gordon, he says: “ I am especially pleased with your recognition of
 John Gordon’s character and work, which is not only perfectly true
 as regards himself, but gives some indication of the in<U+FB02>uence which
my father exercised upon his pupils and the School of Edinburgh.
 I have still all Gordon’s papers, as well as John Allen’s.”
    Dr. Sharpey’s in<U+FB02>uence was that which made itself felt through a
life-long friendship of the closest kind, bound together, as he and
Allen Thomson were, in allied anatomical and physiological pursuits.
 Sharpey was one of the young men in Edinburgh who owed the direc
tion of their studies and inspiration to John Thomson, and this
debt he repaid to his son Allen by an a<U+FB01>ectionate friendship. He was
about twenty-nine years of age, and Dr. Allen Thomson twenty-two,
when they commenced to teach Anatomy and Physiology together in
Edinburgh in 1831. This association subsisted during the four follow
ing years till 1836, when Dr. Sharpey became Professor of Physiology
in University College, London.
    Dr. Allen Thomson spent the autumns of 1836 and 1837 at Rethi
mnrchus, in the Western Highlands of Scotland, near Aviemore, with
the Bedford family, and afterwards began his four on the Continent
with    them.
    On his return in 1839 he was appointed (at the age of thirty) Pro
fessor of Anatomy in the Marisehal College and University                                 of
Aberdeen, which he resigned in 1841. Returning to Edinburgh in
the autumn, he became once more a teacher of Anatomy in the

Extra-mural School, No. l, Surgeon’s Square, at the age of thirty
two, where he continued to give systematic lectures on Anatomy.
At 11 A.M a lecture-room demonstration was given, and he taught
in the dissecting room at one o’clock, assisted by demonstrators, the
chief of whom was Dr. Gunning, who had accompanied him from
Aberdeen, and who has since given to the University of Edinburgh
a fund for prizes in memory of the teachers of his day.
   Professor John Struthers, of Aberdeen, bears the following testi
mony to the valued teachings of Allen Thomson :—
   “Allen Thomson’s lectures on Anatomy were of a high order
scienti<U+FB01>cally, and also in style contrasted favourably with the teaching
in the other schools.      His favourite subject was embryology. That
could not come in much in the ordinary course, but in the summer of
1842 he delivered a special course of lectures on Development, in
which he gave the results of his own researches, as well as those of the
German observers.         These lectures were illustrated by a very large
number of beautiful diagrams, and were attended by many members
of the medical profession of Edinburgh. His graduation thesis had
been on the development of the heart and great blood-vessels in the
vertebrata, showing an early direction of his mind to the subject of
embryology.       In that summer session he gave also a course of weekly
lectures on the new Microscopic Anatomy, which followed the publi
cation of the great work of Schwann. In these lectures we heard much
of Schwann, Henle, and Kiilliker, the latter of whom became his inti
mate and life-long friend.       To this time the microscope had not been
much used in the school.        The cell doctrine of Schwann had cleared
up the confusion of the old general anatomy, although the revolution
it was to effect in biology, in relation to the evolution as well as to the
structure of organic forms, was hardly foreseen.         Knox, whose forte
was Comparative Anatomy and its bearings on human anatomy, was
satirizing the microscope, as he did most things.        Sharpey had been
using    it in  the investigation  of  ciliary motion.  John Goodsir, Con
servator of the large and valuable Anatomical and Pathological
 Museum of the College of Surgeons, gave a few original lectures to
the Fellows of the Colleges on Cells, and on Germinal Centres; and
 Allen Thomson used it in his researches on Development. But then,
 and for years afterwards, the student had nothing of the microscope
 beyond the privilege of a peep through Allen Thomson’s and John
 Goodsir’s on a Saturday.          The work which Allen Thomson did
 during this year in Edinburgh secured the success of his subsequent
 career.     His abilities as a teacher and observer were fully recognised
 by the medical profession of Edinburgh.”
    The principal reason of his apparently sudden return to Edinburgh
 may be explained by the fact that the Chair of Physiology in Edin
 burgh University was expected to become vacant by the transference

                                       xxi
of Dr. Alison to the Chair of the Practice of Medicine; and to sue
ceed to the Chair of Physiology was the object of Allen Thomson’s
laudable ambition<U+FB01>“        Forthwith in the autumn of 1841 Professor
Alison resigned the Chair of Institutes of Medicine or Physiology in
the University of Edinburgh, and in 1842 Allen Thomson was ap
pointed his successor at the age of thirty-three.              The contest was
severe with such formidable competitors as Robert Knox, John Reid,
Hughes Bennett, and ‘V. B. Carpenter.            He held this Professorship
in Edinburgh for six years, and during that time he made several im
portant contributions to the science of embryology.              He at the same
time made the course on physiology systematic and complete, devoting
himself entirely to the teaching of physiology proper. His lectures
were prepared with great care, and a very elaborate synopsis of the
day's subject was written in chalk on blackboards for the students to
copy, supplemented by drawings in coloured chalk, often very elabo
rate, and numerous wall diagrams.            (A goodly MS. volume of such
abstracts is in the writer’s possession.)
   Allen Thomson’s familiarity with what was being done in Germany
and France gave breadth and thoroughness to his teaching. He took
great pains in making his drawings and in writing the heads of the
lectures before the time of meeting; and like his friend Dr. Sharpey,
he lectured mainly from short notes.                He was systematic and
methodical in everything, and took great pains to perfect his teaching
in every way; and every course of lectures he delivered, whether to
a popular or professional audience, cost him much labour from day to
day.   On debatable points, and where de<U+FB01>nite conclusions had not
been arrived at, he was careful to give us the views of observers on
opposite sides, but it was tantalising in the extreme when at the end
we could not learn what his own views were.             This was all the more
distracting  because   he  was  so full  of knowledge, so clear in his state
ment, and so sound in his judgment.           But the weak part (or perhaps
strong part) in Allen Thomson’s mental development appeared to be
so great an excess of caution in coming to a de<U+FB01>nite conclusion that
he seemed always to hold his mind open to receive and digest new
matter. He was thus prevented from making any broad generalisation
with which his name can be associated.
   In all his researches his mind inclined more to the anatomical
than to the physiological side of biology, having more to do with the
development of form than the development of function; and when
the Chair of Anatomy in Glasgow University became vacant by the
death of Dr. James      J elfray in 1848, Allen Thomson became his suc
cessor at the age of thirty-nine.        His introduction by Lady Holland
to Lord Melbourne (in 1833) <U+FB01>fteen years before, and already referred
to, shows that Allen Thomson was destined for that chair as a political
                 i“ ‘ Memoir,’              John

inheritance;     for then,     as   now,    political   connexion in<U+FB02>uences the
chances  of scienti<U+FB01>c appointments; and according as a Whig or Tory
Government was in the ascendant, it was known that Allen Thomson
or a political opponent would obtain the chair. But when Dr. eifray     J
vacated his chair it was given to Allen Thomson with universal
approval. He thus returned to the teaching of anatomy as .to his <U+FB01>rst
love, remaining constant to its teaching in the Glasgow University
with great distinction in the professorship. He resigned it in 1877,
when he was succeeded by its present distinguished occupant, Pro
fessor Cleland, who had been one of his demonstrators in previous
years.
  During   these previous twenty-<U+FB01>ve years of teaching anatomy and
physiology, Allen Thomson had the unique experience of having been
a professor    in three out of
                             the four of the Scottish Universities, and
in all of them there is evidence that he worked with an indefatigable
industry, not only in connexion with the immediate duties of the
chair he held, but as a frequent contributor to scienti<U+FB01>c literature.
Thus it came to pass that his reputation, as a teacher and as a man
of science, steadily increased; and at the end of his days he had
become generally known throughout the scienti<U+FB01>c world as one of the
most careful, judicious, accurate, and learned         investigators and
teachers of his favourite subjects.    His very earliest work brought
him reputation as an embryologist, and herein lay his speciality,
so that throughout his long and busy life he was constantly making
important contributions to that department of science.
   He retired from his Chair of Anatomy in the University of Glasgow
at the age of sixty-eight, having <U+FB01>lled it for the long period of twenty
niue years; and the work he accomplished there “ may be said to
have been of two kinds: one, the introduction of the modern anatomy
and methods of teaching        by which he laid the foundation of the
                                 it,
eminence and success which the Glasgow School of Medicine has since
attained, an object which he had warmly at heart; the other, also
contributory to that end, namely, the planning and erection of the
New University buildings, in which great undertaking he was from
the beginning the moving spirit.”
   Succeeding a teacher who had held the Chair of Anatomy in Glas
                                             “
gow for the long term of <U+FB01>fty-eight years,        may be readily believed
                                                        it
that Allen Thomson’s anatomy and methods were a new revelation in
the old monastic building of that university.”        As in Edinburgh,
when the third Monro at last (in 1846) made way for John Goodsir,
the tide turned from the extra-mural school to the university; so the
Glasgow School of Medicine, when Allen Thomson became Professor
of Anatomy, began to take the high rank to which the new colleagues
who gradually gathered round him have contributed their part.‘

     Shortly after coming to Glasgow, his son and only child was born
  in  1849.   After that he took Greenhall in 1852, about eight miles
  from Glasgow, and afterwards Millheugh, where, as he always had a
  great love of country life, he betook himself in the autumnal holidays,
  hospitably entertaining his many guests.         Dr. Sharpey paid him
  regular summer visits. In 1855 came the meeting of the British
  Association in Glasgow, and among the guests then with him were
  his friends, Professor Kdlliker of Wiirzburg and Professors Retzius
  and Broberg from Sweden.         In 1857 he rented Hatton House near
  Ratho, some miles from Edinburgh, and took great interest in this old
  place.   There he became acquainted with the Lauderdale family to
  whom the property originally belonged, and there he received his old
  Edinburgh friends, Syme, Bennett, Christison, Douglas Maclagan,
  Andrew Wood, Sharpey, and Kdlliker. He took much interest in the
  garden and in garden work, and his acquaintance with Mr. Archer the
  artist, brought him into the pursuit of photography, which gave him
  a new pleasure.
     In 1862 he left Hatton, having purchased some acres of ground at
  Skelmorlie on the Clyde, where he built a house in accordance with
  his own plans. The later editions of Quain’s ‘ Anatomy ’ were written
  here with Dr. Sharpey during the summer months; and here he also
  enjoyed his leisure moments with his friend Professor Kolliker, in the
  examination of marine animals.
     About this time the work commenced with the New University of
   Glasgow buildings, and from 1863, when the old college buildings
   were at last disposed of to a railway company, until 1870, when the
  classes met for the <U+FB01>rst time in the new buildings on Gilmorehill,
  Allen Thomson, as Chairman of Buildings Committee, was largely
  occupied with the anxieties and plans of the undertaking.             He
  did all the duty of a “ Master of Works,” and his frequent exposure
  during the erection of the building brought on a tendency to rheuma
  tism with a severe attack of sciatica. He further took a similarly
’
  active part in the planning and erection of the new—the Western
  In<U+FB01>rmary of Glasgow, the funds for which were mainly contributed
  by public subscription.     This hospital is generally considered to be a
  model hospital.    It has recently been greatly enlarged on the original
  plan  ; and when Dr. Thomson retired from the Chair of Anatomy in
  1877, he had already realised the pleasure    of seeing the great success
  of the Glasgow Medical School which he had done so much to
  develop.
     In 1870 he ceased to live at Skelmorlie, which he let and afterwards
  sold; and in 1871 his only son, John Miller Thomson, settled in
  London as one of the assistant demonstrators on chemistry at King’s
  College. The summer of this year was spent with his son and
  Mrs. Thomson in the Highlands of Scotland.        “ It was,”
                                                               he writes in

                                    xxiv
September, 1871, “a great success for me and Mrs. Allen to come
here (Lynvilg-Avieore) for a holiday.         I  knew the country well
from my‘residence at Rothiemurchus (close by) with the Bedford
family in the autumn of 1836 and 1837; and         I had most agreeable
recollections  of   rambles among the Grampians     and  various parts of
the neighbourhood.      Mrs. Allen and I have not exactly rambled over
the top of Cairngorm and Ben Muichdhui as we used to do when some
what younger, but we have really done an immense deal of walking
for such old people, and have pro<U+FB01>ted in health, and enjoyed our~
selves to the full.   The scenery is just what we like—grand and open
and yet beautifully combined with river, lake, natural wood, rock, and
mountain.     The birches especially are charming, and the remains of
some of the old Calcdoniau forests of Scotch <U+FB01>rs, some of the best
existing. I am sorry to think the time of our remaining here approaches
its termination, as I must be in Glasgow for meetings on the 20th,
and intend to leave this on the 19th.”
   In 1872 he again went abroad with his family and with Dr. Sharpey
to visit Professor Kolliker and other friends in Germany, and in the
summer of that year be extended his tour to the north of Italy. The
summer of 1873 found him once more travelling in the north of
 Scotland, and visiting his many friends.
   On his son’s marriage to Miss Aikin in 1875, he began to think
seriously of retiring from his professorship; and after some delay,
<U+FB01>nally ceased his active connexion with the University of Glasgow
in 1877—a connexion which had extended through different members
of the family without interruption for 116 years.        He then came to
London, where he took a house next to that of his son. Here he took
an interest in all that was going on in the world of science—occupying
himself especially in the alfairs and work of the Royal Society. He
was now able to enjoy, and he much appreciated the quiet home-life
he was able to lead in peaceful retirement, “listening to the innocent
prattle of his grandchildren."      It was a new pleasure and an amuse
ment to have them with him in his study.
   It is not easy to convey to others a suf<U+FB01>cient appreciation of
Dr. Allen Thomson’s numerous contributions to biological science.
His earlier papers were on embryology, which throughout life con
tinued to be the favourite subject of his study and researches, working
hard to keep pace with the rapid progress of the science.       It was in
this  <U+FB01>eld that   he  won  his laurels; and although  his  name   may not
be associated     in the history of that science with any one great
discovery (although be contributed many new facts), yet he will
always be regarded as having done much, perhaps more than
anyone else in this country, to make this di<U+FB02>icult department of
biological science familiar to British biologists.       He directed his
attention to it when few in this country did so, and did much by

                                     XXV
clear and accurate description to make intelligible the writings of the
German embryologists.         No one rejoiced. more at the attention given
to it by a rising school of British embryologists, nor mourned more
deeply the sad death on the Alps of its leader, the late Francis M.
Balfour of Cambridge. He was one of the <U+FB01>rst also to bring under
the notice of British physiologists the researches of Weber on the
                                                                ‘
tactile sensibility of the skin, and he wrote largely for the Cyclopae
dia of Anatomy and Physiology,’ edited by Todd and Bowman.             The
                                “ Generation,” and “ Ovum,” are from his
articles on “ Circulation,"

             ’
Britannica he contributed articles on kindred subjects. The article
“ Ovum ” in the latter was prepared by him, and over it he worked
to the end with ardent love and care; but since his death another
band has been employed to write it. He also wrote on physiological
optics, more especially on the mechanism by which the eye accommo
dates or focuses itself for objects at different distances; and his
name has long been associated          with current editions of Quain’s
  System of Human Anatomy,’ as editor especially of the descriptive
‘
parts of the seventh and eighth editions. 1n the seventh edition
he was associated        with Professors Sharpey and Cleland, in the
eighth with Professors Sharpey and Schafer, and in the ninth
and last edition with Professor Schafer and Professor Thane, both of
University College, London. Alike with pen and pencil Dr. Thomson
made important additions to their great work, especially ‘An Outline
of the Development of the Foetus.’         He also edited a second edition
                  ‘
of his father’s Life of Cullen.’      To the Royal Societies of Edinburgh
 and London, and British and Foreign medical journals, he contributed
numerous special papers and articles. The Royal Society’s Catalogue
 contains the titles of about twenty papers by him.
    During his distinguished career Dr. Allen Thomson received many
 scienti<U+FB01>c honours.     He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of
 Edinburgh in 1838, and of the Royal Society of London in 184-8.
 After his removal to London from Glasgow in 1877, he became <U+FB01>rst a
 Councillor of the Royal Society, and ultimately one of the Vice
 Presidents.    He was President of the Philosophical Societv, of the
 Medico-Chirurgical      Society, and of the Science Lectures Association
 in Glasgow,   in   which city he was also the <U+FB01>rst President of the Local
 Branch of the British Medical Association.         For eighteen years he
 was a member of the General Medical Council for the Universities of
 Glasgow and St. Andrews jointly, from 1859 to 1877, where his ripe
 experience and calm judgment enabled him to do good service to the
 cause of medical education.       In 1871 he was President of the Biolo
 gical Section of the British Association at the meeting in Edinburgh,
 and in his address he reviewed the progress of biological science
  within the period of his own recollection. In 1876 the Association

                                    xxvi
conferred on him its highest honour by electing him to the Presi
dential Chair.   At the meeting at Plymouth in 1877, his calm, far
seeing, and philosophical address on his favourite topic, “The De
velopment of the Forms of Animal Life," was a masterly history of
the gradual acceptance of the doctrines connected with the name of
Darwin, whose important generalisations his open and receptive mind
had long before accepted.     In l871 Dr. Allen Thomson received from
his university the degree of LL.D., a degree which was also conferred
upon him by the Glasgow University in 1877.
   In 1882 he received the degree of D.C.L. from the University of
Oxford; and latterly he was elected to at least one Syndicate of the
University of Cambridge to assist in the election of professors to the
Biological Chairs. Whilst thus pursuing a purely and steadfast scient<U+FB01>c
career, Dr. Allen Thomson was well known as one of the most active
and in<U+FB02>uential men in the city of Glasgow.
   The friendly hand that wrote the obituary notice in the ‘ Glasgow
Herald,’ from which much of this memoir has been compiled, has
given the following characteristic word picture of Dr. Allen Thomson:
—“ He took a deep interest in almost all departments of science. He
was a ready listener, and always delighted to hear an account of anew
investigation.   Eager in the pursuit of truth himself, he, above all
things, demanded accuracy. He was critical on all questions, and it
required a- great deal of fact and argument to lead him to a change of
scienti<U+FB01>c opinion.    Yet his mind was open and receptive, and he did
not shrink from a change of view although it went against his precon
ceived notions.    His own writings are models of clearness of state
ment and skilful marshalling of facts.       Dr. Allen Thomson’s mode of
teaching was of the same character. Method, order, precision of
statement, and close reasoning shone in every lecture; while there
was also the persuasive eloquence of a great enthusiasm which capti
vated the listener.”
   As a teacher he was equalled by few and surpassed by none of the
many colleagues amongst whom he taught.             His education and sur
roundings   made   him   a teacher,  and   to  that   work he bent all his
energies.   Those only   who  have  been   associated  with him as demon
strators of anatomy in his dissecting rooms in Edinburgh, Aberdeen,
and Glasgow, can appreciate the daily labours he went through in
preparing and arranging the material for his lectures and demonstra
tions. Personally he was much beloved by his students, who are
generally remarkable for devotion to a teacher who takes pains to
                    “ In the social circle there was much
teach as he did.                                             gentleness and
simplicity of manner, along with a keen sense of humour, while his
domestic life throughout was characterised by a quiet kindliness, and
that chivalrous attention to little details of personal courtesy which
mark the true gentleman.”

                                              xxv<U+FB01>
   “One   can   never    forget the kindly courtesy, the simplicity of
address, the indescribable     charm of his manner, the warmth of his
 friendship.”    Loyalty  to his friends was a typical characteristic of his
 affectionate nature.
     Inheriting the best characteristics of his father, with himself as
 with his father “he was a discerning and attached patron of youth
 ful and friendless merit; so that there are many who owe their rise
 in life to him, and who bless his memory all over the world.”*          In
 evidence of this we have the testimony of the Treasurer of the Royal
 Society, in his eloquent address on December 1st, 1884, when he said,
 in his notice of Dr. Allen Thomson’s death, that “ for acts of kind
 ness there must be many besides myself who owe him a deep debt of
 gratitude.”# The writer of this paper fully endorses this statement,
 and with gratitude acknowledges the many acts of kindness he
‘received    from Allen Thomson throughout a brotherly, or rather
 father-like friendship of more than thirty-six years.        So also Dr.
 George Johnson, in his address as President of the Medico-Chirurgical
  Society, on March 2nd, 1885, thus spoke of him :—“ Dr. Allen
 Thomson will long be held in affectionate remembrance, not only for
 the extent and variety of his scienti<U+FB01>c attainments, but for his wisdom
 in council, the genuine kindly courtesy which gave an indescribable
 charm to his manner, and the enduring warmth of his friendship}
     On his retirement from the University of Glasgow, in 1877, his
 portrait, painted by the President of the Royal Scottish Academy
 of Arts, the late Sir Daniel Macnee, was presented by his friends
 and admirers to the University, and it now hangs in the Hunterian
 Museum, to hand down to future generations the cherished features
 of so beloved a man. A replica of this portrait was presented to
  Mrs. Thomson.
     Dr. Thomson has left a widow and an only son, Mr. John Millar
  Thomson, Demonstrator on Chemistry in King’s College, London, and
  Secretary to the Chemical Society of London.         Up to within four
  months of his death Dr. Thomson appeared to be in excellent health,
  and looked forward to the pleasure of being in Edinburgh at the
  approaching tercentenary. In 1883 he went with his wife to Cannes,
  on January 3rd, and spent the cold months and spring there, and the
  summer was once more passed with his son, daughter-in-law, and
  grandchildren    in the West Highlands of Scotland, with much
  pleasure in revisiting scenes with which he had been so familiar in
  earlier days.    Suddenly, on December 14th, from his house in
  London, he wrote to say that his left eye had not been quite
  so well of late, and that Mr. John Couper and Sir William Bowman

 both concurred in the opinion that an iridectomy should be performed
 without delay. Accordingly, on the following day, Mr. Couper did an
 iridectomy on the left eye, on account of glaucoma. Nothing could
 have been more satisfactory than his recovery from the operation.
 The wound healed without pain, vision was maintained, and normal
 tension restored. About ten to fourteen days after the operation he
 began to experience lancinating pain referred to the ears and base of
 the skull, which he attributed to the east wind and rheumatism, as
 there was no change in either eye to account for the pain, and no
 external swelling.   He woke in the morning to <U+FB01>nd that he had been
 struck blind of the right eye (which up till that moment had been
 perfect). Mr. Couper saw him forthwith, and found the tension
 normal, but there was a considerable area of the <U+FB01>eld of vision blind,
 the limit coming close to the centre.        He could only distinguish large
 letters. Next day the main branch of the arteria centralis was seen
 to be plugged with blood-clot, the portion of vessel beyond the
'plug empty, and so for many weeks vision was entirely lost. From
this it was feared that other arteries might be similarly plugged in
 adjoining parts. Dr. George Johnson also saw him with Mr. Couper
 and Mr. C. A. Aikin, and found that the cardiac valves were sound.
  It was thus probable that the vessels became plugged owing to
 degeneration of their coats at the plugged part. Gradually the
 plugging process extended, and about the fourth month after the
 illness began some local paralyses became developed, <U+FB01>rst in the left
 hand, thumb and fore<U+FB01>nger, which passed away, and afterwards in the
 muscles of the right side of the face ; the vagus also became implicated,
 so that hiccough was more or less constant, relieved only by chloro
 form. His strength was reduced by protracted suffering, and even
 tually breathing became obstructed. He died at 66, Palace-gardens
 Terrace, W., on March 21st, 1884, in the seventy-<U+FB01>fth year of his
 age; and as he wrote of his friend Sharpey, so it may be written of
 himself: “ He had not a single enemy, and he numbered among his
 friends all those who ever had the advantage of being in his society.“E
 His memory will long be cherished in the hearts of thousands of his
 pupils at home and abroad, alike in civil and in military life.
