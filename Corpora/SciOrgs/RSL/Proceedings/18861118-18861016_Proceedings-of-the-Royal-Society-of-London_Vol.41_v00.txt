     The   opinions of physicists and geologists as to what may be the
  probable thickness of the crust of the Earth differ very materially.
  On the strength of its great rigidity and the absence of tides,
  physicists contend for a maximum thickness and the comparative
  solidity of the whole mass of the globe. On the evidence of volcanic
  action, the crumpling and folding of the strata in mountain ranges,
  its general flexibility down to the most recent geological times, and
  the rate of increase of temperature in descending beneath the sur
   face, geologists contend for a crust of minimum thickness (although
   respecting the measure of this there is great difference of opinion)
   and a yielding substratum, as alone compatible with these phenomena.
      My intention here is not to enter upon the general question, but to
   lay before the Society the results of an inquiry on one section of it
   — namely, the rate of increase of temperature beneath the surface, — a
   subject equally affecting the argument on both sides. My attention
    was more specially directed to this subject in connexion with an
   inquiry on the cause of volcanic action, during which I found that
   the recorded observations gave so wide a choice in the selection of a
   mean rate for the increase of temperature, or as termed by Professor
   Everett, the " thermometric gradient," that very different values might

be and were attached to           it by different writers.        I  was thereby led to
collect the scattered evidence bearing on the snbject, with a view to
see whether it were not possible to fix upon some more definite and
less elastic rate.
    If   the inquiry     does not lead to any material alteration of the
averages      now   usually accepted, it may, at all events, serve to eliminate
some sources of error, and to restrict the limits within which the true
rate may lie. It may also serve to show how far the differences in
the observations in different geological areas are due to causes com
mon to all, and how far they are special to each or due primarily to
geological structure and local causes.
    At present, owing to the wide differences in the recorded observa
tions, it is very usual to take a general mean rate of 1° F. for every
50 to 60* feet of depth, or of 1° C. for every 30 metres.                     Others take
even a lesser rate of increase, and everyone must have felt the want
of the greater certainty which can only be given by a restriction of
the limits of variation to more definite bounds.                  I had already in con
nexion with work on artesian wells, and as a member of the Royal
Coal Commission of 1866, in connexion with the " Possible Depth of
Working," got together a considerable number of observations, and
to those      I have added a considerable              number of others, many of
them not before recorded. Although some of the earlier observa
tions may seem to be of little value, I have thought it best to keep
the record of all in the general list (Table I) for reference in case
of need, as with corrected data respecting the surface temperature
and height, some of them may possibly hereafter prove available.                            A
list of   all local  observations may be useful also at any time for further
research which is still much needed, particularly in connexion with
artesian wells, which under all circumstances,                   appear to afford the
best and surest index of underground temperatures.
   I    need scarcely say that I treat the subject solely from the geo
logical point of view. For its physical and mathematical aspects,

Lebour,§ and the Rev. 0. Fisher, || should be consulted.
   * The more rapid gradient of       1° in 50 feet has been the one adopted by some
physicists and geologists, but generally one of 60 feet to the degree, or even more,
is adopted.

                      On Underground Temperatures.                      3
    The subject of underground temperature is far from being new.      It
attracted attention a century and a-half ago, some observations
having been made by Gensanne in 1740 in the mines of Alsace,
which if we take the mean annual temperature at the mines of 47° F.,
give, curiously enough, an increase of 50 feet per degree Fahr.
    Towards the end of the century, a few experiments were made by
Saussure in Switzerland, and by Humboldt in America, but the
more important ones were those made by Daubuisson in 1803, in the
mines of Saxony and France, which gave a rate of increase varying
from 54 to 72 feet per degree F. De Trebra carried on similar ob
servations in one of the Saxony mines for two years, which, taking
the surface temperature at 44°, show an increase of 57 feet per
1° Fahr.
    Passing over some minor observations, we come to the series of
careful and systematic        observations  commenced in Cornwall by
Dr. Forbes and by Mr. R. Were Fox, about 1820, and which were
carried on by the latter continuously until 1857.         Other Cornish
geologists   followed,  Mr. W. J. Henwood especially, who between
1837 and 1858, made a large number of experiments,           not only in
 Cornwall, but also in the mines of South America. Notwithstanding
that the instruments had not the perfection of those of later date, the
observations are of great value, as they were conducted under very
varied conditions, and with a full understanding of the various
causes of interference to be guarded against.       They show very con
 siderable variations in the rate of increase     with depth.   Mr. Fox
records a range for 1° F. of from 32 to 70 feet, from which De la
 Beche deduced a mean from 46 to 51 feet ; and Henwood, while finding
 the results to range as widely as did Mr. Fox, nevertheless estimated
 from a large number of averages the gradient for 1° F. to be from
 37 to 41 feet only.
    In 1822, Cordier published his celebrated " Essai sur la Tempera
ture de l'lnterieur de la Terre," and in this he recorded the observa
tions previously made by Gensanne, Daubuisson and Fox, together
with some observations      made by himself in the coal-pits of France.
The several results showed variations extending from 13 to 57 metres
perl0 C, but he concluded the mean to be about 1° C. per 25 metres
of depth.
   Amongst the most careful of the early observations are those made
by De la Rive and Marcet in an artesian well at Pregny near Geneva.
In this case, the thermometer was protected against pressure, and the
resalt gave a rate  of increase of 48^ feet per 1° F.
   This was    shortly followed by Professor Phillip's well-known
observations in the deep coal-pit of Monkwearmouth, Sunderland ;
?reat precautions were taken against error, and in the result an in
crease of 1° for every 62 feet of depth was obtained.
                                                              b 2

 4                          Prof. J. Prestwich.
    At this time a  number of deep artesian wells were being made in
France by Messrs. Degousee and Laurent and other engineer, and
M. Walferdin invented an overflow maximum thermometer, which
carefully guarded against pressure, gave excellent results, and which
he employed to check many of the earlier observations made without
 this necessary precaution. The numerous artesian wells also made
about this time in Algeria, Venice, and other parts of the Continent
 by Degousee and Laurent, ga,ve important results.     Those in Algeria
seem to show that the rate of increase is there more rapid than in
Europe.
    Admirable discussions of the question were made from time to time
 by Arago : the last being that published in his
                                                   " CEuvres Complets "
 in 1856. In this he reviews the whole subject, gives elaborate par
 ticulars of most of the recorded observations, with the advantage of
 more accurate surface temperatures, and concludes that the rate of
increase is very variable, and may be taken at from 20 to 30 metres
for each degree centigrade.
    In 1861 Sir W. Fairbairn gave an account of the observations, so
frequently referred to, in the Dukinfield Colliery, where the rate of
increase was estimated at 1° F. for every 79 feet.
    Professor Hull also brought together in his " Coal Fields of Great
Britain" (Edit. 1873), a number of observations made in the coal
pits of this country, and drew especial notice to the Rosebridge
Colliery temperatures.     The general conclusion at which he arrived
was that the underground temperature varies, being much influenced
by the dip of the strata, but may, as a mean, be taken at 60 feet per 1°.
    The Royal Coal Commission of 1866-70 was the means of obtaining
                          "
through its Committee On the Possible Depth of Working," a mass
of most valuable evidence from practical coal-owners, inspectors, and
managers, relating to the temperatures at depths in the coal mines of
Great Britain.     The general opinion of these gentlemen was that the
temperature increased at the rate of about 60 to 63 feet for each
degree F., and the Committee concluded that the rate of increase
of the temperature of the strata in the coal districts of England is in
general about 1° F. for every 60 feet of depth.
    In 1867 a Committee of the British Association was appointed (at
the suggestion, I believe, of Sir W. Thomson) " for the purpose of in
vestigating the Increase of Underground Temperatures downwards in
various Localities of Dry Land and under Water," with Professor
Everett as secretary.    To this Committee we are indebted for a series
of sixteen very valuable annual reports, in which are recorded a large
number of observations carried on with corrected instruments supplied
by the Committee, and under the able superintendence of its secretary.
Each set of observations is discussed at length ; the causes of inter
ference are considered ; and detailed particulars are given of all the

                           On Underground Temperatures.                                   5
conditions of depth,            strata,  isolation,   <fcc,  under which they were
made.
    In    the summary of results given in the Report for 1882, Professor
Everett, after describing the instruments used, the methods of obser
vation, and the many questions affecting the value of the observa
tions, such as the heat generated by the boring tools, or by chemical
action, the effects of ventilation, the convection of heat by air and
water currents, Ac, proceeds to a comparison of results.                          Taking
the list of 36 localities of which Professor Everett gives the recorded
results, and classifying them as — 1. Metallic Mines ; 2. Coal Mines ;
3. Wells and Wet Borings ; 4 Tunnels ; he found that in the —
Metallic Mines, the increase of temperature with depth varied from
      1° P. in 47 feet to 1° in 126 feet ;
Coal mines, the range was lc F. in 45 feet to 1° in 79 feet ;
 Wells and barings gave from 1° P. in 41 feet to 1° in 130 feet, or
      excluding the wells of La Chapelle and Bootle, which are open to
      suspicion of convection currents, the least rate of increase was 1°
      in 69 feet    ;
 Tunnels.        In   the only two great tunnels        in which observations have
      been made, that of         Mont Cenis gave an increase of 1° for 79 feet,
      and that of St. Gothard of 1° for 84 feet, but in a subsequent report
      Dr. Stapff has shown that an important modification is necessary
      for   a portion of the tunnel.
In deducing a mean from these various results, Professor Everett has
considered it best to operate not upon the number of feet per degree,
but upon its reciprocal — the increase of temperature per foot ; and
assigning to the results of the observations at the thirty-six localities
of which he gives the list, weights proportional to the depths, he finds
the mean increase of temperature per foot to be 0"1563, or about ¥\-
 of a degree per foot — that is, 1° F. in 64 feet.*                In the subsequent
 report of 1883, however, taking the corrected readings of Stapff for
the St. Gothard and Mont Cenis tunnels, this mean is reduced to 1° F.
in 60 feet.
    Scattered      observations      have  also been made         within the last few
years in different parts of the world, some in particular of much
interest on the deep hot artesian well of Buda-Pesth, by Professor
 Szabo, and by         others in America and elsewhere ; while temperatures
of a    number of ordinary wells have been taken by the Rivers Pollution
 Commission.           Amongst those to whom I am indebted for furnishing
 me with observations          in wells and mines in their respective districts,
    •  Professor   Everett  observes,  however, in a previous paper (1874) that some of
 the   best observations give a rate of about 1°   F. for 56 feet of descent, and that this
 feems a   fair average.

not hitherto recorded, are Professor G. Dewalque of Liege, Professor
Gosselet of Lille, M. F. L. Cornet of Mons, and others.
   Professor Lebonr has further discussed the subject, with reference
especially to the nature of the experiments still required to improve
our knowledge of       in an interesting paper read before the North of
                        it,
England   Institute of  Mining and Mechanical Engineers, in 1882. In
this he gives a list of observations made at fifty-seven localities, and
deduces from them an average rate of increase of 1° F. per 64'28 feet
of descent but he remarks that all the observations recorded are by
              ;
no means of equal value, and points out that the mean rates of increase
in the best observations cluster about the numbers 1° F. per 50 or
60 feet.

I        have given   in a general list all the observations on underground
temperatures      of which    I   have     been able to find a record.*           The
number of different localities, mines, &c, where such observations
have been recorded, amounts to 248, and the number of stationsf to
530.    have only omitted a few which were obviously wrong, together
         I
with some of the observations repeated frequently in the same mine,
or repeated more frequently than necessary for our object in mines in
the same district, and which would only add needlessly to the length
of the list. J  Neither have     considered
                                  I             necessary to give in all

cases the full details of the observations, as these will be found in the
original papers referred to.        have confined myself to giving the
                                      I
principal and essential facts and results.
   The observations are given in the order of date, an order which, as
a general rule, agrees with that of their reliability, although there are
several remarkable exceptions.      The superiority of the later observa
tions consists chiefly in the perfection of the instruments and methods
of experimentation.      Most of the more general disturbing causes
interfering with accuracy of the results were well understood and
guarded against by the early observers.
   The particulars of depth, temperature, and modes of proceeding,
are given in the terms of the original observers.     On two points only,
on which their information was often unavoidably imperfect, have                    I
made any alteration — points which even now are in many cases not
accurately determined — viz., the mean annual temperature of the
surface, and the height of the surface above the sea-level.        These

alterations will account for occasional differences in the thermometric
gradients, between the observations as originally recorded and as
given in these lists, which in most cases will be found referable to my
taking a different mean annual temperature to that used by ths
original observer.
     Height of the' Surface. — As this influences both the surface and
underground temperatures, it is important that it should be deter
mined with precision. This is not always possible, although the later
publications of the Ordnance Survey have in many cases furnished us
with levels, which, if not at the precise spot, are sufficiently near to
form, with a knowledge of the country, a near estimate; but not
 unfrequently mines are in out-of-the-way places, where only roughly
 approximate estimates can be made. Several of the surface heights
 given in this table necessarily come into this category, and are there
 fore subject to future correction; while there are many cases in which
 I am unable to give even an approximate height.
     Mean Annual Temperature. — This is a point on which it is indis
 pensable to have exact information, for it is one in which the differ
 ence even of one or two degrees materially affects the calculations.
 There are yet, however, many of the places in the lists, where
 satisfactory    information is wanting, and the accepted temperature
 may therefore reqnire revision.             For places on the Continent, the
  works of Arago,* which embody all that was then known of the
 mean temperature of places, both in France and other parts of the
 world, are of great value.           The publications of the Meteorological
 Society of Scotland have done much to give us exact data respecting
 the mean temperature of places in Great Britain.f and I am further
 indebted to Mr. Robert H. Scott, of the London Meteorological Office,
 for valuable information respecting the latest recorded mean tempera
 ture of places both in this country and on the Continent.               There are,
 besides these, the older and more general tables of Dove.
     Where the temperature of the locality cannot be had, that of some
  place near and on or near the same level has been taken.                  Where
  there is an important difference of height between the place at which
  the surface temperature has been taken and the site of the under
 ground experiment, an approximate allowance                    of one degree F.
 ( + or
          —
            ) is made for every 300 feet         of   difference of level.  When,
 however, as is sometimes the case, a mean annual surface temperature
 is not obtainable, a near approximation may often be made by means
 of ordinary surface wells of about 40 to 50 feet, deep, and springs.
 This plan has been, especially in the earlier observations, frequently

    the measure          of the increase of temperature with depth, should                 be
    placed at that point below the surface,         at which the changes                    of
    annual temperature cease to have effect.                        Any such determination*
    might also with advantage                     be   applied to the correction of the   past
    observations.
        In   the absence of this information, we have                   for the present to be
    satisfied   with the mean surface temperature, where known, and take
    that         datum line from which to calculate the descending rate.
             as the
     Sometimes this has been the mode adopted, and the gradient cal
    culated from the surface ; at other times it has been calculated by
    supposing the mean invariable surface-temperature to lie at a depth
    of 50 feet, and taking that as the datum level from which to start.
    Thus, some of the original estimates have been founded on calcula
    tions commencing from the surface, and others at 50 feet beneath it.
       Either, therefore, some of these estimates are too high in conse
    quence of the deduction of 50 feet from the depth, or others are too
    low in consequence of not making an allowance for the zone of
     variable temperature.    But as the mean annual temperature of the
    ground at the surface generally in these latitudes exceeds that of the
    air by about 1°, it follows that if we take the mean temperature of
    the air at the place of observation, and calculate the rate of increase
    from the surface, instead of allowing 1° for the higher temperaturo
    of the ground and with a datum line 50 feet lower, we shall come
    to nearly the same result. At the same time it must be admitted
    that in so doing, we may sometimes be liable, especially with stations
    of moderate depth, to make the rate of increase with depth less than
    it should be. It is therefore the more important in future observations
    to determine if possible the temperature at a depth of 50 to 60 feet —
    or where the first bar of uniform temperature may happen to be — and
    to calculate from that point the rate of increase of temperature
    with depth.    Failing this, starting from the surface with the mean
    annual temperature of the place will no doubt give an approximate
    result. Thus the mean temperature of Paris is 51° F., and the tem
    perature of the cellars of the Observatory at a depth of 95 feet is
    53° F., or 2° higher, so that if in this instance, whether we start with
    a surface temperature of 51° or a temperature of 52° at a depth of
    50 feet, the result would be almost exactly the same.
       In looking over Table I, the essential differences in the results ob
    tained in Mines, Coal-pits, and Artesian wells will be at once apparent.
    This arises both from the circumstance that not only in each of these
/       * This was    done    in the  of the experiments at Grenelle, where a datum line

    based on the temperature     and depth of the cellars of the Paris Observatory was
    employed.    These are 29 metres (95 feet) deep, and the thermometer stands in
    variably at 11-7° C. (53° F.), the mean annual temperature of Paris being 10 6° C.
    (51° P.).  This     is,
                        however,    greater depth than necessary.

ire the geological conditions very dissimilar, but also that the dis
turbing causes are of a different order. In Mines, the latter are
attributable to —
   1st. Air currents established for ventilation, and by convection ;

   3rd. Chemical reactions ;
   4th. The working operations.
And in Artesian Wells, to —

   2nd. Convection currents in the column of water.
While a general cause affecting each group is conductivity, which
variably influences all the rooks, and which is itself liable to be in
fluenced by a number of causes to which we shall refer separately.
    We shall be able therefore to deal more readily with the subject, if,
as Professor      Everett has done, we divide the observations in Table I
into groups in accordance with these considerations,         and take each
separately     in the following order : —
      I. Coal Mines.
     II.  Mines other than coal.
    III.  Artesian Wells and Bore-holes.
    IV.   Tunnels.
                       I. Coal Mines.     (Table II, p. 88.)
    Considering the general uniformity of geological structure of the
 Coal-measures,      the temperature observations in coal mines are more
 discordant than might be expected. This depends upon various causes,
 of which ventilation is seemingly the principal, while in some cases
 differences of conductivity may possibly have influenced the results.
 It is true that in most cases the sources of error have been carefully
 guarded against, but it is doubtful whether in others sufficient allow
 ance has been made for them, and whether in some they have not
 altogether been overlooked.        The main disturbing causes are as
 follows  : —
    Loss of Heat through Exposed Surfaces. — To guard against the
 cooling of the coal or rock produced by ventilation, it has been
 customary to place the thermometer in holes 2 to 3 feet deep, but it
 is a question whether this is sufficient, for we are rarely informed, as
 is essential,   of the precise time that the face of the coal or rock has
 been exposed.        Even in the best observations we are only told that
 they   have   been   made in "freshly exposed faces," which may or may
 not be sufficiently soon. For on these working faces the ventilation is
 necessarily well maintained, and consequently the difference between
 the temperature of the air and of the strata is there often most con
 siderable, and the cooling of the rock very rapid.
     On the surface of the ground the diurnal variation of temperature

 extends to the depth of about 3 feet, and it has been shown by                 means
 of thermometers sunk in the grounds that at a depth of* —
       1  foot the monthly ' fluctuation is from 33° to 54-0° or
                                                                         = 2i-0°

    At   the depth of 29 feet at Greenwich, the annual fluctuation is still
 2° to 3° F., and to reach the limits of range, or where it is at last
 reduced to -^th of a degree F., we must go in this climate to a
 depth of from 50 to 80 feet.
    Now it is evident that, owing to ventilation, there is a permanent
 difference between the temperature of the air in a mine and the
 temperature of the rock, analogous to the diurnal variation on the
 surface of the ground, and that its effects will extend with equal,               if
 not greater, rapidity in the one case as in the other.
    Any surface of rock exposed to air of a lower temperature will lose
 heat with a rapidity proportionate to the difference in temperature
 between the two bodies and to the conductivity of the rock.                  There
fore as convection currents and ventilation are constantly introducing
into the shaft and mine air of a lower temperature than the under
ground rocks, these latter must suffer a loss of heat from the moment
they are so exposed.       To avoid this, the best observers have, as just
mentioned, operated in freshly exposed surfaces, where the loss is
at a minimum : on the other hand, numerous observations have been
made on surfaces exposed for a length of time and often under con
ditions of which we are not informed.
    Thus in the well-known case of the Dukinfield Colliery, near Staley-
bridge, it is stated that the bore-holes were driven to such a depth as
to be unaffected by the temperature of the air in the shaft, and the
thermometers were left in the holes from ^ to 2 honrs ; but we are not
informed of the depth of the holes, nor of the temperature of the air
in the shaft, nor of how long the rock had been exposed. We know
only that the shaft, which was a very large one and carried to a depth
of 2151 feet, took 10 years to sink. At this depth the temperature
of the rock was 75° F., and the estimated rate of increase was calcu
lated to be 99 feet for 1° F.      The observations were carried on during
the whole of the time that the work proceeded.               Although we do not
know the temperature of the air, the action of convection currents or
of ventilation is clearly shown in the irregularities of the rock
temperatures in summer and winter, even at great depths.                    Thus, on
the 12th June, 1849, the shaft had reached a depth of 704 feet, and
the rock temperature was 58°.            The same temperature was noted
with slight fluctuations until the 22nd December, at which time the
         * Prof. James D. Forbes, " Trans. Boy. Soc.  Edin.," vol. xri, p. 189.

                         Oil Underground Temperatures.                      11
depth had been reached of 810 feefc. In February, 1857, at a depth
of 1450 feet, the temperature was 67j°, which rose with abnormal
rapidity to     72£°  in August, at a depth of 1689 feet. It then slightly
decreased, partly recovering and ending in October at 72^°, when the
depth was 1840 feet. In March, 1858, it had fallen to 71±° at 1881
feet, and then rose by July, at 2055 feet, to 75^-°. After the winter, in
March, 1859, at 2151 feet the thermometer stood at 75°, or half a degree
 leas than it did in July at a depth of nearly 100 feet less.            I can
 only attribute these fluctuations to the influence of the seasons and
 convection currents, or to some unmentioned form of ventilation. A
  new shaft sunk in 1858, not far from the other, gave, in the same way,
  analogous results, viz., an increase of 1° F. for every 90 feet.
      When, however, at a subsequent period, and when the works of
  this colliery had been carried to the great depth of 2700 feet, observa
  tions were made in galleries at a distance from the shaft, with instru
  ments furnished by the British Association Committee, and in holes
  4 feet deep, an amended reading of 1° for every 72 feet was obtained.
  Still that rate of increase is slow, and Professor Everett has drawn
  attention to the fact that there are other collieries such as those of
  Ashton Moss, Denton, and Bredbury, within a few miles of Dukin-
  field, in which the results are in close agreement with those obtained
  in the latter. It has been suggested in explanation of this, that the
   rapid dip of the strata at Dukinfield facilitates the transmission and
   escape of heat.      It is quite possible that this cause may have an
   influence, as the experiments of Herschel and Lebour have shown
   experimentally that the conduction of heat is more rapid along the
   planes of cleavage, or bedding, than across them.          Nevertheless no
   such difference exists in other mines where the stratigraphical condi
   tions are alike ; the strata in the Liege, Mons, and Valenciennes coal
   fields (Nos. 140, 214-16, 145) are more disturbed, and dip at more
   rapid angles than at Dukinfield, and yet the deep temperatures there
   give no such slow rate of increase.
      Again, Mr. Garside draws attention to the circumstance that the
   Red Sandstone, overlying the Coal-measures           in the area, is highly
   charged with water, which is largely drawn upon for water supply.
   This may reduce the temperature of that mass of rock, but the effects
   would hardly reach to the great depths and extent observed.
      Some of the anomalous results may also be attributable partly to
   the excellent ventilation of these deep pits.           At the Dukinfield
   Colliery, about   58,000  cubic feet of air circulate  through  the pit per
   minute. The mean annual temperature of the air at the surface is
   48° F., while the return air from the pit has a temperature of 73°.
   But then again the ventilation at Rosebridge and other large pits —
   where the rate of the increase of temperature is more rapid and
   nearer the  probable normal — is not less carefully attended      to. Still,

12                        Prof.   J.   Prestwich.
that ventilation has a preponderating influence is shown by an experi
ment of Mr. Wynne, who found that in a rise of the Dukinfield
Colliery, where owing to defective ventilation the temperature of the
air and rock were both 76°, the rate of increase from the surface gave
only 55 feet per degree.
   Other causes have also been suggested for the lower temperature of
the Dukinfield pit.   Mr. Dickinson states that before the shaft was
sunk, two of the principal seams of coal in the upper part had been
worked away from other pits, and that the lower seams had been
worked a long way from the outcrop down towards the Astley pit.*
   The Dukinfield observations,    therefore, while they confirm the
general law of increase of temperature with the depth, are scarcely
admissible in estimates concerning the exact rate of increase of
temperature with the depth, and it would be safer to omit them in
such calculations.
     I
    do not mean to imply that good observers have or would select
long exposed and cooled surfaces, but others have done so, and my
object here is to show that cooling must at once commence, and that
it is difficult to escape in any part of the pit, or however early the
experiments are made, from the effects of ventilation.       It is not a
question  of weeks  or  months,  but of days, if not hours.
  Effects of  Ventilation. — The  evidence   given before the Committee
of the Royal Coal Commission of 1867, " On the Possible Depths of
Working," is particularly valuable for the information it affords
respecting the effects of ventilation.
   At the Pendleton Colliery (Nos. 104 and 122), near Manchester,
the coal in a level 500 yards from the down brow, had a temperature
of 70°, and at 1000 yards distant, in the same level, and when just
opened, it had a temperature of 83° F.
   At the Rosebridge Colliery, Wigan, the temperature of the Raven
coal in the shaft was 78°, whilst at 630 yards distant it had a tem
perature of 88°.    The air at the bottom of the down-shaft at a depth
of 1800 feet was 60-5°, and, after circulating 1500 yards, 73°. At
another time it was 51-5°; after circulating 2400 yards, 67"5° ; and
after 3140 yards, 71°. In July, 1858, the strata at the same depth
had a temperature of 80° ; in March, 1861, it was reduced to 72°.
   At the Annesley Colliery (No. 106), Nottinghamshire, a fresh cut
coal at a depth of 1425 feet had a temperature of 73°, and six months
later it had fallen to 64°. In another case, the coal cooled 11° in three
months.
   The volume and velocity of the air currents vary greatly. In one
place a circulation of 5000 cubic feet per minute is recorded.   In
another pit the circulation was 100,000 cubic feet per minute, while
            * Coal Commission Report, toI.   ii,   "

  In this          case we           have four observations made nearly at the same

   In the Seaham (Durham) Colliery the circulation of air      very                                   is
large, — 193,346 cubic feet per minute. At a depth of 1524 feet and
1642 yards distant from shaft, the temperature of the air was found
to be 61° at 2726 yards distant and at the same depth
               :                                         was 67°; and                    it

   Mr. Dickinson found    that at a depth of 2088 feet in one of the
Pendleton pits the temperature at 500 yards from the engine brow
was 78°, and at 1000 yards distant 82°.   In the same pit at a depth
of 2214 feet and distant 200 yards from the engine brow, the coal in

   in a hole 7^ feet deep the temperature was 84°. The general opinion
   amongst the witnesses     seemed to he that the effect of ventilation was
   to reduce the temperature of the pits some 9° to 10° F., though some
   estimated it at as much as 15° to 20°.
      The effect of exposure is well shown in the following             records from

      No other particulars are given. The rate of increase here for the
  first 1000 feet is 1° for every 95 feet, whilst for the whole 1770 feet
 the rate of increase is 1° for every 61 feet.              This is clearly due to
  the circumstance that the shaft had long been sunk to 1004 feet and
 the mine cooled, and only recently opened to 1770 feet.
      Mr. Lupton mentions that in a pit 1425 feet deep, the fresh cut
 coal had a temperature of 73°, whereas at the end of six months it
 had fallen to 64°.     In another case a period of three months had
 sufficed to reduce the temperature 11°.
     After the air in the pits has circulated a certain distance (estimated
 by one of the witnesses at one mile), it may become in the face of the
 workings hotter than the rock ; while the difference, which arises from
 the heat of the lights and the men in an instance given, does not exceed
  + 2°.
     The extent to which the temperature of the air affects that of the
 coal is also shown in the table of experiments, given on next page,
made by Mr. Wood in another Durham Colliery (No. Report, p. 140).
 Here the difference between the coal and the air in the part of the
pit through which the intake air circulates, is from 4° to 6^°, or an
average of 5° ; whereas in the return air at the same distances from
the shaft, the differences are reduced to an average of 1^°.
     In the Crumbouke mine the face of the coal which had been worked
two years had, according to Mr. Dickinson, lowered 4°. A similar
loss was shown at the Rosebridge Colliery, but after a longer
interval. In an adjoining pit, the difference between the temperature
of the air in the galleries and of the coal varied from 10° to 12^° F.
     At the Rosebridge Colliery other observations made three, four, and
nine years after opening the colliery showed, that at 1410 feet deep,
and 200 yards from shaft, the temperature of the coal was = 66° F.,
and at 300 yards = 70° F., while at 1800 feet deep and 215 yards

from shaft the temperature of coal was = 65° F. Mr. Bryham states
that the redaction of temperature effected in this pit by veutilation
amounts to from 15° to 20° F., or even more in a strong current.
    Other returns give the column of air circulating through the pits
 at from 50 to 150 million cubic feet in the twenty-four hours, with a
gain of temperature of from 10° to 20° F., which shows how great the
 abstraction of heat from large and well-ventilated coal-pits must be.

     Even in the two pits off work,            we  have   in  the  one   instance
 44,550 cubic feet of air passing out per minute, with a gain in tem
 perature above that of the outer air of 17° F., and in the other case
 25,500 cubic feet pass out with a gain of 18° F.
     In these instances the temperature of the outer air was only in one
 observation under 50° F. At other seasons of the year, with the outer
 thermometer      lower, and with the difference of temperature between
 the circulating air and the strata greater, the loss of heat would
 proceed still more rapidly.       Mr. Forster mentions that he has known
 ice form at the bottom of a coal shaft, and Mr. Bald, speaking of the
 Whitehaven Collieries, states that the circulation of air sometimes
 causes the water to freeze on the sides of the shaft, and " even form
 icicles upon the roof of the coal within the mine," whilst the air from
 the rise-pit issues in a dense misty cloud.
     In consequence of the allowance necessary to be made for these
 effects of ventilation, some of the witnesses, while taking the actual
rate of increase at about from 50 to 60 feet for each degree F., con
 sidered that the normal rate might not be more than 50 feet per
degree.
    As a rule, the deeper the mine the greater must be the ventilation,
and therefore, the more rapid must be the cooling of the underground
strata.     But the amount of ventilation depends also not only on depth,
but on the quantity of gas present in the coal.                 Mr. Warington
                         " in round numbers 100 cubic feet of air
 Smyth says,s that                                                              per
minute may be required for the health and comfort of each person
underground, or for 100 men, 10,000 cubic feet ; but if fire-damp be
given off — say at the rate of 200 cubic feet per minute — we should
need at the very least thirty times that amount of fresh air to dilute
it, or 6,000 cubic feet in addition.        Increase the number of men and
liability to gas, and 40,000 to 60,000 cubic feet of air may be indis
pensable for safety."
    It is evident, therefore, that the rate of cooling from ventilation in
different coal mines and at different depths is likely to be very vari
able.     The greater the heat and the more gas in the coal, the more
rapid will be the cooling, and this may possibly account for the great
discrepancies between the thermometric gradients at different col
lieries.     Until, however, we are in possession of all the collateral
conditions, it will not be possible to assign in each instance, the precise
weight to be attached to this disturbing cause. f

   t  Mr. W. Warington Smyth gives, in his Anniversary Address to the Geological
Society in 1868 (pp. 79 — 87), some interesting particulars respecting ventilation
and other causes affecting underground temperatures.

minerals, which is of rare occurrence in coal mines, and the heat
arising from the men, horses, and lights, which can only be of im
portance in shallow mines, for in deep mines it is rarely that that
source of heat brings up the temperature of the air to the normal
temperature of the rock, there are few causes likely to produce an
abnormal rise of temperature.             There is one, however, which though
of exceptional occurrence, should be noticed in connexion with this
subject, and that is the heat produced by the crushing of the rocks
which sometimes takes place in coal mines.
    The Crushing of Bock. — It is certain that in coal mines where pillars
are crushed and the strata pressed up in creeps, more or less heat is
liberated.     No experiments, however, have been made to determine
what, in these cases, are the exact effects produced, but some of tho
evidence given before the Coal Commission fully establishes the
general fact.      Mr. Elliot,* in speaking of one of the pits in South
Wales, mentioned that when " a creep takes place, he has known the
temperature very much increased," and in one case where
                                                                            " the
                                                                                  pres
sure began to crush the pillars, the heat produced was so great that
he feared it would set fire to the coal."              In some cases the pressure
has been such as " to grind the rock to powder, like the effect of a dozen
mill-hoppers, and this was accompanied by considerable heat." He had
often found the air very hot when a sort of temporary creep occurred.
    Escape of Gas. — On the other hand, a cause productive of a loss of
heat is a more constant disturbing cause.               There are few coals which
 do not give off gas when first exposed.                In some seams it may be
observed exuding from the freshly broken surfaces with a hissing
 sound ; and, if in large quantity, as in the case of the so-called
"blowers," or sometimes near faults, it issues with a rushing noise
like the steam from a high-pressure boiler. Some of these blowers will
be exhausted in a few minutes, others will last for years — like that at
 Wallsend, which gave off 120 feet of gas per minute.f                  The common
gas   on  these occasions    is light carburetted hydrogen.            It  must exist
in the coal under the enormous pressure either highly condensed, if
not in a liquid state, otherwise it is hardly conceivable how the dis
charge could be maintained so long. The pressure of this gas is said
to equal sometimes 300 to 400 lbs. to the square inch.J
    In any case the escape of this gas from the coal, in which it appa
rently exists in an infinite number of small cavities, must be to

the gas speedily accumulates so as to exercise a pressure of several hundred
pounds upon the square inch, as indicated by pressure-gauges fixed into the cavities.

reduce the temperature of the body from which it escapes, though
here again no special experiments have been made to ascertain the
exact loss of heat from this cause.                        I find,   however, one of the wit
nesses* on the Coal Commission               remarking that in a pit the depth of
which had been increased              from 830 to 1588 feet, the temperature of
the coal was lower at the              greater than at the lesser depth, and he
attributed this to a strong           blower of gas issuing from the coal, which
at that point was sensibly            cooler to the touch.

the same case,        it   is stated that,   —
         In   the   Lower Duffryn Mine at a depth of                                 1588 feet,
                           — and distant from shaft                                  1850 yards,
the temperature  of coal in a wet hole with a blower of gas was 62° F.,
whereas it was found that —
                     At    a depth of                                 1269 feet,

             in a dry hole with little gas was 74° F.
the temperature
  At the Cym Neol Colliery, at depths of 990 and 1150 feet, and
1350 and 1070 yards distant from shaft, the temperature was re
spectively 62° and 65°, which is abnormally low, but it is stated that
the observations           were made in wet holes with blowers.
  This escape of gas from the body of the coal may account for the
observation of another witness to the effect that " the coal gives out
heat quicker than the rock," and that the temperature of the coal                                    is,
on the whole, less than that of the associated rocks. In several cases
observations have been made in the same pit, both on the coal and ou
the underlying shale, and generally the temperature of the rock has
been found to be higher than that of the coal.  In the Rams Mine,
Pendleton, for example, the temperature of the coal in a hole      feet                         3
deep  was  82° F., and in the floor 83° F. in the Crumbouke ; Mine  the
coal was 80° F., and the floor 82° F. and in other levels
                                                       ;       was 80°                    it
and 80°, and 78° against 82° F.     In one of the Ruabon collieries the
relative temperatures varied as follows —                  :
 Depth 1002 feet           ;   temperature     = 60° F. in coal, and                67°   F. in floor.

  As the conductivity of the coal (0'00068)                          is   less than that of sand
stone  (0-00672) or shale (0-00235), the coal should retain its heat
longer than the rocks.   If the coal cooler than the rock, must

just mentioned which would be caused by the escape of gas condensed
under great pressure.   It is an effect important to notice, inasmuch as
not only is the discharge of gas from coal of frequent, and often con
stant occurrence, but also from the circumstance that it affects espe
cially the fresh opened surfaces of coal in which the temperature
observations have so commonly been made.
  The Effects  of Irregularities of the Surface.
                                                 —Although it was known
that the underground isothermals under mountain masses are not
prolonged in horizontal planes, but follow in a certain ratio the curves
of the ground above, little was known to what extent mines were
affected by the smaller irregularities of the surface until Mr. George
Elliot, M.P.'s experiments in coal pits in Glamorganshire, showed that
there is a sensible increase of heat with an increase in the mass of
the superincumbent strata.       This important point has been rarely, or
never sufficiently, taken into consideration in any of the underground
temperature     observations.
   The following observations and sections of Mr. Elliot* laid before
the Coal Commission were mostly made in abandoned parts of the
pits, so as to avoid as far as possible both the effects of ventilation and
of working, and the holes, in which the thermometers          were placed,
were 4 feet deep.     Only the depths and temperature of the coal are
given in the original sections.     I am responsible for the isothermal
lines which   I have plotted on these data, for the purpose of showing
the more precise manner in which the temperature at depths is
influenced by the surface heights.
   At Upper Duffryn Colliery, in South Wales, the top of the shaft is
400 feet above the sea level, and the shaft 360 feet deep.        The seam
of coal has been followed southward for a distance of 2327 yards, at
                Fig.   1. — Section at   Upper Duffryn, Aberdare District.
                                                                                    N| 4
which point it is 190 feet lower in respect to the sea level than at the
entrance.  This difference might account for a lowering of 3° to 4°
in the temperature, but not for the difference of 14°, which is due to
                  * " Coal Commission Reports," vol.      ii,   p. 105 — 111.
                                                                                c
                                                                                2

the circumstance that at this point the surface of the ground has
risen so much that the seam of coal lies 1690 feet below the surface,
or 1330 feet lower than at the bottom of the shaft.                  The distance
from the shaft might partly account for this difference, but only
partly for that between stations 2, 3, and 4.
   At the Cym Neol Colliery one station is under a valley, and two
under the adjacent hills, rising about 500 feet above the valley. No. 2
station is only 480 yards distant from shaft (not in section), against
1070 from Station No. 1, and 1350 yards from Station No. 3.                    At
that time the temperature of the outer air was 69° F.

                                                                         HI 3
   In  a similar way the New Tredegar Colliery is situated in a valley
670 feet above the sea level, and the works pass under a hill which
rises 617 feet above the valley, with the effect of raising the tempera
ture of the same coal      11°   F., though 2° to 3° of this may be owing to
distance from shaft.         At the time the thermometer outside stood at
60° to 70°  F.
               Fig. 3. — Section at New Tredegar, Aberdare District.
    At the Vochriw Dowlais Colliery, on the other hand, the top of the
 shaft is on a hill 1330 feet above the sea level, and the seam of coal,
 which there lies 1103 feet below the surface, is followed first under a
 hill which rises 217 feet above the pit mouth, and then under a valley
 only 818 feet above sea level, or 512 feet lower than the pit mouth.
 Notwithstanding the distance of Station No. 3 from the shaft, the fall

                         On Underground      Temperatures.                   21
of temperature due to the fall of the surface is apparent, though the
temperature at Station No. 2 is too low, which the witness attributed
to a strong current of air passing at the time.            Outside the thermo
meter marked 59° F.
                Fig. 4. —Section at Vochriw Dowlaie. Aberdare District.
    It will   be noticed that the observations in      all these pits were made
when the thermometer outside stood high, so that the cooling effects
of the outer air would be less at the stations near the shaft than at
other seasons.
    There is no other coal-field in Britain so hilly as that of South
Wales ; still it frequently occurs that a shaft is sunk in a valley, and
the works pass under adjacent hills (or the reverse), which though
not so high as those of Wales, are of sufficient height to influence the
 temperature more or less.
    Many of these are points which have commonly not been noticed in
 the discussion of this question, yet they must not unfrequently have
 influenced the observations.          In all coals there is an escape of gas
 when first opened out, and in some it is very large, as in several of
 the Sonth Wales pits ; others are merely called " gassy," and there
 fewer precautions are required.          Amongst the pits in England, where
 recorded temperature observations have been made, and which are
 situated in districts sufficiently hilly to be affected by irregularity of
 surface, are the Dukinfield and some of the pits in the Manchester
 district.
     Selection of Observations. — It will be apparent from the existence of
 these many disturbing causes, that not only should we know that the
  instruments employed are properly constructed and properly used, but
  we should also in all cases know, — 1st. Height of the ground above
  the sea level.    2nd. The exact mean annual temperature of the surface.
  3rd. Depth beneath the surface of the ground of each station where
  the observations are made.         4th. Distance of those stations from the
  shaft.    5th. Temperature of the air and volume in circulation at the
  stations.    6th. Exact length of time that the face of the coal or rock

 22                              Prof.  J.  Prestwich.
 has been exposed.          7th. Whether or not there is much gas given off
 from the coal. Besides these more essential points, it is well to know
 the temperature of the air outside, the dip of the strata, their hydro-
 geological conditions, together with any local causes tending to
 increase or lower the temperature.
    It is only when all these essential conditions are known and can
 be taken into account, that we can hope to arrive at a more exact
 estimate of the real rate of increase of temperature with depth
 in Coal Mines. It is to be feared that very few of the observa
 tions recorded in Table            II   satisfy this standard.        While they
present many points of interest, and confirm the general fact of an
increase of temperature with depth, they fail,              I think, to give the
more precise information required.             For these reasons I feel that only
a very small selection can be made, and I doubt whether those even
give sufficiently true readings, though they may give the best approxi
 mation that can at present be obtained.
                                                 I
    In making the selection, the points have looked to are (I) accu
rate mean surface temperature, (2) height of ground, (3) temperature
of air in gallery — or, when that is not given, such a distance from
shaft as will ensure the minimum of difference between the tempera
ture of the air and the rock* — (4) distance of the working face from
the shaft, and (5) depth of trial hole.           Permanence of temperature at
a station is not, as it has been often considered, a sign of its correct
ness, or of its being the true normal temperature.               On the contrary,
when it is stated that the thermometer in the same hole continues to
give the same reading for a long period, it is evident that, instead of
having a more definite value, it cannot represent the normal tempera
ture of the rock, but that of the rock or coal after cooling to a point
at which an equilibrium has been established between the temperature
of the strata and that of the circulating air. Such readings there
fore are too low.
    Amongst the best recorded observations are those at Boldon in the
Newcastle coal-field (No. 150). The holes in the rock were there 10 feet
deep, the temperature of the air in the gallery was nearly the same as
that of the rock, and the mean annual temperature well known.
    At the North Seaton Mine (No. 217), the station being half a mile
from the shore, and more than that distance from the shaft, a certain
uniformity of temperature between the rock and the air was necessarily
ensured, although that is not mentioned.
    The experiments at Hetton Colliery (No. 116) seem to fulfil the re
quired conditions, but I do not place implicit reliance on them, because
the holes were first filled with water and then left for forty-eight
   *  It is said that at about the distance of a mile from the shaft the temperature
of the air approximates to that of the coal, but this of course is    a very variable
result.

                        On Underground Temperatures.                         23
hours, after which the thermometers were left         in them for twenty-four
hours, so that the coal was exposed for at least for three days, if not
more, to a current of 5000 cubic feet of cooler air per minute. Further,
it is stated that there was no difference in the temperature after the
lapse of a fortnight.        I infer from this that the coal here again had
reached a cooling point at which the equilibrium between the air and
coal   had been temporarily established.
   The experiments at South Hetton (No. 136) have especial value, as
they were made in a bore-hole drilled into the strata at the bottom of a
shaft, 1066 feet deep, to a further depth of 878 feet.                The first
reading    made   on  the  completion of  the  hole, and while  yet dry, gave a
temperature of 96° F. Three years later the experiments were repeated,
but in the meantime the hole had become filled with water, and silted up
to the depth of 234 feet. The thermometer was, however, pushed down
in the   silt to the depth of 26 feet, and a temperature of 77° recorded.
Whilst no doubt the first readings were rather too high, as the heat
caused by the tools could not have been all lost,* it is equally probable
that convection currents may have cooled the mud in the bore-hole.
 Taking, however, the temperature in the bore-hole between the depths
in it of 100 and 670 feet (1166 and 1736 feet below surface), we
 have a difference of 11", which gives a rate of increase of 52 feet per
 degree.
    The strong ventilation, and the uncertainty about the length of
exposure, are objections to the otherwise careful records of the Pendle
 ton Colliery (No. 104), and the same doubts attach to the other deep
 works of this district.       It is true that many of the observations are
 said to have been made in newly-opened ground, but we do not know
 whether this means an hour, a day, or a week, and as in all newly-
 opened mines the ventilation must be well kept up for the sake of the
 workmen, the rate of cooling must be rapid.
    The Wakefield      pit (No. 120) bad been newly opened. Ventilation
 was stopped as    much as possible at the stations, and the temperature
 of the air was very near the normal ; the hole in the coal was 6 feet
 deep, and distant 600 yards from the shaft.              In the Barnsley pit
 (No. 119) the station was too near the shaft, and the air was much
 below the normal.
    The observations, both in the Radstock and Kingswood Collieries
 (Nos. 163 and 155), were made in holes only 2 feet deep, and the ther
 mometers allowed to remain respectively two, five, and seven days —
 long enough for the rock to cool, as shown by the fact that after
  another week the thermometer at Kingswood gave the same reading.
  The temperature of the air is not given.

  collieries, in consequence of the deflections of the isothermal lines by
  irregularities of the surface.
      The particulars of the Norley Colliery, Wigan, (No.                  Ill)       are
  insufficient, though the result there obtained seems to confirm the
  observations at the Rosebridge Colliery.
      The observations in the Mons Collieries (Nos. 215, 216) were made
  at a distance from the shaft, and in dry galleries without ventilation.
      At Liege (No. 141) the unusual precaution was taken of making-
  the holes 5 metres deep, while the temperature of the air in the
  galleries was only 1° lower than that of the coal.
     I   have not taken any of the earlier observations, owing to the un
  certainty attaching to the instruments, and, after eliminating others
  for the reasons named, we are reduced to the following small number

      This seems a very small selection to make, but I believe that the
  disturbing causes     I have mentioned operate so constantly, that an
  element of uncertainty is introduced at the very opening of a pit, and
   that, without fnrther precautions than hitherto taken, the observa
  tions are not reliable for the purpose of those exact values necessary
  to determine the true thermometric gradient.
      Instead of making the observations in a newly-opened and well-
  ventilated part, with fresh faces of the coal emitting peDt-up gases, it
  might be desirable to try an isolated abandoned unventilated gallery,
- and there place thermometers in the coal and the rocks above and
  below the coal. The holes should be 5 or 6 or more feet deep, and the
  gallery then closed at distances of 200 to 300 feet by a series of
  diaphragms to stop ventilation and convection currents, and the place
  not opened for several months, by which time the end station would

    It   is only    in a few instances that temperature observations have
been made            in carboniferous strata in other than coal-pits; in
these     others    there is no indication of the excessive range which the
observations in shafts and galleries have shown.                     The following

     If  we were to unite these two series of observations,            we should got
 for the Coal-measures         a rate of increase of temperature as nearly as
 possible    of 50 feet per degree Fahr., although there seems to be local
 variations dependent upon structure, the percolation of water, and
 other causes.

      The causes affecting the thermal conditions of Metalliferous Mines
 are    very different to those which obtain in Coal Mines.                  In them
 we have        to deal almost exclusively with crystalline and schistose
 rocks.     Not only does the conductivity of such rocks differ materially
 from that of the Coal-measures, but the disturbing causes common to
  the two have in general very different values.
     Ventilation is a cause affecting both, but it affects them unequally ;
 and while in Coal Mines the influence of water is generally very small,
 it plays an important part in Metallic Mines.                  On the other hand,
 chemical decomposition and hot springs, which are common disturbing
 causes in the latter, are of rare occurrence in the former.
      Ventilation. — I have so fully described the effects of ventilation in
 the section on Coal Mines, that             I  only need mention here in what
  respects its effects differ in other mines.          Besides, we are not in pos
  session,   in   respect to metallic mines, of such detailed particulars as
   those which the Report of the Coal Commission gives of the Coal
             * Or, deeper holes and well distant from the shaft might answer.

Mines. The effects are modified in the two cases by differences in the
structure of the shafts and galleries, and while in the one the presence
of the coal-gases necessitates excessive ventilation, in the other, hot
springs and chemical decomposition, though they raise the tempera
ture, do not render so active a ventilation imperative.
   In some of the Cornish mines the current of air is hardly felt, and
it is stated generally by Mr. Robert Were Fox,* that in deep mines
the temperature of the rock and that of the air do not materially
differ, except when the currents are strong. At the same time it is
evident that strong currents of air do sometimes prevail. An instance
is mentioned by Mr. Robert Hunt,t where at the bottom of a mine
 1 950 feet deep, the current of air was so strong that it was difficult to
keep a candle alight.     In another, in all the levels (which were of
great extent) of one hot lode at the depth of 1410 feet, the ventilation
was so effective that the temperature of the air was never higher than
70°   F.
   These mines must suffer, as in coal mines, a great and permanent
reduction of temperature in the proximity of the down shafts. This
is especially noticeable in severe winters, and when the ventilation is
active the effects of this will extend to a considerable distance from
the shaft. Daubuisson mentions that during a severe winter, and with
the outer air at a temperature of — 15° R. ( — 2° F.), the shaft of the
Beschertgluck mine, in the Freiberg district, was lined with ice to a
depth of 80 toises (480 feet), and that the temperature of the air at the
bottom of the shaft was £° R. (33° F.). Dr. Clark (" Travels in Scan
dinavia,") says that in descending the great iron mines of Persberg,
in Sweden, which are 450 feet deep, he found large masses of ice
covering the sides of the walls, and that it had accumulated in large
quantities in the lower chambers.       But the formation of ice is not
confined to these more rigorous winter climates, for Mr. Moyle speaks
of finding, on one occasion, ice in abundance in the Tin Croft Mine,
Cornwall, at a depth of 318 feet below the snrface, and says that the
ladders became impassable, crevices were filled, and icicles formed all
around ! That this must produce a permanent effect is clear from the
circumstance mentioned in connexion with coal mines, where the walls
of deep mines near the shaft are so cooled in winter, that in summer
the air circulating by them is of a higher temperature than the rock.
On the other hand, the temperature of the air in a metallic mine is
more apt than in a coal mine to become heated by the combustion
of candles, the explosion of gunpowder, and the presence of the
workmen.
   Some of the observations of Mr. Fox show the effects of ventilation
in the Cornish mines. Thns at Huel Damsel Mine (No. 21), the tem-

  Mr. Fox does not give the temperature of the air, but states that
theabnormally low temperatures of Stations  and IV arose from the        II
passage   of strong currents of air. The effect of these conditions, in
estimating the rate of increase of temperature with depth, is clearly
shown in the last column which                       I
                                       have added for this purpose.
   But although there may be extreme cases, it is probable, as a general
rule, that the ventilation does not produce the extent of difference
between the temperature of the air and of the rock that it does in coal
mines.    Mr. Fox who, to avoid the effects of ventilation, always, if
possible, made his observations near the ends of the levels, states that
in those cases there is little difference between the temperature of the
air and the rock.    At the same time it is possible that, even then, the
uniformity may    be owing to the rock having permanently cooled down
to the temperature of the air — though it may not be much.            The
following are cases in which the temperatures of both are given.

   The two partial exceptions (IV, V) are in both cases at stations of
lesser depths, and, being still near the shaft, are possibly more
exposed to the influence of the outer air.
   The effects of ventilation are also shown in another way. Some of
the early experiments of Dr. Forbes were made in the water in sumps
and pools, which necessarily would be much exposed to the cooling
effects of the circulating air.            His tables, which give the results of
observations in six mines (No. 18), show a rate of increase of tempera
ture relatively less with increased depth.                 The observations are bo
much at variance with those subsequently made by Mr. Fox and
Mr. Henwood, that         I   can only attribute the discrepancy to the cause
I have here named, viz., a relatively greater cooling of the water, due
to increased ventilation at increased depths.                 It is not necessary to
give the whole series : the following instances bring out the fact : —

   * The rapid rate constantly observed near the surface is probably in great part
owing to chemical decomposition in the lodes which is most active near the surface,

  No further    particulars and no greater depths were given, but
Mr. Fox's later observations in rock give different results.
  The Effects    of the Percolation of Water.
                                               — But while the effects of
ventilation are not so general and disturbing in Metallic Mines as in
Coal Mines, the effects produced by the underground waters are of
much greater importance.        The alternation of impermeable with per
meable strata, and the multiplicity of faults in the Coal-measures, so
impede the descent of the surface-waters,        that there are mines so
dry as to necessitate the introduction of water to keep down the dust.
The Metallic Mines being, on the contrary, commonly in crystal
line, schistose, and slaty rocks, have more uniformity of structure ;
and, being also generally hard and compact,            they are more or
less impervious.       When, however, they have been disturbed and
fissured, they give   freer passage to water ; and when, further, they are
traversed by veins and faults, these frequently serve as channels or
conduits, more or less free, for the surface-waters, and considerable
quantities of water pass through them.         Consequently water is one
of the great obstacles to deep mining with which the workmen have
to contend.     Water finds its way to all depths, and with more or less
rapidity.    Mr. Henwood states that in some mines a great increase
follows soon on heavy autumnal rains, and that in others, months
intervene before the effects are felt.
    In districts formed of the usual alternations of sedimentary strata,
it is estimated that on an average about one-third of the rainfall passes
underground ; while in Cornwall, where granites and slates exclu
 sively prevail, Mr. Henwood estimated in his survey of the Gwennap
 district — which consists chiefly of slates — that about a fourth of the
 rainfall is absorbed, the mean annual rainfall there being 46 inches,
or equal to 166,834 cubic feet per acre.     The local percolation   how is,
 ever, extremely variable, as in some mines the quantity pumped up
 does not exceed     gallons, while in others
                       5                          amounts to 186 gallons
                                                     it
per minute.
  The same observer      found that water passes more freely through
slate than   through granite, the quantity yielded by mines in slate
being   about four times as much as that in granite. In a period of five
years
         (1833-7) the water pumped per minute from forty mines,
amounted     on a mean to the following proportions           —

  ground in the Gwennap district is of mnch interest.             The mines in
  that district, over an area of 5500 acres, were combined for drainage
  purposes.    A great adit carried away the water above the sea-level,
 while a deep-seated level collected the water at the depth of from
 1100 to 1200 feet.     At the time that Mr. Henwood wrote, the former
 was discharging 1475 cubic feet per minute, and from the latter 909
 cubic feet were being pumped up, or together above 10 million
 gallons in the twenty-four hours. Taking the mean temperature of the
 surface at 50°, as the water issues at a temperature of from 60° to
 68" F., or at an average of more than 12° above the mean of the
 climate, it is easy to conceive how large must be the amount of heat
 which the waters abstract from the mines, and how considerable the
 cooling of the enclosing rocks which must result therefrom.
    Another observer, writing a few years earlier, states that the dis
 charge at the Huel Vor Mine from a depth of 950 feet, was 1,692,660
 gallons every twenty-four hours ; at Dolcoath Mine, from about 1400
 feet, 535,173 gallons; and at Huel Abraham Mine it reached the large
quantity of 2,098,320 gallons*
    Mr. Henwood remarks that " the largest streams of water flow
 through cross-veins ; small ones through the lodes, whilst but little
issues from the rocks whether granitic or slaty."
    Where the water dribbles slowly through the rocks to great depths,
it will no doubt acquire the normal temperature of the depth, but where
it passes more rapidly through the veins and lodes, the temperature
 will depend upon the time occupied in transit and on the volume of
water.      If the flow is rapid, as it evidently is in some mines, the
surface-waters may carry the influence of the above-ground tempera
ture to considerable depths.       If on the other hand, the vein is one in
 which the ore is subject to decomposition by the surface-waters, those
waters will have their temperature more or less raised.                A copious
stream of warm water is considered among the Cornish miners a
favourable indication of the proximity of a lode.                 Nevertheless,
Mr.   Henwood,    who,  as we may feel assured, fully understood all the
contingent conditions, considered that by a careful selection of the
underground springs and by taking them when freshly opened, they
gave safer temperature results than did the undisturbed rock.
    Hot Springs. — These are not uncommon in metallic mines. They
are due to two causes,       lstly, to chemical decomposition ; 2ndly, to
water coming from greater depths.
    The first of these causes is a very general one— especially in copper
and iron mines, in which the lode consists of iron and copper pyrites.
The surface-waters decompose these sulphides, converting them into
sulphates, which by further changes that need not be here described,
pass into the oxides and carbonates of these metals.            That the action

is general is   shown by the circumstance that the upper part of all
these lodes consists near the surface of a crust, several feet and some
times several fathoms thick, composed of the oxidised products of
copper and iron sulphides ; this part of the vein is known in Cornwall
under the distinctive term of gossan.         In these cases, the water is
commonly impregnated with some of the resulting soluble sulphates,
and has its temperature raised by this decomposition.
   Mr. R. Hunt mentions* two marked instances of the heating effects
arising from this cause.     In one case the temperature in the level of
a copper mine stood at 100° F., hut on the removal of a very large
                                 " the level became cold
deposit of the copper pyrites                              enough to make
the agent wish for a great-coat."      The exact difference is not given.
In another case, a large deposit of iron pyrites was opened at about
half a mile distant from a hot lode, 1530 feet deep, in the Clifford
Amalgamated Mine, and the mere fact of opening the mine there and
removing the iron pyrites, considerably rednced the temperature in
the mine.     When it was closed the temperature rose to its former
height.    Springs of various degrees of heat (one was as high as 124°)
are often met with.
   The miners of Cornwall have long held that the lodes containing
tin are, at equal depths, colder than those in which copper ores occur ;
a fact which is no doubt due to the facility with which the cupreous
pyrites decomposes.
   There must also be cases in which water from greater depths is
brought up along lines of fissure (lodes and cross-veins) ; for as
these are  prolonged downwards, they may traverse at greater depths
strata, veins, or faults, charged with water, which, when thus tapped,
will outflow at any levels lower than the height at which the water
stands in the supplying source.
   It sometimes also happens that at the same depths, but in distant
parts of the same level, the water is of different temperatures.       In
one instance there were springs at 102°, 110°, and 124°, and in another
case (Wheal Wreath), the temperature of a small stream at the east
end of a lode (tin) was 71°"5, while a spring at the west end of the
lode had a temperature        of 75° (both being at the depth of 1422
feet).
   On the other hand, when the water is in considerable volume, and
 percolates rapidly, it must tend to have a lower temperature than
 the normal rock temperature, as in the instance where, in two adjacent
 mines, large streams both coming out of veins, had the same tem
 perature of 67-5°  at the respective depths of 588 and 722 feet. The
 observations  of Henwood likewise tend to show that the range of
 temperature of water in the same level is subject to great variation.
    In consequence of the uncertainty attaching on the one hand to

observations taken     in rock, and on the other to those iii water, Cornish
geologists have been divided      in opinion as to the best plan to adopt.
The two great authorities on the subject, Mr. R. Were Fox and
Mr. W. J. Henwood, respectively gave preference, —the one to rock
and the other to water (or rather springs), — and we may feel sure that
the subject was well weighed and considered by both. Either system
is in fact open to some objections, and neither can be employed with
out recourse to those safeguards and precautions, which no one knew
better how to use than these two experienced observers.
   Mr. Henwood gives as his reason for preferring springs, —that the
rocks forming the sides of the shaft and levels must, to a certain
extent, partake of the temperature of the air circulating through them,
and that this air could not escape the influence of heat-producing
causes at one time, and at another of the cooling effects of the intake-
air. For the same reason he objected to the use for temperature pur
poses of the water standing in the levels, or sumps.              He found it
difficult to select stations at which the influence of those conditions
would be always alike, and he was led to confine his observations as
much as possible to the temperature of the streams of water imme
diately as they issue from fresh opened unbroken rock, —before they
could be affected by the temperature of the levels, — as the places
which would give the most correct temperature readings.
    The following observations appear to me amongst the most reliable
of those obtained in springs. The deepest seated springs are probably
the most free from interference by the surface temperature and other
disturbing causes.

   Instead of a few selected observations, Mr. Henwood took a larger
number and a wider range, though to this there is the objection that
he thereby includes a number of extreme and doubtful cases.                Thus,

  he took the large          number of 415 observations         made    in ten Cornish
  mines, and on          reducing them to given mean depths, obtained the
 following rate of increase of temperature               with depth : —

     He elsewhere         gives the mean temperature for other depths              : —

     He noticed also that there was a difference between the tempera
 ture of the springs issuing from the granite and those from the slate
 rocks.        The mean of 134 observations made to a depth of 1200 feet
 in  Cornwall and Devon, gave the following thermometric gradients —
                      In granite               41-5 feet per 1° Fahr.
                      In slate                 39-0        „
     Further, taking         separately the springs issuing from veins of dif
ferent     characters, he arrived at the following results : —
       For      cross- veins at a depth of 594 feet      ....    40'0 feet per       1°
       For     lodes generally         „       660 „     ....    41 -6         „

       For     tin lodes               ,,      552    ,, ....    51'5t         „
    The    result of these and various other calculations, is that for the
springs issuing from the rock, the mean thermometric gradient was
 401 feet, and from the lodes 40 3 feet per degree.
    The early observations of Mr. Fox were made in the mine waters,
but his later experiments            were made in the rocks, and he expressed
afterwards some doubts as to the value of his earlier experiments.]!
He considered that the rock observations were free from the direct-
influence which the descent of the surface-waters exercises on the lodes
   *  I am    unable to explain this difference. The more rapid gradient in No. 1 is
probably    due to the heat resulting from the oxidation caused by the surface-waters
   t There would appear to be some mistake in this figure, as iu another page he
states that the temperature in the tin and copper lodes conjointly at a mean depth
of 444 feet is 61 '4°, which gives a rate of increase of 89 feet per degree.

going on in the upper part of the lode, or to lower the temperature
when the surface-watera are abundant and infiltrate rapidly.

the most reliable of the results obtained, the temperature having

   Foreign Mines. — We know too little of all the conditions which
obtain in foreign mines to draw any definite conclusion as to the rate
of increase of temperature.              Possibly the observations may prove
available when we have more certain information respecting the
mean annual temperature at each place, the height of the mine above
the sea, and the position, especially in mountainous districts, of each
station with reference to its depth beneath the surface.
   This latter element is one, which the coal-mines observations pre
viously given, clearly show should be taken into account. In Cornwall
it is not of much importance, as the elevations are small, and the

                            On Underground Temperatures.
  mines       are rarely more than 100 to 300 or 400 feet above the sea
  level   ;   but the mines of Freiberg are on higher ground, whilst those of
 Prizbam and Chemnitz are situated amongst high hills, and the tem
 perature at the end of a long gallery may be, in relation to depth
beneath the surface, very different to that given by the depth of the
shaft.
     The mines of Freiberg are those in which the greatest number of
observations have been made, though none of them are of very recent
date.         The deepest mine, and one in which the observations were
made         in holes in the rock (gneiss), gives, if we are right in our
estimate        of the surface temperature,* a rate of increase with depth of
54    feet per degree. But in this instance, — as in the case of Mr. Fox's
observation (No. 73) in Dolcoath Mine, where the thermometer was left
in position for one and a half year, — it was here left two years, and
there must have been as before described, a cooling of the rock, such
is would reduce the temperature so far below the normal, as to
place       it in equilibrium with the temperature of the cooler air in the
galleries. The temperature of 66" at Freiberg, and of 76° at Dolcoath,
with their thermometric gradients of 54 and 53 feet,                         I  take to
represent the normal temperature of the rock, minus the loss of heat
due to ventilation ; and if that can be estimated at anything like the
loss shown to have taken place in a level in the Wheal Vor Mine, which,
after it had been opened some time and the mine had been deepened,
amounted to abont 6°, or in a similar instance mentioned by Mr. Hen-
wood, where the difference amounted to 7°, it would indicate a normal
temperature of these mines more in accordance with the gradient
which we have adopted on other grounds.
     For the same reason the numerous observations made by Mr. Hen-
wood in the mines of Brazil and Chili, are, for the present, not
available, though it is possible that they may be rendered so at a
 future period, should the other factors necessary for determining the
difference between the surface and the underground temperature be
ascertained.

    This class of observations presents results much more uniform than
those taken          either in Coal or Mineral Mines, and whereas the obser
 vations in Mines were in Palaeozoic or crystalline rocks, those in Wells
are, with few exceptions, either in Cretaceous,                Jurassic, or Triassic

 water, and less disturbed.
    Many of the interfering causes difficult to eliminate in the case 6f the
 Mines, do not exist with the Artesian Wells.           The causes of interfer
 ence in the latter are reduced mainly to two, namely, pressure on the
instruments and convection currents.            The early experiments, where
 no precautions were taken against pressure, are consequently un
reliable. Walferdin introduced improved and protected instruments,
 although in some previous oases, as in Marcet and De la Rive's
observations, protected thermometers had been used.              The need of
 protection against convection currents had also not escaped attention,
but it was not until the later observations, instituted by the Com
mittee of the British Association, were made, that more efficient safe
guards were introduced to protect more completely against the subtle
influence of these currents.
    It is clear that we must reject all the early experiments made with
unprotected thermometers ; and it is not certain whether also a large
number of those made with protected thermometers, but without pro
tection, and sufficient protection, against convection currents, should
not also be rejected.
    In large bore-holes the disturbance from this cause is so great
that the consequences are at once sufficiently apparent to oblige
the rejection of the observations.             The ordinary deep artesian
wells of Paris, such as Grenelle and others, all agree in showing
a rate of increase        of 55 to 58 feet per degree F. ; but the
great bore-hole (4j feet in diameter) through the same strata in
another part of Paris (La Chapelle St. Denis), where the water does
not overflow, gave a rate of increase of 39^ feet per degree for the first
100 metres (328 feet), which is too rapid, whilst at the depth of
660 metres (2165 feet) the rate of increase was only 1° in 84 feet.
This is clearly due, as stated by Professor Everett, to the over
heating of the upper part of the column of water and to the cooling of
the lower part by the action of convection cnrrents.          In the report of
a deep boring at Moscow it is stated, but without explanation, that
from 350 feet to the bottom at 994 feet the temperature was nearly
constant at 10-1° C. (50 2° F.).        The diameter of the bore-hole is not
given, but I judge     from    other  circumstances that it is not less than
2 feet, and can only account for the uniformity of temperature by the
action of convection currents.           The mean annual temperature of
Moscow is 39'4°.
    Professor Everett* also directs attention to the manifest action of
convection currents in a shaft at Allendale, about 350 feet deep, with
nearly 150 feet of water, in which the temperature was practically the
same at all depths.

   While in another shaft at Ashburton 620 feet deep, and with water
standing to within 50 feet from the surface, the temperature at all
depths was 53°, except at one point, where it rose to 53'4° and 53"2°.
   Even in the deep and narrow bore-hole at Sperenberg, it was shown
that the first experiments with thermometers protected                         against
pressure,    but   not against    convection   currents,   gave wrong results, for
in the first instance at a depth of 100 feet, the temperature was
found to be 11° R., and at 3390 feet, 341° R.                     Afterwards, when
plugs were inserted to stop the currents, the temperatures                       at the
same respective depths had altered to 9° R. and 36" 1 6° R., showing
therefore that the first readings were too high by 2° Reaumur near
the top of the bore, and too low by 2-05° Reaumur at the bottom.
Another experiment in the same well later showed that the difference
at the bottom, between plugging and no plugging, was as much as
6f°  Fahr*

tion   currents, was that sunk to a depth of 2000 feet, at Swinderby,

three weeks, and the water stood within a few feet of the top.

gives a difference of 31" for the whole depth, or 64£ feet increase
for each degree F. If it stood by itself this might appear nothing
remarkable, yet it is evident, from the series of observations that were
 taken in this bore-hole, that the temperature or rate of increase at the
 depth of 100 feet, which was equal to 1° in 10 feet, and at 300 feet to
1° in 28 feet, is excessive, and that this excess can only have been
acquired through loss of heat by convection currents at the bottom and
a corresponding gain at the top, and thus making the readings too high
at top and too low at bottom.       If, however, we take an intermediate
station at a depth of 1000 feet, where the temperature averages 69'2°,
we get a mean, and more probably truer, rate of increase with depth
of 47 feet per degree.
   Owing to the large diameter of the bore, to the many water-levels
in the rocks, and to the circumstance that when the observations
were made there was no sufficiently free ontflow of water on the surface,
such as would check the convection currents, there can, I think, be no
doubt that the temperature of the well at Bootle (No. 153), sunk in
the New Red Sandstone at Liverpool, is influenced both by convection
currents and by the influx of waters at different levels.
   It is clear, therefore, that great uncertainty attaches to all observa
tions made in bore-holes with standing water, the error being in
proportion to the diameter of the bore-hole ; and that where experi
ments have been made without plugging, all the deep temperature
readings will be too low. Even with this precaution, it may be a
question whether the bottom water and that of the adjacent rock may
not have had their temperature permanently lowered before trial.
This might be remedied to some extent by the uso of more than one
ping, and the stoppage of the circulation throughout the whole depth
of the bore hole for a certain time.
   There are, however, some artesian bore-holes, where the sources of
error have been reduced to a minimum. Amongst those are —
    1. Kentish Town (No. 129). — These careful experiments were carried
on for some years by Mr. Symons. From the circumstance that the
mud at the bottom of the bore-hole into which the thermometer was
sunk, was free from convection currents, the results obtained show,
in all probability, a near approximation to the normal temperature.
At the same time the long period that the well had stood neglected
allowed the play of those currents in the water standing in the tube
above the mud, and this may possibly have effected a slight reduction
of temperature, but it cannot be very material.
   2. Richmond. — The observations here were made by Professor Judd
with standard instruments.        The overflow was too small to give the
correct temperature, though enough to check convection currents,
and consequently the temperature was ascertained by letting down a
thermometer to the bottom of the well.

      3.  The first experiments at Orenelh were made when the bore-hole
  had reached the       depth of 400 metres (1312 feet), and when no work
  had been going on for some weeks. The thermometers, of which three
  sets were used, were left down thirty-six hours.              They were protected
 against pressure, and Arago remarks that the chalk through which
 they were boring made so thick a paste filling the bore-hole, that
 convection currents were hardly possible.. All three sets of instru
 ments gave results within a fraction of a degree to one another.*
     4. In the bore-hole ot the well at the JEcole Militaire the experi
 ments were made by Walferdin under very similar conditions.
     5. Pregny near         Geneva. — The thermometer was here protected
against pressure, and to a certain extent against convection currents.
 Tbe bore-hole was small, and the water stood at a small depth below
 the surface.
    6.   The observations at the well at Odend, with the water also
 slightly overflowing,, were made by Professor Cr. Dewalque, of Liege,
 with protected thermometers at the bottom of the bore-hole.
     7. At Sperenberg, especial care was taken against convection cur
 rents, though how far these currents may have operated in reducing
generally the temperature in the lower part of the bore-hole, before
the experiments commenced, may be a little uncertain.
    These seven wells give a mean rate of' increase of rather more than
 51 feet for each degree F. in depth (see p. 40).             The reason why I have
 not included a larger number, is because in these cases I believe in
the existence of some nndetected errors, such, for example, as, amongst
 many others, those mentioned in the following, instances.
    Stcinderby. — I have already explained my objections in this case.
 Of the first series of observations down to a depth of 1500 feet, Pro
 fessor Everett remarks
                                 " it is obvious that nearly all the
                                                                              tempera-
tores are largely affected by           convection,"     he considered the bottom
temperature at 2000 feet as less likely to be vitiated by convection in
consequence of the small diameter of the bore-hole.

    [But if we take, as have suggested, a mean depth and a mean
temperature,       I believe we should have in the thermometric gradient of
i7 feet per degree, a nearer approach to the true normal at Swinderby.
Even in cases where the temperature is uniform from top to bottom,
and there appears to be no clue to follow, as in the instance with the
Moscow Well (No. 135), where Professor Lubinoff records a tempera
ture of 10-1° C. (50-2° ¥.), if not for the whole depth of 994 feet, at least
from 350 to 994 feet, it seems possible to obtain an approximate
gradient.       For the mean annual surface temperature being 39"5° F.,
and the half depth 494 feet, if we divide this by 10'7° (the difference

 convection currents operated ; apparently no protection against con
 vection currents during the experiment.

    Overflowing     Artesian Wells. — We now come to surer ground.
Under certain conditions, these wells must give not only the nearest,
but a very near, measure of the underground temperature, at the level
from which the water rises.               These conditions are —
    1st. A sufficient depth and a sufficient distance of the out-crop of
the water-bearing strata from the point of overflow. In a case like
the Grenelle well, which is nearly 2000 feet deep, and where the
stratum which serves as a channel for the water does not come to the

                       On Underground Temperatures.                      41
 surface for a  distance of above 100 miles, these conditions are most
  favourable.   It is very interesting to find, from information which M.
 Daubree has just (Dec., 1884) obligingly obtained for me, that the
 temperature    of the water at the Grenelle well is now precisely the
 same (27'8° C.)« if not 0-l° C. higher, than it was at the commence
 ment of the overflow forty-two years ago.       In London, the distance of
 10 miles at which the Lower Tertiaries and the Chalk out-crop is also
 no doubt sufficient, but it is a question whether the excessive pumping
 and constant passage of water may not have cooled the channels.
    2nd. A sufficient volume and consequently rapid upward flow of
 the water in proportion to the depth, otherwise the water will part
 with some of its heat, as it rises through the tube.     This may possibly
be in some small degree the case at Grenelle, for in the carefully con
ducted observations of Arago and Walferdin,            when the well had
reached a depth of 400 metres, the temperature (23' 75° C.) gave a rate
of increase of 55 feet per degree, instead of that of 58 feet when it
overflowed.      At the Ecole Militaire, the rate was, as ascertained by
Walferdin, 54 feet.      It is possible, therefore, that the slower rate of
increase at Grenelle indicated by the overflow water at a greater
depth (548 metres) may arise from a reduction of temperature due
in part from the water overflowing with a velocity by no means great,
but mainly from the diameter of the tube at the top being considerably
greater than at the bottom.
    The conditions of depth and volume are generally satisfactory
in the case of the great saline wells in Germany, especially in
the instance of the well at Neu Salzwerk.             Humboldt states the
supply of water was very abundant, the outflow being then at the
rate of 422,000 gallons daily.      Its ascensional force was remarkable,
as was also the enormous         discharge of carbonic acid.     The deep
artesian wells of Minden, which derive their water from the same
source, give very similar results.
    The discharge of water at the thermal springs of Mondorff in
Luxembourg is very much less than at those of Neu Salzwerk.
It is situated further south, and the height of the ground is consider
ably greater, being 673 feet above the sea-level ; the mean annual
surface temperature adopted by Walferdin was 48"4° F., but this was
only an estimate.      The mean temperature of Luxembourg, according
to Arago, is only 8° C. (46-5° F.).
    The depth of the artesian well at Tours is much less than that of
the above, but the ascent of water was rapid and the discharge large.
The observations there were made by Walferdin, as were also those
 at  Rochefort.
    The following   list is confined to those wells where the overflow is
abundant, and     where the observations     have been made by competent
 observers.

   We thus have in these wells an average rate of increase of 49 feet
for each degree F., or if we take the mean of the two lists, of
almost exactly 50 feet per degree.    Before, however, accepting this
conclusion, two points should be reserved for correction hereafter,
namely : 1st, the determination of the precise temperature at a depth
where the annual surface changes cease to be felt. 2nd, whether
there is any loss of heat, and what the amount, by the water in
ascending through the tubes.    This latter      believe, not an unim

portant consideration.
   The experiments at Grenelle indicate the probability of some such
loss, and the form of construction of the tubes gives strength to the
supposition. If the tubes of an artesian well were of the same diameter
throughout, the passage of any given portion of the water from the depth
to the surface would be direct, and the velocity the same throughout                           ;
but the tubes in almost all these wells decrease in diameter from the top
to the bottom, consequently, instead of the whole body of water being
in continuous and uniform motion throughout the length of the tube,
the velocity of the water gradually decreases from the bottom to the
top, currents are established at the points where the tubes enlarge,
and a certain time beyond that required for its direct trajectory must
elapse before the whole of the water issues at the surface.
   For example, at Grenelle, where the difference between the size of
the tubes at the top and bottom of the bore-hole        less than in some
                                                                      is
wells, there are four tubes of the respective       diameters   of 0-25 m.,
0'22 m., 0'18 m., and 0"17 m.     As the lesser the depth of the well the

 fewer   the changes of tubes, the differences in this respect, together
 with the differences      in length of the tube, may possibly help to
explain the reason why the wells of 300 to 600 feet deep gave gene
rally a more rapid rate of increase than the wells of 2000 feet, and
may    also account for the different rates of increase at the several
wells, for which otherwise there is no apparent cause.
    I have exclnded a large number of overflowing wells because
of the uncertainty which attaches to the instruments used, or to some
essential point of which we are in ignorance, such, for example,
as the influx of other springs, the precise          depth, the size of the
tubes, &c.     These reasons apply to such wells as those of Newport
(No. 210), Falkirk and Midlothian (45), Dunkirk and Bourbourg
(209, 208), Alfort (49), Meaux (62), Arcachon (183), and others,
where we do not know whether or not standard and protected instru
ments were used, or whether the experiments were in all such cases
made by competent observers.
    With respect to the extra- European observations, still greater un
certainty attaches from our ignorance of the general conditions, and
especially of the exact mean annual temperature of the several places.
At the same time there are some exceptions worthy of consideration.
The experiments in the Sahara Desert (No. 88a) were made by an
engineer of great experience in the construction of artesian wells, and
accustomed to observations of this description, and are the mean of
results obtained at a number of wells. The observations at Charleston
and St. Louis appear reliable, only in these cases more particulars are
desirable.
    The  African and Indian experiments seem to indicate a more rapid
rate of increase    of temperature with depth than occurs in Europe.
Not so the   American (U.S.) observations, which appear to indicate con
 ditions  very similar to those which obtain here. Not much weight can
 he  attached to the solitary observation in South America. It requires
 confirmation.
                                IV. Tunnels.
    The few observations     of this class, limited    as they are, show not
 only the modifications of the gradients caused by inequalities of
 surface, but bear also on some important geological questions con
 nected with the structure of mountain chains and metaroorphism.
 The first great tunnel was that of Mont Cenis, which is about 7 miles
 long, and passes under a ridge of the Alps rising 9532 feet above the
 «ea level, and 5280 feet above the tunnel.      After making a correction
for the convexity of the surface, Professor Everett estimates the rate
 of increase of temperature with depth to be 1° F. in 79 feet.           But
 the  observations   there   were   commenced    late,   and were   not very
 complete.

  44                         Prof. J. Prestwich
     In the St. Gothard tunnel, where very fall and complete observa
 tions were carried out by Dr. Stapff, the results are of much interest.
  The tunnel is about 9 miles long ; the summit level of the ridge
  above the tunnel is 10,040 feet above the sea level, and 5578 feet
  above the tunnel.      This, after allowing for the convexity of the
  surface, gave a rate of increase of 1° F. in 82 feet.    But Dr. Stapff*
 has since pointed out that in one part of the tunnel the rate is
 considerably more rapid.         He found that the relative tempera
  ture of the ground above the northern end of the tunnel was much
 higher than in other parts — that in the plain of Andermatl the
 mean rock temperature was several degrees above the normal, while
 at the south end of the tunnel it was some degrees below it. The
 latter circumstance was easily explained by the presence of cold
 springs ; and some higher temperatures in other parts of the tunnel
 were attributable to the decomposition of the rock ; but there were no
 apparent reasons for this excess of temperature in the northern end
 of the tunnel, where it passes through gneiss and granite.              The
 difference was such that instead of a rate of increase of 1° in 85 feet in
 the centre of the tunnel, or of an average rate of increase for the
 whole tunnel estimated by him at 57'8 feet, the rate was here 1° F. in
 38 feet.    Dr. Stapff says that there is no obvious explanation of the
 rapid   increase in the granite rocks at this end of the tunnel, and that
 it is probably to be attributed to the influence of different thermal
 qualities of the rock. He mentions, further, that this granite be
 longs to the massif of the Finsteraarhorn, which is of a different
 (newer) geological age to that of the central axis of St. Gothard, and
 that it is therefore not to be wondered at " if one of them be cooler
 than the other." He elsewhere remarks that there is also a well-
 known local focus of heat (decomposition of rock) below the valley of
 Andermatt, which may exercise a sufficient influence.
    I  myself am disposed to attribute the greater heat of these rocks to
mechanical action rather than to the later protrusion of the Plutonic
rocks, or to any subsequent decomposition of these rocks.             If the
pressure, force, and friction accompanying elevation of mountain
chains be attended by the development of great heat —a heat sufficient
to produce great chemical changes even in the Tertiary strata — then
it may be possible for some of the newer mountain chains still to
retain a portion of that heat. The facts brought forward by Dr.
Stapff in the St. Gothard tunnel give material support to this view.
    Although Mallet failed to show that the heat produced in the crush
ing of rocks by the lateral pressure, arising from the contraction of the
crust of the earth as a consequence of its slow secular refrigeration,

 he  nevertheless      brought prominently forward the enormous heat-
 producing power of the disturbances caused by this contraction. He
made a series of elaborate experiments to ascertain the force re
quired to crush blocks of a given size (3 or 3£ cubic metres), and
measured the work done by the estimated heat evolved by the crush
ing of I cubic foot of several classes of rock by the number of cubic
feet of -water at 32° F. converted into steam of one atmosphere,                             or

to prove the essential fact that a mechanical disturbance of the rocks
may develop a large amount of heat.                   I  must refer to his valuable
paper* for full details of his results.               The following is an abstract

   Thus with the ordinary sedimentary rocks the crushing weight (or
that   at which the blocks yield to pressure) is from 2^ to 15^ tons
per square inch of surface, while for the crystalline rocks it rises to 31
tons.    The heat produced on the metal surroundings by the crushing
was   in most cases easily perceptible to the hand, and was so great in
some    of the granites and porphyries as to necessitate a delay for the
apparatus to cool.        Both Mallet and Rankin were of opinion that " in
the crushing of a rigid material such as rock, almost the entire me
chanical work (with the small residue of external work) reappears as
heat."    If, therefore, the disturbance affecting the massive strata of a
great mountain range were sudden or of short duration, an intense
degree of heat might be rapidly developed ; but there is reason to
suppose    that such movements have been of extreme slowness during

 long periods of time, and it was only when the tension had reached a
 certain point that fracture and disruption, accompanied by a more
 rapid motion of the parts, took place.
     What the force of the pressure may have been in these cases is
 shown by the compression of the strata in the Alps, by the extra
 ordinary folds and inversions of the rocks, and by the vertical
 cleavage (a resultant of pressure) which the whole mass of rocks has
 undergone.       We may illustrate this point by the following generalised
 section across the central axis of the Alps along the line of tunnel.

    But although the compression             may have been excessive, and the
 actual mechanical displacement great, the crushing was not so complete
 nor so sudden as to produce the extreme effects indicated by the expe
riments. Complete crushing is not, however, necessary for our object,
since the experiments show that on the first yielding of the rocks,
which takes place when the weight is rather more than one-third of
the crushing weight, a large portion of heat is given off. Consequently
not only would the heat be developed very gradually (and much of it
might be dissipated during the long periods that the disturbances
lasted), but also the major effects obtained artificially would never be
realised in nature. Nevertheless, although fusion may not have taken
place, there were molecular and chemical changes produced in the
rocks which indicate the existence of very considerable heat ; and there
is reason to believe that this heat was often due to mechanical causes,
and not to the protrusion of the molten granitic centres.                     In fact
M. A. Favre and         other   Swiss   geologists now consider the granite in
those ranges to have been in existence in its present relative place
when the elevation and crushing occurred.
    Mallet further showed that the quantity of heat developed varied
greatly in different rocks, and that, although compressed by the same
force before their elastic limits were passed, yet, when released, it
would render a quartz rock nearly three times as hot as a slate rock.

                         On Underground Temperature*.                             47
 Consequently granite and gneiss, with their large proportion of freo
 quartz, would be more affected than the other rocks.
     When, therefore, we consider at how late a geological period some
of the great mountain chains have been uplifted, it is not impossible,
looking at the magnitude of the massifs, that some residual portion of
the heat produced by compression, faulting, and crushing, may still exist
in such modern chains as the Alps and the Himalayas, or in Continental
areas of recent elevation when that elevation has been accompanied
by compression and faulting. This is a consideration which, although
exceptional, should not be overlooked in the general qnestion of
underground temperatures, especially in mining districts, where we
have to deal with disturbed areas, with their faults, dykes, and
mineral veins ; at the same time, there can be little doubt that the
disturbances in most of these areas are of such high antiquity that
 there is in most instances small probability of the rock showing
 remaining traces of thermal effects due to these causes. Neverthe
 less, when the area has been affected by late disturbances, it is possible
 for the thermic normal to be influenced by such a cause independently
 of the action of any volcanic or igneous rocks.*

     Although it is evidently possible to account for many of the appa
  rent discrepancies in the thermometric gradients by the causes dis
  cussed in the foregoing pages, yet it is equally evident that there are
  irregularities — not only between the rocks in the three groups of
  observations, but also common to individual instances in each separate
  group — which these causes do not adequately explain. As the rocks
  in each group are of very different lithological characters, and ns
  there are also occasional lesser differences of characters in the
   members of each separate group, the common disturbing cause may
  in some measure depend upon those differences of structure and
   composition which variably affect the conductivity of the rocks.
      The researches which bear most directly on this inquiry are thoso of
   Professors Herschel and Lebourf in this country, and M. JannettazJ in
   France, the former relating more especially to the differences de
   pendent upon the lithological structure of the rocks, and the latter to
   those dependent on the component minerals. Tabulating the results of
   Professor Herschel and Lebour's experiments in accordance with their
   geological relations, as grouped in Tables II, III, and IV, we obtain
   the following mean conductivities for the several groups of rocks : —

   This shows    a considerable difference between the conductivity of the
metamorphic and palaeozoic rocks of the Mineral and Coal Mines, and
that of the newer strata in which the Artesian Wells are usually
situated   ; but there are conditions, hydro-geological and structural,
obtaining in the rock masses themselves, which introduce many modi
fications affecting the value of these differences.
   For example, in each group there are subordinate beds, which may
have more or less local influence.       In the first there are seams of coal,
of which the conductivity is extremely small, though these seams form
but a fraction of the entire mass.        Thus there are —
                                                                                 Total

   The coal therefore     only enters as a very small fractional part into
the constitution of the Coal-measures.           Besides, the coal seams vary
very much in thickness, and are        of  limited   range, that is to say, they
form thin plates never coextensive with the Coal-measures them
selves ; at the same time, when one thins out, it may be replaced by
another on a different level.
   In the crystalline and schistose rocks, veins and layers of quartz
and of quartzite are of common occurrence, though very irregular in
their mode of distribution.     The quartz veins and seams are generally
thin, hut the quartzite often forms masses of large dimensions.

occurrence in the Triassic strata ; in the remarkable instance of the

     The Influence   of Water.
                                — The above, however, are but local and
minor conditions, subordinate to one of a much greater and wider
influence.      The conductivity experiments of Messrs. Herschel and
Lebour were, with few exceptions, made with blocks of dried rock.
In a few instances they repeated the experiment with wet blocks of
the same material, and with a remarkable difference in the result.
Thus—

     Here we have substances which when dry present great thermal
resistance, becoming when wet amongst the best of the rock conduc
tors of heat — equal, if not superior, to that of the crystalline and
schistose rocks.
     This condition becomes, in considering the question of conductivity
in relation to underground temperatures, a matter of very great
 importance, for in nature dry rocks are the exception and wet rocks the
 rule. The level of permanent saturation of the strata is regulated by the
 sea level on the outside, and by the level of the river valleys and their
 tributaries inland. All the rocks below those levels are, as a rule, per
 manently saturated with water, while between the valleys the line of
 water level rises in proportion to the distance the water has to travel,
 and the friction offered by the rocks before it escapes as springs.                In
 the chalk hills of Kent or Surrey, for example, which rise to the
 height of 500 to 600 feet, the water level stands 200 to 300 feet beneath
 the surface, while below that level, the rock, whatever its thickness,
 is in a state of saturation.          In the valleys the chalk is saturated to
 the surface ; and Artesian Wells are always in relatively low levels. It
  is the same with the sandstones of the Trias or of the Coal-measures,
  only that in the latter the presence of faults often cuts off the supply,
  and segments exist with but little water except that of imbibition.
  This water of imbibition, or quarry water, is present in rocks above
   the line of permanent saturation, it being a property that depends on
  the capillarity of the rock, which is very strong in chalk and oolite,
   while it is slight in quartzose grits and sands. There are therefore
  few rocks in which the influence of water is not felt.
     * It may, however, be a question whether it ie not intercalated with thin eeams of
  gypsum.

     In the hard granites, sandstones, and limestones, the water of im
  bibition differs but little in proportion from that of saturation.                   The
  difference   is considerable in the softer rocks. The following are some
  of the few   experiments that have been made on this point.

     It is clear then that the conductivity of the underground rocks
  must, except     in some very hilly districts, be taken solely as that of wet
  rocks.    In the harder and more compact rocks there will be little
  difference, but in the softer and more porous rocks the difference
  arising from this cause must be very considerable.
     The conductivity even of coal will be increased,                      although the
  quantity of water that coal imbibes is very small.                    But unwrought
  coal also contains a large proportion of gas — and gas in a state of
  extreme condensation,        or possibly in a state near liquidity, and this
  also may have an effect upon its conductivity.
     Foliation and Cleavage. — The other condition, to which we have
" already alluded, is that produced by foliation                and cleavage, and by
  the angle at which the strata lie.                Messrs. Herschel and Lebour
  showed, for example, that the conductivity of slates varies accordingly
  as it is taken across or along the planes of cleavage — that while the
  conductivity along the planes of cleavage is equal to that of the
  crystalline rocks, it is no greater than that of soft sandstones across

   M. Jannettaz* has extended the inquiry to a great number of other
rocks, and he shows that the variation in conductivity in many rockt*
is largely dependent upon the presence of mica.   He found that in a
crystal of mica, heat was conducted about two and a-half times more
rapidly along the planes of cleavage than perpendicular to it.                                         In
augite these axes of the thermic curve are in the proportion of about
two to one.
     M. Jannettaz  obtained results of a similar character, varying
according to certain physical conditions, in a number of other
minerals and in many rocks.      The ratio of the minor to the major
axis in the following rocks he found to be as follows : —

    The thermic curves attain their maximum variation in talcose and
 micaceous     schists and in slates. The greatest inequality, 1 : 3, was
 shown    by a specimen of a talcose rock, of sp. gr. 2-7.          The variation
exists   in all rocks showing schistosity or lamination, but in ordinaiy
stratified rocks the thermic curve remains that of the circle.                  It
was found that the variation exists also in rock crystal, gypsum,
felspar, Ac.      All the specimens experimented upon were dry.
    It is evident then that in gneissic rocks and slates, the dip, cleavage,
and foliation may have a very important effect on the conduction of
heat; lamination has a similar but lesser effect in argillaceous shales;
in ordinary sandstones and limestones no such effects are produced.
Whilst these effects therefore may be very manifest in the rocks
generally associated with Mineral Veins, they can only be small in
Coal Mines, although they may be in some places increased by a larger
proportion of mica in the sandstones and shales.                There is also the
farther consideration with strata, such as those of the Coal-measures,
that although there may be separately                 little difference    in the
thermic axes of the different rocks, the differences of conductivity in
the various component           strata may, as with foliation, allow of a
variable transmission of heat along the planes of the inclined
strata, at their outcrop.       But, even if that be the case, the effect would
be merely local, possibly affecting the mass of inclined strata to a
given depth, but in no ways affecting the special problem in relation
to the general body of strata unaffected by those local conditions.
                                   Conclusions.
    The list   of selected  cases on    which these conclusions are based may
appear     small, but   I feel satisfied that the sources of error in experi
ments     of   underground temperatures are so many and so obscure,
that without the fuller information             which we have in these few
instances, the larger number are not          available  for our purpose, though
they all bear on the        general question, and with the corrected data
before    named    it  may be possible to utilise some of them hereafter.
We now require, however, for this object those observations                  only
which give the nearest possible approximation                to the  true thermo-
metric gradient, and for this it is necessary to reject all the doubtful
and more      uncertain cases. For these reasons I have confined myself,
in the case      of the Coal Mines, to the limited number of the eight
instances given in the list at p. 24 ; and in the Mineral Mines to
eighteen of the seemingly most reliable rock and spring observa
 tions of Fox and Henwood.             The Artesian Wells give more uniform
results,  —  results  which,   under    certain conditions, should be perfectly
 true.    I have, however, only been able to select fifteen wells, of which
 eight are overflowing wells, and seven not-overflowing.

   Taking these three classes of observations we obtain the following'
values for their several gradients     :—
                                                  Thermometric gradient
                                                       per 1° F»hr.
             Coal mines                                 49-5 feet
             Mines other than coal                      43*2   „
             Artesian wells                             50'0   „
   The mean of the three thus gives a general thermometric gradient
of 47-5 feet per degree.
   I do not, however, by any means consider this more than an ap
proximation to the true normal gradient. In Coal Mines the effects of
ventilation, and in other Mines the effects of chemical action and the
circulation of water, have yet to be more accurately determined ; while
in the case of Artesian Wells, I believe the gradient of 49-5 feet may
be too low in consequence of the unequal velocity of the water in deep
overflowing wells, and of the uncertain measure of convection currents
in those which do not overflow.
   Admitting, however, these determinations to be approximately
correct, they show that different geological areas have, in all pro
bability, different gradients, and indicate possible inequalities in the
underground isothermals, unless the altered conditions which come
into play at greater depths tend to reduce and level them.
   There is reason also to believe that the conductivity of the rocks at
great depths may be affected by their hydrometric state and tempera
ture. The descent of the surface water may ultimately be retarded or
stayed by friction and heat.          Faults, although they may stay its
descent, leave untouched the water originally inclosed or imbibed.
M. Delesse, who made some calculations on the probable depth to
which water descends, concluded that water might circulate to the
depth of about 8 miles before this limit was reached.
   Further the experiments of Regnault determined the expansive force
of the vapour of water up to a temperature of 239° C, the pressure then
being equal to 27£ atmospheres.        Beyond this, it has only been carried
by empirical   formulas,  but  both   experiment  and calculation indicate
that, with the increase of temperature, the increase of force is extremely
rapid, and there is in all probability a point at which the vapour-
tension of the heated water will equilibrate the hydrostatic pres
sure.
   With respect    to  the   possibility of change in the thermometric
gradient at depths,     it is known that the conductivity of wrought
iron diminishes as the temperature increases, and at a rate agreeing
very closely with the empirical law that the conducting power of
iron for heat is inversely as the absolute temperature.             What the
variatiou in rocks may be has yet to be determined                    experi

                            On Underground Temperatures.                                55
mentally ;* we may presume it to exist, although it may differ
materially in degree.
     Therefore, taking into consideration the probable limitation of the
percolation of water, and the possible diminution of conductivity with
increase of depth, if there should be any alteration in the thermo-
metric gradient, at great depths, it will be more likely to be in the
direction influenced by these more or less certain factors, or in favour
of a decreased conductivity and a more rapid thermometric gradient,
rather than otherwise.
     I   have made a few attempts to ascertain, with the data in our
 possession, whether there exists any indication of such variation within
 the limits of the depths reached, by comparing the gradients of the
 upper with the lower portions of the mines, but without arriving
 at any satisfactory result.f           It is true that in the Coal Mines, taking
 a depth below 1000 feet, the gradient, in all cases except two, shows,
 with increased depth, an increased rapidity, but it is a question
 whether this is not due to ventilation and convection currents causing
  too low a reading of the gradients in the upper part of the mines,
  and so throwing an apparent gain into the gradients in tho deeper
  parts of the mines.
      In the Mines other than Coal, some show at great depths a more
  rapid, and others a slower gradient, but it has to be observed that
  generally there is greater steadiness in the gradients at depths beneath
  500 or 600 feet, than in those which are shallower.
       In Artesian Wells and bore-holes, on the contrary, the gradient is
   often more rapid in the upper than in the lower section of the wells,
   but this is clearly due to the action of convection currents ; while the
   decrease in the diameter of the bore-hole with the increase of depth,
   by unequally checking the flow of water, differently affects the tem
   perature of the water in the tubes as successive depths are reached.
       Looking, however, only at the more certain and determined causes
   which have interfered with the value of even the best observations,
   I believe that the effect of them has been to make the readings for
   the Artesian Wells and bore-holes especially, as well as the Mines, too
   low ; and it may be a question whether a general average gradient of
   45 feet per degree would not be nearer the true normal than the one
   of   47| feet obtained by the foregoing investigation.

        * In Cornwall a mean surface temperature of 50°, 51°, 52°, or even 53° F. was
     adopted in the early underground observations, and thermometric gradientr were
     calculated on those several different scales.        The more recent observations of mean
     annual temperature, which     I   have received from the Meteorological Office, give for
     Penzance 51'8°, Truro 52°, Falmouth 514°, while Plymouth is 51 3°, and the high
     ground of Dartmoor 45'8°.        Taking the height of the mining districts to vary from
     100 to 800 feet, we may take the mean annual temperature of those districts
     " in block " at 51°. Mr. B. Were Fox placed thermometers 3 feet underground,
     at a height of 300 feet above the sea-level, near Dolcoath Mine, which gave a mean
     annual temperature of 49'94° F. ; at 300 feet near Gooland Mine, which gave
     48 99° ; and at 120 feet at Falmouth, where it recorded 50'67°.              His opinion wa»

§ 1.    In'roductory Observations — Current Hypotheses — The Vapour of
          Water considered as the Primary Cause of Volcanic Action.
    The important part played by water in volcanic eruptions is a well
recognised and established fact, but there is great difference of opinion
among geologists as to whether water should be considered                            the
primary or secondary agent, and as to the mode, time, and place of its
intervention.         The prevailing opinion in this country is that water is
the primary cause of volcanic activity.                  Whichever view may be
adopted,      the   subject   is one  which    is  so  largely concerned with the
laws regulating the underground circulation of water, that the con
sideration of the two questions must proceed pari passn.                      We shall
therefore have to consider somewhat               fully the hydro-geological ques
tions    relating to the circulation and penetration of water, and in con
nexion with this the contested question of the probable thickness of
the earth's crust from the geological standpoint. The objections to the
chemical theory of Davy, according to which, water finds its way to
the interior of the earth, and there, meeting with the metals of the
earths and      alkalies, is decomposed with the evolution of intense heat,
steam, and gases, have been so often stated, that it is not necessary
here to refer to them further than to remark that the objections I shall
have to urge generally against the percolation                   or passage of water
to extreme depths will apply equally to this hypothesis                 also.
    The theory of volcanic action which has of late years been most
   * The
            general  views expressed   in this paper were    laid before the Geological
Section of the    British Association at the York Meeting      in 1881.   See Report   of
Section C, p. 610.

 generally accepted is that of Mr. Poulett-Scrope. As formulated by him
 in the successive editions of his standard work on " Volcanos,"* " the
 main agent in all these stupendous phenomena — the power that breaks
 up the solid strata of the earth's surface, raises, through one of the
 fissures thus occasioned, a ponderous column of liquid mineral matter to
the snmmit of a lofty mountain, and launches thence into the air, some
 thousand feet higher, with repeated explosions, jets of this matter and
fragments of the rocks that obstruct its efforts — consists unquestionably
 in the expansive force of some elastic aeriform fluid struggling to escape
from the interior of a subterranean body of lava, i.e., of mineral matter
in a state either of fusion, or at least of liquefaction at an intense
temperature.     This body of lava is evidently, at such times, in igneous
ebullition."^    He further explains that the rise of lava in a volcanic
vent is occasioned " by the expansion of volumes of high pressure
steam generated in the interior of a mass of liquefied and heated
mineral matter within or beneath the eruptive orifice," so that the
vapour reaches the external " surface in a state of extreme condensa
tion and entangled in the liquid lava which rises with and escapes
outwardly, just as any other thick or viscid matter exposed to heat
from beneath in a narrow-mouthed vessel boils up and over the lips of
that aperture."
    I might have felt some doubt as to the exact meaning of this
passage, especially as the author proceeds to remark, that
                                                                  " at what
depth those volumes of vapour are generated may be a question," but
as he goes on to observe,
                               " that the tendency to vaporisation must
                                             "
everywhere occasion an extreme tension         or expansive force through
out the mass, " only restrained by the enormons weight and cohesion
of the superincumbent rocks,"            I
                                     infer from this and from the general
tenour of bis remarks that the steam being the original motive power,
exists in and at the base of the molten magma.            He says, " If any
doubt should suggest itself whether this fluid is actually generated
within the lava, or only rises through                 it,
                                                having its origin in some
other substance, or in some other manner beneath,              must be disit
pelled by the evidence afforded in the extremely vesicnlar or cellular
structure of very many erupted lavas, not merely near the surface,
but throughout their mass, showing that the aeriform fluid in these
cases certainly developed itself interstitially     in every part.     And
although such vesicles or cells appear at first sight to be wanting in
other lavas, at least in the lower portions of the lava-current after its
consolidation, the microscope invariably, or almost invariably, discovers
them.     In those exceptional cases, where the rock         to appearance
                                                                        is
perfectly compact,   it    allowable to suppose that the vapour

     It
     must also be borne in mind that for this hypothesis to have any
value, the explosive material must extend throughout the mass of lava
and act from its base upwards, just as much as it is necessary that the
powder in the breech of the gun should be at the back of the shot.
It   should therefore extend to the volcanic foci, at whatever depth
that might be, and be there occluded in the lava.
   Professor Judd, in his excellent summary of Mr. Scrope's views,
remarks that on this hypothesis volcanic outbursts are considered to
    " due to the accumulation of steam at
be                                           volcanic centres, and that
the tension of this imprisoned gas eventually overcomes the repressing
forces which tend to its manifestation," and that *' in the expansive
force of great masses of imprisoned vapour, we have a competent
cause for the production of fissures through which volcanic outbursts
take  place."f
    Mr. Scrope does not enter npon the question of the mode in which
the water has become occluded in the fluid magma.       Sir Charles Lyell,
however, in supporting the views of Mr. Scrope, says,
                                                              " We may
suppose that large subterranean cavities exist at the depth of some
miles below the surface of the earth in which melted lava accumu
lates, and when water containing the usual mixture of air penetrates
into these, the steam thus generated may press upon the lava and
force it up the duct of a volcano, in the same manner as a column of
water is driven up the pipe of a geyser."J
    Briefly the opinion of Mr. Scrope upon the cause of volcanic action
 is that it is to be attributed to the escape of high pressure steam
 generated in the interior of the earth.    Before proceeding to discuss
 this hypothesis more fully, and to state my objections to the views of
 this distinguished volcanologist, I must refer to the remarkable paper
 of the late Mr. R. Mallet, in which the same subject is treated from
 an entirely different point of view.
    According to Mr. Mallet, volcanic energy, as we see it on the globe,
 is not the direct product of primordial heat of fusion, although it is
 evidently due to the loss of that heat, and is the result of the cooling
 of our globe.     He defines it thus : " The heat from which terrestrial
 volcanic energy is at present derived is produced locally within the
 solid shell of our globe by transformation of the mechanical work of
 compression or of crushing of portions of that shell, which com
 pressions and crushings are themselves produced by the more rapid
 contraction, by cooling, of the hotter material of the nucleus beneath
 that shell, and the consequent more or less free descent of the shell by
               * Op. dt., pp. 36-7.

gravitation, the vertical work of which is resolved             into tangential
pressures and motion within the thickness of the shell."*
   The crushing of the earth's solid crust along lines of greatest weak
ness, is in this manner considered           by Mr. Mallet to evolve heat suffi
cient to fuse portions of the crust aud to cause the extrus^m of the fused
masses.    He says, " The result of the crushing is^o produce irregular
masses, on the whole tending to verticality, of pulverised rock, heated
more or less highly, that may extend to any depth within the solid
crust; but it is only to such depths as water can percolate 'or infiltrate
by capillarity that the deepest focus of volcanic activity can be found."
   Geologists find many objections to Mt. Mallet's ingenious hypo
thesis.   Amongst the most serious, and it seems to me fatal objections,
are — (1) that it fails to explain the centralisation of the heat, for
even if fully developed by sudden and paroxysmal movements* it
would, unless confined to a very narrow line, which is not probable,,
be dispersed and dissipated throughout the whole mass affected by
the pressure ; (2) that there is an absence of volcanoes in the majority
of mountain ranges where the pressure and crushing have been of the
most powerful character; (3) while, on the contrary, in many volcanic
areas there is little or no evidence of great lateral pressure, or of
much disturbance of the strata beyond faulting.
   The great mountain ranges of the Alps and Pyrenees, where the
strata are tilted, contorted, and enormously crushed, do not contain a
single volcano ; the strata are highly metamorphosed, yet show no
traces of igneous fusion.         In the Andes, the volcanoes are mostly
situated on flanking ridges, or on the lower grounds at their base, and
rarely on the high central ridges.             Volcanoes, in fact, are as often,
or more often, on lines of fault than on anticlinal ridges. But lines of
fault, even those of the greatest magnitude, show no fused walls,
though the formation of slickenside surfaces must, seeing the great
friction, have been attended with considerable heat.
   I however entirely agree with Mr. Mallet in two of his proposi
tions, namely, that volcanic action
force which has always been in action
was nebulous ;" and in one sense
                                                     ....

  § 2. Objections to Steam as the       Primary Cause of Volcanic Eruptions.
   The chief objections to the hypothesis that the vapour of water is
the primary agent in volcanic action, are —
   1.  The difficulties in the way of accounting for the presence of water
        in the deep-seated volcanic foci.

                On the Agency     of Water in Volcanic Eruptions.                 121
    2.   The insufficiency of the elevatory force.
    3.   The want of agreement in time and proportion              between    the dis
           charge of steam and the discharge of lava.
    On the       hypothesis   of Mr. Ponlett-Scrope it has to be assumed
either that the                           part of the original molten magma,
                       ^ater^formed
or that        the surface-waters find a passage by percolation or by
fissures through the crust of the earth to the molten mass beneath.
That water does penetrate to great depths, there can be no doubt, and
if nothing interfered to check its descent, the extent and range of the
percolation could hardly be limited.                  But various stratigraphical
causes interfere with this transmission,           such as the thinning out of the
strata, faults, and uncomformity of superposition.                      These causes
especially impede the flow of water in thp more frequently disturbed
Palaeozoic strata, but in the less disturbed newer strata it is compara
tively little aSected by them-.            At the greatest depths in Tertiary
and Secondary strata water is always, or almost always, met with in
the permeable beds.             It is otherwise with the Palaeozoic strata
generally ;. where, for example,, as is so common in Coal Mines, the
faulting of the measures divides them into separate segments or com
partments, in each of which the supply of water from adjacent areas
is cut off, and no fresh supplies, being received from the surface, there
in no further accession of water.           Again, where Tertiary or Secondary
 strata overlie uncomformably Palseozoic strata, the interstices on the
surface of the older rocks are so effectually plugged by the basement
 bed of the superimposed strata, that they are often rendered perfectly
 watertight.        There is a remarkable instance of this in the coal-field
 of Mons,* where the Coal-measures are in places worked under a depth
 of 600 to 900 feet of loose sandy Cretaceous strata full of water, and
 yet are found to be perfectly dry, owing to the circumstance that the
 basement bed of the overlying strata has formed a sort of puddle
 cover, sealing up, as it were, the edges of the underlying strata.
 The percolation of the surface-water to great depths is, in consequence
 of these interruptions, far from being so general as might be supposed.
     Admitting, however, the possibility of water descending in certain
  cases,— as     through the fissures and crevices of crystalline rocks, or, in
  the absence of any mechanical conditions to stop its descent, through
  permeable strata, — it is a question whether its descent would not be
  stayed by the increase of heat at great depths, although under the
  enormous pressure it may remain liquid at high temperatures.
      It is known experimentally that the pressure of steam which at
  212°    F. equals one atmosphere, is, at a temperature of 432° F., equal to
  that of nearly 24 atmospheres ; and also that the rate increases with
   the rise of temperature,      and faster at high than at low temperatures,
   as  the following reduction from Begnault's tables shows : —

   Thus, while an increase of 50° F. to the temperatnre of water vapour
at 212° causes an increase of pressure of only 1^ atmospheres, the
addition of another 50° gives an additional pressure of nearly 3 atmo
spheres ; of another 50° gives 5 atmospheres ; while 50° more gives a
further increase of 8| atmospheres.
   This rate of increase of pressure is nearly proportionate to the 5th
power of the excess of temperature above —40° F. Pouillet em
ployed empirical formula? to ascertain the probable pressure at higher
temperatures      up to 51b° C. These, although not mathematically
exact, are sufficiently so for our purpose — at all events up to the tem
perature of 773° F., the critical point of water, at which new condi
tions would be involved.

     If  there are      experimental errors, as      I  consider not improbable,
Bach as would reduce the gradient to 45 feet per degree, the tem
 perature at the depth of 150,000 feet would be 3383°, unless the
 increase of heat modifies the conductivity of the rocks at depths.                   Or
 if in centres of crystalline rocks and slates, as in Cornwall, and with
 a gradient of 40 feet, a temperature             of 3000° might be reached at a
depth of 120,000 feet or about 23 miles.
    * M. Delesse,    in his paper on the water in the interior of the Earth, considered
that   notwithstanding that water tends to pass into vapour at the high temperature
of great depths, the pressure of the overlying strata and the resistance they offer
to its return being greater than its tension, would cause it to retain its liquid state.
But at a depth which he estimates at about 60,000 feet, and at a temperature of
about 1100° F., the overlying pressure (taken at the rock weight), and the elastic
force of  the vapour of water would be in equilibrium.     " Bull. Soc. Geol. de France,"
2nd   Ser., vol. xii (1861), p. 64.

   Besides these, there are other considerations which should not be
overlooked,     although it is impossible at present to assign a value to
them.     Still they may be placed to a suspense account.            The first is
whether there may not be areas of certain rocks in which the gradient
is more rapid than in other areas ; and whether in tropical regions
there is not generally a more rapid thermometric gradient. In the
paper on Underground              Temperatures, a few of the observations
raise these questions, as questions for further inquiry.
   The second point, which I have already mooted,* is more purely
hypothetical. It is whether the effect of the excessive cold of the
glacial period — or cold prolonged during so many thousands of years
— may not possibly have left its mark on that portion of the earth
covered for so long a period by perpetual snow and ice, — whether the
loss of heat in the upper layers of the crust may not only have altered
the thermometric gradient, but also induced, as it were,, prematnre
contraction by an excessive abstraction of heat during that period.
 Whether also that outer portion of the crust so affected might not
 now present a slower gradient than the present mean surface tem
 perature would warrant, while at greater depths a normal more rapid
 gradient may still prevail. And whether or not this might possibly be
 an element in the present effective rigidity of the crust ?
    Taking therefore into consideration all the conditions to which
 water becomes subject with increasing depth and the rapid increase
 of temperature, together with the circumstance that while the pres
 sure of water increases with depth in simple arithmetical progression,
 that of the elastic vapour of water is one of a very rapid geometrical
 progression, it becomes extremely improbable that water can penetrate
 beyond a certain depth beneath the surface.             Roughly, it is a ques
 tion whether 7 to 8 miles would not be a limit. At all events I feel it
 impossible to accept any hypothesis based upon an assumed percola
 tion to unlimited depths, and am forced to look to other causes in
 explanation of the presence of water in volcanic eruptions.
    It is true that the experiments of Daubree, which will be further
 alluded to, show that owing to the force of capillarity, water can
 pass through porous strata against a considerable resisting pressure,
 but on the other hand Wolff's experiments show that the effects of
 capillarity decrease with the increase of temperature, and tend to
 prove that there is a point at which they would altogether cease.

elements,  and in so dissociating it augments its volume by one half,
and  its pressure in proportion.* That water is decomposed in contact
with lava during eruptions, is rendered probable by the observations
of M. Fonque daring the last great eruption of Santorin, for ho
found that the gases given off under water during the eruption, and
collected as they ascended through the sea, often contained as much
as 30 per cent, of free hydrogen,   and from the circumstance that he
also found free oxygen occasionally present, he considered       it likely
that the vapour of water exists in a state of dissociation in the lava
during eruptions.t
   Other geologists have contended for the possibility of water gaining
access to the volcanic foci by fissures opening into the sea-bed.                                 J
These fissures are supposed to be formed by the molten             matter
struggling to escape. To this it has been rightly objected, that in
such a case the lava wonld at once fill the fissure to the exclusion of
the water.      By others it has been suggested that the fissures are
caused by    the escape of imprisoned elastic vapours ; but as Mr. Scrope
remarks, this is reasoning in a circle, for while it supposes the
aqueous vapour to be the cause of the disturbance, it yet proposes to
introduce the water after the effects attributed to it had been pro
duced.
   The second objection               is,
                              that supposing     were possible for water

to penetrate    to the molten magma and to be converted into high
pressure   steam,  would     be possible for

an erroneous estimate of the elastic force of steam.
    Would not also, on the fissure hypothesis, the pent up elastic
vapours, which are supposed to force the lava up the volcanic duct,
 necessarily take the line of least resistance, drive back the column of
 water in the fissure and escape with                it ?
    But the objection to which    attach most weight and importance
                                            I                                                     is
 one which deals with facts which are within the scope of actual
 observation.    On the hypothesis that attributes the extrusion of lava
    " the
 to       expansive force of some elastic aeriform fluid, struggling to
 escape from the interior of a subterranean body of lava,"         would                  it
 follow that no lava could escape without the accompaniment        of the
 propelling aeriform fluid, nor could any large evolution of vapour

discharge of steam and lava could not            fail to bear some proportion one
to the other.
   Although the phenomena accompanying volcanic eruptions are so
constantly recorded, those which bear in particular on this question
are generally so mixed up with the other details, that it is not
always possible to determine their relative bearing and sequence.
There are, however, an ample number of cases to show that the dis
charge of lava is not in proportion to the discharge of steam, nor is
the discharge of steam always in accordance with the escape of
lava, which they should be if the hypothesis were correct. These con
ditions would seem on the contrary to be perfectly independent one of
the other.    It is of course conceivable that lava of an extreme fluidity
and offering less resistance to the escape of the elastic vapours, might
be ejected in lesser quantity than a more viscid lava, which presented
more resistance,     or that paroxysmal explosions may disperse the lava
in aerial discharges, and reduce the importance of the quieter outflow ;
but these occasional occurrences would not affect the more general
results.   There are too many great eruptions that have been attended
with a small discharge of lava, and too many of the largest lava
streams have been erupted quietly and with a very small exhibition of
explosive violence, to allow of much doubt on the subject. Sometimes,
when the discharge of lava has been at its maximum, the explosive
violence has been at its minimum, and, on the other hand, violent
detonations have been attended with small overflows of lava.
   According to Daubeny,* there is no recorded lava-flow accompanying
the eruptions of Vesuvius prior to the eruption of a.d. 1036.                  This,
however, may be the mere absence of record.                 Still, it would seem to
point  to the   prevalence     of paroxysmal eruptions like that of the great
eruption of    79 B.C.
   Mr. Scrope divides volcanic outbreaks               into  periods of moderate
activity and of paroxysmal violence,f and he himself remarks that
" the volume of lava poured out by an eruption does not preserve any
constant proportion to the force or continuance of its explosions."
He instances EtnaJ as an example of almost continual moderate
activity with occasionally more or less paroxysmal outbursts. The
volcano of the Island of Bourbon offers another example of the same
kind. He further points out§ that " in all cases where lava is emitted
its protrusion marks the crisis of the eruption, which usually attains
the maximum of its violence a day or two after its commencement.
The stoppage of the lava in the same manner indicates the termina
tion of the crisis, but not of the eruption, for the gaseous explosions

continue often for some time with immense and scarcely' diminished
energy."          Vesuvius " has often continued in eruption for periods of
several months, discharging moderate jets of scoriae, lapilli, and sand,
from temporary orifices at the summit or flank of the cone, or at the
bottom of its crater, when there was a crater ; while streams of lava
welled out, sometimes almost                with  the  tranquillity of a water-spring
from the same or from contiguous openings."*
    Professor Palmierif says of Vesuvius, that on some occasions the
eruptions commence with explosious and detonations of greater or
lesser violence, ending with a great eruption and a copious flow of
lava ; and that at other times great eruptions have taken place with
out     any precursory signs.
    Professor Phillips observes of the great eruption of Vesuvius of
1794, which was characterised by the flow of some of the largest lava
currents ever erupted from this mountain, that " for nearly a month
after the eruption (of lava), vast quantities of fine white ashes mixed
 with volumes of steam were thrown out from the crater."J
     H. Ch. St. Claire Deville§ states that the great eruption of Vesu
 vius in 1855 was one of the most tranquil.                The projections only lasted
 a few days, and the detonations soon ceased.                    The lava continued to
 flow for twenty-eight days, and formed the largest current which has
 passed out in the north-west direction. ||               This eruption was in great
 contrast with that of 1850, which was one of the most violent and par
 oxysmal, when the mountain was changed in form, the central cone
 reduced, and the crater enlarged to 2 miles in circumference, yet the
flow of lava teas comparatively small.
     The eruption of Etna of 1852 was one of unusual magnitude, and
 the flow of lava greater than ever witnessed, except, probably in 1669.
  It commenced in August with violent explosions and ejection of
  scoria.      The lava then began to flow from several openings, and
  flooded the country for a length of 6 miles and a breadth, in places,
  of 2 miles.        The ejections of scorise continued during sixteen days,
  but after that time they almost ceased, except in a few smaller craters,
  though dense volumes of steam were occasionally discharged from the
  central crater, but the flow of lava continued with little interruption
  through September, October, November, and December,                         and did not
  entirely    cease   until  May,    1853. 1[

independence of the causes leading to the outflow of lava, and those
generating the elastic vapours, is that of Santorin in 18G6, recorded
by M. Fouque.*           In the centre of the bay formed by the great
encircling old crater-walls of the islands of Thera and Asprosini,
stands the small island of Kaimeni, the product of later eruptions. On
the 26th January, 1866, the loose blocks on the southern slope of this
island began to move — on the 27th slight shocks were felt, gases
evolved, and fissures rent in adjacent buildings.                 The ground in a
small sandy bay was observed to rise, and by the 4th February the
erupted mass consisting of blocks of lava, had attained a height of
 32 feet.    By the 5th, this protuberant mass of lava had increased to
 230 feet in length by 98 feet in width, and 65 feet in height, and on
 the 7th to 492' X 197' X 98'.           The adjacent water was hot and the
 surface of the lava was consolidated, though it was incandescent at
 night. Until the 12th February there were no detonations and no
 explosion, notwithstanding the large quantity of lava emitted, for it
 was not confined to the matter above water, but it was, in places,
 gradually filling up the bay itself ; and where there previously had
 been soundings of 1G3 fathoms, the depth was now reduced to from
 40 to 70 fathonis.f
    M. Fouque remarks.J that " at the beginning of the eruption the
 discharge    of lava was the most salient phenomenon ; the rock-emission
 proceeded   in silence ; it was only at the end of several days that the
 explosions    and ejections commenced          and a crater formed (the volcano
 of Giorgios)." The explosions attained great violence tin the 20th and
 22nd, and on the latter day the column of vapour and ashes rose to a
 height of about 7000 feet. In April and May lava flowed more freely.
 The eruption was prolonged to 1869, when the explosions were still
frequent but the discharge of lava very small.
     Another eruption commenced in February 1867, in the sea-bed west
 of Kaimeni, and by the 17th an island (Aphroessa) was formed
  328 feet long by 196 feet wide and 32 feet high ; while the adjacent
  sea-bed was in places reduced from a depth of 296 fathoms to
  108 fathoms.      This also was effected quietly and without noise, and       it
 was not    until later that the explosions began.
     So noiseless and     so  steadily continuous was the protrusion of these
 masses of lava at first, that        Dr. Cigalli, who watched them from day
 to day, compared their growth to the steady and uninterrupted growth
  of a soap bubble.
     Much of the lava of this great eruption was very compact, and not
  at all scoriaceous.§

     But probably the eruption most remarkable for its magnitude, and
 at the same      time for its quiet, was that of Mauna Loa in 1855. In
 speaking of this eruption Dana says that there wag no earthquake, no
 internal thunderings, no premonitions at the base of the mountain.                A
 small glowing point was seen at a height of 12,000 feet, which
 gradually expanded, throwing off coruscations of light. A vent or
fissure then formed, from which a vast body of liquid lava rapidly but
quietly flowed during several weeks (a later account says 10 months),
forming a'stream of lava which extended a distance of 65 miles, with
a breadth of from 3 to 10 miles.             He adds that those eruptions of
fiery cinders which mark so strikingly Vesuvius, are almost wanting
about the craters and eruptions of Mauna Loa, and the few that there
are, are mainly in connexion with the lateral cones.
     On the other hand, Mr. Scrope remarks that the great paroxysmal
eruptions of volcanoes are preceded by earthquakes                   more or less
violent, frequent, and prolonged, "and begin generally with one
tremendous burst, which appears to shake the mountain from its
foundations.         Explosions of aeriform fluids, each producing a low
detonation and gradually increasing in violence, succeed one another
with great rapidity from the orifice of eruption, which is in most
instances the central vent or crater of the mountain."                    As a con-
sequence of such eruptions, the cone is frequently found truncated,
"
   the upper part having been blown off, and in its place a vast chasm
formed, of a caldron-like appearance, and of a size proportioned to
the violence of the eruption and its duration.*
    One of the most violent of the explosive eruptions was that of
the Cosequina in 1835.        f    This volcano is situated on a promontory
south of the Bay of Formosa in Central America.                   The detonations
were so violent that they were heard at a distance of 280 miles.                  So
enormous was the quantity of ashes and scoriae shot out of the crater,
that for a distance of 25 miles they covered the ground to a depth of
about 15 feet, and the finer dust was carried by the wind as far as
Jamaica, a distance of 800 miles.           It is not recorded that this great
outbreak was accompanied by any lava-flow.            J    The mountain itself is
only 480 feet above the sea-level.
    From time to time the violence of other paroxysmal eruptions has
blown off and truncated the cone of the volcanoes, and enlarged the
craters,   from the small dimensions they have when the eruption issues
at the finished apex, to gulfs sometimes several miles in circumference
and of great depth, eviscerating, as it were, the very centre of the

mountain.      Scrope* mentions as examples of such paroxysmal erup
tions,   — 13 eruptions of "Vesuvius,  8 of Etna, 2 of Teneriffe, 1 of San.
Georgis in the Azores, 3 of Palma, and 1 of Lancerote (Canary
Islands), and all the recorded eruptions of Iceland.
    " Sometimes in these
                            eruptions no absolute escape of lava takes
place,  scorire alone being projected.    In all cases when lava is emitted
its protrusion marks the crisis of the eruption, which usually attains a
maximum of its violence a day or two after its commencement.            The
stopping of the lava in the same manner indicates the termination of
 the crisis, but not of the eruption, for the gaseous explosions continue
 often for some time with immense and scarcely diminished energy."f
   It    seems to me therefore evident from these and such other cases,
that there is no definite relation between the quantity of explosive
gases and vapours and the quantity of lava discharged from the
volcanic foci. It is conceivable that the enormous force of some of
the explosions may, in the paroxysmal outbursts, shatter and blow to
fragments all the lava as it rises in the crater, but this seems hardly
sufficient to account for the proportionally large quantity which
should accompany such vast volumes of vapours, were those vapours
the cause of the extrusion of the lava.       It is still more difficult to
conceive on this hypothesis the excessive discharge of lava in tranquil
eruptions without a greater escape of vapour.
   If the escape of lava depended altogether on the escape of the im
prisoned vapours, it is not easy to see how the constant supply, whether
of the lava or of the steam, is maintained. The rise and escape out
wardly of the lava in a volcanic vent has been likened to the boiling up
and over of any other thick and viscid matter exposed to heat from

beneath in a narrow-mouthed vessel, and Constant Prevost compared
it to the overflow caused during fermentation by the evolution of car
bonic acid gas. But the cases are not analogons.           In the one the
aeriform fluid is part of the substance of the vaporisable matter, which
is not the case with the lava where the substance causing ejection is
foreign to it. In the first case the elastic fluids are generated by a
molecular change of the heated substance itself, and the supply is
 therefore, so long as that lasts, unlimited; whereas in the case of lava,
 which cannot undergo such changes, it is only the supposed occluded
 vapour in          it,
                 that, with the relief of pressure would be subject to
 expand and escape, and thereby displace and expel a proportionate
 quantity of the lava.     Besides, could that result take place before
 the lava began to rise     If not, there must be an independent cause
                                   ?

the lava   in the duct would not on the contrary increase the pressure
in the volcanic foci in which the occluded vapour is present?
    We have already pointed ont the difficulty of accounting for the
introduction of water into the volcanic foci. Even supposing it to be
introduced and to cause a boiling over, that ebullition would go on
so long as any of the imprisoned vapour remained               in the lava;
but when the expulsion of one or the other was effected, then the
introduction of fresh materials from the outside, as in the case
of the water in the Geyser pipes, would become necessary, or the
boiling over of the lava would cease for want of supplies.             If the
water were present in combination with the lava in the volcanic foci,
there is no reason why the passage to the exterior once formed, the
eruption should cease until all the mass susceptible of boiling over
should be expelled, in which case each eruption would be of longer or
shorter duration, and a volcano would become extinct after one
eruption.     If, on the other hand, the expulsion were due to the access
of water from the exterior, whether by fissures or by permeation, it is
difficult to imagine such an influx of water without the previous
action of some disturbing cause whereby the existing equilibrium
under which the descent of the water is stayed, would be destroyed.
    The only logical hypothesis on which I can conceive the vapour of
water of gases to be present in the fluid magma of the volcano is the
one snggested by Dr. Sterry Hunt, who considers that the magma is
not part of the original molten anhydrous nucleus of the earth, but an
 intermediate layer derived from the first outer crust of old surface
rocks which had been exposed to meteorological agencies, and retained,
when fused under pressure, the water with which they had become
permeated when on the surface.        He supposes the original nucleus to
have gradually become solid by pressure and loss of heat, and an
outer crust to have formed.           As that crust became thicker and
covered by sedimentary strata accumulated upon                 it,
                                                          its under surface,
owing     to  the  rise  of the isothermal   bars, was gradually remelted,
forming an intermediate fluid layer between the solid nucleus and the
 solid outer crust.
    Or else that of Mr. Fisher, who, from investigations in which he com
 pares the existing inequalities of the earth's surface with such as could
 possibly have arisen from secular cooling, concluded that the interior
of   the earth had shrunk more than mere cooling alone would account
 for, and snggested that this was due to the presence of superheated
 water in large quantities in the original nucleus, and that the blowing
 off of this water during volcanic eruptions might have contributed
 materially to the diminution of the volume of the magma.*         In sub-           a
  sequent workf   Mr.  Fisher has applied this hypothesis  more  particularly

to the explanation of volcanic action. He supposes a solid crust of about
25 miles thick resting on a fluid substratum of highly heated rocky
matter in a state of igneo-aqueous fusion, and shows that if a crack were
produced by any cause in the under surface of the crust it would become
filled with the water substance or vapour given off from the fluid
magma at a high tension.         Whenever the rent, commencing below,
opens upwards, vaponr at a high tension will escape, and after a certain
time will be followed by the magma itself, which will overflow at the
surface because the water-substance        expanding, owing to the dimi
nished pressure, will render the whole column of less weight than
an equal column of the crust.         On this view he considers that any
disruption in the crust which is sufficient to permit the passage of
steam at an enormous pressure, would originate a volcano ; and " much
of the lava poured out might consist of the materials of the crust itself,
fused by the passage of the gases through it, and so vary in its compo
sition at different vents, and even at the same vent at different times."
                                                 I
    I need not dwell on the other objections feel to these hypotheses
because the special one before-named applies equally to this, — namely,
that, if they were true, all rocks formed under such conditions should
exhibit evidence of the presence or of the escape of vapour. All
volcanic matter should be more or less scoriaceous, whereas there are
many lavas which are little, and others not at all scoriaceous ; while
the great sheets of basaltic rocks which have welled out from fissures
at former geological periods, are likewise neither scoriaceous, except
very superficially if at all, nor are they accompanied as a rule by debris
indicating explosions and projections due to the presence of vaponr
and gases. Why also should not all rocks of igneous origin, as well as
volcanic rocks proper, be scoriaceous, if such were the conditions of
the molten magma beneath the solid crust ? The general want of
hydration in volcanic rocks and their associated minerals is likewise
incompatible with such conditions.
    It has been contended by some writers that large subterranean
 cavities may exist at depths in the earth's crust, and that the vapour
of water under high pressure may be stored up in such underground
 cavities.  But the pressure of the strata is so great at depths, that, as
in deep coal pits, where no permanent cavities can be formed, owing
to the " creeping
                    " and
                           falling in of the strata, it would be impossible
for such cavities to exist in Sedimentary Strata, while in Igneous
rocks the initial plasticity of the rock and pressure would effect the
same object.      Even if such cavities did exist, they could only be
maintained by the action of an elastic fluid, whose pressure would
exceed that of the superincumbent strata.           Geology affords no evi
dence of such underground reservoirs, or of any having existed in
former times.     No great explosions of pent up steam show themselves
during the disturbances, shocks and rents accompanying earthquake

               On the Agency      of Water in Volcanic Eruptions.                133
movements,        and no persistent issue of steam gives countenance to
the   supposition that the water permeates the rocks to great depths or
exists there in natural cavities.
    Natural cavities at depths in the earth's crust I hold to be impos
sible.     There may be cavities in the Igneous rocks near the surface,
due either to contraction, to rapid cooling without pressure, or to the
shell left by the escaping lava streams.            But these cannot take place
at great depths.        They are connected with subaerial action.
    With regard to such cavities as those so common and of such
extent in limestone rocks, it must be remembered that these cavities are
entirely due to the descent of the surface waters to a definite level,
and to their escape by the most readily available outlet, either in adja
cent valleys, or at or near the tide line on the adjacent coast.              Below
that level there can be no active circulation of water, and no possi
bility, therefore,      of great cavities, due to the passage of water
through underground channels, being formed.                     Changes of level
may have carried some of these superficial cavities to certain depths
beneath the surface, but that they should have been carried to the
great depths we are referring to, or be of any sufficient size, is more
than problematical.          In limestone strata they occur near the surface,
or at a short distance beneath the surface ; wherever these rocks have
been worked at a depth beneath the line of water saturation,                    such
cavities are of very rare occurrence.            Deep mines reveal occasionally
a few fissures,       and some comparatively small cavities, but these
are in mineral veins, which show no relation with active volcanic
phenomena.
      § 3.  Influence of Volcanic Eruptions on Spring and Well Waters.
    It  is a singular circumstance that although the presence of water in
 volcanic eruptions has been so long recognised, and the disturbances
 caused to    wells and springs have been        so often noticed, no systematic
 series of observations        has been made either on the surface or on the
 underground waters         in  connexion therewith.        There are many allu
 sions and incidental notices, but nothing in the form of special and
 exact details.      Most writers on the subject speak of the disturbances
 to wells and springs as a common or obvious fact ; but a series of
 extended and accurate observations is much needed.*                 In the absence
 of more exact data, we have to avail ourselves of general observations
 made by witnesses on the spot, amongst whom are many competent
 authorities.
     The great eruption of Vesuvius of 1813-14, which commenced with
 a  few trifling explosions and shocks in September, and by a small
 eruption of lava in October and November, followed by the great
    •  The observations should not be limited to the volcanic area, but should extend
  to the  sedimentary strata around, and to some distance from the centre of eruption.

eruption of December, was witnessed by M. Menard de la Groye,* wbo
remarks that "towards the end of May the well-waters of Torre del
Greco and Torre dell'Annunziata failed, and that this was an ordinary
precursory symptom of the eruptions." In June the waters continued
farther to lower, and " in the first fortnight in July they fell so low
as to alarm the population," while "in October the wells of Resina,
Torre del Greco, and other places failed in a surprising manner."
   Professor Phillips briefly recordsf the following instances : — " July,
1804.    Severe earthquake — diminution of springs."                     In May, 1812,
the wells failed or were much lowered at Torre del Greco and Resina,
as well as a thermal spring.              In June, July, and August, heavy rains
occurred     ;   yet this did not restore the water in the wells, which still
remained low, and even lower than before in September, and this
scarcity was felt along the whole Vesuvian coast, and in the valley of
the Sarno.         Early in 1822 the wells lost their water. August, 1833,
water failed in the wells.            J   The loss of water has sometimes been
attributed to other causes, such as the state of the rainfall, <fcc., but
Professor Phillips specially observes that this sinking of the wells
cannot be explained by reference to the previous state of the
weather ;§ and, after a careful examination into all the phenomena
connected with the eruptions of Vesuvius, he alludes again to " the
Binking of water in the wells around Vesuvius — the total drying up of
some, and the increased descent of the bucket in all," during times of
volcanic disturbances, as an important fact.
   M. Ch. St. Claire Deville|| remarks : " It is well known that there is
only one tolerably certain indication of an approaching eruption of
Vesuvius, and that is the disappearance                   of the water in the wells   of
Resina and Torre del Greco."
   According to Poulett-Scrope,^[ the threatening indications of an
                            "
approaching crisis are accompanied by the disturbance or total dis
appearance of springs, and such accidents as the cracking, splitting and
heaving of the substructure of the mountain must naturally occasion."
   Professor Guiscardi, of Naples, in answer to my inquiry, writes,**
" As a rule, the water of wells in
                                                    the neighbourhood of Vesuvius
undergo changes in quantity, and even quite disappear before the com
mencement of eruptions.                Only as well as I know in the eruption of
1861, the phenomena followed the eruption.                        I  add a list of such
diminishing        and   drying wells.

   " Before the
                   eruption of 1794, there was at Torre del Greco a small
torrent, capable, it is said, of moving four mills.          After the eruption
the   torrent got very poor, so that the water scarcely supplied a foun
tain.    After the eruption of 1861, there was an increase of water in
this fountain, and in some small springs near the shore, and one was
noticed in the sea itself, which lasted nearly a month.
    " There is a well on a farm of some relatives of mine, at St.
                                                                          Georgio
di Cremano, in right line nearly 4 miles from Vesuvius, 150 feet deep,
and plentifully fed by a spring. After the eruption of 1861, the water
began to decrease, and a year after it was quite dry. This was followed
by so abundant an emission of carbonic acid, that the well had to be
 stopped up."
    I must observe, however, that the high authority of Professor
Palmieri is against this view.* He states that previous to the eruption
of Vesuvius in 1871-72, the water in the wells was neither deficient
nor scarce, but was very acid afterwards.              He elsewhere mentions
that he considers      these supposed premonitory signs either only to
happen occasionally, or to be mere coincidences, such as the coinci
dence of a dry or rainy season.            But the weight of evidence is
certainly against    this opinion,  and,  as  I shall presently explain, there
may be tracts that have an independent water-level which escape the
 surrounding disturbance, and it is not impossible that this very cir
 cumstance has led to the selection of such areas for the sites of towns
 and villages on the slopes of the mountain.
    The more local springs which supply the shallow surface wells may
 remain undisturbed, while at other points the deeper-seated springs
 having a wider range may be tapped and drained. Again, the water in

the superficial volcanic strata will nsually flow towards the circum
ference of the mountain, in consequence of the beds by which they
are held up dipping from the central crater; while the springs in the
sedimentary strata lie in the continuous planes traversed by the vol
canic duct, and towards which they may often dip. Some irregularity
in the phenomena is therefore to be expected, and while in most
places the wells suffer, it is quite intelligible that in others they may
be but little affected.

    As bearing upon the subject of the disturbances to which water
bearing strata are liable in volcanic districts, we have the evidence of
M. Mauget, a well-engineer of great experience, respecting the
sudden changes of water level in the Neapolitan area, during his
residence there.          There were eruptions of Vesuvius in 1865 and 1867,
but none in 1866. Nor were there any important earthquakes, but a
number of minor ones are recorded.
    M. Mauget says that in May, 1866, the wells and springs around
Naples began to be affected, and continued to diminish until June,
but considers that this might be due to ordinary causes, such as lesser
rainfall.       On the 29th June a sudden change took place.               The waters
of the aqueduct, which brought in the water from a distance of
 12 miles, and of the canal of Lagno di Mofita, as well as of various
rivers, became troubled and reduced in a surprising manner. The next
day the waters became bright, but were found to be reduced to the
extent of one-fifth of their volume.               The great springs of the Sannio
district    were     reduced   by  one-third   ; and  the town of Sorrento was de
 prived of all potable water.           This water is brought in by an aqueduct
 from the neighbouring          hills, which consist of Eocene or of Cretaceous
 strata.     The whole district, from the foot of the Apennines to the
 Neapolitan coast, was affected over an area of 66 miles square.
    At the same time various artesian wells in the valley of Sebito
became sanded up and greatly reduced in their flow, and the two deep
 artesian wells of Naples threw up above 200 cubic metres of trachy tic
 and pumiceous sands and lapilli.*
     It is evident that this diminution          in the surface waters could only

have been caused by their absorption under ground, either to restore
some water level reduced by a former eruption, or to fill fissures in
course   of formation preceding the eruptions of 1867 and 1868.
     It seems to me, therefore, to use the words of Professor Phillips,
that   the observationsrespecting the effects produced on wells and
                                                 " have been too often
springs by volcanic eruptions and earthquakes,
and too carefully made to allow of a serious doubt on the subject;" he
asks, "What is the cause of it ? and why is it an indication of coming
disaster ?"
§ 4.   The Hydro-geological and Statical Condition of the Underground
                Waters in and under a Volcanic Mountain.
     The canse   is,
                   believe, not far to seek, when the hydro-geological
                   I
conditions of the strata composed above of volcanic matter, and below
of sedimentary         strata, are considered.
     So well known        the absorbent power of a volcanic surface, that
                          is
the  mention of the fact hardly seems necessary, except in corroboration
of subsequent statements and for the purpose of independent testi
mony.      On ordinary strata         itroughly estimated that about one-
                                           is
third of the rainfall passes nnder ground, but on volcanic surfaces the
whole rainfall soon disappears, a small proportion only being lost
by   evaporation. Amongst innumerable notices of this fact,               will
                                                                           it
suffice to mention those of        two  experienced   authorities. Lyell re
marks on the dry and arid surfaces of Etna, and on the rapid absorp
tion of the rainfall, and observes that
                                             " the volume of rain-water and
melted suow commonly absorbed by a lofty mountain like Etna,                     is
enormous    ;*  again, Piazzi Smyth, in describing his ascent of Teneriffe,
says,  "that    though so much rain had fallen lately, not a trickling
stream, not even a drop of standing water, was anywhere to be seen                ;
the pumice-stone ashes had swallowed all up."                 f
   Volcanic mountains being composed of streams of lava of very vari
able width and length, irregularly alternating with more widely spread
layers of scoria and ashes, the whole mass would be permeable were
it not that the decomposition of some and the consolidation of other
beds, by atmospheric        and aqueous agencies, have formed here and
there impermeable       beds, which hold up the rain-waters, and furnish
local supplies to wells and springs.         But where such impermeable
beds    do  not  intervene,   the rain-water penetrates to greater depths,
and    is there stored until the line of water-level reaches to such             a
height that the hydrostatic pressure forces        outwards, and causes
                                                         it                to
                                                                            it

   This storage may take place either in the lava or in the beds of
 scorias and ashes.      Solid lava      impermeable, but water penetrates

through, and is held in, the numerous fissures and cavities by which
it is traversed. These fissures are due to contraction on cooling,
and to the fractured state of the lava produced by the split
ting caused by subsequent disturbances, whilst larger cavities are
produced by other causes. Of these, the two most important are —
1st, the escape of vapours while the lava is consolidating.               Sometimes
the hardened outer crust of the lava is raised in great blisters, which,
on the escape of the vapour, are sufficiently solid to retain their posi
tion, and remain like so many empty beehives on the surface of the
lava streams. The Grotta delle Palombe, on Etna, which, according to
W altenhausen, has a length or depth of about 500 feet, and a height
in places of from 70 to 80 feet, and the great ice cave near the top of
the Peak of Teneriffe, described by Piazzi Smyth,* aud so large as
to contain a lake of water of considerable size, are attributed by them
to the escape of elastic vapours.
    2nd, the escape of lava from a lava stream after the exterior of it
has become solid, when an empty shell in the form of a cave or
tunnel is left. These tunnels or caverns are of common occurrence,
and often of large size.                                   "
                               Scrope observesf that among the lavas of
Etna, Bourbon, Iceland, St. Michael, Teneriffe, and many others,
caverns of very large dimensions are thus formed beneath the surface
of a lava stream, and often imitate in their extent and windings the
well-known caves worn by water in limestone rocks."                          Phillips
and others notice the occurrence of similar tunnels in the lavas of
Vesuvius, but they are all small.
    In the great volcanic mountains of South and Central America,
Humboldt long ago inferred that large cavities filled with water must
exist in consequence of the ejection of water, with small fishes and
tnfaceous mud, from fissures caused by the earthquake shocks which
precede the eruptions of the volcanoes in the Andes.            J
    A French geologist, M. Virlet d'Aonst, has, moreover, given particu
 lars of two great tunnel-caverns of Central America, § which will serve
to indicate the magnitude of some of these subterranean reservoirs.
The first is that known as the Cueva de Chivacamote, near Perota,
which he was assured extended several leagues in length (!) He found
it to be a cavern of great size, and divided into compartments by
falls of the roof. The floor is covered with a sandy gravel, and the
side walls, here as in the cave of Custodio, exhibit grooved lines
covered with slight calcareous incrustations indicative of old water-
 levels.   The other is the lirena de Custodio, in the State of San-Luis
 Potosi, of which he says that it forms a perfect semispherical tunnel

the centre of the mountain.
    Cavities    originating in these ways must have been formed at all
times and in many lava streams, and although a certain number of
them, especially those due to the upward escape of elastic vapours,
may have been filled up by succeeding              lava streams, this would not
be the case with tunnel-caverns opening downwards.                       Nor would
these    streams    always fill up even open fissures, as they push before
them a mass        of solidified debris, which forms a pavement protecting
the   underlying mass.
   The lava throughout a volcanic mountain may therefore contain a
greater     or lesser number of caverns, which serve, whenever they
happen     to lie below the normal line of water-level, as so many reser
voirs.     The mass of the lava is further riddled with fissures of all
dimensions, which act as water-channels and                 channels of intercom
munication.
   Again, the beds of scoriae, ashes, and tufaceous deposits serving to
build up volcanic mountains, and which overlap the lava streams, and
extend to considerable depths, are often water-bearing.                Some contain
powerful springs, like stratum No. 4, which was met with in the Palace
well at a depth of 368 feet beneath the surface at Naples (p. 141). The
shallow surface wells of the district are commonly in beds of this
character.
    Even the more impermeable tufaceous beds contain cavities which
when under the line of water-level, must serve as reservoirs.                  These
cavities,    which attain a size of 2 feet or more in height, and are
lengthened out in a vertical direction, like the flues of chimneys, have
been formed by the disengagement            of elastic vapours during the con
solidation of the beds, that consist, in the Naples district, of volcanic
tuff with trachytic and other rock pebbles.*             These beds have a wider
extension than the lava masses, which further decrease in importance
 as they trend from the central area of eruption.f
    The dykes running in vertical lines through volcanic mountains
 form another structural feature having an important bearing upon the
 question under consideration, for they traverse radially the beds of
 ashes, scoriae, tufa, and lava wrapping round the central duct, with
 which they serve to place them in communication.                     Besides these
 great radial dykes, which are often extremely numerous, there is a
 network of small fissures or dykes branching off from them in all
 directions.

 central cone for a distance of 1£ mile.             Scrope says that in nearly
 every lateral eruption of Etna, the production of such a fissure has
 heen observed.       Similar instances are not wanting in Vesuvius.                  In
 1738 a fissure crossed the whole island of Lancerote; while in the
 great eruption of Hecla of 1783 the fissure which was then formed
 was supposed to extend not less than 100 miles in length.*

    Scrope further remarks that "the rents thus produced in the frame
of a volcanic mountain are sometimes of such a size as to cleave its
whole mass in two.         This occurred in the volcano of Inachian, one of
the Moluccas, in 1646. The crater of the Soufriere of Montserrat, and
the volcanic cone of Gnadaloupe both appear to have been thus split
through.        So also the Montagne Pelee of Martinique."                       Piazzi
 Smyth states that the cinder beds surrounding the summit of Tene-
riffe are traversed by dykes proceeding in radial lines from the Peak.f
Phillips describes some of the dykes and fissures of Vesuvius, and gives
a section showing the relative position of the ejected debris and lava
beds of this mountain, and of the dykes radiating from the central
core. J
    These dykes, like other masses of lava, have generally become
fissured in cooling, and the interstices thus formed serve as water
channels, not only for the rain which falls upon them, or to small
springs high up the mountain as in Teneriffe,§ but, what is more im
portant, they may serve as channels of drainage to the water-bearing
scoriaceous and lava beds which they intersect.               For it will be under

as    so many conduits to carry the water from the separate water-

   Very little is known of the substrata of a volcanic mountain. We
know that Vesuvius, Etna, and Hecla stand on Tertiary strata — that
some volcanoes in America stand on Cretaceous         or Jurassic strata,
and others probably on crystalline rocks, but of the stratigraphical
details underground we have very scanty information.            The only
                I
instances that am acquainted with are the sections obtained in boring
for the two artesian wells constructed in 1865-66 at Naples by MM.
Degousee and Laurent, of Paris.     These supply very important data not
only respecting the volcanic beds, but also respecting the sedimentary
strata beneath.     One well is situated in the Piazza Villa-Reale, and
was carried to a depth of 1106 feet, and the other, in the gardens of the
Royal Palace at Naples, 72 feet above the sea-level, was carried to the
depth of 1524 feet.     The details given of this latter by M. Laurent

   No ascending spring was met with until the volcanic ashes stratum
No. 4 was reached at a depth of 368 feet. Another spring was found
at a depth of 830 feet in the Tertiary marly sands No. 9 ; another in
the micaceous sands No. 12 at 1106 feet, but no spring of the desired
volume was met with until a sandy bed under the Macigno was
reached at a depth of 1524 feet.         The discharge of water from this
bed amounted to nearly 2 cubic metres per minute, and rose about
30 feet above the surface, so that the water could be used as a natural
fountain in the Palace gardens.         In the Piazza the artesian waters
formed another natural fountain rising 8 feet above the surface.
   These wells, therefore, show the existence of one important spring in
a stratum of volcanic debris, and of three springs in the sedimentary
strata beneath.       But this only gives the more powerful ascending
springs ; bodies of water of lesser volume, or which do not rise to the
surface, escape notice in works of this description.
   The overflow of the water from the bed of volcanic ashes proves
that the bed comes to the surface at a level higher than that of the
ground where the well is situated, and as the water has sufficient
ascensional force to rise several feet above the ground, it must neces
sarily, in order to overcome the resistance or friction of the bed
through which it passes, stand at its oufcrop in the central volcanic
area considerably higher than at the point of overflow.          There must,
therefore, be a continuous sheet of underground water, the level of
 which rises towards the centre whence the water-bearing bed pro
ceeds.     In this way all the permeable beds of a volcanic mountain will
be charged with water, the level of the water rising with the distance
from the point of escape and with the height of the mountain. Everv-
where beneath the level of saturation the surface-waters will eventually
fill all fissures and interstices, and lodge in them permanently, unless
disturbed or drawn off by artificial or natural means (see fig. 1).
    This level depends, when there are alternating permeable and im
permeable beds, on the height of outcrop of the former, and, when the
whole mass is permeable, on the texture of the rock, or the friction
to which the water is subjected.          In the Chalk hills of the south
of England which are composed of a comparatively homogeneous

               On the Agency       of  Water in Volcanic Eruptions.               143
rock, bat variably fissured, the rise of the line of water-level varies
from 13 to 150 feet in the mile, and in some strata it is even more.
     It will therefore be apparent, that in the case of the irregular and
complex beds forming a volca-nic mountain, the height of the water-
level is subject to too many conditions to be determined accurately,
except by experiment, and for this few opportunities present them
selves.     There is, however, an available natural datum line, namely,
that furnished by the escape of springs, at certain high levels on the
mountain slopes.
     As springs issuing from a body of homogeneous strata or strata
which intercommunicate, depend for their permanence upon the
water stored up in the interior of the mountain, at a level above that
of the point of escape, it follows that if there is a point of permanent
escape, we may conclude that in the ground behind, all the strata below
that level are under the line of permanent saturation, and therefore
charged with water ; and further, as just said, this line of permanent
 saturation must stand the higher the further it goes into the body of
 mountain.
     Now, on Etna, Wattershausen* describes a spring in the valley of
 St. Giacomo, near Zafarana, which he says is the only point at so
 high a level at which a tolerably strong spring constantly issues. It
 at once forms a small waterfall, and runs some distance until lost in
 some volcanic sands lower down.                The strata, where they issue, are
 composed of alternating layers of          tuff  and compact lava.      Its escape is
  due   to the  circumstance     that  there  is here  a  ravine  which cuts  through
  the bed, and either touching on the line of water-level or intersecting
  the junction between an impermeable and a permeable bed, and thus
  taps the subterranean waters. Wattershausen does not give the height of
  the ground, but from a section of Abich's, which passes near the spot,
  I infer it to be about 2000 feet above sea-level.f On the other side of
   Etna the river Simeto, or one of its tributaries, rises near Bronte, at a
   height of about 2200 feet above sea-level.            This likewise indicates the
   existence of a perennial spring.              I find   also that at other points
   around the mountain at and about this level, streams commence
   which point to a like line of water-level.
      These figures are only roughly approximate, but they constitute our
   only available data, and in taking a mean level of 2000 feet,             I believe
   I am rather below than above the mark. If, therefore, we take
   'Wattershausen's section of Etna, supplemented by Abich's, which
   follows nearly the same line, and gives, moreover, the height of the
    several points, the following diagram would represent generally the
    massif of the mountain and the position of
                                                         the line of saturation.

    rana and near Bronte, the line of water-level will rise in proportion as
    the ground rises between o and b ; and in the same way in the great
   central dome which rises rapidly above the lower slopes, the water-
   line will rise more suddenly. It is therefore possible that in the
    centre of the mountain the line of permanent saturation, I, may
    occasionally stand higher, V, than the top of the Val del Bove (5292
    French ft., Abich). It may lie too deep for springs to issue, but the
   remarkable flood 'in that great depression described by Lyell,* and con
   nected with the eruption of the year 1755, seems explicable on the
   supposition of a high central water-level more readily than on the
   assumption of the sudden melting of a mass of ice in the interior of
   the mountain. For although ice may be formed and retained under a
   covering of lava in the manner described by Lyell near the summit of
   Etna, the cold would not penetrate to a sufficient depth to allow of
   the accumulation of a mass of ice of the dimensions required for so
   great a flood. Any body of ice must be superficial, as the increase of
«  heat with the depth from the surface would be a bar to its existence
   in the interior of the mountain, independently of the heat diffused at
   all times from the central duct. Nor would the sudden melting of the
   snow, which never lies very deep, and would frequently recur, explain
  tho sudden great and exceptional outburst of flood-waters described
  by contemporary writers.f
       On the other hand, heavy rains or the prolonged repose of the
   volcano, may have resulted in the exceptional rise to V of the level of the
   underground water-line, I, so that if one of these radial fissures, bo
   frequently formed during the eruptions of Etna, snddenly opened in a
   direction to traverse the water-logged strata, the effect would be to
  tap and drain at once the whole of this subterranean reservoir to the
  level of the point of escape — in the Val de Bove— a point still about
   5000 feet below the summit of the mountain ; while the water, coming
  as it would from the centre of the mountain, would also account for
  its reported heat.

         This intersection of the line of water-level     in Etna was probably
     due to    the  peculiar shape  of  the  mountain, and the rapidity of the
     slopes above the Val del Bove.          In volcanic mountains generally,
     this level   is too depressed to be  within reach of surface irregularities
    and fissures.
        With respect to the condition of the sedimentary strata under a
    volcanic mountain, very few observations          have been recorded, M.
    Constant     Prevost, after visiting most of the volcanic districts in
    Europe, concluded that they, were not in general much disturbed —
    that the volcanoes were on lines of fissures but not on lines showing
    much      lateral compression, or on anticlinals.        If we may take
    Vesnvius as a type, we should conclude that the sedimentary strata
   pass under the mountain and crop out in the adjacent sea- bed with
   little interference from faults. For the tertiary strata under Naples,
   come to the surface on the hill ranges further inland, and dip
  continuously seaward ; and the fact of the overflow of water from
  the water-bearing beds — water of course            passing down from the
  oatcrop on the surface — to the height it actually attains, shows         that
  the continuity of the beds cannot be materially interrupted.
      The well-sections at Naples determine the existence of at least
  four water-bearing strata, of which the deeper one (1524 feet) dis
 charged about 600,000 gallons daily, rising 102 feet above the sea-level.
  So great a pressure would show that this stratum had its outcrop
 inland at a considerable elevation above Naples, and the volume of
 the spring would prove that the head of underground water above the
 line of sea-level was large.        Consequently, as the plane of this water
 bearing bed must be traversed under Vesuvius by the volcanic duct,
 the sides of that duct or fissure will at that point be subject to the
 amount of hydrostatic pressure indicated by these conditions, or to a
 pressure, apart from friction, equal to that of about 53 atmospheres.
      "With respect to the ordinary mode of escape of the underground
 waters, that portion held in the more superficial volcanic beds will
 escape as springs on the slopes or at the foot of the mountain ; but
with respect to the underlying sedimentary strata — when they are
adjacent to the sea and crop out in the bed of the sea — the surplus
waters (or those annually added to the underground stores by the
rainfall) will escape, 1st, in springs flowing on the surface ; 2nd, by
springs issuing in the sea-bed — and the size of these springs will
depend on the hydrostatic pressure, and on the resistance and friction
of the conducting strata. When the water-passages are contracted,
as in sand and sandstone, the submarine springs will be small and
slow : but when large and more open, as in limestones, the discharge
in the sea-bed will, as on the coast of Spezzia and elsewhere on the
Mediterranean, form large and powerful springs of fresh water rising
through the waters of the sea.

    Such are the hydro-geological conditions of a volcanic mountain in
a state of rest.       The effects when that equilibrium is destroyed will
now be discussed.
      § 5.   Condition of    the Underground      Waters during an Eruption.
    So long as the volcano remains in a state of rest, so long will the
hydro-geological conditions described in § 4 continue unchanged.                     The
level, I, of the underground waters may rise ; but, as in the meantime
cooling has, by causing solidification, isolated the molten lava, no
result is produced except that arising from the trickling of the
surface-waters on the yet hot surfaces, giving rise to the small
columns of steam common during the periods of rest. After a pro
longed period of repose, even these minor effects cease.                         It may
happen that if      the  crater  is very deep   and  there  has  been  a long   interval
since the last explosion, that the water-level may mount into the
crater and give rise to a lake.              In most cases, however-, such lakes
are due to the relatively low position of the crater with reference to a
part of the adjacent ground, or to the decomposition of the lava,
whereby it has become retentive of the rainfall.                     Such bodies      of
water are important in the event of any              fresh  eruption.
              Fig. 4. — Crater Lake dependent on the general water-level   (I).
    Crater lakes are not so common or of so large a size in Europe as
 in Central America.            The lake of Atitlas, 1558 metres above the
 level of the Pacific, is 20 X 15 kilometres large, and of a depth yet un
 ascertained.      The crater lake of Masaya in Nicaragua is 8 kilometres
 across, and 150 metres deep in the centre. In 1852 this lake suddenly
 appeared as though boiling, and a violent explosion shortly followed.
 The volcano of San Salvador is 2300 metres high, and at the bottom
 of its crater, which is 700 to 800 metres in diameter, and 400 to
 500 metres in depth, is a very deep lake.               Another large crater lake,
  12 kilometres west of San Salvador, is level with the ground and
 200 metres deep.*
     The crater lakes, however,         are an exceptional feature.          The great
 body of the rainfall         becomes stored within the mountain itself, and
 makes itself visible          only by springs       on   the   lower slopes of the

mountain. Its distribution must be irregular from the circumstance
that volcanoes consist of alternating beds of permeable scoriaceous
and of solid or decomposed impermeable materials, and as each of
these is of limited extent, there may be a number of independent
water-levels. It consequently follows that one may be affected by the
disturbances accompanying an 'eruption, while others adjacent do not
suffer, or suffer but little.         It is only when these several levels are
traversed by the same set of rents that intercommunication is esta
blished. The following section shows how numerous are the beds on
the flanks of a volcano, and how they are traversed by dykes.

    The hydro-geological conditions of a volcanic mountain during the
period of repose are of the same character as those ordinarily obtaining
in Sedimentary strata, but whenever an eruption takes place these
conditions are disturbed, and a special class of phenomena ensue.
(See Plate 1.)
    After a period of rest, the chilled superficial plug of lava in the
 volcanic duct will be of a thickness proportionate to the duration of
 that period, and when the upward pressure of the molten lava
 beneath begins to exert itself, the resistance will be in a ratio to the
 thickness of the plug. If thin, it will soon yield ; small cracks and
 fissures will be gradually formed, into which the water lodged in the
 beds around, or may be in the crater, will find its way by slow degrees,
 causing an increase in the discharge of vapour, and giving rise to
 detonations, small at first, but increasing gradually as the heated lava
 breaks through the crust. Should, on the other hand, the plug be
 thick, it will not yield so readily to the pressure of the ascending
 column of lava ; but when the tension has reached a certain point it
 will rupture more or less suddenly, forming deep fissures through
 which the water will be precipitated into the molten lava beneath, in
 quantity sufficient to produce those powerful and paroxysmal                     ex
 plosions with which the eruptions usually commence after lengthened
 periods of rest.
     As a consequence of these detonations and explosions the fabric of
                                                                           l 2

 the mountain is shaken    — the underground waters suffer disturbance,
 old -water-channels are sanded up, new channels are formed — and the
 waters   are dislodged and driven to seek fresh beds and fresh lodg
ments.     These effects are necessarily most strongly felt in the rocks
around the centre of eruption, and it is there that they undergo the
maximum of displacement and Assuring ; and as the water lodged in
that part of the mountain flows into the volcanic duct, it flashes
into steam, and is driven out in continuous explosions.         Thus, the
water stores immediately surrounding the central duct and crater,
become gradually exhausted, and .their level is more or less lowered.
As this loss proceeds, the water lodged in more distant parts of the
volcanic mountain flows in to supply the void, and the explosions
will be violent and prolonged, according to the available volume of
water present in the mass of the mountain. As these central water
stores are driven off and become exhausted, and the level of the
underground water is gradually lowered, there must necessarily be
an iiiflux from the circumference of the mountain to replace the
loss caused by the central explosions, and this will continue so long
as thu central body of water is kept by the eruption lower than in
the strata and fissures at a distance.    These different hydraulic con
ditions are represented by the diagrams — sections 1, 2, 3, Plate I.
   In these diagrams v represents the mass of volcanic materials ; S the
sedimentary strata ; p the permeable strata ; m the impermeable strata ;
a, b, c the normal level of the underground waters in the volcanic
mountain ; and I their level in the sedimentary strata.       The arrows
show the direction in which the waters .flow under the normal and
also under the altered conditions caused by the eruption.      In section
No. 1 the points a and c are fixed levels, while b fluctuates according
to the amount of rainfall and to the length of the intervals between
the eruptions.     Its height above a and c depends upon the distance
from those points and on the resistance of the materials through
which the water percolates.     This of course is apart from any excep
tional interfering causes. The flow of water in v, section 1, will, under
normal conditions of repose, be from the centre towards the circum
ference, and it will escape at the lowest levels ; and if there are no
lower levels inland, the whole direction will be seaward.         In this
section, however, the depression at c allows of an escape of some of
the water on the inland side of the mountain.
   As the level of 6 is lowered by the discharge of water into the duct
of the crater, the water first ceases to escape at a and c, and then the
adjacent body of water below that level sets in with an inward flow
towards the central duct, as shown in section 2 ; for it is a well-known
fact that in masses of partially resisting strata, such as the Chalk or
the New Red Sandstone, excessive pumping (or the removal of water
faster than it can be replaced from the surrounding strata) causes

               On   the Agency     of Water in Volcanic Eruptions.                  149
a depression      in the line of water-level in the form of an inverted cone,
large    in  proportion to the amount of friction, and this continues
until, on the cessation of pumping, the water gradually recovers its
normal level by influx from the surrounding beds.                    The discharge of
water from the crater is an analogous operation, and must be attended
with the same consequences.*
   This flow of water towards the volcanic centre is greatly facilitated
by the dykes radiating from that centre, and which, intersecting at
right angles the several water-bearing masses, serve as conduits to
carry the water into the mam duct of the volcano.                        Nevertheless,
there may be some areas so isolated as to escape.                If,  however, a large
fissure were formed         through the head of water ab or cb, and happened
to open      out on the slope of the mountain at a level lower than the
water-level in the interior of the mountain, then the escape of water
would be outwards, and its volume would be in proportion to the
mass of the mountain above that level, or to the height of the water-
level at b.        Such a fissure, probably during an exceptionally high
water-level, might account, as before mentioned, for the flood on the
slopes of Etna in 1665, and it is possible that the same cause may
have produced some of the great water and mnd discharges recorded
of other volcanoes*
   The progress*of the eruption by which the level of 6 is gradually
lowered finally determines the whole of the available drainage of v
into the central cavity or duct : and if any portion of v be below the
sea-level, and that portion contain any permeable beds, or if it be
traversed by any of those radial dykes, which, at the high tide of b,
carried its waters into the central duct, then whenever the level of b
descends below the point of the escape of the fresh inland waters into
the sea, the same permeable strata or the same dykes will serve to
carry the salt water from the sea to the central area.f So also, should
any fissures, under these circumstances, open at the sea-level after the
higher inland head of water is drained, then the water from the sea
will flow into that fissure and be carried inwards into the mountain.
Professor Moseley mentions^ a submarine eruption, that in 1877
took place off the Hawaiian coast, in a depth of from 150 to 400 feet
of water, 50 miles from Mauna Loa, during which a fissure, in all
   * The vapour of water constitutes by far the largest part of the elastic fluids
given off during eruptions, probably ffifo or even -n^Ti °f tne "'hole.       M. Fouque
estimated that the quantity of vapour projected from Etna in the eruption of lb65
amounted to the large quantity of 22,000 cubic metres, or about five million gallons
daily.
   t Just   as wells adjacent to the coast and deeper than the sea-level   are subject to
an influx of sea water    if  the pumping is carried too far, or the level of the springs
too much lowered.

    probability connected with this eruption, opened on the coast. This
    fissure was traced inland from the shore for nearly 3 miles, varying
   in width from a few inches to 3 feet. " In some places the water was
    seen pouring down the opening into the abyss below."          This is not
   strictly an analogous case, but I mention it to show how the activity
   of the eruption may be promoted by the influx of surface waters.
        Similarly, should the water-level in and under the mountain fall
   below both the-sea-level and also below the general level of the water, I,
   in the permeable strata p, then not only will the springs at the surface
   of p fail and the wells run short or dry, but the outward and seaward
   current will also be reversed, and the water will flow in from the sea
  to the seat of the volcanic disturbance, through the same channels as
  those by which the inland waters before escaped.          This later con
  dition of the eruption is represented     in section 3, where the level of I
  in the strata p falls below the sea-level.     With the fall of the water-
  level, /, the available supply of water becomes gradually exhausted or
  the channels of communication impeded, and this continues until,
 with the cessation of the extravasation of the lava, the eruption comes
 to an end.
       To return to the first stage of the eruption.    The lava, as it rends
 and crashes through the plug, comes into contact with the water
 lodged in the cavities and porous strata about and above the plug ;
 explosions and detonations follow, violent in proportion to the supply
 of water. More or less of the lava is hurled into the air and scattered
 as scoriae and ashes, and the explosions continue so long as water finds
 its way to the escaping lava, but as the supply becomes gradually
 exhausted the detonations diminish in power and number, until they
 finally cease from want of supply. But the extravasation of the lava
 may, and often does continue, long after this exhaustion of water
 supply, showing, as I believe, the independence of the two causes ; for
otherwise the flow of lava would be accompanied to the last with
explosions and detonations due to the escape of the extruding
agent.
      This flow of water from the surrounding beds into the volcanic
duct, its sudden flashing into steam and the violence of the explosions
during the first period of the eruption, are easy to conceive; but
greater difficulties attend the following stages when the column of
lava has ascended higher and fills the duct, and the level of the
underground water has become lowered. The only way water can
then gain access is through the walls of the duct into the fluid lava
as    it ascends.
     This involves some little-understood       problems.    Of the actual
underground conditions we must ever be ignorant, and experiment at
present guides us but a short way.          Any inquiry must therefore for

              On   the   Agency   of Water in    Volcanic    Eruptions.   151
  the present be more     or less conjectural. There can be little doubt
  that (as before   explained) when the volcano is in a state of rest, the
   beds of volcanic materials surrounding the upper part of the volcanic
   dnct are charged with water to a certain height, and also that, when
   the volcano stands on sedimentary strata, the duct lower down
   traverses a certain number of water-logged strata, where the hydro
  static pressure is considerable.      For the water to rise to the height
  which    it does at the Naples wells requires a pressure of not less
  than 50 atmospheres ; but the static pressure of the column of lava
  in the crater of Vesuvius at the depth at which the water-bearing
  stratum there lies (1520 feet), during a central eruption of the lava,
  is, of course, far in excess of this.  The introduction of the water into
  the lava must therefore depend on other conditions than hydrostatic
  pressure, such, for instance, as capillarity, or the elastic force of
 vapour. Although this increases so rapidly, yet as the law of increase
 at temperatures exceeding 436° F. has not been experimentally deter
 mined, and we have to deal with temperatures            approaching to or
 equalling the melting point of lava, which        not less than 2300° F.,
                                                    is
 we can only infer what may possibly be the consequences of the
 passage of a volcanic duct through water-bearing strata           and our
                                                                      ;
 remarks on this point must to certain extent be taken as merely
                                       a
suggestive.
    Under great pressure and friction water may continue .to circulate
 underground until its critical point       isreached, or until      point
                                                                      a    is
 reached when the elastic force of vapour, or of its disassociated gases,
 exceeds the hydrostatic pressure.        In the former case, taking the
 critical point of water at 773° F., the depth would be about 35,000
 feet, but of the limits of the latter we are ignorant.
    If at a depth say of 5000 feet, or at any other depth, a water
 bearing stratum should underlie a volcano, the temperature of the
 water in that stratum will, independently of its temperature of
depth, rise rapidly as       itapproaches the volcanic duct, and pass
progressively through an ascending scale until a temperature of 700"
to 800° F., or higher,       isreached.    We will assume that at some
point the force of the elastic vapour counterbalances            the hydro
static pressure, and stays the further approach of the water.         In this
case, and supposing the volcano to be at rest, the only underground
effect would be that the water to      acertain distance, n, fig   from the
                                                                     6,
duct, would under that high temperature be at its critical point, or in
some state of maximum tension and pressure.            This being effected,
there will be no further change so long as          state of equilibrium
                                                    a                     is
maintained, and the pressure of the lava at rest in the duct D remains
equal to the elastic force of the superheated water or vapour in n.
If, however, that state of rest       disturbed, and the lava in the duct
                                     is

pressure   may have been, the change from the static to the kinetic
immediately destroys the balance ; the lateral pressure of the lava, L,
in the duct is no longer equal to that of the superheated vapour in n,
which is therefore driven into the yielding mass of molten lava and so
ascends to the surface.
                       Fig.   7. — Lava column during flow.
   As the escape of this vapour of maximum tension relieves the
pressure on the water in the shaded part m, a portion of this -water
is at once driven in to replace it ; and so long as the pressure of the
column of lava in the duct is less than that of the vapour or water in
the state in which it exists at n, so long will successive increments of
the vapour be driven into the lava and cause continuous explosions.
   The only limit to the depth at which the introduction of water into
the duct can be effected      will be that at which the general underground
percolation  of water   is  stayed in the manner before explained — that is,
by the increase of the temperature due to central heat — a depth far in
excess of that where we are supposing the introduction of the surface
waters to take place.
   With regard to the lesser depths and lesser general temperature
of the water in the strata surrounding the higher parts of the volcanic
duct— capillarity will there continue to force the water forward so long

 as   the underground water stands at a sufficiently high level.                  Mallet
 was     of opinion* that capillary infiltration goes on in all porous rocks
 at enormous        depths, and that the deeply seated walls of the volcanic
 ducts     leading to the crater, if of such materials, may be red hot, and
yet continue to pass water from every pore (like the walls of a well
 in chalk), which is flashed off into steam, and, unable to return by the
way      the water came down, escapes through the duct and crater.
 For my own part,          I  do not think this can happen during a state of
undisturbed statical pressure, but that it follows on any disturbance.
    That capillarity exercises a very important influence on the under
ground percolation of water is undoubted.                To a certain point it has
been      proved experimentally by M. Daubree,-); who found that water
placed on a       disk of fine-grained (Triassic) sandstone,J fastened over
a vessel filled with steam under pressure of nearly two atmospheres,
infiltrated into the underlying vessel against that pressure.               He further
noticed that in consequence of the heat the action was more rapid than
it otherwise would have been ; and — making the experiment inversely
— he observed that vapour placed under a pressure of several atmo
spheres in the lower vessel, did not transude through the disk left
dry on the upper surface.           As before pointed out, however, capillarity
is adversely affected by a rise of temperature, and is comparatively
inoperative at high temperatures.
    Under these circumstances, it is conceivable that water may readily
be carried down throngh the upper cooler strata to the proximity of
the volcanic duct.          But no amount of available vapour tension could
force it back through the same depth of strata against both friction and
capillarity. At the same time when the elastic tension of the vapour
of the water reaches the point either of critical temperature, or such
higher temperature that it exceeds the hydrostatic pressure, the further
progress or descent of the water will be prevented.                    The influx of
water to the volcanic duct is to a certain point effected under the same
conditions as those which effect its general descent to depths through
the earth's crust.           But at this point, whatever it may be, other
causes come        into  operation, which, while the descent of water to the
volcanic foci beneath the solid crust remains an impossibility, renders
its introduction into the volcanic ducts, even at considerable depths,
possible.      In any case, when an equilibrium is established between the
vapour tension and the hydrostatic pressure, no change will take place
unless that condition of equilibrium be disturbed.                    Such a cause
exists in the case of a volcanic duct.

gives the water an elastic force sufficient to bar its further progress,
and fills the space n with vapour at an excessive tension, or with
water at the critical point. This tension has determined a state of
equilibrium which, so long as no change takes place in the opposing
surfaces of the vapour and the lava, is maintained without change. If,
then, anything occurs to weaken the resistance of one of the surfaces,
and equilibrium be destroyed, the surface, if elastic, will yield. Thus,
so long as a volcano is at rest, the pressure exercised by the column
of lava L against the sides of the duct counterbalances the tension of
the vapour at n.     But, when the lava is forced upwards and flows
past n, the statical pressure at that point is so far lessened that the
tension of the vapour now exceeds the resistance of the lava at the
same point, and the vapour is driven into the liquid lava L and rises
with and through it to the surface.      At the same time the sudden
elastic expansion of the vapour lessens the pressure on the water at m,
which therefore becomes in turn explosive, and as this water is
replaced by a portion of that which is pressing forward from the
water-head in b, this action will be repeated so long as the water
supply lasts and the disturbing causes continue in operation.
   The influx of water into the volcanic duct will also be materially
influenced by the changes of level, or oscillation, which the column
of lava undergoes during eruptions. For the variation of pressure
caused by this state of changing equilibrium allows the vapour
pressure to predominate at one time, while the resistance to it by the
column of lava will be in excess at other times.
   The explosion of steam iato the lava involves, amongst other
effects, disturbances of the encasing strata whenever any portion of
the water or vapour explodes behind blocks of rock forming part of
the walls of the duct. In fissile or porous sandstones, where the water
cavities are small, it may be supposed that a minimum dislodgment of
the materials composing the strata takes place. But        instead of soft if,

  or incoherent sandstones, the strata consist of bedded compact lime
  stone or other rocks, as represented in diagram, fig. 8, through which
  the water passes in open fissures, then the result will be different ; for
 the rock being divided horizontally by the planes of bedding, and verti
 cally by joints and cracks constituting the fissures in which the water
 is lodged, when the water surrounding the blocks 6' explodes or flashes
 into steam they will be forced or blown out with the escaping steam
 into the lava current L, in which they will be carried to the surfaco
 and ejected with the lava-scoriee by the explosions of the elastic
 vapour.     The cavities formed by the expulsion of the blocks b' are
 immediately injected with the lava from column L which eventually
 consolidates there. At the next eruption, when the former conditions
of water level have been restored, the renewed explosions at m n will
 expel not only other portions of the strata, but also portions of these
 intruded masses of lava.        It is thus that in the earlier eruptions of
Vesuvius, which form the slopes of Somma, blocks of altered limestone
derived from the underlying Tertiary and Cretaceous strata are
common ; they are scarcer in the later eruptions. It was while forming
 the walls of the dnct, and in contact with the molten lava and heated
water or vapour, and not while imbedded in the lava, that these rock
masses probably underwent that metamorphism which, in the case of
the Vesuvian lavas, resulted in the formation of the very varied group
of minerals met with in the ejected blocks of Somma.          Similar meta
morphosed blocks are found in the old lavas of many volcanoes
(Santorin and others), whilst the blocks of quartz mica-schist occa
sionally met with have undergone little or no change.*
    Besides these blocks of Sedimentary rocks, there are also found in
the more recent lavas of many volcanoes blocks of lava having the
character of the early erupted lavas.          Fouque mentions that in the
eruption    of Santorin in 1866, there were enclosed blocks of a lava of
which the composition differed considerably from that of the flowing
lava, and that they contained the minerals common in the old lavas of
that island.f It is difficult on any other hypothesis to account for the
presence of such blocka.
    I consider, therefore, that a volcanic duct passing through a certain
number of permeable strata charged with water, and through volcanic
matter also charged with water below a certain level, is surrounded
at these points by, as it were, an explosive material under repression,
which only requires a disturbance of the equilibrium, under which it
exists when the volcano is in a state of repose, to explode with violence.
Further, as the superheated vapour from each point of contact forces
its way into the ascending lava, the contiguous portion of highly
heated water behind it is driven forward, replacing that which has
                        * Fouque, " Santorin,"  p. 10.

just escaped, while another portion of the water filling the stratum
is pressed forward to take the place of the exploded portion. If the
lava still continues to ascend, the in-forcing of the vapour and the
explosions of successive portions of water succeed almost uninter
ruptedly, and the volcanic duct thus becomes the centre to a battery-
 discharging at many levels and keeping up an incessant volley ; for
the supply of water at first is comparatively unlimited, and being
renewed as quickly as it is exploded, there is no cessation in the action
 until the source is drained or stopped or the lava ceases to flow.     If
 the water is lodged at such a distance, n, from the sides of the duct
 that it explodes behind blocks or fragments of rocks, or of older
 lava lodged in the cavities left by previous removals of portions of the
 rock, then such blocks will be blown and driven into the outflowing
 lava current. This seems to be a more probable explanation than that
 of their being torn or wrenched off the sides, although in the first
 stage of a new volcano there may often be great mechanical action
 and ejection of debris in clearing the passage, as in the case of tbe
 large quantity of debris of Devonian strata in so many of the old
 volcanoes of the EifeL
     In considering the various phases of this problem, it is, however,
 only too apparent that while the hydro-geological conditions admit of
 investigation on known principles, the thermo-dynamical conditions
 are involved in much obscurity, and are more hypothetical.           The
 warrant for any hypothesis depends, however, upon whether tbe
 observed phenomena accord with the inferences that should follow on
 the assumptions,    and for this    I think sufficient cause can in this
 instance be shown.     For the more or less deep-seated subterranean
 detonations and thundering that accompany most eruptions, and the
 paroxysmal explosions accompanied by enormous ejections of steam
  and ashes from the crater, are the necessary consequences of an influx
 of water into the volcanic duct under the conditions we have
  described ; while a term is placed to the continuance of the eruption
  in the circumstance that the water supply being external and indepen
  dent, whenever that supply is exhausted by expulsion through the
  escaping lava, the explosions must cease, although the eruption of lava
  may proceed for a longer period.       The hypothesis agrees also with
  the fact that as a rule the eruptions are more paroxysmal the longer
  the interval of rest, for the filling of the underground reservoirs
  exhausted by the previous eruption is a question of time, and the
  greater their water-stores, the greater and more powerful the explo
  sions.
     The apparently conflicting phenomena of Ehrenberg's discovery of
  fresh-water diatoms in the volcanic ejections of some islands, and of
  marine diatoms in others, admit also of ready explanation on this
  hypothesis, for so long as the inland underground waters due to the

            On the Agency   of Water in Volcanic Eruptions.            157
rainfall stand higher, which they must do whenever the land is even
only a few feet above the sea level, so long will those waters dam
back and keep ont the sea-water, but whenever their level is brought
below that of the sea level, then inevitably will the sea-water flow
inland until the level is restored.   Thus fresh-water remains accumu
lated daring a period of repose, may be ejected during the early
stages of the eruption, and may be succeeded by marine ejections when
the exhaustion of the fresh-water springs leads to the influx of the sea.
   There are difficulties in adapting this hypothesis to volcanoes in a
state of permanent action such as Stromboli and Kilauea, but they are
not more formidable than those presented on other hypotheses.
   In both those volcanoes there is a maintained state of slight unstable
equilibrium — a constant oscillation of the lava in the volcanic duct
coupled with a small loss, whether in the form of ejected scorise or of
slight occasional overflows of lava. As these conditions are per
manent, they would induce in the manner before described a per
manent influx of water either through permeable strata at depths, or
by soakage of surface or sea water through the loose volcanic matter
above ; and as owing to this incessant drain, the underground reser
voirs would not have time to fill to their full extent, so it is probable
that the influx of water would always be small, but sufficient to main
tain the slight and constant disengagement of vapour bubbles that
goes on. Mallet says that there is a perennial spring on Stromboli at
a higher level than the crater.
    The independence of neighbouring volcanoes also presents another
difficulty. If, however, the volcanoes of Southern Italy or those of
Hawaii are, as suggested by Dana, on separate lines of fissure, it is
possible that on the assumption of excessive viscidity of the lava,
friction may oppose greater resistance along the horizontal planes
which separate them at depths, than along the vertical colnmn of
ascent in which the increasing fluidity, as tho pressure lessens,
diminishes the friction. This is merely a suggestion.     Although seem
ingly independent, there is occasionally both in the Italian and in the
Hawaian volcanoes, symptoms of sympathetic action.
    On the hypothesis advanced in these pages, a reason is also afforded
why a greater volcanic activity should be maintained along coast lines
 than inland, in the circumstance that when the inland waters which
feed for a time the explosive action are exhausted, they are succeeded
through their now deserted channels, by an influx of sea water that
 serves to keep up for a longer period the state of volcanic activity,
 and maintain passages open for the extrusion of the lava.      It is thus
 that the great inland volcanic areas of Auvergne, the Eifel, Hungary,
 and Central Asia have, on the withdrawal of the surrounding waters,
 become gradually extinct, and that the great volcanoes of the present
 day have settled in ocean centres, or along coast lines.

158                         Prof.  J. Prestwich.
   In mostly all of existing    volcanoes, there is clear evidence of the
access of sea   water in the presence not only of the chlorides and other
prodacts of its decomposition in the emanations from the lava, but also
in many cases of sea salt itself. Not, however, that the presence of sea
water is necessary or is always present ; for the vast stores of under
ground water in the Andes, and the great distance from and height
above the sea of so many of the South American volcanoes, render it
probable that they are in the main dependent upon inland water
supplies, and this is confirmed by the researches of Boussingault, who
was unable to detect in the fumaroles he examined any traces of
chlorides.
   But if water only plays the secondary         though important part      I
have assigned to it, to what are we to attribute the motive power
which causes the extravasation of the lava ? This involves questions
 connected with the rigidity and thickness of the earth's crust, that we
 will proceed to consider in their geological bearings.
   § 6.  Thickness of the Earth's Crust from the Geological Standpoint.
   Geologists and physicists still hold from their different standpoints
divergent views respecting the thickness to be assigned to the crust of
the earth.       Although the present stability of the earth's surface
renders it evident that the hypothesis of a thin crust resting on a
nucleus altogether molten and fluid is untenable, it is equally difficult
to reconcile certain geological facts with the hypothesis of a globe
solid throughout, or even of a very thick crust.
   Nor have the phenomena of the tides yet been determined with
sufficient accuracy to settle definitely the moot question whether the
rigidity of the crust is perfect, or whether it yields to some very
small extent to the deformation that might be caused by slight internal
tides.    Therefore, while on this ground alone, even if the data were
not otherwise insufficient, there are, on the other hand, certain geo
logical phenomena, volcanic phenomena among the rest, which are not
only incompatible with an entirely solid globe, but which would seem
to be explicable only on the hypothesis of a thin crust and a slowly
yielding substratum.        Of course it is also open to consideration,
whether a crust and Rubstratum of this nature would not, under
certain conditions, offer sufficient resistance to produce a quasi rigidity
such as would accord with existing physical conditions.
   The phenomena on which on geological grounds I should chiefly
rely in proof of such a substratum, and of a crust of no great thick
ness, are —
   1st. The flexibility   of the crust as exhibited (a) in the uplift of
           mountain chains, and (6) in the elevation of continental
           areas.

    0.   It    is important for our object to note that not only has moun
tain-uplifting gone on through all geological time, but that many, if
not most, of the great mountain chains have been raised during the
latest geological periods, and that compressed uplifts have not been
confined to any limited district, but have extended over the several
continents and over both hemispheres.              As instances of these may be
named       : —
    1.   The elevation       of the Pyrenees, which, although commenced in
            Palaeozoic    times, attained its maximum intensity and develop
            ment      in CHigocene, while minor movements             continued to
            Miocene times.
     2.   The main elevations of the Rocky Mountains and portions of the
            Andes took place during the Tertiary period, and they were
            raised to their present height so late as in Miocene and Pliocene
            times.
     3.   Although considerable elevations of the Himalayas are of Pre-
             Tertiary date, the researches of the geological survey of India*
              show that the special great Himalayan disturbance is of Post-
             Eocene age ; while in the Sub-Himalayan ranges, there is a
             large amount of disturbance of Post-Pliocene date.f
     4.   The elevation of the main axes of the Alps (although, like the
              others, began earlier) took place in Miocene times, and was
              prolonged to as late as the Post- Pliocene period, or to the time
              immediately preceding the comparatively recent             Quaternary
              period.
      It is only necessary to look at the section of any mountain chain to
  see the       enormous    amount of squeezing and crumpling the strata have
  invariably       undergone,    and the succession of folds of vast magnitude
  into which they have been thrown.               In the Alps there are seven, if
  not more of these great folds, each constituting a mountain chain.                  In
  a straight line across they measure about 130 miles ; but, if the strata
   were stretched out in the original planes, it is estimated that they
   would occupy a space of about 200 miles.
       Le Conte states that the coast range of California consists of at least
   five anticlines, and as many synclines so closely compressed that a width
   of 15 to 18 miles       of horizontal strata has been reduced to     6 miles.

instance on account of the magnitude of its scale.

of the Rocky Mountains which lie in Wahsatch and Uinta, estimates
that the folds there measure 40,000 feet from summit to base.* Wbat
must have been the contraction in horizontal distance where the
strata form not one but several folds, the crown of whose arches
attain height to be measured by miles

   It difficult to see how these corrugations of the earth's crust are
      is
to be accounted for, unless we assume that the crust rests on a
yielding snbstratum, and that           of no great thickness.
                                         it   is                    For     the        if
earth were solid throughout, the tangential pressure would result not
in distorting or crumpling, but in crushing and breaking. No such
results are to be seen, and the strata have, down to the time of the
youngest mountains, yielded, as only a free surface-plate could, to the
deformation caused by lateral pressure.          Freedom and independence
of motion are evident in these wonderful contortions and inversions
of the strata, and for that result a soft and yielding bed on which the
crust could move as a separate body                 is
                                               necessary.    Nor      evidence    is
wanting that such        yielding plastic bed does exist, for rising up in
                            a
the central axes are not unf requently masses of crystalline rocks, which
were then or shortly anterior in         viscid state, or else the strata are
                                              a
penetrated by    dykes    and  veins   of  igneous rocks indicating a still
greater fluidity of the broached fundamental base.
   These facts are so patent to geologists that            may seem almost
                                                                  it
superfluous to adduce them.        Let us suppose not entire solidity, but
a crust 800 miles, or even half 800 miles thick.          What would be the
magnitude of a mountain chain resulting from the crumpling and
upthrow of such a mass of rock              Where have we evidence in the
                                              ?
latest of our mountain chains of the existence of such masses                               ?
Nowhere do the disturbed and tilted strata point to a mass more than
a few miles thick, for the whole of the sedimentary and metamorphic
rocks are often nptilted, together with a portion of the molten rocks
on which they rested.      Had the crust had the more excessive thick
ness suggested by physicists and by some geologists, we should have
had mountains         not of greater height, at all events of greater
                      if
breadth    for
           ;     ifasolid plate of any kind be broken and the fractured
edges turned up by reciprocal pressure in presence of a viscid
resisting material beneath, the width of the protruding mass will
bear a definite relation to the thickness of the plate.      If, on the other
hand, the plate      sufficiently pliable to yield without fracture and be
                      is
bent into folds, the height of the arch and the width across the fold
will in like manner be proportionate to the thickness of the plate.

 Where have we evidence, even      in the most recent of mountain chains,
 when the earth was approaching its present conditions of rigidity, of
a shell of 700, or 500, or 100, or even of 50 miles thick ?       Would it
not rather appear that a crust of 30 miles is even       in excess of what
the height and breadth of any mountain chain would, on this finding,
indicate ?
   To the first part of the argument, it may be rejoined that the
existence of a thinner crust and of a fluid nucleus is not contested in
the   various geological periods, and that the conditions of solidity and
rigidity are only applicable to the globe as it at present exists.     But
the observation loses its point when we consider that the cooling must
hare been      slow and gradual throughout all time, — that the formation
of mountain chains has been intermittent with long intervals, — that
the last-formed chains show no change in the character or diminution
in the forces to which they are due, — and that there is nothing to
indicate such a sndden accession of solidity in the earth as would be
involved by the assumption of the free play of the crust during
Tertiary times and its entire rigidity now ; whilst, on the other hand,
other forms of the forces coordinate in a cooling globe still continue
in visible action.      If one form of a force dependent on a common
cause remains in operation, we are scarcely justified in assuming that
another consequence of the same cause, though dormant, is extinct.
Onr limited experience suffices to make us acquainted with the
more persistent effects, but fails to compass those which are inter
mittent.
   6.  With respect to the other analogous forces in operation now and
in times      immediately preceding our own, they likewise indicate a
yielding     substratum — although the disturbances at present caused by
them may not result in the fractures and contortions involved in
mountain-forming, and which are only the effects of prolonged and
eitreme tension.       I allude to those wide-spread movements which
result    in   great superficial or continental upheavals— movements
which,     of frequent occurrence in all geological times, have not
altogether ceased in our own times.       Our object is, however, with the
later periods only. It will be sufficient if we go back towards the
close of the Tertiary period.
   We have merely to look at a geological map of the world to see
that a very large portion of the existing continents have been under
the sea    during the Tertiary period.    South-eastern England, a large
portion of France, great part of Spain and Italy, and the whole of
 Central Europe, have, since the Eocene period, undergone movements
of elevation en masse with little disturbance to the strata over large
 areas, and these have been prolonged down to Miocene and Pliocene
 times.     In the same way the elevation above the sea of great part of
 Asia Minor and Mesopotamia is of Post-Miocene age. Nor has the

yielding of the crust during this late geological epoch been confined
to these limits.  Great parts of India, Australia, and of the seaboard
of North and South America, have been under the sea and raised at
various intervals during the whole of the Tertiary period.
   But it is not these movements — great and general as thoy were —
that so immediately concern the question before us. Our object is to
show that the flexibility of the crust, which is exhibited in all geolo
gical periods, has been continued without break and over large areas
down to the latest period, and that the older changes link on to
changes in progress in our own times — changes admitting            of a
measurement which enables us to realise their importance.
    The presence of shells of recent species at certain elevations in
Central England and Wales prove that those areas have undergone
an elevation of not less than 1400 to 1500 feet after the iuset of the
Glacial period.    Ireland and Scotland have undergone changes little
less in the same period ; and so likewise has the North American
continent.     The rock of Gibraltar has been raised 1400 feet or
more at even a later period.       The massif of Scandinavia, the Ions
coast-lines of the Pacific side of South America, have been raised
500 or 600 feet or more during the life of existing species of
Mollusca.     Over portions of the Pacific basin islands have been raised
200 to 300 feet or more, and the coasts of Arctic America and Asia
exhibit conclusive evidence of similar recent elevation.     These move
ments of elevation, which bring us down to the threshold of the
present times, link on without break in the latter areas (and many
others might be named), with the changes of level which some of those
areas are still undergoing.
    Changes of level have been ascribed by some to the change of tem
perature at depths, caused by the shifting upwards of the underground
isotherms, in proportion as the strata have increased in thickness by
the successive addition of fresh sediment.         This, as suggested by
 Babbage   and   Herschel, may  be a true  cause under  certain conditions
 of thick accumulation of strata, but must necessarily, as the expan
 sion of rocks by heat is so small, be limited to moderate vertical dis
 placement, and fails to explain the greater changes of level to which
 we have just referred, for neither in the Old nor in the New World
 do the later Tertiary strata exceed, as a rule, a thickness of 1000 to
 3000 or 4000 feet, so that the difference of temperature in the strata
 so covered up would not usually exceed 20° to 100° F., and would
 rarely attain to a rise 150° F. Supposing this to affect an underlying
 mass of rock, say 100,000 feet in depth, the effect would be to increase
 its dimensions vertically from about 10 to 100 feet only. This also is
 on the assumption that the underlying mass of rock remains stationary ;
 but  if,whilst the accumulation of strata proceeded, the area itself, as
 has usually been the case, subsided, the only effect of expansion of the

mass, unless   it all took place at once after the deposition of the over
lying strata was ended, which is impossible, would be pro tanto to
diminish the rate and extent of subsidence.           Further, alterations of
level arising from this cause are not likely to have taken place in
Glacial and Post-Glacial times, as the sedimentary matter then depo
sited was   generally limited to a few irregular masses of sand, gravel,
and  shingle, or to a few raised beaches and shell beds only a few feet
in thickness  ; while the submarine beds rarely reached a thickness of
more than 300 or 400 feet.
   The next point we have to consider is, that of the increase of tem
perature with the increase of depth.              On this, there is a general
agreement as to the fact, but a difference of opinion as to the rate of
increase and in the inferences to be drawn from the observations.         The
rate  of increase is found to differ very materially at different places,-
varying in round numbers from 30 to 100 feet for each degree F.,
or with a mean by some taken at 50 and by others at 60 feet ; and
conclusions have been drawn by some geologists from these observa
tions that the nucleus of the earth is in a state of fluidity at a depth
of 30 miles, whereas others have considered the facts not incompatible
with a crust of 800 miles or more thick.
   The variation in the rate of increase with depth is influenced not
only by the variable conductivity of the strata, but depends also upon
so many disturbing causes, that while all the observations             tend to
prove the general     fact of an increase   of   temperature  with depth, very
few can be relied upon to give an exact measure of that increase.
Notwithstanding the care taken by some of the earlier and all the
later observers against these disturbing causes, these are so numerous
and often so difficult, if not impossible to guard against, that only a
limited number of observations can be relied upon to give the exact
data required. I have gone elsewhere* into the various considerations
affecting this question, so that they need not be repeated here.            The
conclusion that I have arrived at is, that the observations that can be
best relied on show an increase of not less than 1° F. for every 48 feet
 of depth, and which thero is some reason to believe may be even more
 rapid.
    Whether or not the rate of increase diminishes or increases with
the depth is a question which requires further investigation.               The
few observations       that have been made throw little light on the
subject.    These are given in the paper before referred to. They
certainly  do  not tend to prove that there is any diminution in the
rate of increase of temperature.           There are some reasons on the
 contrary which would lead to an opposite opinion.

    The received conductivity of chalk, Rand, clay, and some sandstones,
through which so many of the bore-holes and shafts in which the
observations have been made have been carried, is low.               It has been
inferred in consequence that the isothermal lines of depth are closer
together in these rocks than they would be in the underlying crystal
line and igneous rocks, and therefore that these surface rocks give
us a more rapid rate of increase than would be found to obtain at
greater depths. But it must be remembered that in general the expe
riments on the conductivity of rocks have been made with specimens
carefully dried ; whereas all underground rocks hold a certain
quantity of water, the water of imbibition ; and further below a
certain level — that of the line of water-level — they are charged with a
further quantity of water, or the water of saturation. Every bore
hole or shaft has to do with rocks under these conditions.             Now, the
experiments     of Messrs. Herschel     and   Lebour   show     that  there     is a
remarkable difference between the conductivity of rocks in their dry
and wet state.     Thus, taking the rocks just named, these differences
are as under, k being the thermal conductivity, and r the thermal
resistance.

    It appears by this that sand, which is one of the worst conductors
when dry, becomes one of the best when wet, being only exceeded by
rock salt, vein quartz, and qnartzite ; while the average conductivity
of the three substances above named exceeds when wet (&=0-00597,
r=186) that of many igneous rocks. The average of five common
varieties of the latter gives h— 0-0524 and r=196; with five varieties
of granite the average is &=0'00584 and r=173, and taking
together several varieties of Palaeozoic limestones Zs=0'00572 and
r=177.
    Experiments on wet chalk, oolite, and coal-measure sandstones are
wanting, but as the water of imbibition of these several rocks is as
under, it is to be inferred that when wet their conductivity would be
raised in proportion with that of the others : —

    On the other hand, the harder crystalline and igneous rocks imbibe
but little water : —

    Then, again, the conductivity, even when dry, of the "ganister"
and other hard Coal-measure sandstones is found to be higher than that
of either the metamorphic or igneous rocks, averaging for four varieties
A=0 00737, r=136.
    It seems, therefore, probable that the unaltered sedimentary strata
are often, under their normal underground conditions, as good, if not
better, conductors of heat than the crystalline and igneous rocks
which constitute the greater proportion of the solid crnst of the earth,
and, if so, the thermometric gradient would rather tend to become
more rapid in passing from the former into the latter than otherwise.
    But there is another cause which when the subject comes to be
more fnlly investigated will have to be considered — that is, the change
of conductivity produced by heat.           Forbes found that the conduc
tivity of iron varied with the temperature as under : —
                       0° C                          0 0133
                    100    „                         0 0107
                    200    „                         0 0082
    This shows a percentage decrement of the decrease of conductivity
of iron between 0° and 100* C. of 24-5, which agrees nearly, according
to Professor Tait, with the empirical law that the conductivity is
inversely as the temperature.        Looking at other physical properties
which the    metals   and   rocks have in common, it is not improbable that
they may have also this other property, although, no doubt, in a very
modified form.       It is the more probable, inasmuch as the proportion
of iron present in the igneous rocks (commonly 10 to 15 per cent.) is
larger in those which are supposed to be the more deeply seated ;
 while considering how largely the density of the mass of the earth
 is in excess of the density of the crust, there is reason to believe
 that the proportion of the metals increases with the depth.           This
 would produce an important effect on the thermometric gradient.
     A large number of the observations on temperatures at depths
 have been conducted in carboniferous strata consisting largely of
 sandstones of high conductivity;        and others through chalk, clays,
 and sands of which the conductivity becomes high when wet, — and
 wet they must be at even small depths beneath the surface.          On the
 other hand, the crystalline and igneous rocks are so hard and compact
  and absorb so little water, that their conductivity can be little
  influenced by this cause.
                                                                 m 2

166                         Prof.   J.  Prestwich.
    After eliminating those observations where the results are affected
by some of the various causes of interference, it would appear that
 the sedimentary rocks in situ do not possess a lesser power of conduc
 tion than the igneous and crystalline rocks which underlie them, so
 that the rate of increase of temperature need not on this account be
less rapid.    This is especially a conclusion which may be drawn from
 the deep (4172 English feet) and remarkable boring of Sperenberg,
where the bore-hole first passed through not quite 300 feet of gypsum,
 and then entirely through rock salt of which the conductivity is
extremely high (0'0128), exceeding that of any other rock ; never
theless, the rate of increase is 51"5 feet per degree F.*         Had it been
a rock of lesser conductivity the rate of increase could hardly be
otherwise than more rapid.
    Assuming a uniform rate of 1° F. for every 48 or 50 feet of depth,
the heat at a depth of 28 to 30 miles would be such as to fuse the
basic rocks, and this has often been taken as a measure of the
probable thickness of the earth's crust.         But there is the uncertainty
just named whether the rate may not increase, while the phenomena
before named indicate that this even is too great a thickness to be in
accordance with observed geological facts ?
                                                     I
    May it not also be a question whether, as have before suggested,-
the intense cold of the Glacial period has not so affected the outer
layers of the earth's crust that to a certain depth the rate of cooling
is now abnormally slow, owing to the excessive refrigeration the shell
then underwent. If that be the case, would not the rate of increase
of temperature at greater depths be more rapid than that which our
observations on the chilled layers have led us to assume, so that the
thickness of the crust might be even less than the 28 to 30 miles just
named ? Such a conclusion would be more in harmony with geological
phenomena, as we shall proceed further to show.
    The third objection to a thick crust is the difficulty of reconciling
such a condition of things with the effects of volcanic action.          This
branch of the subject may be divided into the phenomena connected —
 lstly, with recent volcanoes ; 2ndly, with the great ontwellings of
 trappean rocks during the later Tertiary period ; and, 3rdly, with the
 character of the changes of level in the areas so affected.
    The first point relates especially to the apparent impossibility of a
column of lava traversing a crust 800 to 1000 miles thick in con
sequence of the enormous pressure required, and without the loss of
so much heat in such a length of passage as to cause the lava to lose
its fluidity and consolidate before it could reach the surface.
    To meet this difficulty Mr. Hopkins suggested that the solid crust
contained at various depths beneath the surface cavities filled with

 fluid incandescent matter, either entirely insulated or perhaps com
municating in some cases by obstructed channels, and that in these
subterranean molten lakes the volcanic foci originate.*
    To this view it is to be objected that the variation in depth from
the surface, and the existence of separate molten lakes is not com
patible with the singular uniformity as a rule of the volcanic rocks
over the whole globe ; again, lakes would be required co-extensive with
large continental areas, and therefore there seems no object in the
limitation ; while further on this hypothesis there would seem to be
no available cause for the extrusion of the lava other (but applying
with greater force) than that assigned by Mr. Scrope, the objections
to which I have already named.
    Again, the enormous outwellings of trappean and volcanic rocks
which took place at intervals during the Tertiary period and con
tinued down to Quaternary times, afford evidence of the existence of
a fluid magma underlying the solid crust, co-extensive not only with
the existing volcanic outbursts, but also with these older eruptions,
and spread the volcanic phenomena over areas so large and so nume-
rons that it is difficult to conceive their isolation as separate and
independent local igneous centres.f
    In this country the great basaltic plateau of the North of Ireland
is 600 to 800 feet thick, and extends over an area of about 100O square
miles ; those of Western Scotland are of about the same extent,
and it is certain that both had, before the coast denudations,              a
much wider range.           In Central France there is a still wider basaltic
area of yet more recent date. There are others of great extent in
 Hungary and in Central Italy. They cover also large tracts in Asia
 Minor, Africa, New Zealand, Australia, and America. But to confine
 ourselves to two instances on a grand scale we may take the great
 plateaux of Central India and of North-west America.
     In India these plateaux stretch for a distance of 500 to GOO miles
from north to south, and 300 to 400 miles from east to west, covering,
according to the reports of the Indian Survey, an enormous area of
not less than 200,000 square miles.J They have a general thickness
of from 2000 to 3000 feet, and it is estimated that the total thickness
of all the beds amounts to not less than 7000 feet. They are of late
Cretaceous or early Eocene date, and consist of a succession of beds
spread, no doubt, over a long period of time.
     In North America vast sheets of basaltic rocks form the high
plateau of Utah, while on the Pacific slopes immense regions have

been flooded by outpourings from fissures at successive      times  from
the close of the Miocene down to the (Quaternary period.    In Columbia
these basaltic rocks have a thickness of from 1000 to 3000 feet, and in
parts of Colorado of not less than 4000 feet, and they stretch over a
tract some 700 to 800 miles in length by 80 to 150 miles in width,
and cover 120,000 to 150,000 square miles of surface.
   Extensive as are the ejections of some volcanoes at the present
day, and vast as are some of the individual lava streams, the sum
total is small compared with these older extrusions. Lyell instances
as amongst the most remarkable of the modern lava streams that
formed during the eruption of Skaptan Jokul, in Iceland, in 1783.
He states that it formed two branches of the relative lengths of 50
and 45 miles, and of the extreme breadths of from 12 to 15 miles,
and of   7.  Taking the mean breadth, we have an area of 500 square
miles covered by the lava of this eruption, with an ordinary thickness
of about 100 feet, and an occasional one, when it filled gorges, of 600
feet.
   But we have no means of judging of the single flows of geological
times  ; we can only take the total areas covered by recent volcanic
eruptions, and compare them with the old basaltic outpourings. The
two most extensive modern volcanic surfaces are those of Hawaii and
Iceland. The thickness of the masses at the centre of eruption pro
bably exceeds, though the average of the whole mass is certainly
below, the thickness of the basaltic beds in the cases named above, but
the areas covered by the volcanic materials show very different
measures.     The area of Hawaii is about 3800 square miles and is
entirely  volcanic, and that of Iceland is 37,800 square miles, of which
the volcanic beds are said to occupy about one-third to one-half.      At
the outside,   therefore, the modern eruptions are spread over no area
larger than 20,000 square miles, or an area only equal to one-tenth
and one-seventh of the old Indian and American basaltic areas.
   Now, if these vast erupted masses had been derived from local
molten lakes of moderate size and moderate depths, the extrava
sation must have caused a diminution in their masses which, as the
loss could not be made good by drafts from adjoining areas, must
necessarily have led to a caving in and subsidence of the crust above
these lakes proportionate to the mass of the extravasated matter.
But so far from this being the case, the areas of these great basaltic
outwellings are almost always areas of elevation.      The basaltic area
of the Deccan forms vast plateaux which attain a height of between
4000 to 5000 feet, and although the intercalated sedimentary strata
are mostly of land and freshwater origin, there is reason to believe
from the circumstances that on the borders of the same district some
of the associated beds contain estuarine remains, that the area was
immediately prior to the eruption not much above the sea-level.

             On  the  Agency   of Water in Volcanic Eruptions.              169
    In America also the basaltic plateaux rise gradually to heights of
 from 2000, 3000, and 4000 feet, and in some cases even attain the
height of 11,000 feet or more.        Similar evidence, though on a much
smaller scale,    is afforded by the basaltic plateaux of Ireland and
Scotland, of Central France, and of other countries which form rela
tively to the surrounding districts more or less elevated tablelands,
raised above the sea-level mostly in Tertiary and many in very late
Tertiary times.
   It is impossible to attribute the elevation of these vast flattened
domes to any secondary causes, such as expansion by heat of strata
undergoing subsidence by transmission of the isothermals.            The differ
ence of level is, as before explained, too great.         Besides, the crust in
these areas must on the whole, so far from gaining in any part, suffer
a considerable     loss of heat by the very circumstance that the heat
brought by the lava to the surface is lost by radiation. There would,
therefore, be every cause for depression of the crust were the molten
lakes local and independent.          These areas of eruption are, on the
contrary, areas of elevation     — not as in mountain chains by lateral
sqneezing and an upward thrust along narrow anticlinal lines, but by
elevation en masse of wide portions of the earth's crust possibly
accompanied by fracture but without, necessarily, contortion.
   We have, therefore, in the discharge of volcanic matter prima facie
evidence of the existence of molten matter beneath the surface, and,
in the domed elevation of the surface, of a yielding substratum, fluid
or viscid, underlying the solid strata.         Further, it follows from the
fact of the upheaval that the igneous rock ejected is not only replaced,
but that it is replaced by a quantity larger than that which is lost by
extravasation.      This could only be effected by supplies from adjacent
areas of similar matter — in other words, it indicates that there must
be a common fluid or viscid substratum, yielding to depression in
some areas, and to upheaval in others, the loss in the one case being
counterbalanced by an addition and centralisation in others.             Apart
from the great movements which raised the basaltic area of the Deccan,
 Dr. Blanford* states that in the Indian Peninsula there is evidence
 bringing down movements of elevation to the extent of 100 to 200
 feet to so late a period as the old raised beaches (of Pleistocene age)
 that, on the other hand, the presence of the Maldive, Laccadive, and
 Chagos groups of atolls and coral reefs in the sea to the south-west,
 points to slow depression ; and that there is unmistakeable proof of a
 recent sinking of the land on the Arabian coast near the mouth of
 the Persian Gulf.      There is evidence also of recent depression in the
 Delta of the Ganges and of the Mississippi, and probably in that of
 the Indus.
    Though attended     with more uncertainty, there is reason to believe,

 aa suggested      by Darwin, that great coral areas of the Indian and
  Pacific Oceans have long been areas of subsidence,* while adjoining
 volcanic areas have been areas of elevation. In some cases areas,
 once areas of depression, hare become areas of elevation, as in the
 instances of some coral islands, which, though formed during periods
 of depression, have been since raised above the waters to heights of
 from 200 to 300 feet or more.
    In conclusion, I may point to the imposing spectacle afforded by
 the slow secular upheaval of the vast tracts of Arctic lands on the
 shores of North America and Asia — an area of elevation so extensive
 that it embraces almost all the land bordering the Polar Seas.                This
 elevation has in comparatively modern times raised the land from
 100 to 400 feet above the present sea-level, and is still, in our own
 times, in visible action over a superficial area ext#iding in some
 directions, for thousands of miles.
                     § 7. Primary Cause of Volcanic Action.
    If  water only plays a secondary part in volcanic action, and the
 presence of the vapour of water in the volcanic foci be not the
 primary cause of the expulsion of the lava, to what other cause is
                          I
 it to be attributed ? see none but a modification of the old hypothesis,
 namely, that of the contraction of solid crust upon a yielding and
 hot nucleus.      The objection to this hypothesis rested mainly on the
fact that   if, as  was at that time assumed, the whole nucleus beneath
the solid crust consisted of a molten fluid, it would be subject to tides
that would lessen or neutralise the surface tides. I might also suggest
as a further reason that there could be no local deformations on a
continental scale : — the pressure caused by local squeezings would be
dissipated through the entire mass and lost.             Sir William Thomson
and the late Mr. Hopkins           have   clearly proved that the earth pos
sesses a rigidity perfectly incompatible with a fluid nucleus.             At the
same time, objections have           been   taken  by other physicists to the
hypothesis     of an  entirely solid  globef  on the  grounds, amongst others,
that the question has been dealt with on the assumption of a perfect
fluid, and that not sufficient allowance has been made for friction.
    Nor are those views so incompatible as might at first sight appeal-.
The questions connected with the surface tides are not yet settled.
Admitting an extreme rigidity of the crust, it has not yet been
proved that notwithstanding this rigidity, the crust is quite free
   * This has been contested. There are no doubt instances of reefs formed without
subsidence, but for the depths of the Pacific Darwin's hypothesis best answers all
the conditions.

from the influence of some slight disturbances — sufficient, however,
for the purposes of our contention.
    For the geological argument, neither a perfectly fluid substratum
nor a molten nucleus are required. The hypothesis of a central solid
nucleus seems to me to be the only one compatible with geological
phenomena.       All that is required for the conditions of geological
phenomena is that on this solid nucleus there should be a molten
yielding envelope — not fluid, but viscid or plastic ; nor is it necessary
that it should be of any great thickness, but a thin crnst is, geologi
cally, an essential condition. The relative proportions of the two are,
however, questions for physicists. The late M. Roche did attempt a
solution based on the astronomical and physical conditions of the
problem. Assuming the earth to consist of a solid centre with a
density of about 7"0, and of an outer layer consisting of a fluid sub-
stratum with a solid crust, and having a mean density of 3"0. he
found that the outer layers should have a maximum thickness equal
to one-sixth of the earth's radius, or 660 miles, but he left the question
of their possible minimum thickness open to other considerations.
    The considerations I have already urged, in conjunction with the
results of other independent physical investigations, would lead me
to assign lesser dimensions to this combined thickness of the outer
layers. On geological grounds the solid crust at all events need not
have a thickness of even 20 miles ; while, on the same grounds, the
dimensions required for the underlying molten layer to place it in con
cordant relation with the ascertained mobility of the crust during the
later geological periods, is that it should be a mass sufficiently large
for the play of movements such as would come within the compass of
continental (not mountain) elevations and depressions ; and for this
object and for the purposes of vulcanicity a molten layer, having a
thickness measured not by hundreds, but by tens of miles, would
fulfil the necessary conditions.
    It is quite possible, as suggested by Scrope, that owing to pressure
the fusion-point of lava at great depths is so much higher than at
 the surface, that the lava may, and possibly does, exist at depths in a
 viscid or plastic state, and only becomes fluid as it rises to the surface
and the pressure is removed.       This state of viscidity accords with the
excessively slow rate of movement and steadiness of the great con
 tinental elevations and depressions, — changes in close relation one
 with another, and which may arise from the slow transference from
 one area to another of a partially resisting plastic medium within con
 fined limits.
    I cannot conceive such a transference to be effected unless that the
 molten layer were of moderate thickness, so that when locally com
 pressed between the outer solid crust and the inner solid nucleus, that
  portion of the magma subjected to pressure would expand laterally

172                         Prof.    J. Prestwich.
and the mass displaced would be transferred to that part of the
adjacent area where the outer crust would yield most readily to
deformation and upheaval.         If the matter displaced were not confined
between resisting surfaces, or if the molten layer were of indefinite
thickness or of extreme fluidity, the effect would not be local, bnt
would extend as far as the liquidity of the mass allowed of the
transmission of the displaced matter, so that it would tend to become
attenuated and lost in the larger volume of which it became part. The
result is, in fact, a condition dependent on the measure of viscidity.
   A compression in one part should, therefore, be followed by expan
sion in another, and by a deformation of the crust over couterminous
areas.   These effects are exhibited in the great continental upheavals
and depressions so rife in the times immediately preceding our own,
and still in a measure of perceptible action over a large part of the
world ; as, for example, in the instance of the slow uplifting of the
northern portions of the Scandinavian and Greenland peninsulas, and
the subsidence of their southern portions, while further south again
in Labrador the land has been rising.
   This constitutes the essential difference between the disturbances
connected with mountain- and volcano-forming.                They both result
from the contraction due to secular refrigeration, but the one is a
process of excessive lateral compression, and the other of turgid
swelling of the crust, for all active volcanoes are on raised sedi
mentary strata. In both cases there is tension, although of a different
character.   In the latter it is slow, steady, and uniform in its action, and
where there are permanent points of comparatively slight resistance,
as in volcanic ducts, it then readily finds relief in the expulsion of the
lava, which is only prolonged until the equilibrium is restored; then
the eruption ceases and the volcano lapses into a state of rest, only to
be broken when again there has been an accumulation of the necessary
energy.
   The agency of water is confined to the secondary effects I have
described — effects perfectly independent of the forces which produce
the extravasation of the lava; and while, with the thinner crust of former
times, there would be a more frequent extrusion of the igneous rocks,
there is probably, with the thicker crust of the present day and its
greater resistance, larger stores of underground water and greater
explosive eruptions.
   In connexion with this     subject, it is a noticeable fact that volcanoes,
although   not entirely confined    to a definite zone, are far more numerous
within 50° lat. N. and S. than beyond those limits, while in the
northern hemisphere there are, with one exception, none beyond the
Arctic circle ; whereas it is beyond that circle, and where we may
suppose the crust of the earth to be thickest, that the great continental
movements of upheaval are now most active and maintained.

   The loss of terrestrial heat by radiation is now exceedingly small.
But small   as this loss is, it cannot take place without producing con
traction, and Cordier long since calculated that supposing five volcanic
eruptions to take place annually, it would take a century to eject so
much lava as would shorten the radius of the earth to the extent of
1 mm., or about        inch.
   I therefore conclude that the hypothesis originally propounded,
namely, that volcanic phenomena are dependent on the effect of
secular refrigeration        is,

  The differences of opinion among pathologists as to the relation of
certain micro-organisms, — and more especially of a curved bacillus
described by Koch — to Cholera Asiatiea, led to our being deputed
last summer, by the Association for the Promotion of Research in
Medicine, acting in conjunction with the Royal Society and University
of Cambridge, to proceed to Spain to make further investigations on
the subject.
   In Madrid we were able to make autopsies on twenty-five typical
cases of cholera, the post-mortem examinations being made in many of
them either immediately after death or within very few hours of it.
Our attention was at first directed chiefly to the relation of the comma
bacillus of Koch to Cholera Asiatiea. Early in our inquiries we were
struck by the fact that Koch's comma bacillus         not discoverable in
                                                          is
the intestinal contents of all cases of cholera. We employed much time
and care in the examination of thin dried films of the mucous flakes
and fluid contained in the intestine, these films being stained by
methods which we knew to be well fitted to show the comma bacillus
if  that micro-organism were present. Such films from one or two
fatal cholera cases showed that the intestinal contents contained
enormously larger numbers of comma bacilli than of other parasites.
In some of the cases the comma bacillus, though certainly present,
was not the most marked feature in the preparation, and in certain of
these cases we were only able to find these bacilli after prolonged
and careful searching. In many cases of undoubted Cholera Asiatiea
where death oceurred before the reaction stage had set in, we were
 unable to detect comma bacilli in any of the films or cultures prepared
 from the intestinal contents taken from different parts of the alimen
 tary canal.

    We made also an enormous number of plate cultivations in gelatine
and agar-agar, the cultivating media employed being prepared in the
manner recommended by Koch.          These cultures gave results corre
sponding with those obtained from examination of the dried films
above referred to. In a few cases the majority of the colonies which
grew in the gelatine were composed of comma bacilti. In others these
were comparatively few in number, while in many of our plate cul
tures from the intestinal contents no colonies of comma bacilli pre
sented themselves.     The results both of the examination of films and
of the plate cultures from the contents of the intestines are therefore
opposed to the facts obtained by Koch.        We do not think that the
complete   absence  of the  comma  bacillus  in  the films and cultures of
many of our cases can be explained by want of due care on our
part.
   When we came to the preparation and examination of sections of
the wall  of the intestine, the results we obtained were also different
from those described by Koch.       The tissues intended for histological
examination were placed in absolute alcohol while the autopsy was
being made, and the staining method which we chiefly employed was
that used by Koch with methylene-blue, which method in our expe
rience is well fitted to show the comma bacillus when it is present in
the tissues.
   Only in a few of our cases did we find the bacillus in question
situated  in the substance of the mucous membrane of the intestine,
and in these cases it was present either in or close to the tubular
glands of Lieberkiihn or else close to the free surface of the mucous
membrane.      The situation of the bacilli in these cases was such as led
us to the belief that it might easily have penetrated the epithelium
either after death or in the few hours preceding death. In the great
majority of our cases careful and conscientious search did not enable
us to discover any comma bacilli in the mucous membrane of the in
testine, nor indeed in any of the tissues or organs which we examined.
Under these circumstances we did not think it necessary to make
special investigations on the pathogenic effects of the comma bacillus
when administered to the lower animals.         We have not been able to
convince    ourselves  that  the pathogenic effects which Koch, Van
Ermengem, and others find to result when comma bacilli are given
to certain animals are identical with the phenomena which charac
terise Cholera Asiatica in man.
   Further, the complete absence of comma bacilli, both in the contents
of the intestine and in the tissue of many of our cases, makes it
impossible for us to accept Koch's views as to the causal relation of
the bacillus in question with Cholera Asiatica.
   At the same time we do not think that sufficient evidence has been
adduced to prove satisfactorily that Koch's comma bacillus is identical

  either with that described by Finkler and Prior as having been ob
 tained from cases of Cholera nostras, or with those other forms of
  curved bacilli which have been found in the mouths of healthy per
  sons, decayed teeth, cheese, &c.   That it is pathogenic scarcely admits
  of doubt, in view of the evidence    given by Koch and V. Ermengem.
  The view, however, that it is to be looked upon as the direct cause of
  cholera is, we think, incompatible with the results we obtained, as re
  ferred to above. Many points of similarity between Koch's and
  Finkler and Prior's comma bacillus, and the relation between the
  latter and Cholera nostras, have led us to consider the possibility of the
  former of the two being the cause of the so-called premonitory diar
  rhoea which is so frequently, if not constantly found accompanying
 epidemics of Asiatic cholera.      The frequency with which the comma
 bacillus of Koch is to be found in cases of cholera makes it, we
 think, almost certain that it has some relation to the disease in ques
 tion. That the so-called premonitory diarrhoea of cholera cannot be
 looked upon as a mild form of Asiatic cholera we feel convinced from
 our own observations in Spain. At the same time we think it must be
 looked upon as a predisposing cause of Asiatic cholera. It seems to us
 by no means improbable that Koch's comma bacillus may be the cause
 of this so-called premonitory diarrhoea, and that its frequent presence
 in fatal cholera cases may be due to true cholera having supervened.
 Unfortunately while in Spain our researches were not sufficiently com
 plete to enable us to decide that Koch's comma bacillus could not be
 looked upon as the direct cause of cholera, and our attention, there
fore, was not directed to the question of its being found in the
 dejecta of persons suffering from the so-called premonitory diar
 rhoea.   This is a question which we believe well worthy of further
investigation.
    As to the straight bacilli obtained by Emmerich from the blood and
organs of fatal cholera cases, our results, by use of similar methods to
those employed by Emmerich, do not enable us to confirm those of
that observer. The cultivating media in which we placed drops of
blood, or portions of the kidney, liver, and other organs from cholera
cases, remained sterile.    We cannot, therefore, accept the bacillus of
Emmerich as the cause of Cholera Asiatica, and see no difficulty in
explaining the pathogenic effects which he observed on introduction
of his bacillus into certain of the lower animals as being due to a
form of Septicaemia.
    The straight bacillus described by Klein in his Report of the
Indian Cholera Commission, is much smaller than that found by
Emmerich ; and we know of no reason for believing the two to be
identical. As Klein has not claimed for the bacillus found by him
any causal relation to cholera, we need only say here that we have noi
been able to recognise it in any of our preparations.

   The pleomorphism of the comma bacillus which Ferran described
in his article in the " Zeitschr. f. Klin. Med." of last year, and the
method of inoculation for protection against cholera, largely employed
in Spain, attracted onr attention while in that country. We had an
opportunity of examining with the microscope the cultures sent, at
the request of the Government, from Ferran's laboratory, to be em
ployed in inoculating troops.    These cultures were under the care of
agents duly authorised by Ferran. We found them to contain several
forms of bacilli and micrococci, but we did not discover either comma
bacilli or any of the peronospora-like bodies described by Ferran to be
present in his protective inoculation fluid. We need only say further
that the facts which came to our knowledge regarding the protective
power of Ferran's inoculations are by no means in accordance with the
statements made by that observer.      The inoculation of such fluids as
we saw in the hands of Ferran's agents must expose the recipient
to serious peril of septiceemic infection.    The theory, moreover, on
which Ferran's system is    based, e.g., that one attack of cholera pro
tects against a second attack of the same disease, is entirely opposed
to the facts which came under our notice in Spain. As, however, we
did not personally meet with Dr. Ferran, we have no right to affirm
that the cultivations when they left his hands were impure ; we believe
indeed that the small swellings described by him in cultivating the
comma bacillus under certain conditions — and which are found in the
course of the spirillum — rest upon correct enough observations. They
have been seen by others, and are apparently degenerative changes.
Large peronospora forms described by Ferran we knew of no reason
to accept as being possible modifications of the comma bacillus.
   With regard to the macro- and micro-scopic morbid changes to be
found in fatal cholera cases, our observations are completely in accord
with the classical description given by Strauss, Nocard, Roux, and
Thuiller.   With regard to the comma bacillus, the observations of
Strauss, in which he was unable to satisfy himself of the causal rela
tion between the comma bacillus of Koch and Asiatic cholera are also
fully accordant with our own investigations.
   Although specially commissioned to investigate the relation be
tween Koch's comma bacillus and Asiatic cholera, we naturally turned
our attention to the pathology of the disease as well as to its etiology.
   That the hypersecretion from the mucous membrane of the stomach
and intestines in cases of cholera is not due to catarrh, is abundantly
shown both by the chemical characters of the dejecta of cholera and
by the absence in the mucous membrane, on examination after death,
of the anatomical     changes which occur in catarrh.        That it is
not due to any irritant present in the contents of the intestine
we think may safely be concluded from the absence of necrosis
(ulceration), as well as the absence of any well- mat ked inflammatory

                    On  the Pathology    of Cholera Asiatica.             177
change     in the mucosa.     The experiments of Moreau, who found well-
marked hypersecretion        of the mucous membrane of the small intes
tine,   resulting from section of its nerves, seems to us to have a very
important bearing on the pathology of the disease in question.            The
chemical characters of the fluid so abnndantly secreted during the few
first hours following section of the nerves of the isolated loop of in
testine are, as shown by Ktlhne, practically identical with those of the
dejecta of cholera cases.        That the hypersecretion from the intestine
in cholera, with the more or less complete arrest of the power of ab
sorption by the mucosa, is the cause of the thickening of the blood
and the drying of the tissues there can be little doubt.          Everything
sb us to point towards the assumption           that the chief symptoms and
signs    of  cholera,  as  well  as  the  frequent fatal termination of that
disease, is due to the escape of fluid from the vessels into the intes
tine.    The pathology of cholera is therefore centred in the question
as to what is the cause of this intestinal secretion          and diminished
power of absorption.        We have repeated Moreau's experiments more
than once with the view of observing for ourselves how far the fluid
contained in the isolated loop of the intestine resembles the intestinal
contents of fatal cholera cases.         The results of these experiments are
such as to impress us strongly with the conviction that the- characters
of the paralytic secretion following section of the nerves to the intes
tine are practically identical with those of the contents of the intestine
in cases of cholera.       With regard to the question whether or not the
epithelium covering the free surface of the mucosa is simply less
firmly attached than in the normal intestine, or whether it be actually
detached before death, our observations tend on the whole towards
the first-named of the two possibilities.
    The pathology of cholera, we are of opinion, can be best explained
by some cause acting on the glands or nerves of the intestine, and
producing effects similar to those which result from paralysis of the
intestinal nerves. This conclusion makes it probable that the cause of
 the disease, if discoverable      by the microscope, is to be found either
 in the mucosa itself, in the nerves running in the mesentery, or in
 the ganglia from which those nerves proceed.
    Soon after our return from Spain our inability to confirm Koch's
 views as to the causal relation of the comma bacillus to cholera in
 duced us to look with care for any other parasite,           the presence of
 which might be supposed capable of causing the disease in question.
 In the course of this work, which occupied many months, we observed
 in sections of the intestinal wall, prepared and stained in the different
 ways which we thought best fitted to make evident any micro
  organisms present in the tissue, granules the characters of which
  arrested our attention.       These granules, which vary much in size,
  were for the most part smaller than the nuclei of the surrounding

 178             Messrs. Roy, Brown, and Sherrington.
cells — which they resembled in the degree to which they were stained
with fnchsine, methylene-blue, and other aniline dyes — that they had
one or more processes proceeding from them, we were always able to
observe ; but these processes, being unstained, conld not be followed
by us in the tissues.     It was only where in a specimen of a kidney we
saw several of these granules lying in the lymph space outside the
membrana propria of a convoluted tubule that we could see against
the clear background the arrangement of the filaments which we had
noticed proceed from the granules in other specimens.             We could
then see that delicate filaments connected the granules one with
another in a manner so striking that the possibility was forced on us
of the structure in question being a vegetal parasite.          As we our
selves know no more regarding the morphology of the lower vegetal
micro-organisms than is known ordinarily to the pathologist, we
judged it best to show the specimen to Mr. Vines and Mr. Gardiner,
whom we thought well fitted to assist us in the question whether or
no we had before us a vegetal parasite, and if so of what kind.
They at once informed us that forms such as the one we showed them
were characteristic of the Chytridiaceoa, an order which includes
many rapidly growing and virulent parasites of vegetables.          They in
formed us, moreover, that they should not expect the envelope of such
parasites to give the ordinary cellulose reactions; and also that in
their opinion some method of staining in methylene-blue wonld be
found best fitted to differentiate such a micro-organism from the sur
rounding tissues. The necessity which we felt of finding some method
which would stain the mycelium-like threads of this structure before
its presence could be demonstrated in the tissues of cholera cases, led
ns to spend much time experimenting with the different methods of
staining in methylene-blue which we thought might be of use for this
purpose. After many failures, we found that it was possible, bv using
a method almost identical with that of Loffler, to stain with methy
lene-blue the micro-organism in question, although even with this
method considerable care is required to stain satisfactorily the fila
ments of which it is partly composed.        When observed in a success
fully  stained  preparation,  it is impossible to doubt that the structures
referred to are parasitic, which will, we believe, be admitted on
examination of the specimens which we show at this meeting.              The
difficulty of staining the parasite satisfactorily, and the fact that, so far
as we know, Loffler's method has not been employed to stain sections
of tissues taken from fatal cholera cases, sufficiently explains to our
minds why a parasite having so striking a form could have been over
looked by the many competent observers who have sought for micro -
parasites in the tissues of fatal cholera cases. That its presence in our
specimens could not be explained by accidental contamination after
removing the tissues from th e body we have satisfied ourselves by

                 On    the   Pathology   of Cholera Asiatica.                       179

 wall and  of the other organs are placed in absolute alcohol, and all the
 fluids through which the tissue and sections required to be passed for
 the purpose of cutting, staining, &c, well boiled and protected from the
 invasion of vegetable organisms by boiling and the addition of thymol.
    The micro-organism which we find in our specimens from cholera
 cases is composed of terminal or nodal swellings connected by fila
 ments varying greatly in thickness, and showing no differentiation
 into component cells.

land j'joil immersion).
    Frequently also we have seen exceedingly fine filaments extending
from the granules, like those which form so marked         characteristic
                                                                    a

granules and filaments take on the colouring matter to a fairly equal
degree, although with fuchsine, followed by diluted nitric acid, the
filaments become decolorised       before the granules.    The globular
enlargements referred to vary in size from knot-like swellings on the
mycelium, causing simply an inequality in the thickness of the latter,
to bodies as large and in some cases even larger than the nuclei of the
surrounding cells. In this abstract, in which we cannot give satisfac
tory illustrations, we need not say more regarding the morphology of
the parasite than that     diners considerably in appearance in different

unstained and stained spaces or bodies in the grannies and mycelium,
which suggest the possibility of spores being present.          The deve
lopment    of  zoosporangia   from  the terminal   granules,  such   as are
described in some forms of the Chytridiace®, we have never seen in
our specimens.       In every one of our twenty-five cases of Asiatic
cholera we have found a parasite having the above-described charac
ters lying in the mucous membrane of the intestine.          It is found at
various depths of the mucosa, its distance from the free surface, the
absence of other micro-organisms, and the precautions taken to pre
vent post-mortem contamination, make it evident that it must have
been present there during life. We find, moreover, that the luxuriance
of its growth goes, speaking very roughly, hand in hand with the
degree of the histological changes in the structure of the mucous
membrane, which are found unequally distributed in the mucosa of
the small intestine in fatal cholera cases.      In some of our cases we
have found it in or between the epithelial cells of the tubular glands
of the intestine.
   As to its presence in other organs and tissues, we have satisfied our
selves of its presence in the kidney in some of our cases.          That it
occurs in the blood-vessels in some cases we have also convinced
ourselves, and think it possible that the filaments and bodies described
by Strauss as growing from the blood corpuscles may have been the
micro-organism which is above described.
   The time required for the successful staining of this micro
organism has prevented us as yet from making a systematic examina
tion of the kidney and other organs in all of our cholera cases, so that
we are not at present in a position to say in what organs besides
the mucous membrane of the small intestine it is frequently or
constantly present. We have seen it, however, both in the liver and
kidneys, as well as in the intestinal wall. As to the question whether
this parasite can be cultivated artificially, our observations are
unfortunately very unsatisfactory. While in Spain we made a very
large number of cultivations from the contents of the intestine, from
the blood and tissues, but found it impossible to investigate the life
history of all the micro-parasites which we encountered.       Our a priori
belief was that the parasitic cause of cholera, if it exist (which we
thought exceedingly probable), must belong to the class of the
Schizomycetes.       Our attention, therefore, was almost exclusively
directed to the bacilli, bacteria, and micrococci, which grew in our
plate cultivations, other micro-organisms receiving little or no atten
tion.    We may, very possibly, have grown the parasite which we
afterwards found in the wall of the intestine, passing it over, however,
as being a very improbable cause of the disease.      It appears to us by
no means necessary that this micro-organism will grow readily in the
alkaline cultivating media which Koch found best suited for his

            Speedy Volumetric  Determination   of Carbonic Acid.     181
 comma bacillus, and we would suggest to future observers that
possibly acid media may be found better suited for the growth of this
parasite.      As to whether the micro-organism is frequently or con
stantly present in the contents of the intestine, our cultivations as
above-mentioned are of no value.            Nor does our examination of
stained films enable us to speak definitely for or against the presence
of this parasite. In the intestinal contents or the dejecta of cholera
cases, we have seen appearances which resembled in many points the
characters of the micro-organism in question ; none of our films,
however, show structures which are unmistakeably identical with
those found by us in the substance of the mucous membrane.
   We have only to add that not having cultivated this micro-organism
artificially, we claim no right to say that it is the cause of Asiatic
cholera. All we have to say is, that we have found it present in
certain tissues of all the cholera cases which we had the opportunity of
examining. Further investigation must decide whether or not it can
be looked upon as the direct cause of the disease.
" An     Instrument for the Speedy Volumetric Determination
       of Carbonic Acid."        By William Marcet, M.D., F.R.S.
       Received June 9. Read June 10. Revised by the Author
       June    29, 1886.
                                  [Plate 2.]
   The principle of this instrument is the absorption of carbonic acid
in a closed receiver by potassium hydrate, and the accurate measure
ment of the volume of dry atmospheric air required to re-establish
the atmospheric pressure after complete absorption. The volume of
air used for that purpose will exactly correspond to that of the car-
bonic acid gas absorbed.      It is obvious that whatever be the reading
of the barometer, the volume of air corresponding to that of the
carbonic acid absorbed, will give the correct proportion of carbonic
acid in the air submitted to analysis ; but to obtain the weight of the
gas present, and its proportion by weight, it will be necessary to
reduce both the volumes of air analysed and of carbonic acid found
to their volume at 0° (C), and under a pressure of 760 mm. of
mercury. Hence the necessity of recording the height of the baro
meter at the time of the experiment, or one reading may suffice for
a number of determinations.
   The instrument resembles two small gasometers, and consists of two
tanks and two bell- jars, or air-holders, each of the latter being made
to hold half a cubic foot of air. The bell-jars hang on a metallic cord
which connects them with each other, and passes over two pulleys,

 182                   Dr. W. Marcet.      On the
allowing the bell-jars to be moved up and down alternately in the
tanks. The inside of the bell-jars communicates with the outside air
by means of a U'8naPe(i iron pipe, one limb of which opens inside the
 bell-jar above the fluid it contains, and the other outside on a some
what lower level for sake of convenience.         The tanks or troughs
contain glycerine, over which floats a layer of almond oil an inch or
two in thickness, and filling approximately the trough. The opening
of the pipe above the surface of the oil enters loosely, so as to leave
free passage of air, a neck in the bell-jar admitting a thermometer
fitted air-tight through it. By this arrangement when the bell-jar is
lowered, the thermometer descends into the inner limb of the \J -pipe
or stand-pipe without dipping into the oil or glycerine.
    A measured volume of air to be analysed is drawn into one of the
air-holders (selected for that purpose) by raising it to a certain
height, and on lowering it slowly, after cutting off communication
with the outside by a stop-cock, the air is driven first of all through
an absorption apparatus and then into the second bell-jar, which has
at that time an ascending motion. The whole apparatus is connected
by brass tubes and stop-cocks, on one hand with a pressure-gauge,
and on the other hand with a graduated glass receiver, immersed in
mercury, and fixed to a bracket and rack movement by which it
can be raised and lowered at will.     The various parts of the instru
ment are all in air-tight communication with each other while the
carbonic acid is being absorbed, so that the absorption will tell on
the pressure-gauge,   and by depressing the measured glass receiver
into the mercury trough, and driving the air it contains into the
air-holders, while keeping the eyes fixed on the pressure-gauge, it will
be easy to restore the atmospheric pressure in the whole apparatus,
and thus determine the volume of gas absorbed.
    I shall now beg to describe in succession the various parts of this
instrument, and next state how the analysis is made.
    The Tanks. — One of the great difficulties     I  met with was the
selection of the fluid to be used in the tanks.        Water would not
answer, first of all because it absorbed carbonic acid, and next on
account of the tension of aqueous vapour.      I tried a nearly saturated
solution of common salt in water, so as to avoid any loss of carbonic
acid by absorption, but after experimenting for a considerable time I
had to reject the plan because of the vapour- tension, which I found
impossible to take into account.    I came to the conclusion that it was
necessary to dry the air and submit it to analysis in the dry state,
keeping it entirely out of reach of aqueous or other vapours. Bearing
this in mind, glycerine appeared to me to be possessed of the required
properties as a medium for confining the air in the bell-jars, and
therefore for filling the tanks.    It had the advantage of holding no
water, but its thickness appeared at first sight a serious objection, as

            Speedy Volumetric Determination     of Carbonic Acid.      183
 from its adhesion to the sides of the bell-jars on their being raised, I
thought there would be a difficulty in obtaining a fixed volume of air
within them. However, glycerine was tried, and the objection found
to be less than       I had imagined, but glycerine absorbed water from
the air, and in      due time would give it out to the dry air submitted
to analysis, so that glycerine could not be used without a protection
from atmospheric moisture. It then occurred to me that some kind
of oil might be made to float on the glycerine, thus completely
isolating it from the external air, and almond oil — which does not
thicken by exposure to the atmosphere — was adopted. The bath of
glycerine covered with almond oil in which the bell-jars are now
immersed was prepared in October last ; there is about one hundred
weight of glycerine in each tank, and I tested the glycerine of one of
the tanks for water four months and a half after it had been, it may be
said, in daily nse. This was effected by placing a weighed quantity of
the glycerine for about half an hour under a bell-jar over sulphuric
acid, and after that time it was found to have lost absolutely no weight.
 The layer of almond oil had, therefore, perfectly answered its object.
The oil for confining the air to be analysed, ensured the absence of
 any vapour-tension, or any possible loss of gas from absorption, and,
 moreover, by lubricating the bell-jars prevented the glycerine from
 adhering to them, the oil itself, from its lightness, running rapidly
 down the sides of the receivers on their being raised or depressed.
 A simple experiment demonstrates the action of the oil. Let a glass
 tube opened at both ends be closed at one extremity with india-rubber
 tubing and a pinch-cock, and then glycerine be poured into the tube.
 By pressing on the tubing the glycerine is driven up, and on re
 leasing the pressure it slowly subsides adhering to the glass ; but if
 a little almond oil be poured over the glycerine, on compressing       the
 tube the glycerine and oil are raised, but on releasing the pressure
 the glycerine runs down quickly to its former position without
 adhering to the glass.
     The bell-jars or air-holders gave me no little trouble. They were
  made at first of thin sheet iron, but this, after much labour, was found
 inadequate, as the changes of temperature of the external air affected
 the gas through the metal, too rapidly to allow of a sufficiently fine
 correction. Every possible contrivance was adopted to overcome this
 difficulty. The tanks and bell-jars were enclosed in a wooden case with
 glazed doors opening sideways, and tinfoil shields were placed round
 the bell- jars so as to shelter them from any heat radiated from the ont-
 side, but these arrangements were too complicated and the shields had
 to be given up. I came to the conclusion that the only plan would be
  to keep the bell- jars under water during the whole of the analysis, and
 this was done by making use of jacketed bell-jars, the space inside the
  jackets being filled with water. A completely new instrument was then

 184                      Br. W. Marcet.      On  the
constructed,   the bell-jars being jacketed and the inside space of nearly
half an inch in thickness was filled with water. Later on           I sub
stituted for water a solution of sodium sulphate saturated at a
temperature exceeding that of my laboratory, so that the annular
space in the bell-jars became filled with a crystallised solution of the
salt.    I thought by this plan to ensure a perfect stability of tempera
ture in the air of the bell-jars during the analysis, any increase of
temperature     outside being transformed into motion through its
action on the crystallised mass.        The result was nearly as    I  had
anticipated; still, after trying the plan for a considerable time, I
finally gave it up and returned to the water-jacket which I now fii.d
quite satisfactory. There is a scale to each of the bell- jars, divided
into four equal parts, and a pointer fixed to the rim of the tanks ;
by bringing       the same line on the scale opposite the pointer
before and after the analysis, the operator will be certain that the
bell- jars hold exactly the same volume of air in both cases, admitting
of course that the atmospheric pressure has been perfectly re
established.
   The jacketed air-holders are raised and lowered by means of an iron
weight worked over pulleys by a rack and drum movement, and
handle ; when the two bell-jars are at the same height, or level, they
may be entirely released of the weights without their position being
disturbed ; but if one of the receivers, say the left-hand one, is to be
depressed from that position and emptied of the air it contains, the
left hand weight is brought to bear upon it, and by a slow movement
of the handle that receiver is immersed entirely in the bath while the
other one is raised as high as it will go. When thus raised it draws
in common air ; this air is filtered through marbles or fragments of
pumice-stone, moistened with a solution of potassium hydrate, and
then through calcium chloride, so that no carbonic acid nor moisture
be admitted into the bell-jar.     It is, of course, necessary to keep the
taps communicating with the external air open in both tanks when
the bell- jar is being emptied, or the oil will be drawn into one of the
stand-pipes.     Should such an accident occur, which never happens
with a little practice, the oil will have to be let out from a small
aperture closed with a screw tap in the lower bend of the JJ-pipe,
while the thermometer has to be removed from the bell- jar, letting in
air through the neck in which it fits. It is better to return an equal
volume of glycerine to the tank rather than oil, from the difficulty the
latter would have in finding its level in the tank. Should oil be added
the bell-jar will have to be raised so far as it can go, and time allowed
for the oil to assume its level below the rim of the receiver.
   The cord which connects the bell-jars is liable to expand or contract,
but this is remedied by turning a screw, placed so as to shorten or
lengthen the cord, while the eye is kept on the pointers of both tanks

         Speedy Volumetric Determination           of Carbonic Acid.        185
when they are made to point to the corresponding lines on the scale.
Should the pointer of one bell-jar meet say the middle line on the
scale, and the middle line on the scale of the other be above the
corresponding pointer, that bell-jar will have to be depressed by
working the screw until the middle line on its scale also corresponds
with the pointer. This can be done without any trouble, and has
seldom to be repeated the same day, while, at times, days elapse in
succession without necessitating this correction.
   Hie Absorption-tube. — Various descriptions of absorption-tube were
tried before I obtained it in its present form. It has to fulfil two
conditions, viz. : it must first of al 1 absorb all the carbonic acid, secondly
give out no water. My present arrangement, which works very well, is
as follows : a straight hollow cylinder, 2 feet 3 inches in height, made of
thin sheet copper and silvered inside, is jacketed and surrounded with
glycerine over which floats a thin layer of oil to prevent the absorp
tion of water. The cylinder is filled with fragments of pumice-stone
in the midst of which is inserted a long metallic tube. The cylinder
is closed with an india-rubber cork, perforated, through which is
inserted a glass "P-piece inverted. A very delicate thermometer di
vided into tenths of a degree Fahrenheit is run through the upper
tube of the "T"-P'ece ^to which it fits air-tight, while the horizontal
limb is placed in communication with the left-hand bell-jar by means
of india-rabber tubing.        The thermometer has a very long stem, and
its bulb reaches far down into the metallic tube in the midst of the
pumice-stone, thus registering the temperature of the air in the absorp
tion-tube.    The space left between the fragments of pumice-stone
measures 1600 c.o. A narrow \J -shaped glass tube connects the copper
cylinder with another wider vertical glass tube, the latter being filled
with pieces of caustic potash, and into it a narrow glass tube is fitted
air-tight with an india-rubber stopper ; the latter is jacketed, the
annular space being filled with water.          Thus the heat formed by the
combination of the carbonic acid with the alkali distributes itself
throughout the absorption-tube, and is prevented from reaching the
right-hand bell-jar by the water in the jacket which absorbs it on its
way. The (J -shaped tube connecting the vertical portions of the
absorption apparatus has a tube soldered to its lower part and
 widened into a bulb, an arrangement the object of which is to drain
out the alkaline fluid after it has done flowing over the fragments
 of pumice-stone ; the tube beyond the bulb is finally closed with
 india-rubber tubing and a pinch-cock.
    The alkaline fluid for the absorption of the carbonic acid consists
 of half its volume of a saturated aqueous solution of potassium
 hydrate, and half its volume of pure glycerine, and the mixture is
 made to dissolve as much caustic potash in sticks as it will take
 up.   An excess of the alkali is invariably left in the fluid, so that

   remain saturated.   This solution answered its requirements in every
  way.     The thickness of the glycerine enabled it to adhere to the
  fragments of pumice-stone in the form of a thick layer, while the
  water of the potassic solution was so firmly retained that none
  was given out to the current of air passing through it.        Placed over
  sulphuric acid under a receiver a sample of this mixture underwent
  no loss of weight.   This fluid absorbs carbonic acid with the greatest
  speed,   and  I am   not  yet able to say when its power becomes
  exhausted.    It is held in bottles kept near the absorption-tubes, and
  before each analysis about       200 c.c of the solution is pourtx?
  into the copper cylinder, when it trickles down the pumice-stone
  appearing shortly afterwards in the exit tube, when it is let out into
  the bottle. The bulb blown on the exit tube is indispensable as a means
  of collecting the solution which remains behind and would otherwise
  stop the communication between the bell-jars — an accident which
 frequently happened until the present arrangement was adopted.
  The air after leaving the absorption apparatus just described passes
 over pieces of caustic potash, where it deposits any last traces of
 carbonic acid which may have escaped from the absorbing fluid ; it is
 finally cooled by the water-jacket, and in this state is collected in the
 right-hand bell- jar.
     The beat produced by the combination of the carbonic acid with
 the alkali introduced, was at first a serious difficulty in the working of
 my instrument. Various means were tried either to get rid of it or
 estimate its inflnence so as to correct it by calculation. At last       I
 succeeded — I may say beyond my expectations — in doing away entirely
 with this difficulty. The means       I employed was surrounding the
 absorption-tube with the non-conducting material glycerine, and
 determining the temperature of the air in this tube with a very deli
 cate thermometer.
     The measuring apparatus consists of a graduated receiver, holding
about 800 c.c, and moving up and down over mercury contained in a
strong glass trough. The receiver is drawn out at the top into a long
tubular neck, and this is fixed by a bracket to a rack and pinion
movement.      The opening in the neck is connected by india-rubber
tubing and a combination of "T"~pieces> with a gauge on one hand and
the bell-jars on the other, while a small tube of calcium chloride is
interposed in such a way as to dry the atmospheric air as it is drawn
into the graduated glass receiver.
    The gauge is a very pretty instrument, which was made for me at
the works for the construction of physical instruments at Geneva. It
consists of a glass U-*UDe wbich can be raised or depressed by a
rack and pinion movement, and a web stretched across the tube, though
fixed to an independent brass-piece.     By this simple arrangement it is

          Speedy Volumetric Determination      of Carbonic Acid.       187
easy to ascertain when the gange is exactly under atmospheric pressure.
The fluid    I have selected for the gauge is coloured petroleum, on
which the slightest difference of pressure will tell.
    Finally, there is an arrangement of brass tubes and stopcocks
through which the air, after having been driven from the left-hand
bell-jar into the other through the absorption-tube, can be trans
ferred from the right to the left bell-jar without retracing its passage
through the absorption apparatus.
    In my early experiments, india-rubber tubing, pinch-cocks, and
glass "|""P'eces were used, but      I  substituted for these the present
brass tubes and stopcocks, and the air-tightness of all the apparatus
can be thoroughly relied upon.       It is not possible to do away entirely
with india-rubber tubes, but those in use are now varnished with
several coats of copal varnish, and made thereby perfectly air-tight.
    The Analysis. — The air to be analysed, which, so far has been air
expired from the lungs or such air mixed with common air, is first of
all collected in an india-rubber bag, faced on both sides with oil-silk
 in order to prevent any loss of carbonic acid by diffusion through its
 substance.    The bag is next connected by india-rubber tubing with a
 gas-holder   or counterpoised belkjar, working in and out of a bath of
 glycerine covered with a layer of almond oil. By weighting the coun
 terpoise of the bell-jar, the latter is slowly raised, aspiring the air
 from the bag.     A scale on the bell-jar and a pointer on the rim of the
 tank enable the volume of air to be read off, but of course the extra
 weight used for giving the receiver its ascending motion will have to
 be removed and the holder placed under atmospheric pressure pre
 vious to taking the observation.       I now find it more convenient to
 read off the volume of air to be analysed from a smaller bell-jar
 holding 11 litres of air.    After collecting the air from the bag into
 the larger receiver, which, when full, contains about 42 litres, it is
 driven into the smaller bell- jar through a glass desiccator full of cal
 cium chloride, where it leaves its moisture without losing any of its
 carbonic acid.     In order to dry the gas thoroughly, it should pass
 through the desiccator at the rate of no more than a litre per minute.
    The next step will be to bring this air in the small holder exactly
 under atmospheric pressure, and a special contrivance had to be
 adopted to effect this object.    The instrument used is a clamp and a
 screw in connexion with each other ; the screw, by means of a crank
 movement, raises or depresses the clamp, while the fulcrum is the
 rim of the tank to which this instrument is fixed. The cord holding
 the counterpoise passes through the open jaws of the clamp, and
 is free to move up and down ; but when the air in the receiver
 has to be brought under atmospheric pressure, by turning a nut the
 clamp is closed and the cord fixed : then, on moving the screw with
 another nut either to one side or the other, the bell-jar is raised or

    188                     Dr. W. Marcet.       On the
    depressed.     The adjustment is exceedingly fine, and by testing the
    pressure  of  the air in the holder with a gauge supplied with coloured
    petroleum, the air in the bell-jar can be brought under atmospheric
    pressure with the greatest degree of accuracy.          I am indebted to
   Mr. W. Parkinson, Engineer, for the mechanism of this delicate
   adjusting movement.
      The (smaller) air-holder is now connected with the left-hand bell-
   jar of the analysing apparatus by varnished india-rubber tubing, in
   the track of which is another tube of calcium chloride (omitted in
  the plate), care having been taken to rinse out previously this con
  necting tube with the air to be analysed.        The bell-jar is now raised
  by turning the handle of the drum and lifting slowly the iron weight
  which keeps the receiver immersed in the tank. When filled, the air
  is brought under atmospheric pressure by the adjusting apparatus, and
  a minute or two are allowed to elapse to make sure that the pressure
  is constant ; the volume of air to be analysed is then read off on the
  scale of the air-holder.
      The temperature indicated by the thermometers in the two bell-
 jars is observed by means of two little telescopes fitted into the
 glazed shutters of the case, and which magnify considerably the
  divisions of the instruments.       By this means the temperature in the
 bell-jars can be estimated to the fiftieth of a degree Fahrenheit, and
 are recorded when steady ; the temperature in the absorption-tube is
 also noted.      After opening and closing the requisite stopcocks, the
 air is    driven   slowly by means of the drum-handle through the
 absorbing apparatus into the right-hand bell-jar, which is simul
 taneously raised.       I find from experience that about 7 litres are
 sufficient, and indeed the most convenient for the analysis of air
 expired from the lungs ; and four minutes suffice for the absorp
 tion of the whole of the carbonic acid of that air run over the
 alkaline solution. After the first operation, it is obvious that the
 air filling the pipes of the left-hand bell-jar has been left behind.
By means of a combination of tubes and taps, the two bell-jars
are now brought into immediate              communication, and the air is
returned into the left bell-jar up       to  the original mark on the scale
without passing through the absorption-tubes.             Meanwhile, a con
siderable suction has     taken place in  the apparatus from the absorption
of the carbonic acid, and this is shown by the pressure-gauge.          The
small graduated glass receiver, originally full of common air under
atmospheric pressure, and which stood at 0, is depressed into the
mercury, and by this means atmospheric pressure is readily re
established in the whole apparatus, as seen by the petroleum in the
gauge returning to exactly the same level in the two limbs ; the car
bonic acid normally present in this atmospheric air is not taken into
account as too small in its proportion to affect the correctness of the

              peedy Volumetric Determination    of Carbonic Acid.     189
result.    It  may be advisable   to drive the air into the apparatus by
degrees as the absorption takes place, and this is my ordinary mode
of procedure. In order to ensure the absorption of the whole of the
carbonic acid, leaving behind but an insignificant fraction, the air
should be passed at least three times through the absorption-tube, or,
in other words, should be made to circulate three times through the
apparatus before recording the total amount of carbonic acid present.
The small fraction of carbonic acid left would of course become in
creased after each analysis if allowed to remain in the instrument.     It
may therefore be advisable to run the air in the left-hand bell-jar
through the absorption-tube before commencing an analysis.          After
the air has circulated three times through the absorption-tube the
steadiness of the reading for the volume of carbonic acid absorbed,
should the air be passed again and again through the absorption-tube,
is usually remarkable, unless there should be an alteration in the tem
perature of the apparatus, when the reading is observed to follow the
changes of temperature.       The volume of air introduced into the appa
ratus to fill up the vacuum is now read off, as also the temperatures of
the two bell-jars and absorption-tube.          All this is done without
 drawing the shutters of the case containing the bell-jars, two little
 windows admitting the hands to work the taps ; the absorption appa
ratus is outside the case at the back (although shown in the plate
 as inside the case).     An instrument which has necessitated such a
 long description will be thought slow and tedious in its working, but
 such is far from being the case, considering that the actual analysis
 will take from 20 minutes to half-an-hour.         I expect, however, an
increase of speed by substituting a mechanical movement for the
 hand to turn the handle. Time can probably also be saved by passing
the air to be analysed through a tube immersed in water at the
 temperatre of the bell-jars.      When the temperatures and pressures
 become rapidly steady, the time required for the analysis is of course
 shortened.
    I have not yet found out the shortest period required for depressing
 or raising the bell-jars ; if the movement is too rapid a displacement
 takes place in the level of the oil in the tanks, and a slight suction
 follows which of course will be mistaken for so much carbonic acid,
 a slow movement given to the bell-jars overcomes that objection com
 pletely.
    No additional time is taken up for running the alkaline solution
 through the absorption-tube, as this is done by another person while
 the observer is filling and adjusting.        Of course it is only after
 acquiring some experience that the above speed is obtained.
    Compared with Pettenkofer's method, the present instrument claims
 much greater speed, for while by the former process the solution
  holding the barium carbonate has to be left a day or over night for the
     vol. xli.                                                    o

190                      Dr. W. Marcet.        On    the
subsidence of the precipitate, with my instrument the analysis can be
made at once, and in a short time.        It might be objected that Petten-
kofer's method could be carried out as far as the combination of the
carbonic acid   with the barium, the fluid being preserved for analysis
in well-stoppered bottles. A number of determinations in succession
might thus be obtained partially made, the final analysis being put off
to a future period.       I  had to adopt this very plan myself in my
experiments on the influence of altitude on the chemical changes of
respiration, but found it inconvenient in many ways and sometimes
objectionable.    I am now alluding to air containing over 1 per cent, of
carbonic acid ; so far my experience does not extend to atmospheric
air.   I  hope soon, however, to be able to determine carbonic acid in
the atmosphere by the same means, as          I   hare had a much larger in
strument made for that purpose, each bell- jar holding 3 cubic feet of
air.
   In order to test the accuracy of my instrument, it was necessary
to compare analyses of the same air by this means and by another
reliable method, and for that purpose        I  selected that of Pettenkofer
which was carried out with one of the cylinders                I have formerly
described in the    " Journal of the Chemical Society," 1880.

  These eighteen series of analyses illustrate the results to be obtained
by the use of my instrument.
  The temperatures of the bell- jars are easily read to a fraction of the
tenth of a degree Fahr., and the three corrections for temperature take
no time to make.     By waiting till the temperatures   in the bell-jars,

after the absorption of carbonic acid, have risen to their original read
 ings, or very nearly so, the correction to be applied is all bu b limited
 to the change of temperature in the 1600 c.c. of the absorption-tube,
 and is hardly likely to exceed 4 or 5 c.c.
    The petrolenm gauge is most interesting to watch ; when the ab
 sorption is complete, after the air has circulated three times through
 the absorption-tube, the reading of the graduated bell-jar (absolutely
under atmospheric pressure) is extremely steady.       It remains so for a
minute or two, during which time the thermometers rise in both bell-
jars ; this is owing to the circumstance that the glycerine in the tanks
is nearly always slightly colder than the water in the jacket of the
bell-jars, and the air on its way through the stand-pipe immersed in
 the glycerine becomes a trifle colder. As the temperature in the bell-
 jars approaches its original reading, the pressure from the expansion
 of the air they contain begins to assert itself, and in order to keep the
 air under atmospheric pressure the graduated bell- jar must be gently
 raised.    When the thermometers have reached their original height in
 the jacketed bell-jars of the instrument, the atmospheric pressure
again remains exceedingly steady, and there is no difficulty in reading
 the result. It sometimes happens that after a time, especially in hot
 weather, the temperature slowly rises by two or three tenths of a
 degree or more beyond its original reading. In such a case the work
 ing of the instrument is so perfect that by introducing the correc
 tion required for this increased temperature in the proportion of
 1 : 492 of the volume of air analysed per 1° F., the result obtained is
 the same as it was on the occasion of the first reading.
    It is important to consider how far the instrument is reliable. At
 first  I had much difficulty in obtaining in every analysis the same
 results by the new volumetric and Pettenkofer's methods ; at last        I
 found that the only cause of error left was the displacement of the
 surface of the oil, occasioned by working the bell-jars too fast ; when
 moved slowly, the results by both methods invariably agreed.       I con
  clude that air containing about 4 per cent,  of carbonic acid will yield
  within 0-5 per cent, of the proportion which would be obtained by
 Pettenkofer's method, and air containing 1 per cent, of carbonic acid
 will give a result within 1 per cent, of that to be obtained by Petten
  kofer's. In the last analysis I have quoted, air containing less than
 1 per cent., or 0'9327 per cent, only of carbonic   acid, gave with the
 two methods a difference of 0-45 per cent., a very satisfactory
 result.

for some valuable suggestions ; and finally to Mr. Landriset, of
Geneva, my assistant since last January, whose care and perseverance,
especially with reference to the determinations by Pettenkofer's

" Researches      in Stellar Photography.          1. In its relation
      to the Photometry        of  the   Stars; 2. Its applicability to
      Astronomical Measurements of great Precision."              By C.
      PRITCHARD, Savilian Professor of Astronomy in Oxford.
      Received May 20. Read May 27, 1886.
   Several attempts have already been made to connect the photo
graphic images of stars with their photometric magnitudes, and con
sequently with their relative brightness ; but hitherto, so far as     I
know, this relation has been sought by comparing the impressions
made on the eye rather than as resulting from rigorous measures.
With a view to the removal of this indefiniteness, unscientific unless
it be unavoidable,      I  have undertaken a series of instrumental
measures of the diameters of the photographic images impressed on
sensitised films, which has led to the establishment of a remarkable
physical relation (mathematically expressed) between the diameter?
of the stellar images and their photometric magnitudes, as determined
by instrumental means : a method which seems to me to be free from
systematic error and personal bias.
    With this end chiefly in view, though accompanied also with the
hope of obtaining still further, and perhaps even more valuable appli
cation of the photographic method to astronomical observations,        I
procured a number of gelatine dry plates, each being about 2 inches
 square.   The comparative smallness of these plates was determined
 or suggested by my desire to obtain pictures of such small parts only
 of the sky as would fall within the ascertained limits of astronomical
 accuracy of the telescopic field of view, i.e., a field possessing no
 measurable distortion, and consequently restricted to about a square
 degree.   These plates were exposed in the focus of the well-known
 De La Rue reflecting telescope, of 13 inches aperture, erected in the
 University Observatory, at Oxford.
    Several plates of the Pleiades were taken with varying times of
 exposure, and on these were impressed images of portions of the
  group, extending to stars of approximately the tenth magnitude. The

196                        Prof. C. Pritchard.
first use made of these photographic plates was to measure the
diameter of those stars whose photometric magnitudes have already
been ascertained by the Wedge photometer, and published in the
" Uranometria Nova Oxoniensis,"
                                      p. 94.
   Before proceeding further, it is necessary to observe that the photo
graphic images of the stars formed on the film possess in general a
very sensible size, even when exposed for moderate intervals of time.
It is not necessary here to enter upon the probable cause or causes of
these considerable images, or of their peculiar nature ; it is sufficient
to indicate, as an example, that the image of Alcyone (mag. 3' 12) on
a plate exposed for (say) ten minutes, is a disk having a diameter of
about 0*02 inch, equivalent to a diameter of 30" in the focal plane of
the telescope.   As to the peculiar form of these images, it was long
ago   shown  by Bond  (in 1858)*, that when viewed under considerable
magnifying power, they are not 6imply sharply defined circular disks,
but are fringed all round with discrete black dots, separable under
the higher powers of a microscope, and extending to some distance
beyond the main black circular disk ; nevertheless, when viewed in the
comparatively low power of the double-image micrometer, or of the
microscope attached to the macro-micrometer, actually used in the
measurements, these discrete fringes are not salient, and do not inter
fere sensibly with the exactitude of the repeated measures.
    As a matter of precaution, the diameters of the photographed
images were measured, both by means of Airy's double-image micro
 meter (Greenwich observations),         and by the De La Rue macro-
 micrometer described in vol. 47, "Mem. Roy. Astron. Soc," and the
 trustworthiness of these measures was still further confirmed by
 observations made by means of a stage micrometer applied to an
 achromatic microscope of very considerable power.             The results of
 these combined measures were then graphically plotted on paper pre
 pared with ruled squares, the measured diameters being taken as the
 abscissas, and the corresponding photometric magnitudes taken as
 ordinates.   As usual, a curve was drawn by hand among the points
 plotted, and thus graphically connecting magnitudes in general with
 their corresponding diameters.      A mere inspection at once suggested
 the mathematical connexion between these abscissae and their ordi
 nates, indicating a logarithmic curve, of which the equation would
 be—
                                  y = Ae-"'
 where x is the measured diameter, and y is the corresponding magni
 tude of the star, here expressed on the scale that 2-05 shall represent
 the magnitude of Polaris, and 2-512 the light ratio in passing from
 one magnitude to the next.      All this is in accordance with the ordi-

nary convention explained in "Mem. Roy. Astron. Soc," vol. 47. But
it should from the first be understood that any other convenient light
ratio, and any other standard magnitude, might have been adopted.
It may properly be here repeated that the object of the research is
confined to the question whether a definite relation can be discovered
between measured photographic images and the ordinary conven
tional magnitudes of stars.
    If this equation expresses the true relation between diameter of
image and magnitude, then an equation of condition for the deter
mination of the numerical values of the constants becomes of the
form —
                               logy=log/t-|                                ^
the logarithms here being on the ordinary base      10 ; i.e., if D, D' be the
 measured diameters of two stars on       the same  plate, and M, M' their
corresponding magnitudes, then —
                               D-D'^logg:          .......                 (2)
 From this it follows that in the equation of condition (1), (derived
 from the original equation to the curve, viz., y= Ae~i ), the constant p.
 is the magnitude of the faintest star at all impressible on the plate
 for the exposure in question (or whose photographic diameter is zero),
 and B denotes the diameter of that star whose magnitude is the tenth
 part of that of this zero star on that plate, this particular number
 (10) being necessarily introduced by the adoption of the Briggean
 system of logarithms.
     "With regard to the relation (2)
                         D-D'=a{logM'-logM},
 it is noticeable  that  it is in analogy with    the fundamental relation
 existing between light and magnitude —
                         M-M'=K{logL'-logL}                                 (3)
     We now proceed to the numerical computation of the constants (fi)
 and (8), and consequently to the comparison of the resulting computed
 magnitudes with those instrumentally obtained by the Wedge Photo
 meter.
     The results of the present research are confined to tho discussion
 of three plates of a portion of the Pleiades, exposed for 7, 12, and
 15 minutes respectively on February 11 and April 2 of the present
  year, at the respective altitudes of 51° 57', 23° 49', and 21° 50'. The

   A   solution of these equations    reduces  the fundamental equation
 (1) to-

   The other two plates, similarly discussed, but each being absolutely
 independent in its results from the others, give —

   From this investigation it may be gathered that the magnitude of
 the star which was commencing to form its photographic image on the

                    Researches in Stellar Photography.                199
plate (A) after seven minutes' exposure, was 12'82 mag., and that the
diameter of a star of the magnitude P28, would occupy on the plate
in question a circular disk 46-36" in diameter, or, linearly expressed,
0-024 inch.
    Similarly for plates B and 0, with the exception that the exposures
and the altitudes of the stars are different, to say nothing of other
possible differences, such as the chemical constitution of the films, the
development of the images, and the meteorological circumstances
attending the exposures. It is observable that in Plate B, although
the exposure was twelve minutes instead of the seven for Plate A,
nevertheless the zero star was brighter than for A, owing probably to the
lower altitude or to the other causes mentioned above. For Plate C
the exposure was still longer, viz., fifteen minutes, nevertheless, as-
 the group was still lower in altitude, the zero star is the brightest of
 any of the three plates ; the instructive character of these phenomena
 is obvious.
    The results of applying the normal equations A, B, C severally to-
 the twenty-four stars whose diameters were measured, are given in
 the subjoined Tables I, II, III, where, in the first column, is given the
 star's designation as originally applied by Bessel. In the second is
 given the   measured diameter of its photographed image on the plate-
 in  question.  This diameter expressed in seconds of arc corresponds
 to the angular magnitude under which that image would be seen
 when placed in the focus of the mirror (10 feet), and viewed from
  the centre of that mirror. In the third column of each table is given
  the photographic magnitude, computed from the normal equations
  A, B, C severally. Column 4 contains the photometric magnitude, as-
                 " Uranometria Nova Oxoniensis,"
  given in the                                          p. 94.   The last
  column contains the difference between the two magnitudes.

                    Researches  in Stellar Photography.               203
    A comparison of the numbers in the last column affords a definite
indication that there does exist in nature a general definite relation
between the photographic diameters and the intensities of the stellar
lights   impressed on the plate, and that this relation is truly repre
sented by the equation —
                        D-D'=«{logM'-logM}.
Nevertheless it is also made evident that although this relation is a
fact for stars on the average, there are a few stars which stand out
from that average, a result which might have been anticipated on
account of the salient character of special spectra occasionally met
with in certain stars.       In the group examined above, the stars
having this abnormal actinic action are Pleione, and Nos. 22 and 31.
These stars give the same evidence of peculiarity in all the three
plates ; and from this circumstance it becomes clear that if a compari
son is at any time to be made between the photographic and the
photometric magnitudes, more than one plate should be taken, in
order to be sure that any discordances are due to variations in the
actual actinic action, and not to accidental circumstances.     Omitting
 these three stars, the average deviation of the magnitude here com
 puted photographically from that photometrically determined, is
 0-16 mag.     If these three stars be included it is 0'19 mag. Had
 it not been that the Pleiades group was rapidly approaching the
 sun at the time of these observations, the character of the spectra
 of the three exceptional stars would have been examined, with the
 view of explaining, if possible, their peculiar actinic action on the
 photographic film.
    The general results of the foregoing research appears to be —
  '
    First. There does in general exist a remarkable and definite relation
 between the intensity of the actinism of a star on a photographic film,
as expressed by the area of the image formed, and.the intensity of the
light as measured by a photometer.          That relation also exhibits a
 certain analogy to the relation between the photometric magnitude
and the actual intensity of the light of a star. These relations being
expressed by the formula —
                              M    ^, L'
                              M'=Klo&L
                              D    ™,    M'
where the relation is sufficiently evident.
    Secondly. Both these relations are disturbed in the cases of any
salient difference in the colours of particular stars, or at all events
 present analogous difficulties in dealing with them by way of definite
 measurement.

    Thirdly. If it be established that the photographic film is perma
nent, we possess in the application of photography the certain and
definite means of comparing at pleasure any changes which in the
lapse of time (whether longer or shorter) may occur in the lustre of
any star or group of stars, without the labour of continually
measuring and recording the actual magnitude at any particular
epoch.     We possess, that is, a register, which can be examined when
the emergency arising from any suspicions circumstance occurs.
II. — On   the  Relation of the Dimensions of the Photographed            Images  of
               a Star to the Time of the Exposure of the Plate.
    It will be observed that      so far  as the   foregoing investigations are
concerned, the stars examined and compared are all on the same plate
and exposed for the same time ; and it is from such plates that the
remarkable relation between the areas of the images and the photo
 metric magnitude has been obtained.             There is, however a still wider
 question than this, involving the alterations in the disk-areas caused
by the variations of the time of exposure of any particular plate on
 which they are impressed.            I  do not propose to enter upon this
 question   to the exhaustive    extent   which at the present day is required,
 by the extreme and hitherto unexpected duration of the times of
 exposure, extending now to hours rather than to minutes or seconds.
 I  will here only explain that the question of the relation of time
 of exposure to the photographic diameter of a particular star im
 pressed     on a film was elaborately examined by Bond.*                     From
 exposures varying      from    one   second   to  two   minutes,    he came to  the
 conclusion that the area of a given star's photographic image
 impressed on a given plate varied directly as the time of exposure.
 The plates he used were the ordinary wet collodion plates of 1858.
 My own investigations, based on exposures even when limited to the
 same time as Bond's (but on the modern gelatine dry plates), led
 me to a very different conclusion, viz., that the area varies as the
 square root of the time of exposure.
     Before, however, publishing the details of my observations, it is
 desirable to extend the time of exposure to far larger durations, and             I
 abstain at present from further remarks thereon, with the exception
 that, judging from the remarkable photographs taken by the Brothers
 Henry at the Paris Observatory, Bond's conclusions appear to me (as
 a,t present advised, but subject to further examination) incompatible
 with observed fact. There are also some still more remarkable and
 interesting investigations relating indirectly to the same question,

opportunity to make the whole subject the basis of a further communi
cation.      I will, however, add here that I have found the fringes of
•discrete dots which surround         the images    on the original  negative
entirely disappear on transferring them to a positive print, and leave
their positive images simply as clean cut disks, whose diameters are
sensibly the same as the measured diameters of the concrete disks on
the original negative.        It is conceivable that in printing, the light
penetrates through      the  interstices of the fringe.
III. — Applicability     of Photography to Astronomical Measurements        of
                                 Great Precision.
    The scientific interest and importance attached to the possession of
a register of the relative lustre of the stars, virtually exhibited on a
permanent photographic film, capable of re-examination at any time,
and accessible at will, are, if possible, surpassed by the value attach
able to the measurability of their relative positions, provided only the
accuracy of the measures made upon the film is equal to that obtain
 able by the application of the best astronomical instruments to the
 sky itself. Three questions,         in fact, here present themselves in
 relation to this matter.         The first is, whether the photographic
 pictures accurately represent a portion of the skies ; the second is,
 whether the relative co-ordinates of the star images are measurable
 with as much delicacy and certainty as they are by the heliometer, or
 any other form of micrometer, applied to the sky itself : and the
 third question has reference to the permanence of the photographic
 film.
     For present convenience,     I shall consider the reply to the first two
 of these questions as involved in the same evidence.             In order to
 settle these points, several photographic plates of stars situated in
 portions of the Pleiades group, already referred to, were selected for
 examination.       On each of these the image of rj Tauri (Alcyone) is
 impressed, together with that of many other stars in the group, and
 specially for this purpose twenty-five of the stars, whose distances
 from Alcyone had been so carefully measured by Bessel with his
 famous heliometer in 1838 — 1842.         These distances from Alcyone on
  the several films were each measured, and as far as possible with
  as many repetitions as those adopted by Bessel himself.        Inasmuch as
  the plates were taken at different altitudes on different nights, the
  necessity arose for applying small numerical corrections for the
  varying effects of refraction, and where necessary, other small correc
  tions for aberration were applied, in order that the resulting dis
  tances might be strictly comparable inter se.       This examination of the
  amount    of correspondence   in the measures is the only object here, for
   the moment, entertained.

   As far     as the general     mass, or great majority, of these observations
is concerned,      it is not necessary to give all the particulars, but        I have
selected the first sets of measures as affording an average specimen of
the whole work.             These results are exhibited in Table TV ; and in
Table    V   are given the mean deviations of the whole twenty-five stars,
deduced as in the case of the six for which the complete details are
printed in Table          IV.

   In the above preceding clause have adopted the term general mast,
because on one of the plates (fig. 2) there occurs a somewhat curious
and instructive fact, viz., that while for nineteen instances of stars
measured       from 17 Tauri, the distances agree with those of the same
stars on the other three plates, there is a sensible discordance between
the measures of Atlas, Pleione, Nos. 29, 31, 32, and 33, when com
pared with the similar measures on the three other plates.                     This fact
indicates a distortion of the film at the places where these six stars
 are impressed.       On inspecting the diagram of the plate, it is observ
 able that all these six stars, exhibiting these discordances of distance
from 7], lie on the same portion of the plate. It follows, necessarily,
that three of the plates must accurately represent the portion of the
heavens impressed, and the fourth plate in those portions only which
exhibit an identity with the other three.              From this fact we conclude
that it is not safe to regard any single plate as necessarily accurate
in itself, unless it is corroborated by the identity of exact measure
ments, when compared with others also.                    The discordances here
referred to are small, but existent, perceptible, and in themselves
destructive of accurate astronomical conclusions involved therein.

   It   may be noticed that the discordances for Atlas and 29 are not so conspicuous
as  for  the remaining stars, indicating that the principal disturbance of the film has
taken place in the neighbourhood of 31, 32, and 33.         The maximum discordance
applies to the Star 31, where it is 1*7" ; and the least disturbances applies to Allot,
where it does not reach half a second of arc.
    The accordance of the measures given in Tables IV and V inter se,
is quite equal to that exhibited by the measures of the illustrious
 astronomer of Konigsberg.             I confess that, having already had a long
experience of the results of repeated measures of distances of spots on
 the moon as obtained from lunar photographs (" Mem. Roy. Astron.
 Soc," vol. 47 (1883)), and being at the same time aware also of Dr. De
La Rue's great success in measuring solar photographic images, was                I
 not altogether surprised, but agreeably satisfied by the removal of all
doubt and uncertainty.              But, in reference to this question, we must
not overlook the fact of the generic distinction which exists between
 the circumstances attending the production of these solar and lunar
 photographs and these stellar images formed on photographic films of
a totally different description, and which latter films do necessarily
present difficulties and suspicions not applicable to the former.                    In
the former case the collodion plates were exposed for at most a very
few seconds, or even for fractions of a second ; but in the case of the
 star plates, the exposures last, not only through very many minutes,
 but the several star images make their appearance, according to their

                       Researches in     Stellar Photography.                       211
relative brightness, only after varying times of exposure.                    It would
 therefore have been premature, or even unscientific,             to  argue a priori
of the reliability of the latter measures from those of the former.
    From inspection of Table V it will be found that the general error
of the whole group of measures of the photographic plates, re
garded as measures of the same quantity, is 0"24", and of the helio-
meter 0'29".         Even this minute error would probably have been
smaller had it not been for a practical difficulty, which arises in
 the accurate bisection of the disks of the star images.                    This diffi
culty, though it exists also to a proportionate extent in the use of any
 filar micrometer applied to the brighter stars in the skies, does not
.exist to an equal degree in the case of heliometer measures.                     Never
 theless, such is the convenience of leisurely bisecting even the com
paratively large photographic disk on a steady film, that the final
results of the photographic measures are, on the whole, slightly more
accordant than those secured by the use of the heliometer. In point
of facility and rapidity, the advantages of the photographic method
are enormous.
    Having mentioned the error necessarily connected with bisection
of the star disk, it is desirable to present a specimen of what
actually occurs. Accordingly I give a short table, containing the
detail of the errors made in continually bisecting two star disks, such
 as actually occurred in reference to Maia and Asterope, of diameters
 25" and 15" respectively.

    Comparing this liability of error in the bisection of each star, in
 obtaining its distance from 17, with the whole liability to error in dis
 tance, which is 0'24", it follows that probably the whole error in the
 distance measures arises from the bisection, and that therefore the
 film has remained undisturbed in the direction of distance.     Another
 practically important conclusion is that the exposure of the plates
 should not continue beyond the time necessary to form distinct disks
of the stars to be measured, inasmuch as an increased enlargement
 of the photographic image necessarily entails an increased error in
its bisection (see Table V). Hence, if the stars to be measured differ
 very greatly in magnitude, then it may be desirable to connect the
brightest stars with the fainter by means of stars of intermediate
 magnitude.
    Such, then, appears to be the comparatively rigorous character of
                                    I
photographic measurement : but hope to carry the investigation still
further, by the application thereof to the determination of stellar
parallax, for which the method appears to be eminently adapted.
    Another investigation presents itself in the inquiry as to the effect
of atmospheric absorption at varying altitudes on the image im
pressed.
    With regard to the question of the permanence of the film, it
would at present be premature to speak : it might be unsafe to
argue from the known permanence of the collodion plates on which
the lunar images are impressed, but so far as the present knowledge-
suggests there is no evidence of deterioration.     I propose, however,
to measure a few distances periodically, as well as the diameters of
the larger star disks.
" Contribution to the Study of Intestinal Rest and Movement.""
      By J. Theodore Cash, M.D. Communicated by T. Lauder
      Brunton, M.D., F.R.S., &c. Received May 25. Read May
      27, 1886.
    During the last two years, as opportunity has permitted,      I  have-
been engaged in an experimental study of the various factors which
contribute to movement or rest of the small intestine.
    This research has furnished me with much information of an
analytical character, but it seemed desirable to supplement and, in
some degree, to control this, by investigating the general conditions
which influence such changes in a healthy animal in which all the
functions exerting an influence upon the viscera are in full operation.
The most promising means for effecting this purpose appeared to be
the establishing of a Vella's fistula which would permit of thorough

                     On Intestinal Rest and Movement.                  213
examination without the necessity of subsequent employment of
anaesthetics or of operative procedure.
    This operation consists in making a double division in the con
tinuity of the small intestine, the approximation by means of sutures
of the upper and lower ends of the gut which are to be returned to
the abdominal cavity to serve their previous purpose as a part of the
intestinal tube, the bringing outwards of the two ends of the intes
tine which has been isolated from the rest of the tract by the double
section, with a view to the subsequent healing of these two mouths in
the abdominal incision.       The mesentery is interfered with as little as
possible in making the intestinal division.
    Operation. — Upon a healthy dog weighing 14 lbs. deeply under the
influence of morphia,     I performed this operation, separating from the
rest nearly 20 cm. of the upper portion of the jejunum, which was
dealt  with   as above described.
    The dog was kept warm, and the day after the operation received
several spoonfuls      of milk. The quantity was increased rapidly, and
on the fifth day meat was given ; by the sixth day the animal was
practically normal, the condition of the wound in the abdominal walls,
which was now granulating and painless, being all that could be
desired.    A further rest of three days was, however, allowed in order
that all danger of prolapse of the intestine in lifting the animal might
be   avoided.
    No hypnotic or anassthetic was employed in any of the experiments
to be described in this paper, nor was any more restraint exercised
than by occasionally laying a hand on the head or body of the dog in
token that he was to remain still.      As regards the disposition of the
animal, his attachment to myself and the laboratory attendant was
snch, and the inconvenience of the experiment so little, that when
 brought into the laboratory he often endeavoured to leap on to the
table on which he rested whilst under examination.        When placed on
his side on this table he remained, as a rule, perfectly quiet, except for
 an occasional deep respiration, a start during sleep, or a stretching of
 the limbs.
     On examining the floor of the short wound in the middle line of the
 abdominal parieties, the two round mouths of the fistulous intestine
 with their everted mucous membrane could be readily observed, and
 their movements noted without the least difficulty.        There was a
 space   of  2  cm.  intervening  between  these two   mouths  which was
 filled by the parietal peritoneum muscles and skin which had been
 divided in the operation, and subsequently united by suture to the
 corresponding structures of the opposite side.         At the time the
 experiments commenced firm union had occurred in this position.

       Obsen-ation of the Fistulous Opening during Hunger, Feeding,
                                  Exercise, &fc.
    If the animal was in a condition of hunger        (it received one large
 meal of meat about the middle        of each day, and manifested   a desire
 for food therefore when brought up to the laboratory about 10 o'clock
 in the morning) the appearance of the mouths of the fistula varied
from time to time.
    After a certain amount of movement had taken place, it often
 happened that a period of complete repose of 3 or even of 8 to 12
minute occurred without any contraction making itself manifest ;
then, spontaneously, movements of one or both mouths of the fistu
lous gut made their appearance, which sometimes appeared to be either
sequences to acts of swallowing on the part of the animal, or results
of mental impressions.
   These contractions usually evidenced a very regular rhythm, but
varied greatly in strength.
   Those first occurring were frequently so slight that they could only be
observed by the change of position in the light reflected by the moist
mouth of the fistula. Increasing in strength they reached a maximum,
and, after persisting for a time (30" to 3' or 4'), gradually declined or
suddenly ceased.     When peristalsis followed an act of deglutition, the
effect was of shorter dnration and culminated more rapidly, duration
of the contractions was usually shorter, and the advent of their
maximal strength more rapid.
   If when only gentle and occasional movement of the mouths of the
fistula, attended by little or no extension of secretion, was occurring,
the animal was allowed to jump down on the floor and encouraged to
run a few times round the room, it was found on continuing the
observation after the exercise, that the contractions were much more
frequent and powerful, and were sometimes associated with the ejec
tion of increased secretion from the lower fistulous opening.
   During the condition of hunger, i.e., before the animal had received
its daily meal, the smell of food, but much more markedly the swal
lowing of several pieces of meat successively presented to the animal,
had for effect a regular and powerful series of contractions, usually
attended with an increased ejection of secretion.
   It was evident therefore that without the least interference with the
fistulous intestine, the appearances coincided with the experiments I
recorded graphically, and which I shall now consider in more detail.
                       Graphic Experimental Records.
   For the purpose of recording merely an intestinal contraction near
the orifices  of the fistula, a fine glass cannula slightly enlarged at the
end, upon which was fixed a small bag of delicate elastic membrane,

                      On Intestinal Rest and Movement.                        2  If)
was employed.         This constituted the " sound," and was connected
by means of a system of thick-walled india-rubber tubes with a
mercurial manometer or a Marey's recipient tambour ; if the former
was employed water was the means of communicating the impulse
from the compressed sound ; if the latter, air. The sound, whether
inflated with air or distended with water, had a diameter when fully
filled of 7 mm. at its widest point and a length of 12 mm.                     The
manometer was so arranged that the level of the mercury was as nearly
as possible that of the sound resting in the intestine.               Occasionally
 two sounds, each connected with a separate manometer, were used, one
being introduced through the upper, the other through the lower
mouth of the fistulous intestine. When it was desired to register the
speed of propulsion of a solid body through a portion or the whole of
the length of the fistulous intestine, a modified form of the method
nsed by Mosso, and developed in its details by Ranvier in experiments
upon the oesophagus, was employed.          In this case the travelling sounds
were oblong bodies having rounded ends, and measuring in breadth
from 5 to 9 mm., in length 12 to 14 mm., and were made of metal,
cork hollowed out, or glass, and in several experiments a solid sound
was replaced by a small piece of lean meat.               Those made of metal
were the thin-walled silver capsules which Prof. Kronecker employs
for the introduction of his maximal thermometers into the alimentary
canal of animals.        They are perforated with one or two holes which
serve for the attachment          of a thread of silk. The larger of the
metal capsules which        I  employed as a travelling sound was 9 mm.
broad by 14 long, and weighed 3'4 grams ; the smaller, 6 mm. by
 14, weighed 2-2 grams.
    The registering apparatus consisted merely of a thin wedge of cork
bearing a glass pen, and travelling vertically by means of two glass
eyes passed through its substance upon parallel steel guides.                   The
weight of this falling pen was 2 grams.            A fine silk thread from the
sound to the pen passed over two pulleys, one placed opposite and in
the same plane as the fistulous opening, the second vertically above
the steel guides of the travelling pen.          When traction was made by
the sound the pen was drawn upwards, its elevation being directly
proportional to the extent of withdrawal of the sound from the lower
pulley.
     For each observation the dog was placed on its side with the
 fistulous opening opposite to and at the same level as the lower pulley;
the sound was introduced into the upper fistulous opening, the upper
pulley raised so that the pen was drawn upwards for a few centimetres
from its support,* and the drum arranged so as to leave the whole
    * The respiratory movements were to some extent communicated to the pen con
 nected with the sound. By means of two Marey's tambours the number of respira
tions was usually written at the same time as the curre of intestinal movement.

breadth    of its recording surface available for registration, when the
pen should be raised by passage of the sound more deeply into the
fistula. A slow rotation of the drum, usually one revolution in
about 17', was employed.
   There is no purpose in separating the resnlfcs according to varia
tion in the experimental method, especially as the fixed sound and the
travelling sound were employed with one or two unimportant excep
tions in each class of experiment.
   It may be stated generally that although during a condition of
fasting occasional contractions make themselves manifest, the record
obtained from a fixed sound sunk 4 cm. into the fistulous intestine
shows that periods of complete quiescence are the rule, and movement
(as evidenced by contraction around the sound) the exception.        When
a period or phase of peristaltic activity begins, the first contraction
manifests itself, usually by a faint impulse communicated from the
sound of the registering apparatus.       This is generally succeeded by a
series of waves of uniform frequency, but varying in their extent.
The repetition of the contractions may, however, show a slight varia
tion ; thus, during the first part of a phase the wave contractions
may be at first eight in a minute, then nine, and again eight before
cessation.
    The following notes fairly indicate the phase of quiescence and of
contraction occurring in the intestine.
                            Experiment Records.

5 mm.), was introduced into the upper fistulous opening; the animal
had not fed for fourteen hours, and was evidently hungry.

         strongly for 2' ; faint contraction for the succeeding 3'.
   31"5' to 39'5'. Rest, except for very faint contractions which may
         have been communicated         by a loop of adjacent intestine.

         for 3'.

                     On Intestinal Rest and Movement.                   217
    53"5' to 91'. There have been three series of contractions,  lasting in
         all 12'.  Two of these were preceded by swallowing, which in
         the first case was spontaneons, and in the second resulted from
         rnbbing the larynx.
   Total in 91'. — In this experiment made upon the fasting animal, out
of a total of 91' active intestinal contraction was present during 9',
faint contractions for 19' more, and the intestine was at rest for the
remainder of the time, i.e., 63'. One-half of the series of contrac
tions were preceded by spontaneous or induced acts of deglutition.
   It cannot be demonstrated by the fixed sound method that the con
tractions are any more than local contractions, but as the occurrence
of these for any length of time greater than 1' or 2' is very excep
tional, and is almost always a prelude to propagated contraction, we
may assume with certainty that many of the long-continued phases of
contraction were propagative, or in other words they would have
propelled the sound downwards if it had been movable.
   From simple observation of the fistul6us opening made immediately
afterwards, no sound having been introduced, I found that the number
of the series of contractions were in the two cases equal, but that in
the sound experiment their duration was slightly longer.
   An experiment made during a condition of hunger, but with a
travelling sound, will now be recorded.

    19'. Started in sleep and awoke.              The loop of intestine was evi
          dently twisted or moved away from former position (roll move
          ment) to which it shortly returned ; again sleeping.
    21' 5''.- Roused. Deep respiration with slight peristalsis.
    33'. Propulsive peristalsis, strong and regular.
             Dog roused just before expulsion of sound from the lower
          opening.     (The meat was not in the least degree digested.)
    It  will be observed that during sleep the sound continues to travel
forwards with considerable regularity.              In all 12 cm. of the fistulous
intestine    is traversed in forty minutes.
    The experiments of Ranvier have shown that if a travelling sound
which is passing down the oesophagus be hindered in its transit by
traction being exerted upon a thread connected with it, the contrac
tions become inoperative, i.e., fail to forward the body, and then
cease, the muscular tube becoming
                                                 " accustomed " to its
                                                                             presence.
The same holds good if we introduce a moderately large sound into
the intestinal fistula and allow it to travel.             The fact of its introduc
tion and presence favours its passage onwards for a certain distance
with considerable rapidity ; but if gentle traction be made on the
thread after a period of active but futile contraction,* rest occurs and
no advancement takes place till a new phase of activity develops itself.
   * These contractions    are  local. I  have hardly    ever  seen them pass the bodv
whose presence is to a large degree the cause of their occurrence and travel to a lower
part of the intestinal tube.

It  is thus  that during a fasting condition, the sound heing uurestrained,
the    first part of the fistulous intestine is traversed rapidly ; but that
afterwards a marked diminution in speed occurs, whilst with a smaller
sound moving freely, or a larger sound restrained for a time, the rapid
initial peristalsis would not be observed.

   Effect of Feeding.
                       — I will now turn to the effect produced upon the
fasting intestine by the introduction of food into the stomach.       The
method of experimentation will be at once apparent.
   A fixed or travelling sound was introduced through the fistula, and
the condition of the fasting intestine, as regards its movement, was
recorded. At a noted time the dog, whose head had been kept covered
with a cloth, had a series of pieces of meat given to it which it rapidly
swallowed without changing its position on the table.       (The covering
of the head was a necessary precaution which I adopted in almost all
the observations in order that this experimental procedure should not
be associated in the mind of the animal with the administration of
food only ; for if the dog saw meat when in a condition of hunger, or
had its proximity suggested in any way, it was sufficient to produce
an active though frequently transitory contraction in the fistulous
gut.)
   The notes of the following experiment which was made when the
animal was showing unmistakeable indications of hunger, will illus
trate the modification in an already existing peristalsis on the intro
duction of food into the stomach.
   Experiment IV (Curve III). —

         and rapidly swallowed.
   10'. Intestine quiet, except for faint local movements around the
         sound.

 traction is easily estimated.     It is then found that the intestine from
 a condition of entire rest or very faint contraction frequently passes
 with great rapidity to a state of powerful and regular propulsive con
 traction.
    If the movement be registered by a stationary sound connected with
 a manometer, the course of the contractions occurring at the part of
 the fistulous intestine surrounding the bladder is recorded.      It will be
 observed then that the individual contractions develop gradually to a
 maximum, and thereafter decline rapidly, their rhythm or rate of
 recurrence being very constant throughout.
 Experiment V, Curve IV. — Administration            of Meat to Fasting
       Animal during Absence of Contraction of Intestine (fixed sound
       and mercurial manometer).
    Experiment V (Curve IV). — Dog fasting, sound, moderately dis
 tended with water, introduced 3 cm. into upper fistulous opening.
 The contraction round the sound as a result of its introduction
and extension occurred regularly at the rate of ten for 1'.            After
spontaneous movement had ceased the smell of the meat produced
 excitement with distinct contractions, which did not entirely disappear
for   3' 30".
    0' 0". When rest had again intervened, a small piece of meat
          weighing 5 grams was given.
    1' 30". Another piece of the same size.           Both of these were
          swallowed the instant they were presented.
    1' 45". Contraction commenced at the rate of seven in 40".
    3' 20". Active contractions     reached their maximum.      Some tonic
          contraction is still seen between active compression of the
          sound, so that the curve remains elevated above the abscissa.
    4' 16". The active contractions which had been declining markedly
          for 30" came to an end, and were succeeded by a series of short
          waves which lasted for 1' till at
    5' 16". The intestine came to rest.
   Five minutes later a piece of meat was again offered, faint move
ment being present at the time, the maximum of the powerful con
tractions was reached in 40", in exact correspondence with the
former experiment.       In the first result there were nineteen well

                     On Intestinal Best and Movement.                      223
 marked contractions,   having approximately a maximal value          ; in the
second there were seventeen.                      ,
   After the lapse of another five minutes, the administration of
another piece of meat failed to arouse any contractions.
   Immediately after a full meal a travelling sound introduced into the
upper fistulous opening is forwarded by a powerful and regular peri
stalsis to the lower opening and promptly expelled, no marked halt
occurring during the passage.        Not only do the local contractions
manifest themselves to a striking extent, but writhing, &c., rolling
movements (" Roll-Bewegungen ") of the fistulous intestine are also
observed.     It is during this period that the most rapid propulsion of
the sound occurs, relaxation between the contractions is very imper
fect, the sound being held without marked retrogression till the next
powerful wave drives it onwards.
   The presence of abundant peristalsis in the small intestines gener
ally is evidenced by borborygmi and movement communicated to the
abdominal parietes.       The increase of secretion which is extruded
from the lower fistulons opening, and to a much smaller extent from
the upper opening, is very apparent.
   I select two experiments for illustration.

     The last experiment was made with a metal capsule, and in order
 to show that the nature of the sound has no marked influence upon
 the rapidity of propulsion immediately after food has been introduced
 into the stomach, I shall quote the results obtained when the meat
 sound employed in Experiment                    II  was substituted for the metal
 capsule. It will be seen that whether the body to be forwarded by
 peristaltic movement be incompressible or soft and plastic, the result
 obtained is practically the same.

fistulous intestine is fairly regular and rapid.   There is, however,
more tendency to occasional pauses and to the development of local
non-propulsive movement which often inaugurate a phase of peristal
tic activity.  Pour or five hours after a meal and until the recurrence
            —
of hunger period of repletion — the progression of a solid body
through the fistula is at its slowest, long pauses being frequently
observed without the occurrence of any propelling contractions.
   Even when peristalsis is occurring it is slow, and has much of a
forward and backward character, complete relaxation behind the

dealing with the speed of transmission of a solid body during fasting
(hunger), digestion, repletion, &c, may be found useful for purposes
of comparison.    The average time for each centimetre of the intestine
traversed is not of course of absolute value.

peristalsis of introduction was much less marked.     After the period
of activity had passed, the time occupied in the transit through the

             Changes    in Character        of   Peristaltic Contractions.
  It   is not my purpose at the present time to enter into a minute
examination of the character of individual peristaltic contractions
occurring under various circumstances, although               have alluded to
                                                                   I
this question very briefly on page 214. As, however, the consideration
of peristalsis, stimulated by the introduction of a large sound into the
fistula, has been brought under notice,          can scarcely omit contrasting
                                                   I
the nature of    the  waves produced     in this manner (and which are very
similar to those occurring in all portions of the fasting intestine), and
the digestive peristalsis occurring in the same animal half an hour
after a full meal.

velocity, that the contractions occurring in the first (fasting) condition
are much more numerous in         a   given time, frequently nearly twice as
many    as in the  latter;  that  the individual contractions have     shortera
maximum which      is   attained more quickly, and that their relaxation               is
 more abrupt and complete.         As a result we find that in spite of the
 greater number of contractions the sound advances further in the
 same time after food than       it  did when food had not been recently
 administered.     Some hours after the meal the change             even more
                                                                         is
 striking, long periods of     rest  occurring which are from time to time
  bi'oken bya   few faint contractions, having a sustained maximum and
  an imperfect relaxation.

        20" to 60", and are succeeded by pauses of several minutes'
        duration.
   This change in the rhytbm, character, and potentiality of the
peristaltic contractions shows how extensive the range of adaptation
of these movements to the necessities of the time must be.

      Direction,                                               Fistulous
                 of Propulsion of Bodies introduced into   the
                                   Openings.
   The result of an examination of this question experimentally may
be given in few words.
   Peristaltic progression in the fistulous intestine is always in the
physiological direction. If the sound be placed well within the lower
mouth, it is invariably rejected from this mouth.         Very occasionally
a sound introduced just within the upper mouth, but not far enough
to be thoroughly      " gripped,"
                                   may be expelled by the same opening,
but after it has passed 2 cm. into the fistula, this retrogression is
never seen.       A slight anti-peristaltic movement observed on the
introduction of water into the fistula will be described below.
              Two Solid Bodies  in the Fistula at the same Time.
   This experiment was performed with a double sound and register
ing apparatus.      The second sound, which was introduced after the
first had passed several centimetres into the fistula, was perforated
for the free passage of the thread connecting the latter with its pen.
It was found that the condition of peristalsis or local contraction was
not necessarily common to the whole length of the fistulous intestine,
and that therefore movement of one sound occurs frequently quite
independently of the other which lies within a few centimetres of it.
On several occasions a distinct alternation in movement was observed,
one sound resting whilst the other advanced.           The first sound, i.e.,
that nearest the lower opening of the fistula, seemed usually to travel
more rapidly than the other, and therefore to gain upon it. This
fact may speak for a slight stimulation originated by the presence of
the upper sound when at rest, favouring a more pronounced peri
stalsis lower down the intestinal tube.      Upon this point I am seeking
 for farther information.
    The introduction of water or almost any liquid, whether cold or at
 the body temperature, into the upper end of the fistula through
 which the sound had already passed, was invariably productive of
 some slight anti-peristaltic movement often associated with writhing
 or rolling of the intestine, the result being a retrogression of 2 or
 3 cm.    This reversed movement, which lasted for 2' to 5', was suc
 ceeded by a return of propulsive peristalsis which frequently showed
 a marked acceleration.

230                On Intestinal Rest and Movement.
                       Experiment    IX,  Cnrve    VIII.
                              Reduced scale = £th.
    Experiment IX (Cnrve VIII). — Injection of 5 c.c. of water at the
fourth minute into the upper fistulous opening, peristalsis being
present, caused on the first occasion a relaxation lasting for 4', and on
the second, between the twelfth and thirteenth minutes, for 2', the
pen falling 18 mm.       After each of these injections the peristalsis
became for a time more active.
        Propulsion of a Sound upon which Traction is being Exerted.
    If the pen were weighted with a burden of 8 or 10 grams at a time,
when the sound was being passed onwards by well-developed peri
staltic movement it was found that not only was the portion of
intestine in which the travelling body was situated at the moment
drawn towards the mouth of the fistula, but that the powerful con
tractions which occurred were incapable of materially forwarding the
body.     Even the traction caused by applying a weight of 5 grams to
the pen produced much hindrance, and the spasmodic contractions
induced and which had a propulsive character created a most distinct
 discomfort or colic.     After the removal of the hindrance to effective
 transmission, the intestine unfolded itself, whilst the discomfort gave
 place to the most evident manifestations of satisfaction on the part of
 the dog, and active peristalsis — which was, however, soon reduced to
 its orginal character — took place.
    In contrasting this experiment with the well-known result obtained
 by Mosso, who observed that the oesophagus could hold a sound con
 nected with a falling weight which exerted a traction of 450 grams,
 and forward one of but little less, the rectilineal course of the tube,
 and the fact that it is practically fixed at both ends— in both of which
 respects it acts at a far greater advantage than the intestine — must be
 borne in mind.     I possess evidence, however, which I hope to be in a
 position to produce shortly, that even if these unfavourable conditions
 are obviated, the small intestine is physiologically unfitted for the
 systematic    propulsion of bodies upon which more than a very

               On   the Practical Measurements      of   Temperature.         231
moderate degree of traction is made.              Fortunately this condition of
traction upon a solid body already engaged in the intestinal tube can
bnt rarely come into operation in the animal body, or it would un
doubtedly prove peculiarly difficult to overcome.
    Mechanical irritation of the lower mouth or upper mouth of the
fistulous intestine, if persisted in, developed a powerful peristalsis
which caused the rapid passage of a solid body through the fistula
and its expulsion by the lower opening.                Thus if the animal was
induced    —                             —
               which it readily was to lick the mouth of the fistula
after the sound had been inserted in the upper opening, expulsion
from the lower opening occurred in four to eight minutes.                      By
moving       a  glass  rod — passed  within  the  mouth   of the  fistula — gently
round or in and outwards, the same result was occasionally pro
duced, but not with the same speed or certainty.
    The consideration of the effect of electrical stimulation and of a
number of drugs, upon whose action I believe new light will be
 thrown by this method of experimentation,             I  must leave to a future
paper.
    I have purposely avoided        entering into a discussion of the physio
 logical rationale of the various phenomena            I  have described in this
 communication, because they cannot find their full explanation in the
 examination of a fistulous animal. This explanation must be sought
 by experiment of another character, and although much has been
 rendered clear to me by the analytical research I have already made,
 other points are still lacking their complete elucidation. Until the
 latter research appears,      I likewise postpone reference to the literature
 of  the  subject.
    To the Royal Society, which presented me with a donation in aid of
  this research, and to Prof. Hugo Kronecker, of Berne, who most kindly
  placed his laboratory at my disposal for its accomplishment, my best
  thanks are due, and      I gladly take this opportunity of recording them.

the temperature Centigrade by platinum wire, agree to 0'1 per cent,
through the range 0 — 600°.
   The method of comparing the temperature variations of different
wires is very accurate.     The wires to be compared are interwound
symmetrically so as to form a double screw thread on non-conducting
material (e.g., clay), and are heated in a vacuous porcelain tube in a
gas furnace regulated to produce steady temperatures.            When the
temperature is steady we may assume that the mean temperatures of
the two wires are accurately the same.      The simultaneous resistances
are measured by the Wheatstone bridge method with a sensitive mirror
galvanometer and resistance boxes accurate to 0'01 per cent.           The
comparison of two similar pure platinum wires might be effected
with even greater accuracy than O'Ol per cent, by using a wire bridge
(Carey Foster's method), since the ratio of their resistance is very
nearly constant (variation perhaps 2 per cent, between 0° and 600°),
and all sources of error affect both wires equally. The resistance of
the connecting wires at each steady temperature is measured and
allowed for, and thermoelectric effects are carefnlly eliminated : as a
precaution the insulation is also measured.
   It is evident then that by adopting one wire as the standard and
comparing others with             it,
                              temperature measurements may be made
strictly comparable through a very wide range, since the platinum
thermometer       almost universally applicable, and
                  is                                          usually more

convenient, sensitive, and accurate than any other kind.         The chief
objection  to its use    the
                           is need of auxiliary apparatus    for accurately
measuring the resistance     its great superiority lies in its wide range,

its freedom from zero error, and its adaptability.     A length of wire                  is

   Comparisons were also made between the platinum pyrometer
and the air thermometer at constant mass and volume up to nearly
600° C.   By enclosing the fine platinum spiral inside the bulb of the
air thermometer itself, errors of unequal heating were to a great
extent avoided. A modified form of air thermometer was devised for
the purpose, in which the air is confined at constant volume by sul
phuric acid in an auxiliary gauge which is connected to the mercury
manometer by vulcanised rubber tube.          For the high temperature
observations the bulb was made of a combustion glass tubing which
does not soften till 700° C. ; the linear expansion of this kind of glass
was determined     by a very accurate method, in which the mean
temperature of the glass tube is given by a platinum wire extending
down its axis.    It was found that if kept for any time at about
500" C., or higher, the glass bulb is liable to capricious changes of
volume amounting to about 0-l per cent, or more ; by a slight and
convenient modification of the sulphuric acid gauge such changes
may be determined on the principle of the volumometer and allowed
for. By avoiding the permanent change the linear expansion could
be represented           by the formula     A=l + -00000680*+ 27.             l0"9*2,   with
a mean  error of 0'2 per cent, per single observation. Among other
sources of error affecting the air thermometer at these temperatures
we may mention surface condensation.       It seems certain that the
surface air film varies with the temperature, and when completely
removed by exhaustion at a high temperature does not recover its
normal state for some time, so that the zero pressure may decrease
upwards of a millimetre of mercury in a week.    The investigation of
 this   is,   however,      still incomplete.
   The results of all the observations with three different instruments
 are well represented          by the formula

calculated    temperature by platinum wire, as this involves no assump
tion and different wires nearly agree. It is from a thermometric point
 of view that the method above described of comparing different
wires with the standard is most valuable : but it might also be em
ployed to form very accurate comparative tables of the change of
resistance with temperature for different metals referred to platinum
as a standard.         Such tables would, however, be of little use apart
from the actual specimens of metal employed, except in so far as they
tended to elucidate the general phenomenon                    of the variation of
resistance with temperature. With this view a comparison was made
between platinum and iron, the resistance variation of which metal
appeared likely from previous observations                 to differ widely from
that of platinum. The curve deduced resembled the steam pressure
curve, and suggested the formula*

A formula of      the same type was found to satisfy the air thermometer

   The chief difficulty of the comparison is that of protecting the iron
•wire from alteration when it is maintained at a red heat for some
time.     The following Table, II, gives some observations selected at
random from a long series in which the zero variation of the iron did
not exceed O05 per cent. The observations were mostly taken on
different days ; and the resistances observed at the air temperature
in the intervals show the direction in which the correction for zero
variation should be applied, but not its amonnt.             It is noteworthy
that in all   cases   the   correction    for  this would tend  to reduce the
small differences between the formula (e) and the observations.            As
it is, the mean difference is only 0o-l C.
   It does not appear that any other equally simple and convenient
formula could be found representing the observations equally well.
   Treating the observations on the comparison of two platinum wires
in precisely the same way, we shall find for the values of the constants,

" The Determination of Organic Matter in Air."

       fessor Thos. Caknelley, D.Sc, and W.M. Mackie, M.A.,
       University College, Dundee.              Communicated by Sir H. E.
       Roscoe, F.R.S. Received June 10. Read June 10, 1886.
   The only methods hitherto proposed for determining the amount of
organic matter in air are the two devised by the late Dr. Angus Smith
 ("Air and Rain"). According to the first of these methods, a defi
nite quantity of the air to be examined is slowly bubbled through a
dilute solution of potassium permanganate of known strength until it
is fully or considerably bleached, and in the latter case the amount of
undecomposed        permanganate        determined by oxalic acid.     In the
second method       a  known volume of air is bubbled through distilled
water, and the latter examined for free and albuminoid ammonia by
Wanklyn and Chapman's process for water analysis.

                The Determination      of Organic Matter in Air.             239
     These methods are open to one or more of the following               objec
 tions  : —
    1.  The time required for a single determination is very considerable,
and    recessarily varies with the amonnt of organic matter present.
    2. There is great uncertainty as to whether the organic matter has
been fully absorbed and acted on by the permanganate                in the first
method, or absorbed by the water in the second.
    3. It is difficult to determine the exact point of fall bleaching, or
to estimate by oxalic acid very small degrees of partial bleaching.
    4. The methods are inapplicable (chiefly on the score of time and of
the extent and complication of the apparatus required) in circum
stances     and places where such determinations are most desirable.
Analyses, especially by the second method, cannot be completed on
the spot, except in very rare cases, so that unless a large quantity of
apparatus be taken, several consecutive determinations            in a series of
buildings or rooms is impossible (c/. De Chaumont, 'Roy. Soc. Proc.,'
vol. 23, 1875).
    5.  The results obtained by the method proposed below show that
very considerable        variations in the organic matter are sometimes
liable to occur within the period of determination required by
Dr. Angus Smith's method.
    By the new process, which it is the object of the present paper to.
describe, the above difficulties are in a great measure overcome.            The
special advantages we claim for it are : — (1.) Rapidity and simplicity
of execution.        (2.) A higher probability, though not absolute cer
tainty,   that   the organic matter is fully absorbed.     (3.) A more general
applicability.
    The ¦principle of the process is the same as that of Angus Smith's
first method, viz., reduction of potassium permanganate.              It differs,
however, from Smith's method, more particularly in the mode of
estimating the amount of reduction.             This consists in determining
colorimetrically, by comparison       with  a standard, the fractional bleach
ing effected in a given volume of air.

which 1 c.c.     = 0'008 mgrm. of oxygen = 0'0000056 litre of oxygen at
0"  and 760 mm.          It is usually kept of   — strength, and diluted as
required, about 50 c.c. of dilute sulphuric acid (1 to 6) being added
to each litre of the weak solution.
    For the collection of the samples of air large well-stoppered jars of
about 3'5    litres capacity are used.     The jars are first rinsed out with
 a little standard permanganate, and when not in use some of the solu
 tion is always left in them, so as to ensure complete cleanliness from
  any reducing substance.         Before use the jars are drained, and the

sample of air collected by pumping out the contained air -with a small
bellows, and allowing the air to be examined to flow in. 50 c.c. of the
standard permanganate are next run into the jar, which is then tightly
stoppered and well shaken up for at least five minutes.  25 c.c. of the
permanganate   are afterwards withdrawn by a pipette and placed in a
glass cylinder holding about 200 c.c, 25 c.c. of the standard solution
being  placed in a similar cylinder for comparison.      Both are next
diluted np to about 150 c.c. with distilled water, and allowed to stand
for ten minutes, after which the tints in the two cylinders are com
pared.    Standard solution is then run in from a burette, until the
tints in both cylinders are of the same intensity ; usually from     to    |
6 c.c. are required.
   The amount of solution added from the burette is a measure of the
bleaching effected by the known volume of air on half the perman
ganate employed.     This multiplied by 2 gives the total bleaching.
   The results may be expressed either in terms of the number of c.c.
of the          bleached by   1   litre of air, or, as we prefer, by the number
         jqqq
of volumes of oxygen required to oxidise the organic matter in, say,
1,000,000 volumes of air ; e.g., 25 c.c. of solution from a 3'5 litre jar,
in which 50 c.c. had been used, required 3 c.c. of the permanganate to
bring it up to the standard, or the whole 50 c.c. would have required
3x2=6 c.c. This represents the number of c.c. of standard perman-
ganate bleached       by 3500—50=3450 c.c.       of air; consequently   ^rjg=
1'74 c.c. is the bleaching effected by      1 litre of air.   But 1 c.c. of
KHnO4=0-0000056        litre of  oxygen; .-.1-74   c.c. KMn04= 0-0000056
X 1-74= 0-0000097 litre of oxygen is required to oxidise the organic
matter in 1 litre of air, or 9" 7 volumes of oxygen to oxidise the organic
matter in 1,000,000 volumes of air.
   Correction for temperature was not considered necessary, as it falls
within the limits of experimental error. It requires about twenty
minutes to collect the samples and complete the analysis.       Scrupulous
cleanliness     is,
                of courso, necessary in all the operations.
   We have examined many hundreds of samples of air by this method,
and in this large experience of        have found

venient and ready process.        We believe       to be as accurate as
                                                  it                           is
possible in the present state of the knowledge of this subject.     Dupli
cate analyses of the same air give very concordant results, as evidenced
by the examples given below. We are nevertheless fully conscious
that objections may be taken to the method on the following grounds            :
— (1.) That     does not directly estimate the organic matter, but only
                it
measures the amount of oxygen required to oxidise either the whole,
or more probably only a portion of it. (2.) That the permanganate
acts upon various matters in the air, besides the organic matter,

snch as sulphuretted hydrogen,      nitrous acid, sulphurous acid, &c.
(3.) That the organic matter in    air is of various kinds, and that con
sequently the permanganate     will   most probably be selective in its
action. Our knowledge on this point, however, is so defective that
no definite conclusion is possible in regard to it.      (4.) There is no
satisfactory means  of checking   the  results, the only method being to
make duplicate determinations of the same air.       This test, such as it
is,the method stands extremely well, as will be seen from the results
given below, which are taken quite promiscuously from                large                                 a

method, however, does not claim to give absolute, but only relative
results.
  In the general lack of better methods we trust that the modification
of the permanganate process we have described will be found of great
value, on account of its extreme simplicity and rapidity of execution,

    Conclusions. — The following conclusions are deduced from a large
number of analyses.           The individual data are usually the mean of two
duplicate determinations.
    (1.) The quantity of organic matter in outside air varies considerably,
within certain limits, from day to day, and from hour to hour on the
same day.
    Variations     from day to day are subject to the conditions of the
weather.

rain or snow, thus : —

    The above results refer only to ordinary week days, and do not
 include Saturday and Sunday, which are not normal days in a large
 town.     On several occasions an important decrease was noted towards

      (3.) A     relation of organic matter to carbonic acid in outside air
 shows, so       far as the tabulated results go, a high carbonic acid accom
panied by a high organic matter, and vice versd.                    This, however, is by
no means invariably the case, and is in fact only evident on comparing
the averages of a large number of cases.                    To show this all the deter
minations which have been made in outside air were divided into
four groups, according to the quantity of organic matter present, and

     (4.) The organic matter in outside air has a far wider range of
variations than carbonic acid. For whereas the carbonic acid seldom
passes beyond the limits of 2 to 6 vols, per 10,000, the organic
matter varies from a quantity too small to estimate to as much as
will require for oxidation about 16 vols, of oxygen per 1,000,000
vols, of air.
     It is also subject to more rapid fluctuation in its value than
carbonic acid.
     (o.) The combustion           of gas       does   not    appreciably increase the
amount of organic matter in air.                 This was proved by burning gas in
 a small practically air-tight room
                                                  (which had previously been well
 ventilated, and the carbonic acid and organic matter determined),

for   a certain length of time, and then making a determination of the
carbonic acid and organic matter in the air thus vitiated.                        Tfae
following is an example of a number of experiments all giving similar
results   : —

    The combustion of gas may therefore be considered too perfect
to produce any appreciable effect. What result ia obtained may
safely be set to the credit of sulphurous acid.
   The above remarks apply to Dundee gas, which is considered to be
exceptionally pure and free from sulphur.
    (6.) Combustion of Oil Lamps. — The effect of burning oil lamps is
much more marked than that of the combustion of gas. This was
determined in a manner similar to that in the case of coal-gas, the
experiments being carried out in the same practically air-tight room
as before.       The following will serve as an example : —
                                                   Organic matter (O required per

as full as possible without smoking.

   (7.) Respiration. Respired air gives a higher result than un-

    The effect of respiration was determined as follows : — The observer

definite intervals the carbonic acid and organic matter present in the
air of the room were determined, the analyses being made in the
room     itself so as to avoid opening the door. The room heing un
provided with outside light, one gas jet was kept burning during the
whole of the experiments, but the effect of this on the organic matter
may     be neglected, for, as previously shown, the combustion of coal
gas does not appreciably increase the amount of organic matter.               The
results obtained are shown below :        —

    Here it is seen that the amount of organic matter becomes greater
 as the period of vitiation increases, but very much less slowly, so that
 the increase in the quantity of organic matter is by no means pro
 portional to the time. It also increases less rapidly than the carbonic
 acid.
    (8.)    An atmosphere which has been entirely at rest for some time is
 found to contain less organic matter than it did previously.            This is
 not necessarily entirely due to the settling down of the solid organic
  dust, but is probably due in part to oxidation.
     The statement made in ' Nature ' (vol. 33, 1886, p. 130), in an
  article on ventilation, to the effect that the organic matter in respired
  air increases pari passu with, and is therefore estimated by the amount
  of carbonic acid present, may be true when the average of a large
  number of determinations is taken, but is certainly very far from
  being true in individual cases.      At any rate the amount of carbonic
  acid is no certain index of the quantity of organic matter present in
  an atmosphere (see above).        That air in which respiration has gone
  on for some time gives invariably a higher result than outside air at
  or about the same time is all that can be confidently affirmed.
     It should not be forgotten that the organic matter in air is most
  probably partly solid and partly gaseous.             The solid obeying a
  different law than diffusion slowly settles down, whilst the gaseous
  part, unlike carbonic acid, is most likely an unstable compound or
  eompounds,     and readily undergoes oxidation.          Experiments were
  made in regard to this, but they did not give decisive results.

       J. Joly,   B.E., Assistant to the Professor of Civil Engineer

     A  substance   at   the  initial   temperature           of the atmosphere,
 suddenly immersed in a saturated vapour at the higher temperature
 ts°, abstracts from it a quantity of heat-equal to WC(/S°-                where
 C is the thermal capacity of the substance between the limits
 and t2°, and W its weight.        There is then a weight w of the vapour
 precipitated, so that
                               WG(t2°-t1°)=w\,
 \  being the latent heat of the vapour.
     By the observation of the weights and the temperatures, either c or
 \   may be the unknowns sought from the equation.                 The method is,
 in short, applicable      to the determination of the specific heat of a
 substance or the latent heat of a vapour.
     The paper contains an account of experiments illustrating the
  application of this method of condensation to the determination of
  the specific  heats of substances.        The condensation of steam is em.
  ployed, its latent heat being accurately        known, and its use affording

a   considerable range of temperature.             Two forms of the apparatus
employed are described.           The calorimeter consists essentially of a
vessel of thin metal in which the substance is suspended by a fine
wire, the wire issuing through an aperture in the top of the vessel and
reaching up to one arm of a balance.               The vessel is so constructed
that steam can be passed through it from a small boiler, displacing
the air around the substance.           The substance rests on a light carrier
of platinum wire provided with a little catchwater beneath to receive
the drops of condensed water.
   The manipulation involved is very simple. The substance being
placed on the carrier which depends from the balance, is counterpoised.
The calorimeter is then closed around it, the suspending wire passing
freely through the aperture provided.             This aperture is formed in an
absorptive     material  (plaster   of  Paris),  which  ensures that it remains
free of precipitated water.         A thermometer reading to T\y degree G.
is inserted in the calorimeter, and allowed to remain with the substance
 for an interval sufficient to secure close equilibrium of temperature.
 The thermometer being read is removed, and the calorimeter suddenly
placed in connexion with the boiler, which supplies, a brisk current
of steam and fills it immediately.           It then remains to note the incre
 ment of weight when the substance has finally attained the tempera
 ture of the vapour. This stage is revealed in the persistent equilibrium,
 of the balance.    i2°    observed directly by a thermometer inserted in
                          is
 the boiler, or deduced by noting the height of the barometer and
 seeking the corresponding temperature               of saturated steam from
 Regnault's tables.      A correction is    applied to the weight observed in
 experiment, necessitated by the difference of the weights of the dis
 placement of the substance in air and in steam.            In accurate experi
 ments the value of\       iscorrected according to Regnault's formula for
its trae value at t2°.
    The method    is    convenient     for the reasons that     it   involves no
 preparations as in Bunsen's change of state method, no delicate
 thermometry, and the calorimeter being roomy permits of bodies of
 various shapes and bulks being dealt with.            The apparatus, too,      of
                                                                               is
a  simple  and  durable   nature.
   The experiments quoted in support of the method are (1) on the
 metallic elements, zinc, silver, lead, platinum, and aluminium.             The
results are in accord with those of Regnault, Bede, Mallett, &c.             The;
 degree  of  consistency   between     the  experiments  is  greater   than  that
attained in Regnault's researches.          (2) On pure water sealed in thin
glass  bulbs.   The   results  agree   closely  with the values deduced from
Regnault's formula.        (3) On mineral substances in various states of
aggregation.      It  appears from these that the result          is   but little
influenced by the extent of surface exposed to the steam.
    The accuracy displayed by the method       is   explained   on the probably
                                                                       S   2

supposition that the substance is throughout the period of heating
coated with a film of water adiathermanons and the external surface
of which may be considered as appreciably that of the steam.        The
danger then of radiation error, that is, of steam condensing elsewhere
than at the surface of the substance, is small.  Condensation, in short,
may be considered as taking place by abstraction of the energy of the
molecule on impact with the water film.
II.       " On the Specific        Heats of Minerals." By J. Joly, B.E.,
           Assistant to the        Professor of Civil Engineering, Trinity
           College, Dublin.        Communicated by Professor Fitzgerald,
           F.R.S. Received             June   28, 1886.
     A number of experiments              were made on minerals by the method
of condensation, using the form of gravimetric calorimeter described
in the beginning of the paper on calorimetry (p. 353). The con
densation of steam being in all cases employed, the values recorded
are the mean specific   heats between atmospheric temperatures ap
proximating to          and
                       12°   C,
                             steam temperature, about 100° C.      More
exactly, the values recorded are the mean calorific capacities for a rise
of one degree between the limits tl and       tabulated in each case.

The specimens dealt with were chosen as good samples of the mineral
free from visible impnrities.* . But before detailing the particulars of
the experiments a few notes on the discriminative value and physical
interest attached to this application of calorimetry may not be amiss.            +
     It   seems     probable that the neglect of the use of the specific heat
constant      is   to be ascribed to the difficulties besetting its determina
tion. Certainly       its determination was as easily effected as we
                        if
effect the determination of the specific gravity of a body, there are
6n the other hand sufficient reasons to recommend           its use as in
general of more physical      value  and  interest than the much used
Specific gravity.  There   are  cases indeed  where specific gravity, as         it
is possible to obtain it,   misleading, and where specific heat gives at
                                  is
once valuable information on the probable chemical nature of the
substance.    Such cases would arise with bodies of loose vesicular or
hollow strnctu.re.   No misleading variations need be introduced into
the thermal constant by mere conditions of volume.
   The method of condensation permits of the determination of this
constant with very little experimental difficulty.     On the whole the
  *  I hare to thank Professor Sollas for the loan of useful specimens from the
Museum of Trinity College.

 process is involved with ho more liability to error than the process
of    weighing a body in air and in water.              If, however, accuracy
— greater     than   1  per cent. — be desired, the operation takes con
siderably more time, as it is necessary, in securing tx accurately,
to leave thermometer and specimen a sufficient time together in
the calorimeter. The simplicity of the method is perhaps best in
ferred from the fact that of over 130 experiments on minerals there
were but three spoiled — due to mishaps ; and it will be seen that the
repetition experiments reveal in no case appreciable discrepancy.
     That this specific heat constant is very sensitive to the presence of
impurities or variations in the chemical nature of the substance can
 not be considered a disadvantage.         It is supposable that this might
lead occasionally to useful enquiry.         This sensitiveness is shown in
the case of tourmaline. Of three specimens the specific heats
were —
              Hemihedral, black crystal                   = O2000
               Striated, black crystal                    = 0-2008
              Hemihedral, brown crystal                   = 0-2111
              The same, a second experiment        ....   = 0'2112
The variation from the black to the brown is over 5 per cent. Now
tourmaline experiences considerable variations in the two con
stituents iron and magnesium.           Approximately in percentage com
position according to Dana's table of analyses —
                                                 FeO.      Fe,03.    MgO.

which in view of the high molecular heat of magnessia and the low
molecular heats of the oxides of iron would acconut for the differences
in the experiments.        It will be seen later in the particulars of these
experiments that the densities of these crystals also, in a less degree,
reveal the difference in composition.
    Again attention is suggestively drawn by the thermal constant to
the chemical compositions of the first two of theqe three aerolites
from the Museum of Trinity College.

    The specific    gravities, too, of the first couple, are found to be
 identical, thus: (1) =3604; (2) =3-601; (3) =3435.                  The experi
 ments, in  fact,  evidently afford strong reasons       for  believing that the
 first two aerolites constitute a case of the strange similarity alluded

  plus complete, de telle sorte qn'il est impossible d'en distingner les
  echantillons respectifs."* He adds a list of the few such occurrences
  known.
     It   is an important feature that the value of the thermal constant
  admits of being approximately, sometimes closely, calculated on an
  assumed chemical composition, and thus can be used in identification
 where       comparative data do not exist or are not at hand. This fact
  rests on the experimental basis that the specific heat of the atom is
 preserved nearly constant through various atomic groupings. This
 applies indeed, only so far as the specific heats of the elements have
 been determined in the solid state ; when the generalisation is
applied to molecules containing elements whose specific heats as
 solids have never been directly determined it ceases to be accurate,
 and it appears at present as if in each kind of grouping a particular
 thermal capacity must be assigned to the atom.                             Approximate
 values     of  these   thermal    capacities    have,   however,    been   calculated by
 Kopp and others, and thus it is possible in all cases to pronounce for
 or against an hypothesis as to the nature of a substance, and this not
 alone in the case of simple salts, but when dealing with the silicates
where many different kinds of atoms are present.
    In the case of the bisilicate beryl, for example, the most probable
formula is 5BeO,2Al203,H20,llSi03.t Of these molecules the specific
heat of BeO has alone not been directly determined.                              We take
for the specific         heat  of    Be   O430,J     and   taking the atomic heat of
solid oxygen as 4-5 — the value it affords approximately in com
pounds having the constitution                    RO§ — we assume its sp. h. in
the molecule to be 0'281.               On these assumptions the sp. h. of BeO
would be 0-335.            The   atomic    weight of Be is taken as 9'1. Taking
advantage, then, of direct determinations as far as possible, the
 data are, sp. h. of BeO 0-335, of A1203 0198,|| of H20 f>501,f of

With the last variety the agreement is very close, but in either                  case
the   agreement is sufficient to render the calculation strong evidence
had the case been one of hypothesis as to the nature of the sub
stance.
    I  proceed to quote a case where the identification of a mineral was
in this way left to the calorimeter.
    The mineral had been assigned a place in a small collection as
cryolite, on supposition.         Its sp. h. was found to be 0'2558. This at
once distinguished          it from gypsum — sp. h. = 0'278 —-which it re
 sembled in appearance.           As I knew of no experiments on cryolite it
 was necessary to calculate the constant.               The formula of cryolite —
 3NaF + A12F3— includes the sp. hs. of Na, F, and Al.                        Of these
 F has not been directly determined.            Its probable value was deduced
 from the sp. h. of fluorspar, which I had found to be 0'2118.
 Ascribing to the calcium in this compound the value 0-170 (Bunsen),
 the sp.   h. of fluorine is deduced as 0'251, which agrees with Kopp's
 result.    The other atoms in cryolite were assumed as follows : to the
 sodium was assigned Regnanlt's value 0'293, to the aluminium that
 obtained by myself, 0»223.            On these assumptions the calculated
 sp.   h. of  cryolite   is   0-2569.    The experiment on the hypothetical
  cryolite affording 0'2558, the diagnosis was assured.                    A test of
 fusibility   now    confirmed the      result,  and   subsequently an authentic
 specimen of cryolite gave 0'2538.
     The calculation may also be effected on the percentage composition.
  It is a readier method but, it is remarkable, not so agreeable with the
  practical result. Thus in the case of cryolite, Al = 13-21, F = 53*56,
  Na = 32*65 in the mean analysis (Dana), and by the equation
                                S X 100
  where wx, «»2, . . . are the percentages,         Sj,  «2, . . .  the sp. hs. of the
  constituents, the result is S = 0'2591.

   Many of these substances may, of course, be also distinguished by
   their specific gravities. There is indeed, as might be expected, a
   connexion apparent between the two, the quantities tending to vary
  inversely, not only from one substance to another, but in the case of
  variations in specimens of the same species.
      In its physical interest I think calorimetry deserves the attention of
  mineralogists. From results which came under notice in the course
  of the experiments on mineral crystals,         I  think it will be allowed that
  questions of interest are raised.          These observations are in. one direc
  tion only, and I have not had leisure to pursue them with the thorough,
 ness they appear to me to deserve. Many questions suggest themselves
  on molecnlar freedom within the crystal which will need care and
  preparation to answer, and I now but give in outline an account of
  observations made, I may say, incidentally.
     The crystallographic interest of the thermal capacity is based upon
 what is apparently an intimate connexion with the amount and kind
 of freedom possessed by the atoms of the solid. This is perhaps
 hardly unexpected.            It is probable that calorific capacity, tending to
be reciprocal to the mass of the atom, is more concerned with the
 intrinsic nature of the atom than with its surroundings. Still on any •
hypothesis of a vibratory molecule it is easy to conceive that if the
surroundings are such as to hamper its freedom of motion the constraint
will be revealed in. its specific heat; that is, if we assume its increase
of energy to be kinetic, as in increased amplitude of vibration. It
might be expected then that in the crystal the atom would reveal
thermally greater freedom than in the amorphous state. If, in fact
crystalline arrangement be regarded as the result of harmony among
molecular vibrations,' wb would expect for the crystal a specific heat
approximating to that of the free molecule, and the more nearly
approaching it the more' perfectly harmony prevailed in the crystal.*
    • There  are not many eiperime-ntal' data for comparing the speciGc heat of the

1886.]                On the Specific Heats   of Minerals.                255
It   is here assumed  that in some way similar to that in which the atom
passes into the compound          molecule without, in general, sensible
change   of thermal capacity, the molecule passes into the crystal with
only insignificant further change in thermal capacity ; the crystal
being regarded in some sense as the chemical combination of the
molecule.     Thus we expect the specific heat of the crystal to be
lower than that of an amorphous aggregation of its atoms under the
constraint of discord. This agrees with experiment, for it may be
stated as true generally that in the crystal the specific heat is lower
than in the amorphous state, and that the more perfect and complete
the state of crystallisation the lower the observed specific heat.
   This, the first fact brought to my notice as experiments multiplied,
seems to hold through the nicest indications of crystalline state as
facial lustre, degree of translucency, as well as through the more
marked indications of cleavage and form, and is probably quite in
accord with the well-known fact that rolling, hammering, and such
operations as tend to increase the density, diminish the specific heat
of metals.     The same wonld, doubtless, be found to hold in the case
of the crystalline polarity conferred on metals by vibration.
   I might illnstrate the fact by a considerable number of cases where
it happened that the specimens dealt with showed differences in
crystalline state.     I will only quote a few, referring to the tables for
other cases.    It is apparent in the case of Barite

water.     I  came on no exceptions.         There is, indeed, a more con
spicuous    kind  of variation  shown   in the specific heats of minerals not
always determinable by external appearances, but this cannot, I think,
be classed with the foregoing. It is, however, difficult at present to
draw the line between them. But so far it seems highly probable that
in slight differences of thermal capacity may be recognised a mole
cular restraint or discord or whatever molecular condition results in
opacity, roughness, incompleteness, formlessness.
    That other kind of variation to which         I    allude   is of a different
order of magnitude, and,       I  venture to suggest, points to causes of
different order.       It suggests the possibility that more than one
molecular arrangement may obtain in bodies chemically and crystallo-
graphically, to all appearance, identical.        For example, in hexagonal
prisms    of beryl  two  very different  degrees of   molecular freedom would
appear to be possible.      Certainly two very different thermal capacities
obtain, unexplained by chemical differences or crystallograpbic form,
so far as I can ascertain.        The variation, too, seems in no way con
nected with the density of the substance, for this may be invariable
from one specimen to another, while the difference of specific heat is
remarkable.       In many cases this difffTance of structure, if such it be,
is revealed in the behaviour of the substance to light, in the opacity
or transparency of the crystal. So marked is this that specific beats
may be at once assigned with certainty to different crystals of known
minerals on their opacity or transparency.            In some cases again the
substances present no differences whatever in appearance.               The case
of beryl stands thus : —

apparent in crystallographic development Bavo in the case of a couple
of the small at crystals of the first experiment, which show pyramidal
as well as the basal and prismatic faces common to all the specimens.
Examination of the twenty analyses collected by Dana (' Mineralogy ')
 suggests no explanation on chemical grounds.                    The percentages
 throughout vary in no adequate degree, ascribing to the molecules the
thermal values recorded previously in arriving at a result by calcula
 tion agreeing with the /3 specific heat.          I     do not think, too, that
 results independent, as they constantly seem, of density can with
 probability be ascribed to differences in the amounts of the constituent

atoms.          There is more probably some difference in constraint, of a
structural kind, affecting the freedom of the molecules. Des Cloizeaux
is of opinion that the optical examination of emerald, " and above all
of beryl," points to a biaxial constitution.*                    In recently noting on
these same clouded green /3-beryls from our Dublin granite, I had
occasion to remark on their optical heterogeneousness.f                         The extinc
tion of basal sections is not uniform between crossed Nicols ; pale grey
cross-hatching is apparent, and as the mineral is rotated extinguishes
capriciously over the field. In these patches the restoration of illumi
nation is feeble and suggests imperfect coincidence                          of optic and
crystal   lographic axes.
    A still greater variation 'appears in the sp. h. of corundum from
the   clouded to the limpid variety, basing the sp. h. of the latter on
Regnanlt's result on sapphire.                 It is remarkable, however, that the
variation is in the opposite direction — the limpid variety exhibits the
higher, the clouded the lower sp. h. Thus : —

This is a variation of 10 per cent, about.                  Now the analyses given in

Dana's Mineralogy of sapphire and corundum, although variable and
 pointing sometimes perhaps in the direction of the calorimetric result,

 sp. gr. of the two varieties are invariably opposed to the result being
 lower in the common variety than in the gem.                     It is perhaps remark
 able that both these minerals, beryl and corundum, are hexagonal.                         A
 third case occurs in the case of calcite.                 I experimented on Iceland

   The case of aragonite is unexpected.             Its specific heat has been
obtained by Regnault, Kopp, Neumann, and myself.                        The experi
ments fall into «- and /^-groups, having values identical with those of
calcite, and the remarkable fact appears that although the minerals
differ in crystalline symmetry and specific gravity, the evidence is in

Neumann's result, 0-2018, probably comes under the « variety. A
coincidence of error adequate to account for this nearly unanimous
agreement between the two forms of calcite is improbable. The in
ference would appear to be that in both forms the molecules possess
nearly equal freedom.          From my own results on transparent crystals
of both forms the molecular restraint seems perhaps greater in
aragonite.       This is probable, too, from the phenomena attending the
heating     of  aragonite.   The crystals spontaneously break and develope
cracks even at the low temperature of the steam ; a phenomenon which,
be it observed, probably in some slight degree falsifies the results.

   It remains to notice the cases of three chemically and crystallo-
graphically related minerals where the variations obtaining in each
case would appear to stand in a numerical relation from one sub
stance to another.       The minerals are iron pyrites (isometric di-
sulphide of iron) ; galenite (isometric sulphide of lead) ; sphalerite
(isometric sulphide of zinc). The orthorhombic disulphide of iron,
marcasite, seems also to fall into the relationship.

 Taking the means of the first two vertical colums in each                                  case, the

                                      Pyrites.              Galena.
                                 126-5   :   130    :

  260                                Mr.  J.  July.                       [Nov.   18,
  The experiments are so close that any of the recorded values are
 fairly in the proportion, and some evidently better than the means ;
 thus if my own results and Neumann's be alone considered, it will be
  found that the ratio is almost absolute.             As it stands, on the mean
 values, the products are as 638 to 640.
     If Neumann's result for marcasite, 0'133, be included, we               find the
 more extended proportion —
                          Pyrites.                   Galena.
                   126 5  :  130   :  133  :: 491   :  506   :  522.
 But in this the last •number is a little excessive, which, as observed,
 is probably due to impurity.
    Two distinct values, very different, are on record for sphalerite : —
            N            0114                          R             0123
            J            0115          ......          K.            0-120
 and finally the proportion        with the extreme values of pyrites and
 galena obtains.
                   Sphalerite.            Pyrites.           Gidena.
                114 5  :  1215 :: 126      5   : 133  : : 491    ; 522.
 If   this proportion be examined by products of consequent and
 antecedent of first term with sum of antecedents and consequents,
 the products obtained are as 88,938 to 88,909.             One value only, it will
 be seen, is omitted   from    the   ratios,  that of  Neumann,      for galena.   It
appears to lie outside the proportion, and may either be erroneous or
simply indicative of corresponding terms not yet fonnd for the other
sulphides.
    In conclusion,  I would ask in reference to the foregoing remarks,
if in the present state of our knowledge there is anything a priori
improbable in different molecular arrangements                 or orientations ob
taining under the same crystalline form and affecting to definite
extents the thermal freedom of the molecule.                   Such' differences of
arrangement, hardly detectable perhaps by any other means of investi
gation, might exist unnoticed except when, as possibly occurs in the
case of marcasite, prevailing to a degree competent to determine a
different symmetry for the aggregate.
    Regarding the experiments which follow,                I   have only now to
observe on the precautions observed in effecting them.
    The thermometers, certified at Kew, read directly to 0'1° C. ; the
place of hundredths being obtained by estimation.
    The balance used was trustworthy to 0'0005 gram. To secure <j
accurately indicating the temperature of the substance, thermometer
and specimen were left together in the calorimeter — starting at air
temperature— never less than one and a half hour; large specimens,

1886.]                  On    the   Specific Heats   of Minerals,                    2(51
two to    three hours     ;   and th9 largest were        reserved for leaving   in all
night.
   Specimens presenting at all a porous or loose surface were carefully
dried, often for many days, in an oven, and subsequently preserved
over calcium chloride.   Porous or loose substances, not of special
value,    were,   for greater surety in drying, broken into small bits —
as    in the case of the few rock specimens investigated.                  To preserve
these      dry in the calorimeter, while acquiring air   temperature,
calcium chloride was in some cases placed in the little chamber pro
jecting from the lower part of the sphere.  If counterpoised imme
diately on being placed in the calorimeter absorption of moisture may
evidently be detected, weighed, and its thermal capacity allowed for.
This plan was on a couple of occasions resorted to.     In any cases
observed, however, entire neglect of this absorption would have pro
duced but small error.
  Supposing errors of the same sign to accumulate          through an
experiment,       I
               do not think they can have in any case falsified the
value of the sp. h. above 0'4 per cent. This seems probable, too, from
the agreement observed on   repetition.
  Allowance has in all cases been made for the variation of      with            \
f2,according    to Appendix   of last   paper. The effect of the  low
specific gravity of steam on the apparent weight of condensation has
                                    W
been     allowed for,   as — =           X   0'62 gram.   With these deductions and
                               Sp. gr.
allowance for the precipitation              on the carrier and bucket       according
to range      of temperature obtaining, the value of w                is   deduced     as
recorded     in the tables.
      The specific gravities recorded have been reduced to water at 4° C.

    Since the reading of my paper on " A New Form of Stereoscope
(' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 40, p. 317) my attention has been called to a
paper read by Mr. Howard Grabb, F.R.A.S., at the Royal Dublin
Society, 20th January, 1879.

    In   the present communication           I propose   to give an account of a
photometric arrangement presenting                 some    novel features, and of
some results found by means of it for the reflecting power of glass
and silver surfaces.          My attention was drawn to the subject by
an able paper of Professor Rood,* who, in giving some results of a
photometric method, comments upon the lack of attention bestowed
by experimentalists upon the verification, or otherwise, of Fresuel's
formulae for the reflection of light at the bounding surfaces of trans
parent media.         It is true that polarimetric observations have been
made of the ratio of the intensities with which the two polarised
components are reflected ; but even if we suppose (as is hardly the
case) that these measurements are altogether confirmatory of Fresuel's
formulae, the question remains open as to whether the actual intensity
 of each component       is adequately represented.           This doubt would be
 set at rest, were it shown that Young's formula for perpendicular
 incidence      (to which    Fresuel's reduce), viz.,                  , agrees    with
 experiment.
    Professor Rood's observations relate to the effect of a plate of glass
 when interposed in the course of the light.                 He measures, in fact,
 the transmission of light by the plate, and not directly the reflection.
 No one is in a better position than myself for appreciating the advan
 tages of this course from the point of view of experiment.                      In the
 first place, the incidence can easily be made strictly perpendicular, in
 which case no question arises of a separate treatment of the two
 polarised components of ordinary light.                And, what is much more
 important, the interposition of the plate leaves the course of the
 light nnchanged, and thus allows the alteration of intensity to be
 determined in an accurate manner with the simplest arrangements.
     On the other hand, the measurement of the transmitted, instead
  of the reflected light, is open to grave objection on more than one
  ground.     It may be doubted whether the influence of absorption is
  altogether negligible, even when the thickness of the plate is as
  small as that mentioned by Professor Rood, viz., 1*67 mm.                   But the
  feature which strikes me most unfavourably is the necessary magnifi
   cation of error, when we deduce the proportion of light reflected

from the observed loss of light transmitted. The transmitted light
is about 91 per cent. ; and thus an error arising from the neglect of
absorption, or from imperfect matches, amounting, say, to 1 per cent,
leads to a relative error of more than 10 per cent, in the estimated
reflection.    The importance of this consideration may be illustrated
by Professor Rood's actual results.        In the first case recorded by hira
the observed transmission was 91"440 as against the theoretical
9P736. The difference 0'296 is indeed very small reckoned upon the
transmitted light ; but if we translate the results into terms of the
reflected light, they present a different appearance.             On the sup
position that the whole loss in the transmitted light is due to
reflection, we get for the intensity of the reflected light 8'560, which
is to be compared with the theoretical 8'264.          The difference 0'296 is
now some 3| per cent., and is thus by no means insignificant.           In the
other case given by Professor Rood the discrepancy is greater still,
amounting to 7 per cent. It may be remarked that in both cases
the amount of the reflection appears to be in excess of that given by
Young's formula. But the cause may lie in the assumption that the
whole failure of transmission is due to reflection.         And whatever the
explanation may be, we can hardly agree with Professor Rood when
he concludes that these experiments show " that the reflecting power
 of glass with the above index of refraction, conforms in the closest
manner to the predictions of theory."
   In the hope of being able to deal directly with the reflected light,
I  made a great many trials of various devices during the spring of
1885, but without finding anything satisfactory. Indeed, at one time,
I  had almost come round to the opinion that the difficulties of
measuring the reflected light were so great that Professor Rood had
shown a wise discretion in declining to face them, and that after all
the best results would perhaps be reached through measurements of
 the transmitted light checked by the use of plates of different thick
 nesses so as to eliminate absorption.* If, indeed, we give up the
perpendicular incidence, the objection founded upon the relatively
small quantity of light reflected may be met ; for at an incidence of
 70°, about half the light (polarised in the plane of incidence) is
reflected.    In such an experiment it would of course be necessary to
 determine accurately the angle of incidence.
    The difficulties referred to have their origin in the necessary
alteration in the course of the light by the act of reflection.            The
direct and reflected light cannot be interchanged in any simple
manner, and the shift necessary to bring about the substitution may
easily lead to systematic error.         In the apparatus (presently to be
described)   to  which  I was   finally led, the difficulty seems to be fairly

overcome so far as regards the accuracy of the results, but at the cost
of several tiresome adjustments, impeding the ready trial and inter
change of various reflectors.
    My apparatus differs in several respects from that generally used
for photometric purposes.         Before describing it in detail, it may be
worth while to indicate some of the considerations which led me to
design it.
    The photometers in ordinary use may be said to depend upon the
principle of diffusion. If the illuminating candle, or lamp, be drawn
back from the screen to double the original distance, the brightness
of the screen as perceived by the eye is supposed to be quartered.
This implies that (within certain limits) the brightness of the screen
is independent of the apparent magnitude of the source of light (the
total radiation being given), or that the light diffused by the screen
in a particular direction (towards the eye) is independent of the
 direction of incidence.       Reciprocally, the light incident in a definite
 direction is supposed to be diffused through a considerable angle with
 some approach to uniformity.           There is no doubt that with proper
 arrangements this condition may be satisfied with sufficient accuracy
 for practical purposes.       My object in formulating it is to show that
 the use of a diffusing screen in photometry is necessarily attended by
 an enormous reduction of light.
    For our present purpose this loss of light is a serious matter.
 Weakened to     J,  by reflection from glass, the light of an ordinary
 candle or lamp is hardly sufficient to illuminate a diffusing screen
 properly, unless placed so close that measurement of the distances
 becomes uncertain.       The difficulty might perhaps be got over by the
 use of incandescent electric lamps, but such were not at my command.
 When, as in Sir John Couroy's experiments,* the reflecting surfaces
 under test are metallic, or when (as above suggested) the observation
 relates to the transmission of light by an oblique plate of transparent
 material, the illumination given by a lamp may be adequate.
    In my apparatus all the reflections are regular, and there is no
 further loss of light than the characters of the surfaces entail. An
 incidental advantage is that the accurate flatness of surfaces demanded
 by methods in which illumination is inferred from distance, is here
  unnecessary. The apparatus was first set up during the summer of
  1885 ; but the glasses then at my disposal were not good enough, and
  when the parallel glaas mirrors, &c., necessary                 for satisfactory
  working   came   into   my possession,      the   season   was  so far advanced
  that I decided to postpone operations until the following summer.

                              Description  of Apparatus.
    The light is admitted into the room through a pane of finely-
ground glass fitted into the shutter.               All other light is carefully
excluded, and the walls and ceiling are blackened — an almost indis
pensable provision. The ground glass carefully cleaned* is illuminated
not only by the direct light of the sky, but also by light from above
reflected at a large mirror.           The reception of light through a large
angle not only favours the aggregate brightness and tends to moderate
the changes due to passing clouds, but it makes the uniformity of
the field more independent of the evenness with which the glass is
ground. Under these circumstances, and when there is no sunshine,
direct or reflected, falling upon the ground glass, the latter may be
looked upon as a tolerably uniform source of diffused light. This
uniformity, however, is not relied upon ; but the arrangements are so
 made that the parts of the field compared are contiguous or identical,
and are seen by rays which leave at the same angle.                  It will be con
venient    first  to   describe generally   the   coarse  of the light, and after
wards the manner in which the adjustments were effected.
    Proceeding from the ground glass (A), fig. 1, the light falls upon
 the transparent plates, B, B', at which nearly equal parts are reflected.
 These plates are of worked glass about 6 inches by 4 inches, and are
 placed at the polarising angle.             By this means are obtained two
 beams of polarised light         of   nearly equal, and of constant relative,
 brightness.       The light transmitted by both plates is stopped at a
 screen,  and    takes   no further part.
     On the right hand side the light reflected at B is again reflected by
 a mirror of worked glass, silvered behind, at C, and assnmes the
 direction CDF.           D and F are alternative positions of the same
 mirror (also       of  worked    glass, silvered behind).         When the glass
 under test E is in use, the shifting mirror is in the position D, and
 the light follows the course CDEFH.                In the contrary case, there is
 one reflection instead of two, and the ray takes the finally identical
 course CDFH. At H this central ray is reflected at the extreme edge
 of a speculum of silver-on-glass in the direction HI, to a small
 observing telescope, which is focussed upon this edge.
     By adjustments that will presently be explained, it is secured that
  the reflections at D and F shall take place under the same angle, and
  therefore with the same (moderate) loss of light ; but when E is in
  use the brightness is diminished some twenty times.                 To compensate
  this in the other position the disk G is introduced. It consists
  of a blackened disk of tin, from which (along a sufficient length
  measured radially) a sector is cut out, so that when the disk is

about nineteen-twentieths of the whole time.                     When the speed ex
ceeds about twenty-five revolutions per second, there is no perceptible
flickering, and the light is seen with a simple diminution of bright
ness.       The idea of the method is so to adjust the angular opening
that the effects of the glass under test and of the disk shall be equal.
     The two brightnesses last considered can only be seen successively.
They are separately tested with a comparison light, reflected at B'
from the same primary beam.                 After reflection at a silvered mirror,
C, and then at a blackened glass, D', this light falls upon a silver-
on-glass speculum at H', and passes thence to the observing telescope
at L        In setting up the apparatus a control over the brightness of
the comparison light is obtained by varying the angle of incidence
upon     D'.
     In order that the line of division between the two fields,                  as seen
from     I,   may be quite sharp, it is necessary that the final reflector H
be    a speculum.         To obtain a reflecting surface, perfect up to the very
edge,      a piece of silvered glass is carefully cut (on the glass side) with
r diamond. If the operation is properly performed, the silver is left
 undisturbed, and when the plate is inclined, as at H, no part of the
glass substratum is visible.
     In adjusting the apparatus the object aimed at is to cause the
 central ray, ABB', issuing from A on the ground glass, to assume
ultimately the position HI, whether it proceed by the course on the
left, or by either of the alternative courses on the right.                  As may be
 supposed,        this  is more    easily   said   than   done.     All  the   reflectors
require to be adjusted so as to be perpendicular to the plane in which
 the central ray is to travel.            This plane is conveniently taken hori
 zontal, so that every reflector has to be vertical.*
      The central ray is defined by diaphragms at A, B, B', points in the
 same horizontal straight line.             At A the light is admitted through a
 small     aperture only. At B, B' the holes are cut in thin cardboard
 screens held in definite positions up to the glasses.                   It was found
 convenient to have them rather large              — about  half  an inch  in diameter.
 In setting up the apparatus the glasses B, B', C are readily put into
 position, accuracy being required only in the levelling. The line CDF
 is now defined, and the next step is the more difficult one of fixing the
 two positions for the stand carrying the mirror D.                     This stand is
  (like all the others) provided with levelling screws, but these must
 not be used in passing from the one position to the other.                    A heavy

metal surface plate was laid down upon the table as the support for
this stand, and carefully levelled.             Under these circumstances the
mirror if vertical in one position will remain vertical even though
displaced ; and this remains true, even though the feet of the stand do
not rest immediately upon the plate, but upon small flat buttons of metal
of uniform thickness, and perforated with equal holes, by which the
feet of the stand are guided to definite positions.               When the adjust
ments are complete, these buttons are fastened to the surface plate by
dropping cement round their edges.
     The position F may now be chosen at convenience, and without any
particular care except in the levelling.             The central ray, as fixed by
the diaphragms, should fall near the middle of the surface. The other
positions would also be somewhat arbitrary were it not for the neces
sity of securing the same angle of incidence and reflection in the two
positions.      To assist in this a small frame of brass wire is provided,
carrying      two  pointers, and so arranged that it can always be placed in
an absolutely definite position with respect to the mirror.                 By means
of hooks it makes two contacts with the back, and two with the upper
edge of the mirror.         Of the other two contacts required to make up
the necessary six, one is with the lower part of the face of the mirror,
and the other with one of its vertical edges. Of the pointers, one (in
the path of the incident ray) leads upwards, and the other (in the
path of the reflected ray) leads downwards. By bending them suit
ably their extremities may be brought into the path of the central
ray, so that when the eye is placed in such a position (H) as to see
the central point A in the middle of the (apparently elliptical) aper
ture B,* this central point is just enclosed between the barely meet
 ing pointers.       By so choosing the second position, D, that this
condition is again satisfied to an eye looking along ED, we secure
 not only the same angle of reflection but the use (for the central ray)
 of the same part of the glass.             In making the adjustment we may
 first bring the pointer on which the incident ray strikes into the
 already determined line CD, and then rotating the apparatus about
 the vertical through this point, bring the second pointer to coincide
 with the reflected ray.
     We have now to consider how to fix the position of E, the re
 flector under examination.           Replacing the shifting mirror into its
  first position, F, we mark the line of the central reflected ray, FH,
  by needles, standing up from the table and as far apart as convenient.
  Transferring the shifting mirror to the position D, we have so to place
  E that the reflected ray shall coincide with the same line as before.
  For this purpose not only must the azimuth of E be correct, but its
  plane must be brought into the intersection of the already determined

  lines DE, FE.      A   levelled slab of glass is provided, on which to rest
 the feet   of the stand carrying E. The mirror is now brought into a
 vertical plane, and may then        be shifted on the slab without loss of
  this  adjustment.       The remaining double adjustment is best made
 systematically.      By rotation about any vertical axis, the central ray
 may    be caused  to   pass over one of the needles. If it fails to pass over
 the other, the axis of rotation must be shifted backwards and for
 wards until a suitable rotation allows satisfaction of both conditions.
 The ray now follows in both cases the course FGH, and the mirror
 H, with the sharp edge, may next be pushed in so as just to catch the
 ray in question and send it to the observing telescope (half of a small
opera glass) at I.
     The adjustments for the auxiliary light on the left hand side are a
simpler matter. All the mirrors being levelled, the central ray is
 brought to the point H', in the prolongation of IH. Nothing then
 remains but to turn the final (vertical) mirror round H' until the re
flected ray coincides with HI.           When the eye looks in along this
line, the bright spot should be seen in the same position from both
mirrors.
     To guard against accidental displacements, the movable pieces were
usually secured with a little sealing wax.          A diaphragm at K limits
the field   of view, and is so placed that the aperture is bisected by the
division line    H. It is not necessary to do more than allude to various
screens    employed to cut off stray light and render the room as dark
as possible.
     The principal     trouble experienced, that of making and retaining
the adjustments,      is connected with the rather large scale of the appa
ratus, which made it difficult to use a single levelled bed for all the
movable pieces.        The question is thus suggested, what is it that fixes
the absolute scale ? And the rather unexpected answer must be — the
diameter of the pupil of the eye, which is the only linear quantity
concerned.*
    In order to understand this it is necessary to bear in mind that
although in describing the adjustments we speak of a single ray only,
we are of necessity really dealing with a complete beam.                The obser
vation of a match requires that the two parts of the field of view
have finite angular magnitudes, amd from every point of the field
there must proceed a pencil of rays limited by the pupil, or by the
telescope.     If all these rays are to be treated as sensibly parallel
during their passage through the apparatus, certain limitations must
be observed.      For easy observation the field of view should subtend
at the eye an angle of not less than a degree, so that if no telescope
be employed the defect of parallelism            must exceed this amount.
The linear scale of the apparatus is not thus fixed, however, for we

                                                                        U 2

might snppose the eye (armed when necessary with a focussing lens)
to approach without limit the final mirrors.        But if we do this we
increase the defect of parallelism due to the aperture of the eye.
It is true that we may elude the objection by contracting propor
tionally the effective aperture, but only at an expense of brightness,
which cannot usually be afforded.        In accordance with a universal
rule, full brightness requires that the aperture of the eye be filled
with light.    In this way we see how it is that the aperture of the eye
controls the size of the apparatus.
   The employment of a telescope introduces a certain modification,
which it may be worth while to state somewhat fully, as the principle
is of general application.     The extreme angle between the rays of the
beam may be regarded as made up of two parts : (1) the angle sub
tended at the object-glass by the aperture in the diaphragm (K) near
the final mirrors (upon which the telescope is focussed) ; (2) the angle
subtended by the object-glass at the diaphragm.         If—

   We may here regard a and a as given beforehand ; and we see that
with a given b the first term may be reduced without limit by increas
ing m, and that then the defect of parallelism is proportional to o, the
diameter of the pupil. If m and b can both be increased without
limit, we may approach as nearly as we please to a state of things in
 which all the rays concerned are parallel. The preservation of full
brightness throughout is already secured by the supposition that the
effective aperture of the object-glass is ma.
    The reasoning set forth above shows at any rate that the size of the
apparatus cannot be reduced below a certain point, but I do not
 affirm that mine was not unnecessarily large.      In addition to its other
 advantages, the use of a telescope gives facilities for obtaining a good
 focus upon the division line, an adjustment of great importance for
 the easy recognition of small differences of brightness.
    The necessarily finite magnitude of the field of view involves a certain
 imperfection in this, and probably in other methods of photometry.      We

can      indeed secure that the lights          seen  in immediate juxtaposition come
from the same part of the ground glass, but a corresponding perfection
of adjustment does not apply to other parts of the field.                                 If we
suppose ourselves to be looking through the telescope at the ground
glass, the part seen to the right of the division line really lies to the
right on the ground glass. On the other side there is a distinction,
according to the two positions of the shifting mirror. When the
revolving disk is in use, the circumstances on the right hand side of
the apparatus correspond to those on the left, and thus the part of the
field seen to the left of the division line really comes from the left on
the ground glass.               The ground glass is thus seen much as if it were
looked at directly, in spite of the separation of the light into two parts
following distinct courses.                 On the other hand, when the additional
reflector (under examination) is brought into play, there is another
 inversion, and the part of the ground glass seen to the left comes
 really from the right of the central line.                 In this case, therefore, it is
 the same part of the ground glass which is seen in both final mirrors.
 The distinction here pointed out would be of no consequence if the
 field were absolutely uniform, or if it were possible to compare the
 parts seen in immediate juxtaposition, without regard to the parts a
 little further removed.                But if the original field vary slightly in
 brightness         from    right   to  left, it will be a ^question how far the eye
 would select for the match continuity of brightness across the division
 line, or how far it would demand equality in the average brightnesses
 of the two parts presented.
      It now remains to describe certain accessories. During the obser
 vations it is necessary to have some means of varying the relative
  brightnesses of the two parts of the field without removing the
  mirrors or altering the width of the slit in the revolving disk.                            For
  this purpose a plate of glass (L), capable of rotation about a vertical
 axis, was introduced into the path of the light on the right hand side
  of the apparatus (between the second and third reflections).                           As the
  angle of incidence upon this plate increases, a greater proportion of
  the light is reflected and thrown away, and a less proportion is trans
  mitted to the eye.
      The observation consists in varying the azimuth of this plate until
  the match is satisfactory,               after which the obliquity of the plate is
  measured.           The transmission by the plate at the measured obliquity
  can then be found approximately from Fresnel's formula.*                              It may,

   Pickering's table is calculated.       An erratum may be noted. For 65° the reflection
   should be 39-6, not 38-4, the value of A being supposed to be sin 2(0      - fl,)/8in • (9 + ${),
   while sin 8 =1*55 sin 9^       There are some othor minor inaccuracies.

 perhaps, be objected that the use of this formula assumes the very
 thing that the experiments were principally intended to test ; but the
 objection is evaded, almost if not altogether, when the aperture in
 the disk is so nearly adjusted to the ideal width that the oblique plate
 comes to take nearly the same azimuth for both sets of readings,             t.e.,
 with and without the use of the mirror under examination.              The   use
 of the formula to allow for a small outstanding difference of obliquities
 can lead to no appreciable error.       If on a first trial a large difference
be found, a corrected aperture is calculated with the aid of Pickering's
table, and the disk readjusted or replaced.
    A fixed oblique plate has sometimes been used on one or other side
of the apparatus in order to effect a rongh adjustment of the bright
ness, and to bring the necessary obliquity of the rotating plate to a
convenient amount (30° — 60°). This was less trouble than a readjust
ment of the mirrors on the left, with an alteration in the angle of
incidence upon the black glass D'.
    In taking an observation the adjustment of the relative brightnesses
was facilitated by a device which may now be described.                   If the
attempt    be made    to secure  an  absolute  match  between    the two   parts
of the field in view, a doubt is apt to arise as to whether the disap
pearance of the division line is due to the success of the adjustment
or to fatigue of the eyes, leading, as in my case it very rapidly does, to
imperfect focussing. This difficulty is less felt when the adjustment
is under the immediate control of the observer, who can then satisfy
himself of the sensitiveness of his eye by making the necessary
displacement ; but in the present experiments (on account of the
distance of the telescope) it was convenient to employ an assistant.            A
glass plate, perpendicular to the path of the light, and attached to a
sort of pendulum, was therefore provided on the left hand side, in such
a manner that by pulling and letting go a string it could be intro
duced or withdrawn at pleasure.          The effect of the plate wonld be to
stop some 8 per cent, of the light, and the adjustment was so made
that with glass in the (apparent) right of the field was as much too
dark as it was too bright when the glass was out. The difference of
brightness, amounting according to the above estimate to 4 per
cent., was always fully apparent, and probably no setting more than
2 per cent, in error would be allowed to pass, giving, as such would
do, a difference of 6 per cent, on the one side and of 2 per cent, upon
the other.*      Since the auxiliary light is eventually eliminated, it
makes no difference, of course, whether we take for the comparison
the full light, or the mean of the lights with and without the inter
position of the plate.
    A 2 per cent, error in single settings may lead to a 4 per cent.
   • The accuracy of the settings falls much short of that attained by Professor
Bood.

error in the comparison     of the effects of the reflector and of the disk ;
and   accordingly (since   this  may occur in either direction) an 8 per
cent, discrepancy in the results is possible.       This, however, would be
very nnlikely, and      with   a two- or three-fold        repetition of the
individual settings would be practically out of the question.
   The revolving disks, used to diminish the light on the right hand
side of the apparatus in about the same degree as by the mirror
under test, were cut from tin plate, about 9 inches in diameter, and
carefully centred.      The angular apertures were finally calculated
from measurements of the chord of the arc, and of the radius.              It is
important    that  the  disks   be thoroughly    blackened,   in  view  of   the
assumption that no light reaches the eye except during the passage of
the aperture.     Here is one reason why it is desirable to keep the
room as dark as possible.      The disk should also be properly balanced.
On one occasion a curious and at first puzzling effect was observed,
The division line, which should present no visible width, sensibly
widened, appearing sometimes darker than the nearly balanced
adjoining fields, and sometimes, though more rarely, appearing rela
tively bright.    The explanation is to be found in a vibration of the
mirror, whose edge forms the division line, in a horizontal direction
perpendicular to the line of sight, the vibration being communicated
from the revolving wheel through the floor to the table upon which
the mirrors stood.      It is evident that if the two lights under com
parison  were  equal,  not  merely on the average, but at every moment
of time, such a movement of the mirror would have no disturbing
influence, and could not make the division line visible.              But it is
otherwise when one of the lights is intermittent, and the vibrations of
the mirror are executed (as here they must be) in the same period.
For suppose that at the moment when the division line is advanced,
so as to invade still further the field from the back mirror, the light
is reaching the eye through the aperture in the disk.          In this case the
parts near the edge qf the vibrating mirror will be sending to the eve
the full light due to this part of the field.      During the remainder of
the vibration, no light should reach the eye, but if this mirror
retreats, the back mirror sends its continuous light from the same
 apparent place, so that when the angular opening in the disk is small,
 it is possible for the part of the field over which the division line
 vibrates to present an almost doubled brightness, combining in fact
 the illumination of the two parts of the field.          A different phase
 relation may evidently lead to an abnormal diminution of brightness
 in the same region.      These effects disappeared when the disk was
 better balanced.

                           Prism of Grown Glass              (I).
     In ordering a glass for the purpose of determining the reflecting
power  of a surface, a prism was preferred to a plate, both on account
of the easier separation of the reflections from the front and back
surface, and also because the refractive index could be determined
more readily.     During the observations the hind surface was coated
with black varnish, the effect of which, however, in annulling the
second reflection, was far from complete.
  With this glass, carefully cleaned (but not repolished), six sets of
observations were made, four by myself and two by Mrs. Sidgwick.
Each set consisted of three or four settings with the glass in operation,
and about the same number with substitution of the revolving disk.
The following is a set of readings by myself on August 7th, 1886 : —

   The angles here given are the obliquities of the adjustable glass
plate used to graduate the intensity.    According to Pickering's table,
calculated from Fresnel's formula          = 1"55), the effect of this

upon it.   The light transmitted      therefore 84-3 per cent.
                                           is                     In like
manner the light transmitted by the plate at an obliquity of 42'3°                      is
82-5 per cent.
     In order
            to complete the calculation of the reflecting power of the
glass surface, we must know the proportion of light transmitted
                                                                                       of of by
the revolving disk.   Measurements gave for the chord of aperture
this disk in fiftieths of an inch 45-0, corresponding to a radius
174 25.  The angle of aperture      thus 14° 50' = 14-83°.

   Since  this number is very nearly the same as that (0'04119) due to
the  disk alone, we see that the result is scarcely at all dependent upon
the correctness of the assumed effect of the oblique plate.
   It now remains to make comparison with the reflection as given by
Fresnel's formula, viz. : —
                                                                                K  J

 where  sin 0/sin 0'=/*, and fi is the refractive index.
    The index was determined in the usual way from the angle of the
 prism (t) and from the minimum deviation (D).                 The value of i was
found to be 9° 50'.         The minimum deviation of soda light on one side
 was 5° 5', and on the other 5° 4£'.           Thus D = 5° 4f ', and

    The angle of incidence (0), which was the same              in all the observa
 tions  with the various reflectors, was measured by determining the
 angle (20) between the incident and reflected ray.              This measurement
 does not require great precision, for a change of a whole degree in the
 value of 0 would alter the reflection about 1 per cent. only.                     I
 found —
                                     0  =   13° 52'.
    With these values of        0 and /i, we  find —

    In order to satisfy myself that the deficiency of reflection was real
 and permanent, this prism was remounted                after a thorough cleaning,
 and further observations were taken, as summarised in the following
 table.   The revolving disk was the same as before : —

   In consequence of the detection               of a greatly augmented reflection
from another glass surface (II, below), as the result of a repolish
with putty powder, this surface also was submitted to similar treat
ment.      Immediately afterwards, on August 30th, a much increased
reflection was observed, the numbers by two observers being —
                           0-0481,    0-0472   ;    mean, 0-0476.
The disk gave, as before, a transmission 0-04119 ; so that the num
bers for the repolished face depend too much upon the assumed effect
of various obliquities of the inclined plate to be fully trustworthy,
even were they sufficiently numerous to guard against accidental
errors.     But they proved, unequivocally,                a considerable     increase in
reflecting power as the result of the repolish.
   In view of these results, a new disk was prepared of angular aper
ture about 17^°, and, consequently, with a transmission equal to
0'04763.       The numbers obtained with this are shown in the following

 Here again too much depends upon the oblique plate, the transmis

tinder nearly similar circumstances, viz., 0 0476, we may conclude
that the true reflecting power of this prism is about 0*0460.
    Altogether the evidence favours the conclusion that recently
polished glass surfaces have a reflecting power differing not more
than 1 or 2 per cent, from that given by Fresnel's formula; but
that after some months or years the reflection may fall off from 10 to
 30 per cent., and that without any apparent tarnish.
                                                      I
     The question as to the cause of the falling off, am not in a position
 to answer satisfactorily. Anything like a disintegration of the surface
 might be expected to reveal itself on close inspection, but nothing of
 this kind could be detected. A superficial layer of lower index, formed
 under atmospheric influence, even though no thicker than 1 6 6'0 Q 0 inch,
 would explain a diminished reflection.         Possibly a combined exami
 nation of the lights reflected and transmitted by glass surfaces in
 various conditions would lead to a better understanding of the matter.
 If the superficial film act by diffusion or absorption, the transmitted
 light might be expected to fall off. On the other hand, the men-
 interposition of a transparent layer of intermediate index would
 entail as great an increase in the transmitted as falling off in the
 reflected light. There is evidently room here for much further investi
 gation, but    I must content myself with making these suggestions.
                          Plate Glass Silvered Behind.
     This glass was silvered chemically by the milk-sugar process, and
  by transmitted light showed the sky of a normal deep blue colour.
  The film was not polished.       In determining the efficiency of this and
  other good reflectors, the black glass mirror D' was replaced by one
  silvered behind. The first trial without a revolving disk gave for the
  reflecting power 0'82. This result, of course, depended entirely upon
  the assumed influence of various obliquities of the adjusting plate. A
  disk was therefore prepared with two opposite projecting teeth, in
  which the ratio of aperture to circumference turned out on careful
  measurement to be 0-8230.         This number, therefore, represents the
  transmission of light by the disk. Using this disk I found the follow
  ing values for the reflecting power of the mirror for light incident
  upon it at an angle of 13° 52' : —
                        Aug.  11                    0-823

  This result relates, like all the others, to light polarised in the plane
  of incidence. Mirrors of this kind are durable, and not being exposed
  to tarnish are more convenient than specula, whenever the double
  reflection is not objectionable.    The high reflecting power is a satis
  factory   feature.

     During these observations      a disk was employed          giving trans
  mission 0-0577, so that     in this case the final result is absolutely
  independent of the effect of the adjustable oblique plate.          It will be
 observed that the separate results obtained by Mrs. Sidgwick and by
                                            I
  myself differ, even in the means, by per cent. This is not the only
 instance in which the errors have presented a suspiciously systematic
 appearance ; but the differences being always small could not be sub
 mitted to any satisfactory examination. It rarely happened, for
 instance, that Mrs. Sidgwick and          I  could find definite fault with
 each other's settings.
     When these results were first obtained,       I thought that they would
 turn out to be too high for agreement with Fresnel's formula, suppos
 ing that the index of the glass was low. A subsequent measurement
 of the specific gravity, however, gave reason for suspecting that the
 glass might be flint, a conclusion confirmed by determinations of the
 refractive index.
     These were made by two methods : (1) by observation of the
 polarising angle in air, (2) by observation of the angle at which total
 reflection sets in when the mirror is immersed in bisulphide of carbon.
 The first is, perhaps, the simpler in respect of experimental arrange
 ments, but it is open to the objection that the inference of the
 refractive index from the polarising angle is somewhat theoretical.
    The black glass was mounted upon the turntable of an ordinary
 goniometer.     In the focus of the collimator was placed a wire, seen
 dark in a bright field of view.      Various positions of the turntable
 were then tried, such that on rotating a Nicol held at the eye the dark
patch appeared to pass somewhat to the right or to the left of the
 collimator wire. After each observation the web of the telescope was
set to coincidence with the collimator wire, and a reading taken.
 Success depends in some degree upon the use of a suitable light.
 Sunshine diffused through ground glass answered the purpose very
well.

    The table gives a set of circle readings.         In the first column the
patch was to the right of the collimator wire, in the second to the
left, and in the third there was no appreciable deviation. We may,
therefore, take as the reading for the polarising angle 64° 5', with a
probable error not exceeding 3' or 4'. The reading for a direct
setting of the telescope upon the collimator wire was — 5', so that the
polarising angle is ^(180— 64° 10')=57° 55'. Whence according to

This relates to white light.
    To find the index of refraction by the method of total reflection,
the mirror was mounted vertically in a small tank of plate glass,
cemented with glue and treacle, and containing bisulphide of carbon.
The mirror E, as shown in fig. 2, was parallel to one of the sides of

 the tank, and a cover was provided to check evaporation.         A uniform
 field of homogeneous light could be obtained from a salted spirit
 lamp, A, with the aid of a plate of ground glass, B, and a collimating
 lens, C.     The eye looking in along such directions as GF, is able to
 mark    with considerable accuracy the direction in which total reflec
 tion begins.       By the aid of plumb-lines, &c., this direction and that
 of the face of the mirror          (seen from above) were marked upon a
  board, and    it appeared    that the angle GLK, between the face of the
  mirror and the direction GLF of the first totally reflected emergent
 light was 18°.
     A beautiful variation in the experiment may be made by replacing
  the spirit lamp with a candle, and subsequently analysing the reflected
  light by a direct vision prism.       For this purpose a screen carrying a
  slit should be interposed as near F as conveniently may be.         As the
  incidence of the light upon the black glass becomes more grazing
   total reflection sets in, but first at the violet end of the spectrum.

 When the      eye is  looking nearly in the right direction, the spectrum
 appears to be covered by a veil proceeding from the red end np to a
 point dependent upon the precise direction of the light.               By slightly
 shifting the eye, the veil may be made to reach any desired part of
 the spectrum, and- then we know for what ray total reflection is just
 commencing.        By bringing the veil to touch the soda line (rendered
visible with the aid of the spirit lamp), precisely the same direction
 was found as had previously been marked out with use of homo
 geneous light.       It would be possible in this way to determine with
 considerable accuracy the dispersive powers of opaque bodies.
    The angle of 18°, being measured in air, is not the complement of
 the true angle of reflection.        If we take T630 as the index of CS3 for
soda light, we     find  for  this  angle

                           fi =1-630 cos 10° 56'=l-600.
    The amount of reflection according to Fresnel's formula, with an
incidence of 13° 52' and an index l-600, is 0-05726, a little lets than
that actually observed.             The agreement is as good as could be
expected, but it should be noticed that this mirror was merely
cleaned and not repolished with putty powder.                If repolishing were
to produce as much effect in this case as upon the acute-angled prism
 (I), Fresnel's formula would be left considerably in arrear.*

mination of the refractive index of the prism of crown glass II. He
finds fi = 1'5328. The introduction of this into Fresnel's formula
(0 = 13° 52') gives for the reflecting power 0-0477.

at the surface of contact between the film and the metal, an electro
motive force due to the chemical action between them, charging the
zinc negatively and the film positively.     The two charges being bound
have no onter manifestation of any kind.

    5. The    principal    piece    of   apparatus      used    was    a   bi-metallic
 quadrant electrometer represented at fig. 1, about one-fourth actual
 size.    Its design was an elaboration of the temporary apparatus
described in a previous paper (' Phil. Mag.,' vol. 2, 1878, p. 142).                  A
is a   metal   case  supported    on  levelling   screws   ;  B  a  thick   vulcanite
tube prbvided at its upper end with a brass cap containing a collar of
leather in which slides the brass rod C.                  D is a brass ball with
clamping screw to retain the rod at any desired height.                         E is a
platinum     torsion  wire,  O001    inch  diameter,   carrying    the   stouter  wire
F, on which are fixed a light concave mirror G, the needle        "           " H, and
a glass weight     J dipping   in  water   or other  liquid   contained    in   a glass
vessel, resting on a vulcanite plate on the bottom of the instrument.
R and L are the quadrants of the metals under examination screwed
to a vulcanite piece M which is adjusted by hole, slot, and plane on
the points of three long fine-threaded levelling screws, O, P, Q,
passing up through stuffing-boxes in the bottom of the instrument.
The quadrant L is connected to an insulated wire N passing out air
tight through the back of the case. R is connected to the body of
the instrument and to
                              " earth " by a slip of foil under the vulcanite
support touching the screw O.               A stopcock T in the top of the
vulcanite tube and another in the bottom of the instrument of which
the opening is shown at S, provided means for varying the nature of
the gas surrounding the metals.            The opening in front of the instru
ment was provided with a flange, faced up to a plane, on which a pane
of plate glass was jointed by grease or other suitable means. The
needle was electrified either positively or negatively by connecting
its suspending wire through a Pohl's reversing commutator to either
pole of a battery of 100 small Daniell cells : the opposite pole being
at the same time connected to the body of the electrometer and to
"earth."
    6. To make an experiment with this apparatus the quadrants were
first carefully adjusted with their upper surfaces in the same plane,
then put in position, roughly levelled, the connexion to wire N made,
and the pair dusted with a camel-hair brash.                The needle which had
been raised by the sliding-rod C was now lowered to within about
0"0o inch of the surface of the quadrants, and adjusted with its
centre line over the slit between them and its suspension wire in the
centre of the system.
    If now on connecting the quadrants metallically, and electrifying
the needle positively and then negatively, it was found that the
deflection (as observed by lamp and scale) was greater on one side of
zero than on the other, due to one quadrant being higher than the
other, the necessary adjustment was made by means of the screws 0
and    P.   A    second   concave     mirror   fixed   on the     ball D was now
clamped, so     that its reflected beam also fell on the zero of the scale,

 so  that after raising the rod C it could be readily brought back to its
 original position.    The quadrants were now levelled by a spirit-level
 from front to back, after which the difference of potential might be
 at once taken, or they might be removed again to be cleaned, rapidly
 replaced, and a reading taken as quickly as possible afterwards with
 out the loss of time in adjusting them.        A " reading " was taken by
 causing the needle (by reversing its potential twice) to deflect first on
 one side (say right) of zero, then to the left, and again to the right.
 The mean of the two right-hand deflections was added to the left-hand
one in order to eliminate the effect of a slow shifting of the zero
which sometimes occurred, caused apparently by a slow untwisting
of the suspension wire, or a slight warping of the vulcanite piece M.
    7. The   readings were either qualitative when the two quadrants
were put in metallic connexion, or quantitative when the difference of
potential of their films was compared with a standard cell.
    In order to make the connexions conveniently for both kinds of
readings a modified Pohl's commutator        was used, by means of which
the quadrants could either bo directly connected with each other, or
else one to each pole of the standard cell W in either sense.
    8. At first two standard cells were used, a Clark's cell purchased
from Elliot Brothers, and a Daniell constructed as at W.            X, T, Z
are three test-tubes fixed in a block of paraffin.       X contains a half-
saturated solution of zinc sulphate, with a rod of redistilled zinc not
amalgamated.        In Z is a gutta-percha covered copper wire, having
its lower end cleaned, wound into a spiral, and covered with crystals
of copper sulphate and water.        Y contains distilled water with a strip
of zinc to reduce any copper salt that might diffuse over from Z.
    When the Clark's cell was used, the results were reduced to the
Daniell as unit value.         Comparisons with both cells were at first
frequently made.
    9. The measurement of the difference of potential near any pair of
quadrants was made by a well-known method as follows. The cell
was first connected, so    that its electromotive force should increase the
deflection due to the difference of potential near the quadrants, and a
reading a taken.       The connexion was then reversed, and a reading 6
taken.     If d is the deflection due to the standard cell, and p that due
to  the difference of potential near the quadrants —
                                   d+p=a
                                   d—p = b

For example,     in comparing the difference of potential of the films on
slightly  tarnished   copper and zinc in air the following deflections wen
found —

     Owing to the nature of the apparatus, extreme accuracy in the
results as absolute quantitative measurements is not to be expected.
They are meant in most cases more for comparisons among thera-
Belves.
     10. A number of    experiments were made to ascertain the rate of
decrease of difference of potential of the films on copper and zinc in
air due to gradual tarnishing of the metals. The curves corresponding
to two of these with zinc of different      degrees of purity are given in
fig. 2, where ordinates are in decimals of the electromotive force of
one Daniell, and abscissae represent the time elapsed after cleaning
the metals with glass paper.       Ten more observations were made on
the pair of copper and redistilled zinc giving curve A. The remainder
of the curve has the same character, falling in 61£ hours to 0'64
Daniell.
    The object was to estimate the difference of potential due to the
clean metals by carrying the curve back to the time at which they
were cleaned, and compare this with the difference of their heats of
combustion in oxygen as compared with the heat equivalent of the
standard cell. The result agrees fairly well with the thermochemical
data of J. Thomsen (' Wiedemann, Beiblatter,' 1880, Nos. 7 and 8).
    We are met, however, with the fact that with many other pairs of
metals in air we do not find the same agreement, although in most
cases there i3 a more or less near approximation.        This I  believe is
due to two causes :   —
     (1.) We cannot tell the exact nature of the chemical process going
on at the surface of the metals, whether it be simply an oxidation ;
which particular oxide of the metal is formed, or if the other gases,
ammonia, carbonic acid, Ac, take any part in the process, nor do we
know exactly the physical state of the film.
     (2.) We do not know how much protective effect the already
formed coating of oxide, &c, exercises on the metals.
     11. The comparatively     small and often irregular difference of
potential observed when experimenting with copper and iron may be
due to the formation on the latter, immediately after cleaning, of a
 highly protective oxide coating, producing a more or less passive
state analogous to that which this metal assumes under other well-
known conditions.       The rapid tarnishing of lead may also produce a
similar effect supposing the oxide formed be of a very coherent and
protective nature.

   The consideration    as to which oxide is formed leads to the question
Owhether  any difference of potential would be found near the contact
of two different oxides of the same metal — I experimented on litharge
and red lead, and on stannous and stannic oxides, but did not get
results sufficiently definite to be reliable — but I think the experiments
worth repeating with freshly -formed oxides, which mine were not.
   12. It has been suggested in criticising my former experiments on
the effect of various gases on the difference of potential near certain
metals in contact, that it would have been better to have had quanti
tative results.     Although for the reasons given above these are
perhaps not of very much value, I have, however, made measurements
in several cases. The following are the results with a copper-irou
pair in hydrogen sulphide gas.
   Quadrants of these metals after being freshly cleaned with glass-
paper were put in position, and the difference of potential in air
measured as quickly as possible was found to be0-059D, 0062D, mean
0'06D, iron side positive.
   Hydrogen sulphide was now sent into the electrometer, reversing
immediately the relative potentials near the metals.          The stopcocks
were then closed and the following measurements taken : — t repre
senting the time elapsed after admission of the gas, and P/D the ratio
of the difference of potential near the metals to that of the terminals
of a Daniell cell.

    Some fresh hydrogen sulphide now sent in caused a slight rise,
P/D=0'32, after which it fell slowly, and in about 11 hours more
(f=23h. 25 m.) it was 0'26. The instrument was now cleared of gas
and left open for about 1^ hours, when P/D fell to 0'l. Re-admission
of gas raised it to 0'32. This was repeated with the same result,
after which the instrument was left open for 24 hours, when the iron
side was fonnd positive, P/D=0'32. This somewhat high value may
be due to oxidation of the iron sulphide, but more probably perhaps
to oxidation of the iron itself, coupled with the protective action of
the very thick coating of sulphide on the copper.          After again ad
mitting the gas the copper side became again positive, P/D=0 26D.
Several more changes of the atmosphere were made, the corresponding
change in difference of potential taking place each time. The electro
meter was then charged with the gas and closed up, the water vessel
having been removed (so that its vapour might not interfere with
insulation inside the instrument), and its place supplied by paper
vanes cemented to the weight. The difference of potential then fell
gradually till at the end of eight days after the gas had first acted on
the metals it was sensibly zero.     On opening the electrometer plenty

 of the hydrogen sulphide was f ootid still present in it, and the metals
 were much corroded         ;  the copper brown with lighter patches ; the
 iron greyish with patches also, but having a thinner coating of sul
  phide than the copper.         On allowing the metals to remain exposed to
  the air, the iron side became again gradually more positive; the
 difference of potential rising during 26 hours to 0'26D, after which
 it fell in about a week to 0'22D.
      13. As the electrochemical        relation of silver and iron in water is
 also reversed       when solution of potassium sulphide is added,          I  had
 little doubt that an addition of hydrogen sulphide to the air about
 these metals when in contact would reverse the potentials near them.
      To test this the upper surface of the copper quadrant used in the
 last experiment was covered with a piece of thin silver sheet cemented
 on, thus forming a silver-iron pair with the iron quadrant.                  The
 difference of potential just after cleaning the metals with emery- and
 glass-paper was 0-23D, iron side positive.               In three minutes after
 admission      of the gas the next reading showed the silver side positive;
 difference about 0'4YD.           The following readings were then taken,

     The sulphide formed on the inside of the metal case of the instru
ment by the action of the gas, now began to peel off in scales and
jammed the vanes of the weight.               After cleaning these out fresh gas
was sent in, and P/D became 0'36D ; silver side still positive.
Measurements were then made at intervals, the difference of potential
falling gradually to 0'23D, on the fourteenth day after admission of
the gas at the outset.
     By that time, however,          the gas was found to have been all or
 nearly all absorbed by combination with the metals and the sides of
 the instrument.         The conclusion of the experiment is therefore in
 complete, but it indicates that the difference of potential decreases
 with these metals also, although more slowly than with copper and
 iron.
     14.  It was   suggested    by Mr. Cross, of Barrow-in-Furness, that the
 difference of potential near a copper-iron pair in air and in ammonia
 gas should be compared.           The electromotive force of a cell formed by
 these metals immersed in distilled water is about CK35D, copper the
 positive pole, but if ammonia solution be added, this electromotive
 force reverses and becomes 0-27D.
     Three experiments were made with copper-iron quadrants in this
 gas, which was sent into the instrument by boiling strong liquor

 1886.]                       A   Tlieory     of Voltaic Action.                      301
 ammonias   in a flask connected by glass tubing to tbe stopcock T. In
 each  case the potential was reversed* and the difference of potential
appeared rather less in the ammonia atmosphere than in air, but
owing to the action of the gas on the vnlcanite piece M, causing it to
twist and so alter the position of the quadrants, I was unable to get
reliable quantitative comparisons with the standard cell.
   15. In a cell composed of copper and nickel in distilled water,
nickel is    the positive metal, and the electromotive                   force is about
0'24D.     On adding a few drops of a solution of ammonia a reversal
takes   place and copper becomas the positive metal.                        The electro
motive force appears at first rather greater than that of the water
cell but falls off quickly.
   The analogous           experiment       with gaseous ammonia was made in a
qualitative way only.             The    quadrants of the electrometer were re
placed by a flat ring half copper and half nickel, the two metals
soldered together.           (This had been used in a former experiment with
hydrochloric acid gas.)
   The metals of the ring having been rubbed bright with emery-
paper, the potential in air only near the nickel was positive to that
near the copper, the index passing over about A\ divisions, when
the electrification of the needle was reversed.
   After admitting ammonia gas in the same way as before described
the copper side became positive, at first slightly, but after two hours
the index moved over six divisions for a reversal of the needle.                      Tbn
two kinds of experiments therefore agree here also fairly welL
   16.  I  now sum up tbe results (regarded qualitatively only) ob
tained in this kind of experiment, where a change in the constituents
of the atmosphere surrounding a pair of metals in contact reverses
the difference of potential              near them in correspondence with the
reversal of electromotive              force, which takes place after a similar
Change in the corresponding liquid eleotrolyte used with the same
metals as a voltaic cell.

    These are the only cases tried ; no exception has, therefore, been
found by    me, nor, so far as I know, by others.
    17. One of the most ingenious explanations (from the pure contact
theory    point of view) of the change of potentials near the copper-
iron or copper-nickel pair effected by hydrogen sulphide or chloride
is that of G. Wiedemann ('Lehre von der Electrikitat,' vol. 1, p. 205),
who suggests that in addition to the films of snlphide or chloride
formed on the metals, a film of hydrogen may be deposited, and the
contact effect of all these substances is added to that of the metals.
It may be pointed out that precisely the same explanation may be
given of the usual experiments made in presence of water-vaponr
where the oxygen combining with the metal forms an oxide film,
which may again be covered with the hydrogen left free.
    1 8. Several other authors have urged as an objection to these expe
riments, that the action of the gases causes the formation of coatings
of various compounds, and so the whole state of things is altered by
tbe introduction of additional bodies or substances assumed to intro
                                                                    '

1881, or 'Theses presentees a la Faculte des Sciences de Paris,'
No. 461, p. 16.)
    Dr. Lodge also states ('Brit. Assoc. Report, '1884, p. 50), "but satis
factory observation in these gases is difficult, because they not only
tend to attack the plates, but they do attack them, and so a film is
formed and everything is rendered uncertain."
    But it is surely too much to say that no such film (of oxide) is
formed in the experiments as usually made in air. We are even jus
tified in inferring that such a thing as a "contact" experiment on
clean metals has not yet been made, since they are invariably cleaned
¦while exposed to the atmosphere, and therefore covered with a layer
or film of highly condensed water-vapour containing other dissolved
gases.
    Each abrading point of the polishing material (emery, glass-paper,
or whatever it be) may almost be said to be working under water on
the metal.
    It seems difficult to suppose that even for an instant after each
little abrading point has passed, the surface of the metal exposed in
its track remains unoxidised.       All such critics assume quite unwar
rantably    that in the  old contact experiments of Volta the surface of
the plates is not altered by the atmosphere, whereas the alteration is
not only after a time visible to the naked eye, but is accompanied by
a sequence of electrical effects in a quite similar way to that when
other gases are used, which attack chemically one or other of the
metals, so as to mask or overpower the action of the oxidising
atmosphere still present.      On the other hand, when gases are added

 that have not an action   differing from that of the air (still present to
 a greater or less degree), or are merely neutral, there is no great
 difference in the electrical effects produced (Pellat,

sentees a la    Faculty des Sciences de Paris,' p. 109 ; Schulze-Berge,
 'Wiedemann, Annalen,' vol. 12, 1881, p. 293). The effect of a hydro
gen atmosphere in gradually decreasing the negative potential near
platinum is an exception, and has been already well explained by the
hypothesis that it forms an alloy with the platinum of a more positive
character ; or which, according to the chemical theory, has a greater
affinity for the oxygen still present than the platinum has.
   19. Many attempts have been made to remove completely from the
metals under examination all oxidising or other chemically active
substances,   and thus show that the metals per se have no power of
producing a difference of potential.
   Some of the older writers claim to have effected this by thickly
varnishing the plates of the copper-zinc Volta condenser.        I doubt if
even a thick coat of varnish, which is more or less pervious to gaseous
matter, would so effectually protect the surfaces as to leave no effect
discernible   by the more sensitive modern appliances.        Besides, the
varnish itself is objected to as a new element in the chain of " con
tact" effects.    Some experiments on the effect of varnish were made
with the large Volta condenser shown at fig. 3.
   20. This instrument was in general form copied from that described
by   Schulze-Berge (' Wiedemann, Anualen,' vol. 12, 1881, p. 294).
Referring to fig. 3, A is a triangular piece of mahogany 1 inch thick,
turning on pointed screws at B, and resting at its other end on a
support M. It carries on its lower surface three vulcanite fittings, DD,
supporting the copper plate C, which can thus be raised from or
lowered towards the zinc plate Z, lying on three vulcanite levelling
screws, SS. The plates were 8 inches diameter, and about \ inch thick.
   A measurement of the difference of potential of the films on these
plates was made by a method similar to that employed by Schulze-
Berge and shown at fig. 4, where D is a Daniell's cell, of small
internal resistance, connected to BR', a set of resistance coils, of which
the part a is 200 ohms and x is variable.         The key K breaks the
connexion of both the condenser plates Cu, Zn at once. In making
an experiment     the resistance x was adjusted till on breaking the
contacts at K, and immediately afterwards separating the plates,
no sensible deflection was observed at the quadrant electrometer E in
connexion with them.      Then the amount of resistance in x divided by
the whole resistance RR' gave in terms of the Daniell the difference
of potential required to neutralise that of the films.
   21. The zinc plate of this condenser was carefully varnished all
 over while hot with repeated coats of " silver lacquer " (shell-lac and
other gums dissolved       in spirits of wine), but the difference of

potential between the varnish on the zinc and the film on the opposed
copper plate did not fall below 0'29D taken while the zinc was hot.
   On cooling for 15 minutes the value rose to 0-35D, and after some
hours to 0'46D, an effect easily caused by the passage of moisture
into the varnish.       Fifteen hours after it bad fallen to 0-4D, in-
dicating probably the formation of a partially protective coat of
Oxide under the varnish.
   The commonly accepted value for plates         of these metals recently
cleaned in air is about 0"8D.
   22.  I have also endeavoured    to obtain this result, although without
much hope of     success, by immersing the platinum-zinc quadrants of
the electrometer, fig. 1, in naphtha which had been digested with
metallic sodium for several months in order to free it if possible from
oxidising matters.     Metallic sodium was also placed on the bottom of
the electrometer.      The naphtha was contained in a glass jar, aud
connected by a syphon to the stopcock S. The difference of poten
tial of the polished metals measured in air was 0'88 D. The naphtha
Was now run in for five minutes, when its level was about 0"05 inch
over the surface of the quadrants, and about the same distance below
the needle.    The following observations were then made j t denoting
time elapsed after the metals had become covered j—-
     <= 8m.   40m,   1 h. 40m. 2h. 40m.    4h.      7h.      ISh.      82 h.

   Two hours after this last observation the naphtha was partially
run out of the instrument,      so as to bring its surface below the leyel
of the quadrants, when a measurement gave only 0'23D.                    It is
difficult to see why the thiu film of naphtha still present on the
plates should possess a more protective power than the bulk of the
liquid.
   It may be that there was in the naphtha some small quantity of
water or other substance chemically active towards the zinc (the
deterioration of sodium or potassium under naphtha is well known)
which would soon become exhausted from the thin film, bnt the
hypothesis is open to doubt.
   23. Faraday considered that electrolytic " decomposition          and the
transference of a current are so intimately connected that one cannot
happen without the other" ('Exp. Res.,' vol. 1, p. 252).           I think it
in the highest degree probable that the same theory applies to the
production of the momentary current which gives rise to a difference
of potential near the surfaces of two apparently dry metals when
placed in contact, and that the electrolyte then active consists of the
water supplied from the air and condensed in invisible films on them.
 Hence the chemical action producing the electrical effect is not only

 the mere    oxidation by free oxygen, but is associated with the decom
 position   of the condensed film on the metal.
    24. The apparatus,       fig. 1, was admittedly not sufficiently imper
 vious to gaseous diffusion to permit of a crucial experiment on the
 effect of drying the atmosphere surrounding the metals.                 However,
 in the hope of partial success, the following experiment was begun in
 1884.    The copper and zinc quadrants were adjusted in position, the
 water vessel having been removed, and a weight with paper vanes
 substituted.     The difference of potential was found 0'68D. Two
 small porcelain capsules containing phosphoric anhydride were placed
inside the instrument, and the joint between the glass front and the
metal facing made as good as possible with grease.                The following
measurements were then made in terms of standard Daniell ; t in this
case standing for days after closing up the instrument.

   The phosphoric anhydride was now taken out, and the instrument
allowed to remain open for twenty minutes, after which a very care
fully made and satisfactory observation showed that the difference of
potential had increased to 0-646D.                Fresh phosphoric anhydride
was now placed in the instrument, which was closed as before, and
the valne measured immediately afterwards found to be 0-659D.
   A similar series of observations was then made for a period of
173 days, during which the observed difference of potential fell more
or less regularly to about 0'5D. Then on allowing the instrument to
remain open for one honr it rose to about 067D.                    These results
were quite as marked as I had hoped for with such unsuitable appa
ratus, and seem to show very clearly that even a partial drying of the
metallic surfaces alters the difference of potential near them in a
decided manner.
   25.   In  1881  I  had endeavoured      to construct a copper-zinc quadrant
electrometer      hermetically    sealed    in a glass vessel, from which         I
could exhaust the air and absorb the oxygen compounds by potas
sium.     Repeated failures in the construction of the apparatus have
hitherto debarred the experiment.              A similar idea occurred to Hen?
Von Zahn about the same time (' Untersuchungen iiber Contact-
Elektricitat,' p. 48).
    He enclosed a platinum-zinc condenser in a hermetically sealed
tube, together with metallic sodium/            The difference of potential was
 reduced in this case to about 0'5D, which the author attributes, in
 part at least, to the absence of moisture. He considers the experiment

would be a crucial one in favour of the chemical theory, if, after
opening the tube, the difference of potential was found to have
increased.     He does not, however, open it.
    There are two objections to this particular experiment.               The
tube, &c, was washed out with water which tarnished the zinc.
The action of the sodium on moisture would evolve hydrogen, which
would alloy with the platinum.
    The former would reduce the difference of potential permanently,
and the latter perhaps temporarily, but neither would, I think, much
affect the conclusion to be drawn from a measurement made imme
diately on opening the tube.
    26. Von Zahn also experimented        qualitatively on the difference of
potential   between  a copper plate    and  a flat spiral of glass tube con
taining sodium used as a Volta condenser plate, but does not seem to
have tested the effect after the lapse of any considerable time,
although he states that the surface of the sodium remained bright
after standing some years.
    If Bunsen's hypothesis ('Phil. Mag.,' vol. 17, 1884, p. 172) that
glass may gradually, year after year, absorb a part of the liquid film
in contact with it, be true, it would probably be necessary to allow
such apparatus to stand a long time before the absorbed water had
 freed itself from the glass. The same criticism applies to Von Zahn's
 experiment with a sodium copper condenser in vacuo, where the tube
 broke after the first observation.
    27. The foregoing observations, the fact that gases under ordinary
conditions are non-conductors, and the much greater simplicity of the
                                                       " contact " effects are
 theory, all point to the view that the so-called
 due to the action of condensed films on the surface of the metals.
 When the copper and zinc quadrants are wet with water, the
 difference of potential near them is practically that of the terminals of
 a cell formed of the same metals dipping in water.         If instead of the
 water we use copper sulphate saturated solution on the copper
 quadrant and zinc sulphate solution on the zinc, the difference of
 potential is almost exactly that of the Daniell cell, of which this
arrangement is the analogue.        In fact whether we break such simple
galvanic circuits in their metallic parts, or in their liquid parts, we
 obtain the same value at the terminals in either case.
    28. Considering then the two metals of a copper-zinc Volta con
 denser as the elements of a cell, and the moisture film on them as the
 electrolyte, we have a simple copper-water-zinc cell, divided on its
 electrolyte, and showing, when the metals are clean, approximately
the difference of potential appropriate to such a cell.
    The well-known experiment of Sir William Thomson, where a
 water-drop was placed between the previously disconnected metal
 quadrants, is thus easily explained.           The water-drop connexion

equalised (sensibly) the potentials of the films, by altering tbose
of the metals which were previously at one potential.*
    29.   Evidently then, as I have before suggested ('Phil. Mag.,'
Feh., 1879), in experiments purporting to give the difference of
potential between a metal and a liquid by the condenser method, such
as those of Hankel, Gerland, Clifton, Ayrton and Perry, &c., we have
really a two-fluid cell (one fluid being that under examination and the
other that condensed on the metal plate), with a dielectric division of
air between the two fluids. Any observed differences of potential can
readily arise from differences between the nature and constitution of
the film and those       of the liquid under examination, even if the latter
be    water.     The film can, for instance, more easily replace by absorp
tion from the air any oxygen in solution which may have entered into
combination with nascent hydrogen liberated by the oxidation of the
metal.
     These    differences   naturally cause different actions on the metal,
entailing different states of its surface, which again react on the
electrolytes differently.
     If in experiments of this kind the metal dipping in the liquid be
different to that of which the plate is formed, we have of course then
a two-metal two-fluid cell.
     30. This aspect of the Volta condenser as a copper-fluid-zinc cell
divided in its electrolyte, suggested the possibility of joining the
films only on the two metals, without bringing the metals them
selves in contact, and so producing a real galvanic current-producing
cell from the apparently dry metals.                This I  succeeded in doing
after a very great expenditure 'of time and patience ; an expenditure
partly owing to the unsuitability of the apparatus — the condenser,
fig. 3, described        § 20, having been designed for another purpose,
was not capable easily of sufficiently fine adjustment.                 After the
first few preliminary trials had given promise of a decided result,
a micrometer screw was added, instead of the support at M, in order
 to be able to form an approximate            idea of the distance between the
 plates   during an experiment.
      The copper and zinc plates of the condenser were first carefully
 faced up to a plane surface by the use of a surface plate, and then
 lightly ground together with washed emery-powder, after which the
 zinc received a light rubbing with fine emery-paper.           Wire connexions
 were fixed by screws to each plate, and the pair could thus be joined
 by means of a mercury cup arrangement either to a reflecting galva
 nometer, giving a deflection of about seventeen divisions for a millionth
     *
        [When the quadrants of copper and iron were disconnected and then joined by
  a drop  of potassium sulphide solution, the difference of potential near them was
  (at  would be expected) increased instead of annulled. It became about double its
   former value. — November 1, 1886.]

 ampere current, or to a circuit consisting of a Leclanche cell and an
 ordinary astatic galvanoscope.             A telephone was also generally
 included in the circuits. When joined up with the cell in circuit it
 was possible by very careful adjustment of the distance between the
 plates to find a point where although they were not in metallic
 contact still a current would pass.         The needles of the galvanoscope
 (which flew to the stops when the plates were in actual contact) were
 deflected unsteadily to about the same extent as if the condenser
were replaced by a resistance of 50 to 100 ohms, and a faint hissing
sound was heard in the telephone.               If now the terminals from the
plates were transferred to the galvanometer, a current was observed
varying in different experiments according to circumstances from a
few up to 130 divisions, but which at ouce ceased when the plates
 were either placed in metallic contact or so far apart as to separate
the films on them.
    31. Measurements of the thickness of the two films were made by
the micrometer screw at M. Its indications are, however, only
approximate, since the upper plate does not remain parallel to the
lower while being raised ; and also (the whole apparatus not being
very rigid) it is quite possible that when the upper film rested on the
lower one, there was sufficient pressure on the surface of the plates t<>
prevent the upper one falling to the extent indicated by the micro
meter readings, although a weight of six pounds was placed on the
end of the upper board at A to help to depress it.                 I give, however, a
series of readings typical of those obtained in all the experiments.

qnent disappearance of the difference of potential near them, and a
decrease of the former prodnces a subsequent decrease of the latter.
   In the case where the decrease of chemical action is dne to drying,
it is, perhaps, sufficiently in correspondence with the theory to sup
pose that when the film is partially removed, the effect it produces
should also partially disappear, although we may not be in a position
to specify the particular nature of the molecular process involved, or
 whether there is included with it anything of the kind described next
following.
   In the case, however, of the hindrance of chemical action by the
formation of an intervening oxide or other compound layer, there
appears at first sight a difficulty, since it may be said that after the
separation and disposal of the two opposite charges on the two films
resident on the metals in contact as above described, the mere forma
tion of intervening oxide on other layers would tend more to keep
these charges apart than to allow them to combine.
   It must, however, be remembered that in this case the films them
selves are also in contact, and that a conducting connexion between
them may reasonably be supposed to provide a continuous leak, by
which the difference of potential suffers a constant reduction below
the normal, and would, therefore, disappear altogether, if the leak
were not greatly overpowered by continuous electrolytic combination
at the surface of the metal.
   The lateral resistance of the film must of course be very great, in
order that so much difference of potential may be observable ; but it
is obvious that unless the film were of infinite conductivity some
differenc» would still exist.
   Where the metals are not in immediate contact the films on (or
moisture in the pores of) the supports may readily provide the neces

        may here refer to an experiment made prior to these last bat
related to them. It was based on the supposition that the molecnles
of water in the condensed film on a metal must (in order to oxidise
it) have their oxygen atoms turned and attracted           towards   it,   but   if
we could reverse this arrangement by attracting the hydrogen atoms,
we might be able to retard the oxidising action.   Possibly the fact
that the potential      for a charged conductor    is   constant   throughout

negatives     this view.      It   was thought, however, the results might
throw light on questions          as to the molecular nature of any electro
chemical polarisation of the condensed films as a cause of the static
voltaic effect, and for that reason they are here shortly stated. The
condenser, fig. 3, was provided with a pair of zinc plates faced up
together.       The difference of potential of their films after metallic
contact of the plates was tested qualitatively by a quadrant electro
meter in the usual way. A very small value was found, due doubtless
to some slight difference in the state of their surfaces. The plates
were then separated to a small distance, and joined to the opposite
poles of a battery of 100 Daniell cells.            After 17| days the battery
was removed, and the difference of potential of the films on the plates
again tested.       It was supposed that if any greater oxidation of the
positively    electrified   plate, as compared with the other, Was caused
by polarisation of the films, there would be a greater difference of
potential than before ; the film on the tarnished plate being negative.
If anything, the reverse was- the case, but the effect was very slight,
and may have been due to some kind of storage cell action in the
supports of the plates.            A second trial with the Daniell battery
joined the reverse way gave a like negative result.               Probably the
 effect suggested does not take place, or it is masked by local actions
in the film.

 contact theory, though          I  think wrongly so, as there is contact of
 dissimilar metals,     viz., copper-gold and zinc-gold on the connexions
 to the gold disks of the electroscope used.           (Von Zahn's inability to
 repeat the experiment so as to get Gassiot's result seems to me
  unaccountable.)
     35. In order to exclude any uncompensated            contact of dissimilar
  metals, as in Gassiot's experiment,       I modified it by joining the copper
  plate of the condenser, fig. 3, to the copper quadrant in the electro
  meter, fig. 1, and the zinc plate to the zinc quadrant.            The latter
  connexion wus made by a copper wire, but the dissimilar contacts
  thereby introduced compensate one another.
     On altering the capacity of the condenser a very decided alteration
  of the potentials near the quadrants was observed.             The following

of potential according to the theory here adopted.
    Fig. 5 gives the state of things in a closed zinc-water-copper cell of
uniform resistance throughout its circuit; N and P understood as
joined in closed circuit.
    Fig. 6 shows the same cell with the metals apart ; the two metals
being covered with moisture films, which are practically a portion of
the electrolyte and (in so far) at the same potential.        This shows
also graphically the explanation of Sir William Thomson's " water-
       "
drop experiment, referred to before (§ 28).
    Fig. 7 is a cell divided in the copper part of the circuit, where
instead of the potential of a film on the zinc, as in fig. 6, we have the
lower potential of that on the copper piece connected to the zinc.
 The terminals of like metal in this way permit the electromotive
force of the cell itself to be measured in the usual electrometric way.
    Fig. 8 represents either a zinc-water-copper cell divided in its
 electrolyte, or the ordinary static experiment where the difference of
potential of the films on two metals in contact is measured.
    It is to be borne in mind that these diagrams are only of a qualita
 tive nature, as the difference of potential between the dry metals and
 water, &c, in contact with them has not yet been experimentally
 determined.
                                 Appendix.
    The experiment described, § 35, leads to the following theoretical
considerations which have been in part suggested and put into form
by Mr. J. Larmor, of St. John's College, Cambridge.

  1886.]                 A  Theory  of Voltaic Action.                  313
    37. The zinc sector of the electrometer and the zinc plate of the
 condenser in connexion with it form an insulated conductor of ziuc ;
 the copper sector and the copper plate of the condenser form an
 insulated conductor of copper.      Consider first the hypothesis which
 asserts that after recent metallic connexion, the potential of the zinc
 exceeds that of the copper by a definite amount.         The plates being
 primarily   at  a distance, make them approach each other gradually.
 As they do so the experiment shows that the difference of potential 1
 between them gradually diminishes. Their behaviour is just that of
 an ordinary charged condenser ; as the plates come closer together
 their capacity is increased, being always inversely proportional to
 their distance, and therefore for a given charge the difference of
potentials is diminished, being always directly proportional to their
distance.    By bringing the plates very close together their difference
 of potential may be reduced indefinitely.          Having brought them
within a very minute distance of each other, establish metallic con
nexion between them.          According to the hypothesis this restores
them to their original difference of potential. This is done by the
separation of a quantity of electricity equal to the difference of
potential multiplied by the capacity of the condenser ; the two plates
acquire charges of this amount but of opposite signs. This operation
involves a gain of energy to the system of amount equal to half the
capacity of the condenser multiplied by the square of the difference
of potentials. The plates being very close together these quantities
are of considerable magnitude.           Now the operation of making
metallic contact was merely directive and involved no supply of
energy from without. This supply must therefore come from an
absorption of the heat of the system, or from chemical combination
either partial or complete.     The first alternative is inadmissible, as it
would lead to a perpetual motion ; we are, therefore, driven to that of
chemical combination, which may either be an action between the
zinc and copper at the point where the metallic connexion is made, or
an action between one or both of the metals and the surrounding
gaseous medium. In either case its amount, though very minute, is
not infinitesimal.      As there is no evidence of any action between
clean zinc and clean copper at ordinary temperatures which involves
any liberation of energy worth considering, it seems nearly certain
that the actual liberation of energy is due to the other cause, which
in the atmosphere is oxidation whether nascent or complete.
   The plates with their acquired charges may now be separated by
mechanical energy, and their charges imparted to an electric receiver
by contact.     The plates being now as at first the same cycle may be
repeated indefinitely, and a permanent supply of electricity may be
thus theoretically obtained at the expense of continued oxidation of
 the plates in air,
                                                                y 2

314                     A   Theory   of Voltaic Action.        [Nov. 18,
  These considerations    apply very much in fact to Sir W. Thomson's
gravity battery with copper filings and zinc funnel.
   38. Bat now suppose that any atmosphere capable of acting che
mically on the plates has been removed.         On bringing them close
together   and  making   metallic connexion    between  them, they will
not be able to return to their original difference of potential, for the
energy required to effect the electrical charge is no longer forth
coming.    The facts thus far encourage us therefore to hold the view
that the difference of potentials is not an intrinsic property of zinc
and copper in themselves, but is the result and manifestation of the
fact that their contact in the atmosphere has started a chemical
action which has proceeded till choked off by its own results.
   According to the ideas of the theory of chemical equilibrium of
Clausius, Gibbs, and Helmholtz, it has proceeded nntil the accumula
tion of its products has secured that further progress shall not any
longer lead to a dissipation of energy.
   39. If this argument which refers the difference of potential to an
initial chemical action on the surface of the plates where they are in
contact with the atmosphere or to a condensed liquid surface film
derived from  it, be allowed, the next step would be the assignment of
some mode of action which would account for the result. And here
the idea of a double electrical layer, which has been elaborated by
Helmholtz from the phenomena of electrolysis, and so successfully
applied by him in explanation of the polarisation of voltaic cells, comes
up hopefully.
   The oxygen of the moisture in the atmosphere will under proper
circumstances combine chemically with the zinc, giving rise to
electrical effects, as in Sir W. Thomson's gravity battery already
mentioned.     When the circumstances are such that actual combina
tion  is not possible, the two substances will feel each other's presence,
and take up along their surface of contact a conformation of mole
cular equilibrium we have a right to assume that this configuration
                    ;
will present  a   sheet of positively charged atoms, facing an equal
sheet of negatively charged atoms, and thus forming a double layer.
A precise explanation of how this comes about conld hardly be
required of us, for so long as we continue to apply to such questions
our ordinary notions of electrical attractions at all, there    is   no way
open for explaining the dynamical fact of a difference of potential
between two substances in contact, except the assumption of such &
layer along the surface of contact.     How     it  formed may be at any
                                                     is
rate illustrated  from  the phenomena   of voltaic polarisation.
    40. We may then provisionally contemplate            a zinc plate as
surrounded by     such a double layer, negative  inside and   positive out
side  ; and a copper plate as surrounded by a similar layer of smaller
 moment, the moment being measured in the same way as for magnetic

shells, by surface   density multiplied by distance between the com
ponent layers.    When    the two plates have attained electrical equili
brium with surrounding objects, the potentials just outside the layers
will be equal (e.g., by electrolytic connexion as in Sir W. Thomson's
experiment of a zinc and a copper plate connected by a drop of water),
but the potentials of the metals inside will be different, each being
less by the moment of its layer. The zinc will therefore be at a
lower potential than the copper.       If a metallic connexion is now
made between the metals, positive electricity will flow from the
copper to the zinc until the potentials of the metals are equalised,
and the difference of potentials of the air outside the plates will now
be exactly opposite to that which subsisted between the metals before
metallic contact.
   There is this difference between the view just mentioned and that
of pure contact difference which was examined, § 37, that here the
metallic connexion involves a running down of electric energy, while
there it involved an addition of energy from without.
   41. The explanation by superficial double layers once accepted,
 there is no longer any reason for retaining contact of the two metals
as one of the conditions necessary for the setting up of this action
between a metal and its surrounding atmosphere.
  We may hold that when a piece of clean zinc, or a piece of clean
copper, kept insulated, is introduced into an atmosphere capable under
favourable circumstances of acting chemically upon             it,

quantity, and which proceeds until a state of equilibrium          estab   is
lished, as indicated by the setting up  of a certain definite difference
of electrical potential between the metal and the gas near      but out  it,
side the sphere of the action.

    Herbert Tomlinson, B.A. Communicated by Professor
       G. G. Stokes, P.R.S.            Received November 15, 1886.

  In   the previous experiments by the author on this subject the
coefficient of viscosity of air was determined from observations of the
logarithmic decrement       of amplitude of a torsionally vibrating wire,
the lower extremity of      which was soldered to the centre of a hori
zontal bar.  From the        bar were suspended vertically and at equal
distances from the wire      a pair of cylinders, or a pair of spheres. The
distances   of   the cylinders or spheres from the wire were such that the

¦main   part of the loss of energy resulting from the friction of the air
 may   be characterised as being due to the pushing of the air. A small
;part, however,        of the whole logarithmic decrement was due to
 the   rotation of the spheres or cylinders about their axes, and
 Professor Stokes has kindly added to the paper a note in which are
 deduced formulas which serve to correct for this effect of rotation.
    Acting on a suggestion of Professor Stokes, the author proceeded
 to determine the coefficient of viscosity of air by suspending a hollow
 paper cylinder about 2 feet in length and ^ foot in diameter, so that
 its axis should coincide as to its direction with the axis of rotation.
 The cylinder was supported by a light hollow horizontal bar, about
 7 inches in length, to the centre of which the vertically suspended
 wire was soldered.        The wire was set in torsional vibration, and the
 logarithmic      decrement    determined with the same precautions as
before.
    The mode of eliminating the effect of the internal friction of the
 metal wire, and also the effect of the air on the ends of the cylinder,
is fully described in the paper.
    The following were the results : —
          Vibration-period      Coefficient of viscosity Temperature in degree*

In   these experiments the loss of energy arising from the friction of
the air may be characterised as being due to the dragging of the air,
and it is very remarkable that there should be such close agreement
in the valnes of n as determined by this and the previous methods.
The mean value of the coefficient of viscosity of air obtained by
this method is 0'00017746 at a temperature of 12-650° C, and the
mean value deduced from the previous experiments when proper
correction has been made for the rotation of the spheres and cylinders
about their axes is 0-00017711 at a temperature of 11-79° C.                   The
above values of /* are given in C.G.S. units.
    The author expresses his great obligation to Professor Stokes for
his valuable suggestions and advice during the progress of the in
vestigation.

leaf to leaf, and the disease assumed the nature of an epidemic.        The
rise, progress, and climax of the disease were observed            both  on
isolated plants and in the open country, and the nature of the lesions
in the leaves was made out. Evidence was found to support the
view that some plants succumb more rapidly ; this evidence was
tested, and the circumstances    to which the differences are due ex
plained.
   The white disease-spots contain the extremely delicate mycelium
of Entyloma Ranunculi, and the resting-spores of this fungus (one
of the Ustilaginesa) were observed on it. The mycelium is intercellular,
and makes its way in the middle lamella between contiguous cells.
The white powder on the outside of the disease-spot consisted of
conidia, very like those of some Ascomycetes.       The author examined
the anatomical connexion between the conidia and the resting-spores,
and showed that the conidia really belong to the same mycelium
— in other words, the conidia are a second kind of spore of the
Entyloma.
   Even more important is the germination of the conidia.         This has
not been before observed in any Entyloma. The germination was
traced step by step, not only on glass slips, but also on the living plant.
These infections yielded the result that the germinal hyphaa entered
the stomata, and produced a mycelium exactly like that in the disease-
spots first investigated ; not only so, but the resting -spores of tlie
Entyloma were produced on this mycelium, thus placing beyond doubt
the connexion of the two spores. It was observed that it required
a certain time for the disease to spread : this interval of time is the
same as that occupied in infecting plants with the conidia. Moreover,
all the symptoms of the disease produced by infection with the conidia
were as before.

     I   am not aware that any numerical values have ever been de
 termined for the axes of the ellipsoids, which are figures of equi
 librium of a rotating mass of fluid.*
     In- the following paper the problem is treated from the point of
 view necessary for reducing the formules to a condition for computa
 tion, and a table of numerical results is added.
     Let a, b, c be the semi-axes of a homogeneous ellipsoid of unit
 density ; let the origin be at the centre and the axes of x, y, z be in
 the directions a, b, c.

   And since when * vanishes,                          ft also vanishes, the equation

  That is to say there is a solution of the problem which makes
a=b.
  Thus there is solution which gives us an ellipsoid of revolution.

    These formulae are,     it must    be admitted, of but    little    use, since    it
would be necessary to take in higher powers of sin2« to obtain results
for a variation of 7 of more than 1°.

between     a. and 7 is

    We shall return later to a modification of (24) which will be
applicable to very long ellipsoids of equilibrium.
    Besides the angular velocity and the axes of the ellipsoid, the other
important functions are the moment of momentum, the kinetic energy
of rotation, and the intrinsic energy of the mass.           In order to express
these numerically we must adopt a unit of length, and it will be con
venient to take a, where
                             a3  =  aba — ascos /3 cos 7.
Thus                             a = a(sec fi sec 7)'.
    Let a be the density of the fluid which has hitherto been treated as
unity, and let ($jr<r)ia5/t, (£jr<r)5a6e be the moment of momentum and
kinetic energy, then

    The function (26) is the quantity which will he tabulated.
    Thus in the tables the unit of moment of momentum is taken as
( J7r<7)?a6, or m'ai, and the nnit of energy as (|7r<r)2as or m2/a.
    It remains to evaluate the intrinsic energy, or the energy required
to expand the ellipsoid against its own gravitation, into a condition
of infinite dispersion.
    If dt be an element of volume, then this energy is
                                                                        Yedt

   This will be denoted by (f jra-)2a5(i— 1), or                                                       m2a_1     (i— 1), so that          t
will be positive.
   Now Y=LxS + Mi/* + Nz* + P, and if we denote by A, B, C, the prin

from the elliptic integrals with logarithms of only seven figures, but
the solutions were confirmed by the approximate formulae (21) and
 (22).  The solution for 7=80° was confirmed by the approximate
formulae   (23) and (24), and that for 7=85° was only computed
therefrom, since when 7=80° the approximate formula gave nearly
identical results with the exact one.

   It will be noticed that the longer the ellipsoid the slower it rotates.
It is interesting  to observe that while the angular velocity continually
diminishes, the moment of momentum continually increases. The
long ellipsoids are very nearly ellipsoids of revolution about an axis
perpendicular to that of rotation. Thus in fig. 2 the section through
b and c is not much flattened.
    The most remarkable point is that there is a maximnm of kinetic
energy when a/a is about 3, or when the length of the ellipsoid is
about five times its diameter.     However, notwithstanding this maxi
 mum    of kinetic  energy,  the total  energy always increases with the
 length of the ellipsoid.
    The kinetic energy is the product of two factors, one of which
 always increases, and the other of which always diminishes ; thus it is
 obvious that it must have a maximum.           The result was, however,
 quite unforeseen, and it seems worth while to obtain simpler forumlee
 for the case of the long ellipsoids. This may be done by taking as the
parameter a/a, or the length of the ellipsoid, instead of <y.
    From the table we see that in the later entries /J is very nearly

founded on a paper by Sir William Thomson, is offered.

true, but the question remains as to what amount of friction       to be                           is
regarded   as sufficing to produce the result, and whether oceanic  tidal
friction can be great enough to have the effect which he supposes                                        it
to have.
    The friction here contemplated       such that the integral effect
                                                         is                                              is
represented by a retarding force proportional to the velocity of the
fluid relatively to the bottom. Although proportionality to the square
of the velocity would probably be nearer to the truth, yet Laplace's
hypothesis suffices for the present discussion.     In oscillations of the
class under consideration, the water moves for half     period north, and            a
then  for half a period  south.
    Now in systems where the resistances are proportional to velocity,
it    usual to specify the resistance by a modulus of decay, namely,
     is
that period in which a velocity           reduced by friction to e-1 or
                                                         is

is such, that the modulus of decay is short compared with the semi-
period of oscillation.
   The quickest of the tides of long period is the fortnightly tide, hence
for the applicability of Laplace's conclusion, the modulus of decay
must be short compared with a week. Now it seems practically
certain that the friction of the ocean bed would not much affect the
velocity of a slow ocean current in a day or two. Hence we cannot
accept Laplace's hypothesis as to the effect of friction.
   We now, therefore, proceed to the solution of the equation of
motion when friction is entirely neglected.
   The solution here offered is indicated in a footnote to a paper by
Sir William Thomson (' Phil. Mag.,' vol. 50, 1875, p. 280), but has
never been worked out before.
   The symmetry of the motion demands that u, when expanded in
a series of powers of fi, shall only contain even powers of fi.
   Let us assume then

    We may remark that         if
                      —A     I
 then the general equation of condition           in (7) maybe held to apply for
 all values of i from 1 to infinity.
    Let us now write it in the form —
                        jWl        !      1   fig  i   1                            tO\
    When   i is large, 52i+i/-B«-i either tends to become infinitely small,
 or it does not do   so.
    Let us suppose that it does not tend to become infinitely small.
 Then it is obvious that the successive B'a tend to become equal to one
another, and so also do the coefficients i?si_i— f2Bu+1 in the expression
for dujd/i.
                      I — -s, where L, M
    Hence   ^=Zr+'i-—                             are finite,  for all values of «.

         do                        vL—,1?
fi = 1 at the pole, and         jdt is infinite there also.
    Hence the hypothesis, that Bti+JBti-l does not tend to become
infinitely small, gives us infinite velocity at the pole.                But with a
globe covered with water this is impossible, the hypothesis is negatived,
and £|j+i/I?i<-i tends to become infinitely small.
    This being established let us write (8) in the form —
    By repeated applications of (9) we have in the form of               a continued
fraction
              —    '

hold in order to satisfy the condition that the water covers the whole

equal to
    These two cases, /3=40, /9=10, are two of those for which Laplace
 has given solutions in the case of the semi-diurnal and diurnal tides.
We notice that, with such oceans              as we have to deal with, the tide of
long period     is certainly    less   than   half  its equilibrium amount.
    Iu Thomson and Tait's Natural Philosophy ' (edition of 1883) I
                                     '
have made a comparison of the observed tides of long period with the
equilibrium theory.           The probable errors of the results are large,
but    not such   as to render     them worthless, and in view of the present
investigation it is surprising to find that on the average the tides of
long period amount to as much as two-thirds of their equilibrium
value.
                                                                  '
    The investigation in the ' Natnral Philosophy was undertaken in
the belief of the correctness of Laplace's view as to the tides of long
period, and was intended to evaluate the effective rigidity of the
earth's mass.
    The present result shows us that it is not possible to attain any
estimate of the earth's rigidity in this way, bnt as the tides of long
period are distinctly sensible, we may accept the investigation in the
'                           '
  Natural Philosophy          as generally confirmatory of Thomson's view
as to the great effective rigidity of the whole earth's mass.
    There is one tide, however, of long period of which Laplace's argu
ment from friction must hold true.                In consequence of the regression
of the nodes of the moon's orbit there is a minute tide with a period
of nearly nineteen years, and in this case friction must he far more
important than inertia.            Unfortunately this tide is very minute, and
iis  I have  shown     in  a  Report for 1886 to the British Association on
the tides, it is entirely masked by oscillations of sea level produced
by meteorological or other causes.
    Thus it does not seem likely that it will ever be possible to evaluate
the effective rigidity of the earth's mass by means of tidal observa
tions.

                                         Introduction.
  This paper is devoted generally to experimental verification of a
method of condensation    applied to the determination of specific heat.
The extension     of the method to the calorimetry of latent heat of
gasification has been the subject of some experiments,   but the further
delay necessary    to complete             these compels              conme to defer their
sideration. Similarly its application, theoretically practicable,  to  the
direct determination of the specific heats of gases at constant volnme,
is not here considered.
    In another paper (p. 250) some results bearing on the possible value
of the method in physical mineralogy and in determinative mineralogy
are given. The method was originally devised in the hope that it
might be of service in this branch of investigation.
    On the subject of this paper a couple of brief notices only have up
to the present been published.         One of these arose out of an
informal notice brought before the Royal Dublin Society ;* the
second from a verbal account laid before the Dublin University
 Experimental Science Association. f
    To the facilities extended to me by Prof. Fitzgerald, in the Physical
 Laboratory of Trinity College, the 'whole of the experimental veri
 fication of the method is due.                I
                                    have not attempted to acknowledge
 anywhere adequately     how  much is due to his advice and suggestions.

                   is                           .have called the apparatus

                               I
vapour   in  effecting  determinations   of specific heat gravimetrically.
There are evidently sufficient reasons in favour of its use, chief among
these is the accurate knowledge we possess of its latent heat through
Regnault's experiments. But the ease with which              may be gene   it
rated, and its chemical inertness when in presence of the materials of
the calorimeter, are also important. The range of temperature too
involved     sufficiently considerable, and, for my purpose, allowed of
              is
convenient comparison with the data of Regnault and others on
specific heat obtained generally through this same range.       By the use
of other vapours greater weights of condensation are obtainable, but
this is  only of consequence when dealing with very small quantities
 of matter. The variations, however, in the upper limit of temperature
thus obtainable might be otherwise important.
                        Description    of   a Gravimetric Calorimeter.
   Whatever vapour be used in this method of calorimetry, two chief
conditions must be attended to in its employment (1) sudden replace    :
ment of the air surrounding the substance by the vapour to be con
densed    (2) perfect mechanical conditions permitting the evaluation
          ;
of the weight condensed while the substance      still surrounded with
                                                                  is
the vapour.
   To effect the first of these conditions we might evidently either
introduce the substance quickly into a chamber filled with and sup
plied with the vapour, or, maintaining the substance throughout in
one chamber, replace the air around      by sudden and rapid inflow of
                                                         it
the vapour. In choosing the last we dispense both with much con
trivance and manipulation involved in the first. The error of trans

 354                                 Mr.    J.   Joly,
 ference obtaining in all other methods is almost entirely avoided, and
 in fact the facilities offered by the method are more fully availed of.
 We have in fact a change of state method which involves, as hope to       I
 show, no sensible radiation errors, the simplest thermometry and appa
 ratus, and no manipulative difficulties whatsoever.
    Plate 6 is from a photograph of the apparatus.      The calorimeter
 consists    of a nearly spherical chamber of very thin spun brass,
  105 cm. in diameter, made up of two hemispheres meeting on thin
  ground .flanges. These hemispheres are carried by standards -which
  slide upon the centre one of three rails forming a light girder.       This
  girder is supported on three feet, and is arranged to stand in one
  assigned position inside the case of a large physical balance.      used it  I
  for a considerable time exactly in the position of the bridge used for sup
  porting a beaker in taking specific gravities ; that is, spanning one of
  the pans and passing between its stirrups.             I
                                                      subsequently found it
  necessary   to remove the pan, substituting a counterpoise.      It will be
  understood now that when the standards carrying the hemispheres
 are slid along the centre rail, the sphere can be completed inside the
 balance case, and when meeting about the centre of the rail, may be
 made to enclose a substance depending from the hook of the balance.
 To permit of the substance being weighed while thus enclosed in the
 sphere, a notch is provided in the flanges at their top meeting point.
 This notch       for reasons to be explained later, cnt in two little plugs
                 is,
 of plaster of Paris, contained in cells provided for them.       The sphere
 has two openings with short tubulures, one on each hemisphere,
 horizontal, and opposite one another.       The larger of the two. 2'2 cm.
 diameter, opening to the front of the balance, serves for the admis
 sion of steam     ;the other, which when in use          prolonged by the

 diameter, and serves for the exit of steam at the rear of the balance.
    To secure the more sudden admission of steam, a movable admis
sion pipe fitting the front nozzle on a ground joint         provided. It
                                                                  is                    is
carried on separate standard, also fitting the centre rail, and
             a                                                          con        is
nected with      a small tin or copper boiler* by a flexible tube, so that
when   it  and the rubber tube connexion have been first thoroughly
heated by the passage of steam,         can be run up on the centre rail to
                                       it
meet the nozzle and
                           discharge the steam directly into the sphere.
Over the entire length of the
                                       calorimeter extends a rectangular
tunnel-shaped covering of mahogany, made in halves, meeting at the
centre of the girder, and
                             provided with notches at their meeting faces,

porting the substance contained within the sphere.        But one-half this
covering   is shown in the plate.  It is  borne upon  the two outside rails
of the girder, which between the rails is filled in with mahogany. The
tunnel serves to isolate the calorimeter completely from the mechanism
of the balance, and thus arranged I can detect no errors due to escape
of heat.    The apparatus might, however, also be arranged to stand
beneath the balance, the balance being supported on a shelf, and a
wire carried down from it to the calorimeter.
   The little screws seen at the feet of the standards bear against the
upper surface of the rail, enabling the standards to be adjusted for the
accurate meeting of the ground joints. This is effected once for all.
For smooth working the standards are clipped sideways against the
rail by spring straps. Thumbscrews on top of the standards permit
axial motion of the several parts, enabling the hemispheres to be
adjusted for the free passage of the wire. The steam ways are insu
lated from the standards by split rings of hard wood.         Beneath the
sphere, and accommodated by a gap in the central rail, a little vessel
is placed for catching the water which drips from the sphere during
experiment. The correct position of the girder is secured by means of
a plate fixed to the floor of the balance, and provided with recesses to
receive the feet of the girder. The girder is thus placed in position,
and may be lifted in and out as required, without necessity of any
readjustment.

the bucket for catching the condensed vapour dropping from              are    it,

removed for cleaning and drying. Buckets made of silver foil quickly
tarnish, owing to impurities in the steam. They prove less constant
in calorific capacity than those of platinum.*
                    Method   of   Making an Experiment.
  In exemplification of   the manipulation involved in making an
experiment, I describe one made on cast zinc.   The piece of zinc                    is
probably nearly pure.  It  weighs 48'300 grams.
  About an hour before we make the experiment                  it
                                                      placed on the is

 balance.   The hemispheres of the calorimeter are then run up on the
 rail from each side of the balance and closed around the carrier.
  They are placed so that the wire passes freely through the aperture
 provided. A thermometer graduated to the tenth part of a degree
  Centigrade is next inserted in the tubulure opening to the front of the
 balance, so that its bulb projects well into the sphere.        The tunnel-
 shaped covering is placed in position, and the piece of zinc and the
 carrier counterpoised.    The balance is sensitive to half milligrams.
    We assume that the thermometer indicates closely the temperature
 of the zinc after the lapse of about an hour. At the end of that time
 the boiler is heated up, and steam passed briskly through the leading
 tube to heat it throughout.      This tube is of a length permitting the
 boiler to be placed at a safe distance from the calorimeter.      The ther
 mometer, where it projects from the sphere, is now read, in doing
 which it is necessary to remove the front half of the tunnel for a
moment.      The temperature indicated is 10" 73° (corrected at Kew),
the last number by estimation.
    The thermometer is now withdrawn         and the admission pipe slid
 quickly along the rail up to the calorimeter, the leading tube beiDg
 pinched for a moment during this brief operation.          Steam is now
 flowing rapidly into the calorimeter; in a few seconds it begins to
 escape at the exit tube to the far side of the balance.          When it is
 seen to come out freely a valve on the boiler is opened, and so much
steam diverted directly into the air that it now issues but slowly from
 the exit tube of the calorimeter.
    The balance being let down on its bearings, weights are added till equi
librium obtains. If the substance is quite heated this weight remains
absolutely adequate, if not the weight is again adjusted when no further
increase is apparent. After the space of about one minute we find the
 balance continues to vibrate equably ; we observe it for some five or
ton minutes, and see that there is no change in the equable vibrations
of the pointer.      We are sure then that the total weight of con
densation is obtained.     It is found to be 0'798 gram.
    A thermometer   — also reading to tenths — inserted in a little tubulure
provided for it on the boiler, reads 100'25° (corrected at Kew).
    The experiment is now completed, and it only remains to make a
couple of corrections on the value obtained as the weight of con
densed steam before calculating the specific heat of the piece of zinc.
Two corrections are necessary —
    (1.) The bucket has, by a previous experiment, been found to
condense 0-031 gram of water over a range of 87'9u°.          The range in
                             —
our experiment is 100'25° 10-73°=89"52.           Therefore the deduction
for the bucket is —
                      0 031 + 89'5^~87'9Q      X 0-031,
or 0'0315 very nearly.

   (2.) The piece of zinc was counterpoised in air, but the density of
steam being less than that of air there was an apparent increase of
weight on the replacement of the air by steam, to an amount equiva
lent to the volume of the substance multiplied by the specific gravity
of steam (air being unity) at the pressure prevailing.   It is sufficient
t<, take this generally as equal to 0'00062 gram       cubic centimetre
                                                   per
displacement (see Appendix).     Taking the specific gravity of zinc aa
7, and its weight being 48'300 grams, the valne of the correction is— •
                              ~x         0-00062 = 0-0043 gram.
The total deduction from the weight of condensation observed is
then 0-0358; we take this as 0'036 in view of the limits of accuracy
imposed by the balance.     This leaves, as very nearly the true con
densation due to the calorific capacity of the piece of zinc raised from
t1

             On the Method     of Condensation in Cahrimetry.                    359
    Some diversity of result exists among          the determinations by other
experimenters.       Probably   much    of  this  diversity is to be ascribed to
actual difference in the molecular condition of the samples operated
on.    The veracity of the present method must be judged then by
general agreement with previous observations.                In the case of zinc,
however, the most reliable       observations     are   probably those of Bede,
Bunsen, and Regnault.          The first of these observers, it will be re
membered, extended his observations to the variations in the specific
heat of zinc with change of temperature limit.*              From those observa
tions the value for the mean calorific capacity between 10° and 100° is
deduced as 0'09412.        This is identical, it may be said, with the value
found by the method of condensation.
    Compare, also, in this list of experiments on zinc — and throughout
the table — the variations of temperature interval, sufficiently revealed
in the varying values of          with the delicate compensating variations
in the weights of condensed vapour, resulting in the close agreement
of the values deduced.       It will be seen too that among the five results
on zinc the extreme variation from the mean amounts to no more
than 0-17 per cent.
    The experiments on aluminium, silver, and platinum tax more
 severely the consistency of the experiments, owing to the limits of
accuracy imposed by the balance.                 Of the experiments made on
 aluminium, one is not recorded owing to a doubt about the accuracy
 of the initial temperature coupled with an abnormal result.                     The
 mean finally arrived at agrees with Mallet's experimentsf effected in
 Bunsen's ice calorimeter. This value accords better with Dulong and
 Petit's generalisation than the lower values of Regnault and Kopp.
    In the experiments on silver, much care had to be taken in esti
 mating the value of w.          No bucket was used, the specimen being
 looped in a fine platinum wire, the small quantity of water precipi
 tated adhering to its surface.       It is the smallest condensation have     I
 attempted to deal with.
    The series on platinum were some of the earliest effected by the
 method, and that in a very rude form of the apparatus.                  Two of the
 first experiments are not included in the list.
    As,  I think, some import may fairly be attached to consistency in
 experiments where prevailing conditions vary, I quote for comparison
 the extremes of Regnault's experiments on metals              I have dealt with.

If  these be compared with the extremes contained in the table it will
be found that, except in the case of silver, the comparison is favour
able to the method of condensation.
    At  the suggestion of Professor Fitzgerald, experiments on distillrd
water sealed in glass envelopes were undertaken.                It   appeared
probable that the specific heat of this substance, as obtained in
experiments made on a very large scale by Regnault, would afford
more reliable    data for comparison than metallic solids, in the case of
which too it is likely that differences in molecular freedom mar exist
affecting the calorific capacity to a considerable extent.            Again it
was easy to obtain this substance sufficiently pure      with facility.   The
experiments were carried out as follows :—
    A very thin   glass bulb is blown before the blowpipe.       Its capacity
is to be sotne 15 or 20 c.c.    In drawing off the tube, a      little hook is
 left for conveniently suspending the bulb in       the calorimeter.     It is
sealed by closing the extremity of the hook ;        but before doiDg so we
see that no appreciable quantity of moisture        is enclosed, introduced
from the breath in blowing it. If moisture is       visible it is expelled by
repealed heating and cooling, the cooling finally being effected several
times in a desiccator.      Neglect of this caused appreciable error in
some of my experiments ; it was ultimately detected in the abnormal
specific heat ascribed to glass by the initial experiments             on the
envelope.     It is probable that this trace of water, as suggested by
Professor Fitzgerald, and contrary to my original idea when ignoring
it, acts more by its latent heat of vaporisation than by its specific heat.
    To ascertain the amount of precipitation to be allowed for this
envelope, it is hung from a wire loop between the stirrups of the
carrier, so that condensation falling from it is received in the bucket
beneath.
   The total condensation for bulb and carrier together with that due
to the air contained in the bulb, including also the effect of displace
ment difference from air to steam, afford —
       (1.)  Wl=0-116.            ....         Range, 11-0— 100-35°
      (2.)   Wl=0116.             ....         Range, 11"3— 100'35°
    The bulb is now opened by removing the extremity of the glass
hook, and weighed = 2 084 grams.            The height of the barometer
(760) and temperature (11°) are noted.
   The next operation is to fill it with distilled water. This is effected
under the receiver of the
                             air-pump by exhausting while the orifice of
the bulb is submerged, and again
                                      cautiously exposing to atmospheric
pressure.    A space is left unfilled to allow for subsequent expansion.
The contents of the bulb are now raised
                                            to boiling point by immersing
in a bath of boiling water, and it is
                                          sealed with the blowpipe while
at this temperature.      This is necessitated by the thinness of the

glass      ;        it
             was found that such bulbs will not stand the internal
pressure   otherwise   obtaining at steam temperature.
   Its weight is now 15'930 grams. It is estimated that its content
is altogether 16'5 c.c. ; this quantity of air at 760 mm. and 11°, as
above, weighs very closely O020 gram.              The deduction for the

   In subsequent experiments with this bulb of water, it          necessary                               is
from the precipitation obtained to deduct to, as ascertained by experi
ments (1) and (2), above, diminished however by the quantity of
precipitation to be ascribed to the calorific capacity of the contained
air present in those experiments.       Taking the specific heat of air as
0"2389, this retrenchment calculates to be nearly         mgrm. of precipi          1
tation, and          taken as such as
                          it     is          probably contained  still some
                                                                    it
moisture.     This leaves the deduction as 0'115 for range of 89'2°,                               a
Although     the nearly constant displacement difference of the bulb
from air to steam        here included, this quantity may without sensible
                                      is
 error be recalculated for variations in temperature range as the cor
 rection on the large condensations          subsequently  obtained.    The
 further process of experiment        the same as previously described in
                                                            is
 the case of zinc.

   The last four experiments in the table were carried out in such a
way that the rate of precipitation was much retarded, in fact the
conditions were altered to those prevailing in the case of a very badly
conducting body. This was effected by shielding the glass bulb from
direct contact with the steam by a loose fitting copper-foil box, an
intervening air-jacket being left around the bulb. With this arrange
ment precipitation was hardly completed in 15 minutes         the naked                                   ;

bulb was quite heated in something less than four. A dednetion
of course made for the shield by preliminary experiments.
   I would point out that any error in Regnault's estimate of the
increase of specific heat of water with rise of temperature will militate
in a double sense against the agreement of his results with mine. For
this increase is assumed by Regnault in deducing, from his formula
for the total heat of steam, the heat of evaporation, and, as it is
subtractive, an error on the side of excess in his estimate of the specific
heat of water introduces an error on the side of insufficiency in the
value ascribed to \, and vice versa.            Thus not alone would the quantity
with which        I   compare my results be erroneously assumed, but in
proportion as error exists in its value, error in the opposite direction
would be introduced into my results.
   I add some experiments bearing on questions of radiation error as

from them that the extent of surface exposed by a substance to the

consistency can hardly be the result of chance.                         As liability to radia

reveal, I think, that the method is not open to appreciable error from
such sources.

     Apart from experiment,                 I think sufficiently careful consideration
 shows that we might expect very considerable accuracy from the
 method.          There is theoretically, it will be found, but one source of
 error needing serious consideration; it is the danger of precipitation
 occurring, not on the surface of the substance, but at points close to

the surface ; in other words, the formation of mist by radiation from
the steam to the cold substance.
   Now it is assured that on the replacement of air by steam a film
of water is instantaneously deposited on the surface of the substance,
and, assuming an abundant supply of steam, condensation then pro
ceeds as fast as heat is transferred by conductivity and diffusion
 across this film to the cold surface of the solid beneath.      While then
 we must assume that the inner surface of the film is appreciably at
the temperature of this cold snrface, it is probable that we may also
assume the outer surface of the film to be throughout the experiment
nearly at the temperature of the steam. There can be but little
difference, for fall in temperature is made good with great rapidity
by fresh condensation.        There is hero in the first place a favourable
condition, as surface radiation can, under such circumstances, be but
insignificant in amount, and radiation from points in the surrounding
steam can only be supposed as affecting points within the film or, in
some cases, within the substance.        Only in this way can we suppose
the formation of precipitation elsewhere than at the very snrface of
the film by actual contact.      But again, the opacity of water to radia
tion from aqueous vapour       will here afford protection.     This opacity,
it will be remembered, has been shown by Tyndall and others to be
very great. Thus I find that Tyndall records among his experiments
that a layer of water but O07 of an inch in thickness transmitted but
l'l   per cent, of the radiation from a hydrogen flame.            It may be
supposed that the more perfect accord between the vibration periods
of radiator and absorber obtaining in the calorimeter will ensure
greater, if not perfect, opacity.
   The contact precipitation, consequent on the loss of vis viva of the
impinging molecules — the film transmitting the energy to the sub
stance — insures that there will be many molecules entering and few
leaving, and hence extension of free path or diminution of pressure in
directions normal to the surface of the substance. There is then super
added as a protective element a converging drift of steam npon the sub
stance, tending to restore to it what precipitation may possibly be due
to radiation. Under perfect conditions of steam supply — could we
suppose, for example, the substance in a chamber which could be
supplied with steam from so many points that we might substitute
the idea of an unlimited region of steam suddenly brought around
it — this drift, I think, oxcludes almost the possibility of error supposing
radiation. In attainable conditions, where cross draughts will prevail
to some extent, there would still evidently be protection involved in
the very fact of condensation.
   There are, then, three circumstances tending to nullify this error ;
the high temperature of the external surface, the adinthermanons
nature of the water film, and the converging drift of Steam. Whether

               On  the Method   of Condensation in Calorimetry.          365
  all three act, or whether the first two are not practically efficacious of
  themselves,    I think that theory is here in accord with experiment in
 showing that on this count no appreciable inaccuracy is to be appre
 hended.
     There are a few other considerations.      From the facts that there is
 a  fall of temperature across the film, the gradient descending nearly
 to the temperature of the substance on the one side, and that through
 out the period of condensation the film continually gravitates down
 wards as it receives accretion from without, it might be expected that
 water which had not yet risen to steam temperature might in some
 cases reach the bucket.       This occurs, but need obviously be no source
 of error. If experiments be made in glass calorimeters, the formation
 of a dew on the underside of the bucket will often be noticed ; to this
 extent it does no harm.          But in the case of sudden and copious
 precipitation, especially in the case of smooth substances, where water
 runs off more freely at points close to the surface of the body, the
 precipitation on the outside of the bucket may collect in such quantity
 that drops fall off.      I have occasionally noticed this, and it should be
 borne in mind ; but with the flat form of bucket used, and the safe
guard afforded by the supporting claw, there is little danger of this
occurring up to rapid precipitations not much exceeding a couple of
grams.       Over that amount a second catchwater, which may be of
small dimensions, should be provided beneath the claw.
    The substance hanging in the steam is safe from radiation errors.
The phenomena attending accretion of weight terminate in the con
ditions which prevail in the case of a liquid in presence of a saturated
atmosphere of its own vapour, the whole maintained at constant
temperature and pressure, when the relative weights of liquid and
vapour remain constant statistically, and absolutely so far as we can
measure.        If radiation from the hot substance to the cooler walls of
the calorimeter occurred, constancy of weight would not be attained.
It is certain that the least radiation across the steam-jacket would be
revealed in continued slow accretion of weight. But there is nothing
so striking in experiments effected by this method as the steadily
maintained equilibrium of the balance once the substance has attained
the temperature of the steam, the pointer vibrating with perfect
equality so long, apparently, as we chose to prolong the experiment.
If the steam supply be cut off for a moment there is loss of weight,
and on restoration of steam there is finally on the whole gain of
weight, for radiation, as well as evaporation, occurs in the absence of
steam.      If  the pressure be appreciably increased by throttling the
exit pipe and partially closing the boiler for a couple of seconds, the
balance reveals increase of weight ; but so long as the pressure is
neither increased nor diminished equilibrium is absolutely preserved.
     It is obvious that disturbing effect due to water-dust or mechanically

366                                Mr.   J.   Joly.
suspended     water in the steam is negatived by this constancy of
weight.     Probably such dnst is all deposited in the steam pipe
shortly after leaving the boiler.
    Mist or water-dust doubtless is present at first, due to the condensa
tion produced in heating up air in the calorimeter.         Some of this is
thrown upon the substance,         but this   will  be small in quantity,
probably inappreciable, and acts against what error is due to radia
tion from the incoming steam to the substance.         This last is an error
analogous to the error of transference in other methods, but with
easily attainable rapidity of air displacement probably far less.
   The degree of accuracy attainable in effecting the measurements
remains to be considered.      Of these, it is evident that in obtaining
the temperature limits great accuracy is attained by the use of
thermometers of no extraordinary sensitiveness.          If      and tj°  are   t3°
reliable to     part of a degree, over    range of 80° we are observing
                                              a
to      part the quantity to be measured.
   As regards the observation of w, the weight of water condensed,
obviously the degree of accuracy attainable depends on the sensitive
ness of the balance and the magnitude of w. It               also necessary,
                                                                is
however, to consider in some detail how far        has been found possible
                                                       it
to perfect the mechanical conditions attending the observation of the
weight of the substance while immersed in steam.
    It evident in the first place that as regards the danger of intro
      is
ducing error into the equilibrium of the balance by heat radiating to
its parts, the difficulty may at once be got over by arranging things
so that the calorimeter      outside the balance case, as beneath it, the
                              is
balance standing on a shelf, suppose, and a wire taken down through
apertures in balance floor and shelf.     In the form already described,
indeed,I   have detected no error due to unequal heating of the beam,
although have frequently looked for
           I                                    it    by
                                                  unhooking the substance
during experiment and testing for want of equilibrium.           This    due    is
to the protection afforded by the non-conducting material of the tunnel.
 It was necessary, however, to retain but one pan, as heat conducted by
the rails through the floor of the calorimeter set up a draught tending
to draw up the pan.
I     have detected no error, measurable by the balance, due to con
densation on the wire for suspending the substance, where             issues
                                                                           it
from the calorimeter.     If this wire be closely observed will be seen
                                                                     it

the balance shows no sign of any gradual increment of weight.           This

 experiment on the constancy of weight has been extended               to over
 half an bour on many occasions.
   The nse of plaster of Paris in forming the aperture avoids what
uncertainty and want of sensibility wonld be introduced into the
weighing by watur permitted to accumulate in the orifice. Until this
plan of catting the aperture in a bibulous material was resorted to, the
accumulation of water gave much trouble.            The plaster remains dry
when in use for an indefinite time, and wears well.        That now in the
calorimeter has served through more than 300 experiments. It is also
very easily renewed.
   In order to avoid as far as possible escape of steam up the wire and
ensure constancy of pressure,    I have lately adopted a plan which acts
automatically in keeping the calorimeter full of steam sensibly at
atmospheric pressure.       The arrangement consists in locating the
escape valve of the boiler at a level so much below the level of admis
sion into the calorimeter, that a small and constant pressure — due to
the levity of the steam — is established, urging the gas to ascend the
tube leading to the calorimeter.     This end is secured by affixing the
escape-valve to the end of a wide tube which is taken from the boiler
bent twice at right angles and carried down to a level outside the
boiler sufficient to secure the requisite pressure ; a couple of deci
metres " head
                "
                  will in general be sufficient.
   The effect on the weighing of steam draught within the calorimeter
can be entirely avoided by shielding or jacketing.              In the form
already  described,  indeed, it seldom  gave    trouble, but  in  this respect
I have in a recent form improved the apparatus. It is worthy of
notice, also, that the conditions prevailing when we weigh a substance
at a temperature different from that of the air within the balance
case do not obtain here, the substance            in the calorimeter being
surrounded by an atmosphere at its own temperature.
          Description of an Improved Gravimetric Calorimeter.
   I have  designed an apparatus intended to carry out such conditions
as have suggested themselves as conducing to accuracy and to ready
working.     Its advantages have already to a great extent been prac
tically tested in a recently completed instrument, but this instrument
serving itself to suggest improvements is not the same as that now
described. Plate 7 shows a vertical section and plan.
   The apparatus it will be seen consists of a cylindrical chamber with
conical ends. This chamber is divided in a vertical plane passing
through its axis, the separate halves being firmly hinged on a tripod
borne on three adjusting screws. The chamber is thus readily opened
by turning back the halves, and closed by pressing them together,
when they meet on a ground edge. It is made of brass and kept as

368                               Mr.   J.   Joly.
slight as possible. The half chambers being closed, steam is admitted
at the top of the apparatus, the expelled air escaping at the bottom
through a tube which passes through the base of the instrument.
In plan it will    be seen  that the steam is admitted by a forked or
branching tube at two tubulures, which in elevation are seen to be
cut back so as to afford a ready seat for the supply pipe, and also that
the latter when placed in position may conduce to bind closer the
half-chambers. The steam pipe is supported further and retained in
position on a light pillar springing from the tripod base.       To its seat
on this pillar it is clipped by a spring bearing against the centre of
the fork, but so that it may readily be laid in its position. A little
tubulure is also provided for conveniently taking the temperature by
inserting a thermometer.* At other times this tubulure is closed by
a little cap (not shown in the drawing).       Two half-cylindrical plugs
of plaster of Paris, notched at their meeting faces, serve as before ti»
pass the wire depending from the balance,, which is supposed to rest
upon a shelf placed above the apparatus.
   Within the outer shell of the calorimeter an inner shield of very
slight brass is provided, similar in shape, and capable of a rotational
motion of about 60° about its vertical axis.           This is effected by
attaching it to a tube which rotates smoothly in the exit-tube at the
base of the calorimeter.     It is worked by a stud projecting through a
horizontal slot cut in the latter. The shield is made in halves, and
opens on hinges affixed to the rotating tube.      Above, each half of the
shield is perforated, so that when in one extreme position it receives
 within it all the entering steam, but on being rotated 60° no longer
admits steam directly, the perforations being then turned away from
the entrance tubulures.
   When it is desired to close the exit-tube of the calorimeter, a stop
is pressed in through a horizontal slot in the tube.      Water condensed
from the steam by radiation from the calorimeter is received in a little
trough placed beneath the tripod stand.
   The apparatus is worked as follows : —
   The carrier being suspended at the right height on the wire from
the balance, and the substance being arranged upon         the calorimeter,
                                                             it,
with its inner and outer cases drawn back,         moved under and then
                                                     is
closed upon it.     The inner case    now rotated so that the calorimeter
                                      is
s
i  thus still further closed, and also one of the apertures of the shield, so
placed that   a  thermometer may be passed through the small tubulure
into the interior of the calorimeter. To guard the calorimeter against
sudden changes of temperature while the thermometer                assuming
                                                                     is
   * The effect of scale parallax in reading thermometers may conveniently be
avoided by bringing the scale into coincidence with ita reflection on the mercury
thread of the thermometer. The way of doing this     easily acquired after a couple
                                                     is
of trials.

            On the Method     of Condensation in Cahrimetry.            369
the temperature       it is necessary to provide a cover of nonconducting
material —  as wood —   made in halves, and closing so as to permit the
reading of the thermometer.
   When it is desired to carry ont the experiment, the forked tnbe,
which is connected with the boiler by 2 or 3 metres of rubber tubing,
is separately heated with steam, the valve on the boiler being closed.
The thermometer in the calorimeter is then read and withdrawn, the
cover removed, and the shield rotated into the position for admitting
steam.     The steam-pipe is now laid in position ; the construction
enables this to be done very rapidly and easily.       Steam is thns passed
directly into the inner chamber at two points, and the inner chamber
being very slight condenses but a small quantity of steam, so that
the displacement of the air is retarded as little as possible, and is, in
fact, with the empty calorimeter almost immediate.         On steam flowing
out freely at the exit-tube, the valve in the bailer is opened and the
calorimeter closed by pressing home the stop in the exit-tube.
   The adjustment of the wire in the orifice is now effected by the
screws on the tripod.       Effected in this way this is a very easy opera
tion, although the orifice may be hardly 1 mm. in diameter and the
wire some 40 cm. long. Balance and calorimeter must, however, be
steadily supported.       The weighing is now begun, and when it is
found that the substance is no longer condensing steam, is finished
with the shield in the calorimeter in its position for sheltering the
substance from draughts.          On this operation being completed, the
thermometer for taking 1% is inserted in its tubulure, which is now
again over one of the orifices in the inner shield and hence admits the
thermometer freely into the calorimeter.
                                   Appendix.
                   Corrections  for Displacement in Steam.
    (1.) The substance being counterpoised      in air is not when immersed
in steam —apart from the        occurrence of condensation — any longer in
equilibrium with the counterpoise, the density of saturated steam at
ordinary pressures being different from that of air. The deduction
from the apparent weight of condensation on the substance is equi
valent to the volume of the substance multiplied by the difference in
the weights of unit volumes of steam and air. By the apparent
weight of condensation is meant that deduced on subtracting from the
 weight added to the counterpoise during an experiment the weight
 due to condensation on the carrier.       Let this apparent weight be wv
    The difference in the weights of unit volumes of steam at 100° and
 air at 15° is 0'000636, calculated on the absolute densities of dry air
 and steam according to Regnault.

370                                            Mr.    J. Joly.
  The correction on                  w1   is then — >
                                          -Vx 0-000636        gram,
where     V        is the volume of the substance in cubic centimetres.
   (2.)       If   accuracy be desired, it is necessary further to
                     extreme
reduce the weight of condensation  to vacuo.  Calling ics the weight
deduced after correction (1),  the second correction is on u^, and
is —
                                             + w3x 0-000589,
the factor 0'000589 being the absolute density of saturated steam at
100° (Regnanlt).  It is assumed that we may for the purpose consider
unit weight of water at 100° as equal to unit volume.
  Finally the true weight of water w is very nearly —
                                 «>=(«>!-    VX 0-000636)          x 1-000589.
Regarding the factor 0 000636                     I
                                   may mention that a direct experiment
made in the calorimeter afforded 0-00062 as the difference in weight
of unit volume of steam at 100-2° and air at 17'7U and 766 mm. The
experiment consisted in hanging a heated sphere of blown glass in
the calorimeter — it having been previously counterpoised — and
admitting steam before the sphere had cooled to steam temperature.
When a sufficient time had elapsed to secure equilibrium of tempera
ture the amount necessary to add to the counterpoise to restore
balance was ascertained ; this divided by the volume of the sphere
afforded the relative density sought.*    In the experiment the volume
of the sphere was   38' 7 c.c, the weight added 0-024 gram.
                                             On the Value of X.
   If the value of X be calculated from Regnault's formula for, say,
the cases of a barometer at 720 and 780, the values 537'2 and 536-0
are obtained; at 760 it is 536 5. In careful experiment this variation
must      be         considered.          My practice has          been    to allow      for it by the
approximate assumption                       for ordinary variations of pressure that the
correction on the value                      of X, for the standard pressure 760 mm.
                                               +0-7(100-0.
that is       I take
                                          X=536-5     +   0-7(100-0
where       the temperature of the steam, read directly by a thermo
               t2°   is
meter or deduced — as   conveniently may be and with great accuracy
                                       it
— from the height of the barometer and reference to Regnault's tables
for the corresponding boiling temperature                            of water.

    The President then addressed the Society        as follows: —
    For many years it has been my duty as senior Secretary to read at
each Anniversary the death-roll of the year.             The names this year
are perhaps slightly fewer than usual, but many recall to us faces
once familiar that we shall never see here again.              Earliest among
them comes Sir Frederick Evans, whose death took place only very
shortly after our last Anniversary.         In the course of the preceding
summer he crossed the Atlantic to take part in that International
Conference which assembled at Washington, to deliberate among
other things on the choice of a common prime meridian for all
civilised nations. On his return he was looking ill, and the illness
increased until it carried him away.         Yet even through his illness he
kept on working      at science, at  a task  he had undertaken, and which
was almost completed when he died.             To this I shall have occasion
 to refer again.   In   Mr.  Busk  we  have   lost  one whose detailed know
ledge of certain branches of natural history and comparative anatomy
was almost unrivalled.         He took an active part in the scientific
business of the Society, and repeatedly served on our Council, and
both then and subsequently gave us the benefit of his extensive
knowledge and sound judgment in the important but laborious
task of reporting on papers. In Lord Cardwell we have lost a
statesman whose political duties did not prevent him from coming
among us and serving on our Council.                The public services and
singular honesty     and  straightforwardness      of  Mr. Forster are appre
 ciated by the nation at large. Quite recently, at no advanced age,
                                                                  2 c 2

 374                       Anniversary  Meeting.               [Nov.
                                                                     30,
 we have lost Professor Guthrie, the occupant of a chair which a great
 many years ago     I held for a time ; a man whose genial character
 drew around him a close circle of friends. Still more recently we
 have lost the Earl of Enniskillen, whose fine palawntological collec
 tions are well known to geologists.     Only the other day one passed
 away whom we seldom missed at our anniversary meeting, and who
 was frequently with us on other occasions : I allude to General
 Boileau, whose philanthropic labours will not soon be forgotten, and
 may, I trust, be recognised in a much needed form.
    The Fellows will have noticed with satisfaction a very considerable
excess of income over expenditure in the balance sheet for the year.
At first sight it might be supposed that as the ' Transactions ' corae
 out at irregular intervals there might have been fewer parts published
than usual ; but it will be found on examination that the past year
has borne its proper share of printing expenses.     The excess is really
due to a substantial improvement in the Society's property, under
the careful and judicious management of our Treasurer.
    Last year our President informed the Fellows of the munificent
offer made to the Society by Sir William Armstrong to give to the
Scientific Reliof Fund the sum of 6,500Z., provided an equal sum were
raised within a year by subscription from the Fellows, and if need be,
other friends of science who might not belong to the Society. As the
Fellows are aware, a circular was sent round by the Treasnrer men
tioning Sir William Armstrong's generous offer, and inviting sub
scriptions ; and the Treasurer has also written privately to a number
of persons, Fellows, and others.     The sum subscribed or promised in
response to this invitation amounts to about 4,200Z. ; and though the
sum thus raised does not amount to what Sir William promised to
duplicate if it could be raised, he has most generously not only
waived the non-fulfilment of the condition subject to which the
former offer was made, but has still further augmented it ; and he
now promises not only to duplicate the sum raised in answer to the
Treasurer's appeal, but to give the further sum of 3,600Z., thus
raising the capital from the present sum of about 8.000Z. to 20,0OOZ.
He will be ready to pay the whole sum of 7,800Z. as soon as the sub
scriptions promised to the Treasurer have been collected.       The only
condition attached to this princely gift   is, that besides meeting the
ordinaiy objects for which the Fund was instituted, the Council
should feel themselves at liberty to apply a portion of the income
towards the remission of fees in cases of urgent necessity.
    The path of the total eclipse of the 9th of September last year, in
any place where it fell on land, was so remote from this country that
no expedition went out to observe it.    It was visible in New Zealand,
and in anticipation of it our Eclipse Committee sent out a memo
randum to the Colony indicating the points of special interest to look

 1886.]                     President's Address.                      375
out for. We have received accounts, drawings, and photographs, of
the eclipse from Dr. Hector and others. One of the most remarkable
features of this particular eclipse was the appearance of two white
and unusually bright prominences which attracted general notice,
and were compared to electric lamps, and which, situated on opposite
sides of the sun, were just over the places of two large spots, one
close to the limb, and on the point of disappearing, the other not seen
 before the eclipse but visible next day, having in the meantime come
round the limb.
    The present year afforded another of those rather rare occasions,
 always of brief duration, which are afforded for the study of solar
 physics by a total eclipse of the sun. Calculations made long before
 hand showed that a total eclipse was to be expected on the 29th of
 August.     The path of the total phase on the earth's surface is always
 narrow, say 100 miles or so across, and on this occasion it swept
 obliquely across the Atlantic Ocean, cutting the Western Coast of
 Africa about Benguela, and sweeping across some of the West India
 Islands to a part of the mainland of South America, where it ended.
     Though there was a long belt of ocean over which the totality
 would be visible, and where the imposing spectacle of a total eclipse
 might be witnessed, this was not available for regular scientific obser
 vations, which require land on which to fix the instruments. On the
 mainland of America the total phase would come on so shortly after
 sunrise that the sun would be too low for good observations, and
 therefore the Island of Grenada, which lay within the belt of
 totality, was much to be preferred.
    Of the two available stations, one lay in the British dominions,
 and was pretty easy of access from England, and accordingly it
 seemed to be the duty of our country to take a foremost place in the
observations,   the results of which would be available to the whole
 scientific world. It was contemplated first to send expeditions to both
 places — to Benguela as well as Grenada.      The cost of this would,
however, exceed what could be spared from the Government Grant
 without unduly curtailing what was available for other objects. Ac
cordingly application was made to the Lords of the Treasury for a grant
 of 1,000/. towards the cost of the expeditions.   Enquiries were also
 made as to the probable climate at the two places ; and here I have to
express our thanks to the Governor-General of the Windward
 Islands, who put us in communication with Dr. Wells of Grenada,
from whom we obtained valuable information regarding the climate of
that island, and to the Consul- General for Portugal, who obtained
information for us from the Polytechnic Institution at Lisbon as to
the amount of sunshine about the end of August at Loanda, which
may be taken pretty well as representing Benguela.
    The information we obtained from various sources as to Benguela

376                        Anniversary Meeting.                 [Nov. 30,
was rather conflicting, but there seemed a pretty general agreement
that even if the sun should be shining at the time of the eclipse the
sky was likely to be hazy. This would much interfere with good
observations,  especially as regards the corona; and as the expense of
the expedition to Benguela would be considerable, and the success
very doubtful, we thought it better to give up that part of the project
and confine ourselves to Grenada.       Being anxious to trench as little
as possible on the national expenditure, and finding that a little more
could be taken from the Government Grant than we had expected, we
wrote to the Ti-easury reducing our application to 500Z., which with
assistance from the Admiralty in the shape of the use of a ship-of-
war on the West Indian station, and supplemented by some money
from the Government Grant and from our own Donation Fund, might
¦enable us to meet the expenditure.
   The resnlt was that a sum not exceeding 500Z., to supplement what
could be spared from the Government Grant, was granted, and the
expedition, as the Fellows are aware, has sailed and returned.      It was
fairly successful, the observations having been prevented by clouds at
only one of the stations occupied.
   There has not yet been time to discuss the observations in full, but
two points already appear to have come out pretty clearly.         One is
that the brightness of the corona, which on this occasion was actually
measured, was much less than bad been expected, and less apparently
than it had been on former occasions.      This seems to show that the
brightness is liable to great changes when we compare different years,
as we know is the case with the form.       The other point touches on
the question of the possibility of photographing the corona inde
pendently of an eclipse.     If the photographic brightness of the corona
be not overpowered       by that of the atmospheric glare immediately
around the sun when there is no eclipse, then when the sun is
partially eclipsed we might expect to be able to trace the outline of
the limb of the moon for some way outside the sun, since the moon
would be projected on the background of the corona.          Tho experi
ment was tried both by Captain Darwin at Grenada, and by Dr. Gill
at the Cape, bnt in neither case was the limb traceable outside the
sun.    This throws doubt on, but does not disprove, the validity of the
method proposed by Dr. Huggins ; for he himself has never obtained
photographic appearances apparently referable to the corona since
the Krakatoa eruption.        It may be that the finely suspended par
ticles, whether connected with the Krakatoa eruption or not, which
produced those gorgeous sunsets that were so remarkable, have not
yet wholly subsided, and cause a considerably increased atmospheric
glare.   It may be that the corona has actually been much less bright
than usual for the last few years.
   The present year has been signalised     by that remarkable    volcanic

1886.]                      President's A ddrest.                      377
explosion in New Zealand, of which we have read accounts in the
newspapers. We have received from Dr. Hector a series of photo,
graphs of the district, taken at no great length of time after the
explosion.
   The Krakatoa Committee, which was appointed at the suggestion
of our late President to collect information relative to the great
eruption, have now      I  may say completed their work.       The Royal
Meteorological Society     had   appointed   a Committee  to  get together
information    respecting    the remarkable atmospheric        phenomena
witnessed after the eruption. It was thonght desirable that the
two Committees should work in concert, and accordingly our
Committee was enlarged by the addition of two members of the
Royal Meteorological Society, even though they did not happen to
be members of the Royal Society, who undertook that share of the
work. The information collected under this head is naturally volu
minous, since it requires no special training to describe the atmo
spheric appearances.      Our late Fullow Sir Frederick Evans undertook
the sea disturbance, and continued to work at it even in an advanced
stage of the disease which carried him off. Another fortnight, it was
estimated, would have enabled him to complete it.        His account was
found to have been written in pencil on separate sheets of note paper,
but his successor in the office of hydrographer, Captain Wharton, our
Fellow, was so good as to take up the work ; and partly by the
nse of materials left by Sir F. Evans, partly by his own independent
labour, he hus now completed it.           The report on air disturbance
 was undertaken by General Strachey, and is ready.         Professor Judd
 undertook the geological part ; the materials are ready, and though
the actual report is not yet written, the writing would take but very
little time. Mr. Scott undertook to collect information as to floating
pumice ; bnt as it has been found that the Krakatoa pumice does
not possess distinctive features whereby it could be recognised,
and therefore the origin of the pumice that ships have encountered at
a distance from Krakatoa remains unknown, little trustworthy infor
mation could be obtained under this head, and the report has been
 handed over to Professor Judd to embody with the geology.             The
 heaviest part of the report, that relating to sunsets and atmospheric
phenomena, has been prepared by the Hon. Rollo Russell and Pro
fessor Archibald, the two Fellows of the Royal Meteorological Society
 who have been mentioned as having been added to the Committee,
and is ready, with the exception of a little revision, and it remains
only to prepare an introduction, index, &c. The whole report may
therefore be regarded as all but complete in manuscript, and it will
 be for the new Council to deal with it.
   The Circumpolar Committee have now brought their labours to
 a close, the report on the observations       taken by Captain Dawson

378                        Anniversary    Meeting.               [Nov. 30,
at  Fart Rae being printed and published.             The reports of the
expeditions   undertaken    by  Austria,  Germany,   and the United States
of America, are,   I  believe, complete, and those by France, Holland,
and  Russia  are in  a forward state. Before the accounts of the obser
vations taken at different stations by the observers of different
nations shall have been for some time before the public, it would be
premature to expect general conclusions to be deduced from this
great undertaking.
   Very satisfactory progress has been made during the past year
with the publication of the Report of the "Challenger" Expedition.
The volumes already published and in the Society's Library now
amount to sixteen on Zoology, and three introductory on other sub
jects.  Others are in a very forward state, and it is expected that
the   whole will be published very nearly within the time mentioned
by the Committee, probably by the end of the next financial year.
   As mentioned in the Presidential Address last year, advantage has
been taken of the British occupation of Egypt to make some explora
tions by way of boring in the Delta of the Nile, to the results of
which geologists attach great importance. The War Department has
allowed some of the staff of the Royal Engineers, when their services
were not otherwise required, to take part in the operations, and has
lent the boring apparatus, and the Royal Society voted the sum of
350Z. out of its own Donation Fund to defray the cost of Jabour and
other incidental expenses. It was contemplated originally to make
a chain of borings, but the depth to which it has been found necessary
to proceed in order to get through the ordinary deposit has turned
out to be so great that it was thought better, instead of attempting
many, to try and get if possible down to rock, or to something ehe
which might afford evidence that what could be referred to alluvium
from the Nile or drifted sand had really been got jhrough. A deep
boring has accordingly been made at Zagazig, under the direction of
 Captain Dickenson, R.E. This has now been carried to a depth of
 190 feet 6 inches below the surface, or 164 feet 5 inches below the
mean sea-level at Alexandria, and yet nothing has been reached but
sand and clay with small pebbles.        Professor Judd is now engaged in
the examination     of  the  matter  brought up. A derangement of the
boring apparatus prevented for the present further progress, and the
use of a narrower pipe than any at hand would be required for
carrying the boring deeper. The Committee considered that it would
be more important to extend this boring, so as if possible to get down
to rock, or else to some deposit with fossils, than to make a fresh boring
in a different place, and arrangements are being made accordingly.
 The inquiry was deemed a proper one to be assisted out of the Govern
ment Grant, and the sum of 200Z. has been voted from this source to
 supplement the Royal Society's grant already mentioned.

1886.]                      President's Address'.                      379
   The ordinary meetings of the Society are well known, and are
frequently attended by strangers by permission of the Fellows
present ; and the papers brought before us are known to the world
through our publications. But a great deal of scientific work is done
of which the outside public know nothing. There have been thirteen
meetings of the Council during the year, and the attendance at our
Council meetings is remarkably good. There have been more than
seventy meetings of Committees and Sub-Committees.                There is
further another task on which a great deal of gratuitous and consci
entious labour of the highest kind is bestowed,          I  allude to the
examination of papers with a view to advising the Committee of
Papers as to their publication. The past year has shown no flagging
in scientific activity, in relation to papers brought before us.
   Since the last Anniversary three parts of the ' Philosophical
Transactions,' comprising upwards of 1160 pages of letterpress and
95 plates, and eight numbers of the ' Proceedings,' containing 1299
pages, have been published.
   The preparation of the manuscript for another decade, 1874 to 1883,
of the Royal Society's catalogue of scientific papers, is now almost
complete.    This great work has been extremely useful to men of
science in enabling them at once to find where a memoir on a par
ticular subject, written by an author whose name they know, as is
usually the case, is to be found. To some extent it enables them also
to find what has been written on a particular subject, for there are
usually one or two authors, whose names they know, who have made
it a special study, and on consulting their papers references are
frequently found to the writings of others who have written on the
same subject.   Nevertheless it must be confessed that the value of the
catalogue would be greatly increased if it could be accompanied by a
key, of the nature of an index rerum.      It was originally contemplated
that this should be added, but the magnitude of the undertaking has
hitherto prevented the Committee from attempting it. To be well
done it would require the long-continued labour of a scientific staff
representing different branches of science, and they could not be ex
pected to engage in so heavy a work without adequate remuneration.
   A great deal of work has been done during the past year in relation
to the Library.      More than 5,000 volumes have been removed to
other rooms to make space for the more important works constantly
accruing. A list of duplicates and deficiencies has been printed, and
circulated among corresponding Societies.         A shelf-catalogue is in
progress, and is about a third of the way towards completion.        Some
work has also been done upon a catalogue of miscellaneous literature.
   The electric lighting of the Society's apartments, which is now
complete, seems to have given general satisfaction.
   On the 31st of August this year, our distinguished Foreign Member,

380                      Anniversary   Meeting.               [Nov. 30,
M. Chevreul, attained his hundredth year. Rarely indeed is it given
to anyone to see right through a century, more rarely still to retain
his powers to such an age, yet both, I am happy to say, have been
granted to M. Chevreul.      In anticipation of this event, preparations
were made for its due celebration. 1 received an invitation for oar
Fellows to assist at the celebration ; but unfortunately it was at a
time of year when most of us were scattered, and moreover time did
not permit of making it generally known. I am afraid we had no
representative at the actual ceremonial, but I am sure that none the
less our hearts were with the veteran savant.
   This year has also witnessed the celebration of the 250th anni
versary of the University of Heidelberg. The Council had appointed
our Foreign Secretary as a deputation to represent the Society on the
occasion.    Unfortunately when the time was close at hand, Dr.
Williamson was prevented by the condition of hie health from taking
part in the celebration ; but acting on the emergency on behalf of
the Society,   I requested our Fellow, Sir Henry Roscoe, to take his
place, which he was so good as to do.
   In his Presidential Address last year Professor Huxley suggested
the idea, I may say expressed the hope, that the Royal Society might
associate itself in some special way with all English-speaking men of
science ; that it might recognise their work in other ways than those
afforded by the rare opportunities of election to our foreign member
ship, or the award of those medals which are open to persons of all
nationalities alike. This suggestion has been taken up in one of onr
Colonies.    We have received a letter from the Royal Society of Vic
toria, referring to this passage in the Address, and expressing a hope
that in some way means might be found for establishing some kind of
connexion between our own oldest scientific Society and those of the
Colonies.
   The Council have appointed a Committee to take this letter into
consideration,   and try if they could devise some suitable plan for
carrying out the object sought.    The Committee endeavoured at first
to frame a scheme which should not be confined to the Colonies and
Dependencies of the British Empire, but should embrace all English-
speaking communities. But closely connected as we are with the
United States by blood and language, they are of course politically a
foreign nation, and this fact threw difficulties in the way of framing
at once a more extended scheme, so that the Committee confined
themselves to the Colonies and Dependencies of our own country,
leaving the wider object for some future endeavour, should the
country concerned seem to desire it. The scheme suggested was laid
before the membors of the present Council, but there was not an
adequate opportunity of discussing it, and it will of course come
before the new Council.     Should they approve of some such measures

 1886.J                    President's Address.                       381
 as those recommended      by the Committee, they will doubtless assure
 themselves    in  some way or oAer that those measures are in accord
ance  with the wishes of the Fellows at large before they are incor
porated into the Statutes.
    But in connexion with this subject there is another suggestion
which   I would venture to offer, and which    I  know has been thought
of by others.
    A good many years ago it was not unusual to elect to the Fellow
ship men of distinguished eminence in departments other than
scientific. More recently a change was made in the Statutes whereby
Privy Councillors are enabled to become Fellows by a special method,
without interfering with the selection by the Council of fifteen from
among the candidates, whom they recommend to the Society for
election.     This to a certain extent superseded the necessity of
appealing    to  other than scientific claims, and in some respects the
method had special advantages.         Those who attained to a place on
Her Majesty's Privy Council were sure to be distinguished men,
 whom we should be glad to welcome among us ; and by confining the
privilege of special election to these, with whose appointment the
 Council had nothing to do, all invidious distinctions were prevented.
 But the method has the disadvantage that it applies only to a
particular class of merit.   A man, for instance, might be of quite first
rate eminence in poetry or literatnre, but that would not lead to a
seat on the Privy Council. Such a man could only be elected by being
 placed on the selected list of fifteen.    But it seems to me that there
 is something not quite courteous either to the eminent man himself,
or to the scientific man who would have to be passed over to make
room for him, in thus putting him in competition with those who seek
admission on purely scientific grounds.      I cannot help thinking that
it might be well if the Council had the power of recommending for
special election men of high distinction on other than scientific
grounds, whose connexion with us would on both sides be felt to be
an honour, and who, though not it may be themselves scientific,
might usefully assist us by their counsel.     I do not think it would be
difficult to devise means for providing that such a privilege should be
accorded only in case of very high eminence.
    The application of photography to the delineation of celestial
objects has of late years made rapid strides ; and, partly owing to the
improved sensitiveness of the plates, partly to greater exactness in
regulating the motions of eqnatorially mounted telescopes, it has been
found possible to photograph even minute stars. The question is
accordingly now seriously entertained whether we may not trust
to photography for the formation of star maps and star catalogues,
taking eye observations on a sufficient number of stars here and there
for reference, and trusting to differential measurements taken on the

                         Anniversary Meeting.                   [Nov. 30,
plates for determining the positions of the other stars. Indeed I think
the practicability of this application may now be considered as esta
blished, and there only remains the question of the best mode of
carrying it out on a uniform plan.       In the course of the autumn I
had a letter from Admiral Mouchez, Director of the Paris Observatory,
in which he informed me that in response to the presentation of
specimens of the admirable star photographs taken by the MM. Henry,
several of the astronomers to whom they had been sent suggested
that it would be well that a conference of astronomers of various
nations should be held, with a view to taking concerted action for
obtaining on a uniform plan a complete map of the whole starry
heavens.    He wished accordingly to obtain an expression of opinion
on the part of the Royal Society as to the desirableness of holding
such a conference   ; and as it was contemplated,  in  case  the proposal
should   be favourably entertained by those consulted,      that the con
ference should be held at Paris   in the spring, and it would be neces
sary to give timely notice to the astronomers who live in the southern
hemisphere, an early reply was requested.
   As it would have defeated Admiral Mouchez's object to wait till
the Council should reassemble after the recess,     I  wrote at once to
consult four of our Fellows specially named by Admiral Mouchez ; and
on receiving their replies I wrote to Admiral Mouchez, saying that
under the circumstances I took it upon me to express in the name of
the Royal Society our approval of the suggestion, explaining at the
same time that I did so on the understanding, which I fully believed
to be in accordance with his intention, that the astronomers who
might attend the conference should not be considered as pledged to
the adoption of the methods or scale of the MM. Henry, but that the
whole subject should be open to discussion.    On reporting what had I
done to the Council when they met after the recess,        I  obtained an
expression of their approval.
   In these photographs a remarkable instance was exhibited of the
power of photography to reveal the existence of objects wholly invi
sible to the eye.   One of the stars of the Pleiades was found to be
surrounded by a nebula which cannot be seen with telescopes. The
reason of the difference of power of the plate and eye is very obvious ;
with the eye an object is either seen or not seen at once, whereas
with the plate, provided there be an absence of stray light, feebleness
of intensity can be made up for by length of exposure.
   But the MM. Henry are by no means the only persons who have
applied photography to the delineation of the stars. Among others
our Fellow, Dr. Gill, who has sent us some excellent specimens of the
photographs obtained by his instrument, proposes to take at the Cape
Observatory photographs of the whole starry heavens of the southern
hemisphere, under such conditions as to include the magnitudes

contained    in Argelander's " Darchmnsterung " of the northern
hemisphere, and to subsequently reduce the observations so as to
complete Argelander's great work by extending it to the southern
hemisphere.      Professor Kapteyn, in Holland, has nobly undertaken
to devote his spare time for seven years to superintending the reduc
tion. Dr. Gill has laid the proposal before the Government Grant
Committee. Having regard to the magnitude of the undertaking,
and the probability of a conference of astronomers being shortly
held in Paris to discuss the whole question, the Government Grant
Committee suggested to the Council of the Royal Society that they
should appoint a committee to take the subject into consideration, and
the Council have acted on this suggestion.       Dr. Gill intends to come
to Europe in the spring, so that the committee will be able to consult
him personally.
    This morning    I  received through the Foreign Office an invitation
from the Academie des Sciences for myself, or some other Delegate of
the Royal Society, to attend the conference to which I have already
referred, which is fixed for the 16th of April.       I shall take the first
 opportunity   of consulting   the new Council as to their wishes.
    The Copley Medal for this year has been awarded to the veteran in
science, our foreign member, Professor Franz Ernst Neumann, for
 his researches in theoretical optics and electro-dynamics.
    Having in his earlier years treated of crystallographic subjects,
 he more than half-a-centnry ago turned his attention to the theory
 of light.   Fresnel had, with his wonderful sagacity, arrived at his
 celebrated laws of double refraction from the theory of transverse
 vibrations, aided by conceptions derived from a dynamical theory
 which was only in part rigorous. Cauchy and Neumann, indepen
 dently of each other, were the first to deduce from a rigorous
 dynamical calculation, applied to a particular hypothesis as to the
 constitution of the ether, laws of double refraction, not indeed
 absolutely identical with those of Fresnel, bnt closely resembling them.
 In this case the laws were known beforehand. But in a very elaborate
 later paper, Professor Neumann deduced from theory the laws of
 crystalline reflection, laws which appear to agree with the observa
 tions of Seebeck, and which had not been discovered by Fresnel,
 though some of them were independently and about simultaneously
 obtained by MacCullagh.
    Professor Neumann is perhaps still better known in connexion with
 the theory of electrodynamics, and the mathematical deduction of the
 laws of induced currents due to the motion of the primary and
 secondary conductor. He may be said to have completed for the
 induction of currents the mathematical treatment which Ampere
 had applied to their mechanical action.

practice  to award one for the mathematical and physical, and the
other for the biological sciences.
   One of these medals has this year been awarded to Professor Peter
Guthrie Tait, for his various mathematical and physical researches.
   Professor Tait is well known for his numerous and important
papers in both pure mathematics and physics.         The late Sir William
Hamilton regarded him as his own successor in carrying on and
completing the newly invented calculus of quaternions, of which
Professor Tait is continually making new applications. Among his
investigations in the domain of experimental physics may be men
tioned his determination of the conducting powers of metals for heat
by a method -which appears to possess special advantages, and his
investigation of the effect of extremely great pressures on ther
mometers, undertaken with a view to deducing correct results for
the temperatures at great depths in the ocean from the observations
made in the
               " Challenger " expedition. This latter
                                                          subject has led
him to investigate the behaviour, as to compressibility and develop
ment of heat, of liquids and solids under enormous pressures, a
subject in which he is still engaged.          Before concluding I must
mention his elaborate papers on systems of knots, recently printed in
the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
   The other Royal Medal has been awarded to our Fellow, Mr. Francis
Galton, for his statistical inquiries into biological phenomena.
   Mr. Galton is well known as an explorer and geographer, and his
mind is singularly fertile in the Revising of ingenious instruments
for various objects. Many years ago he brought before us some
remarkable experiments instituted with a view to test a particular
biological theory, in which rabbits of a pure variety were so con
nected with others of a different variety that the same blood cir
culated through both individuals, and the point to determine was
whether this blood-relationship, in the most literal sense of the term,
had any effect on the offspring.       Contrary to what the theory in
question led us to regard as the more probable, the result proved to bo
negative.   It however, in accordance with the rules for the award
              is,
of the Royal Medals, more especially the later investigations of
Mr. Galton, in relation to vital statistics, that have been taken as the
ground of the award.      He has shown that by taking the average of a
number of individuals having some condition in common, indivi
dual peculiarities apart from that condition are eliminated in the
mean, and results are obtained which may be regarded as typical of
that condition. One way of doing this   is    by his method of compound
photographs.    Thus we may obtain typical features of criminals of a
particular kind, of consumptive persons, and so forth.        By adhering
to the method of averages, he has even succeeded in obtaining a
mathematical expression, very closely verified by observation, con

necting the mean deviation of some condition (such for example          as
stature) in a series of individuals from the general average with the
mean deviations of the same condition in the relatives of those same
individuals of different kinds, such as fathers, brothers, &c. Nor is
the statistical method applicable to bodily characteristics alone. Mr.
Gralton has even extended it with remarkable ingenuity and originality
to mental phenomena also.
     The Rumford Medal has been awarded to Professor Samuel P.
Langley, for his researches on the spectrum by means of the bolo
 meter.
     A better knowledge of the ultra-red region of the spectrum, which
 includes the larger part of the energy of solar radiation, had long
 been a desideratum,     when Professor Langley commenced his work
 upon this subject.    Finding the thermopile insufficiently sensitive for
 his purpose, he contrived the "bolometer." This instrument depends
 upon the effect of temperature upon the electrical resistance of metals,
 a quantity susceptible of very accurate measurement ; and, with its
 aid, Professor Langley has been able to explore a part of the spectrum
 previously almost inaccessible to observation.
     A result of Professor Langley's work, very important from the
 point of view of optical theory and of the ultimate constitution of
 matter, relates to the law of dispersion, or the dependence of refran-
 gibility on wave-length. Cauchy's formula, which corresponds well
 with observation over most of the visible spectrum, is found to break
 down entirely when applied to the extreme ultra-red.
     Professor Langley has given much attention to the important ques
  tion of the influence of the atmosphere on solar radiation. The
  expedition to Mount Whitney, successfully conducted by him in face
 of many difficulties, has given results of the utmost value, pointing to
 conclusions of great interest and novelty.
     The Davy Medal has been awarded to our foreign member, M.
  Jean Charles Galissard de Marignac, for his researches on atomic
  weights.
     M. Marignac's numerous researches on atomic weights, which have
 been continued for a great number of years, have played an exceed
  ingly important part in establishing and consolidating that ground
  work of chemistry. They are remarkable for originality in devising
 methods    appropriate to the respective cases, the most conscientious
 care in discovering errors which occurred in the respective operations,
 and indefatigable perseverance in finding means to eliminate the
 disturbing influences.    His labours are all the more valuable because
 he chose for their field chiefly those elements which are most generally
 used in chemistry, and are most important to chemists, and on which
 the determination of new atomic weights is most generally made to
  depend.

  The operations of The Kew Observatory, in the Old Deer Park,
Richmond, Surrey, are controlled by the Kew Committee, which is
constituted as follows :
                    Mr. Warren de la Rue, Chairman.
  Captain W. de W. Abney, R.E.         The Earl of Rosse.
  Prof. W. G. Adams.                   Mr. R. H. Scott.
  Prof. G. C. Foster.                  Lieut. -General W. J. Smythe.
  Mr. F. Galton.                       Lieut.-Gen. R. Strachey, C.S.I.
   Admiral Sir G. H. Richards,         Lieut-General     J.   T.  Walker,
      K.C.B.                              C.B.
   The Committee regret to announce the death, in December last,
of one of their members, Captain Sir F. Evans, K.C.B., formerly
Hydrograpber.      He had held a seat upon the Committee since 1874,
and was a frequent attendant at their meetings, rendering most
valuable assistance in all questions relating to terrestrial magnetism
or navigation brought forward for consideration.
   The work at the Observatory may be considered under the fol
lowing heads: —
   1st. Magnetic observations.
   2nd. Meteorological observations.
   3rd. Solar observations.
   4th. Experimental, in connexion with any of the          above  depart
          ments.
   5th. Verification of instruments.
   6th. Rating of Watches and Marine Chronometers.
   7th. Miscellaneous.
                        I. Magnetic Obseevations.
   The Magnetographs have been in constant
                                                    operation during the
year, and in accordance with the usual
                                          practice, determinations of the
scale values of all the
                         instruments were made early in January.

                    Report  of the Kew Committee.                   401
   The Vertical Force Balance Magnet was found to have a scale
¦value  of for 1 inch 6V=0'0296, and therefore appeared wanting in
sensitiveness, it was accordingly re-adjusted and brought up to the
proper pitch of delicacy.
   The values of the ordinates of the different photographic curves
determined then were as follows : —
             Declination : 1 inch=0° 22' 04.  1 cm.=0° 8'7.
   Bifilar, January 11, 1886, for  1 inch SH=0'0268 foot grain unit.
                                 „ 1 cm. „ =0-0005 C.G.S. unit.
   Balance,   Jannary 19, 1886 „   1 inch cV=00274 foot grain unit.
                                 „ 1 cm. „ =0-0005 C.G.S. unit.
   The chief days on which notable magnetic disturbance was recorded
were as follows : — January 9, March 30, July 27, and October 7—11.
   The magnetic instruments have been studied, and a knowledge of
their manipulation obtained by Professor L. M. Russell, Mr. E. Kitto,
and Mr. C. Chambers, jun.
   Professors Riicker and Thorpe visited the Observatory in April,
and made several sets of observations with the instruments which
they have employed in their magnetic survey of the British Isles,
prior to their commencing operations on the southern section, which
have occupied them during the past summer.
   At the request of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, a set of
magnetographs on an improved model lias been constructed for the
Committee by Mr. Munro, which, after a lengthened trial in the
Verification House, were forwarded to Falmouth, and erected at the
New Observatory, under the supervision of Mr. T. W. Baker. The
cost has been defrayed by a grant from the Royal Society's Govern
ment Fund.
   At the suggestion of General Sir J. H. Lefroy, the Committee
have caused a plate to be engraved on which sectional lines are laid
down on the scale adopted by the International Polar Conference,
for plotting all magnetic curves on a uniform system. Impressions
from this plate will be kept at the Observatory, and supplied at cost
price to persons desirous of making use of such forms.
   Information on matters relating to terrestrial magnetism and
various data, have been supplied to Professor W. G. Adams, Dr.
Atkinson, General Sir J. H. Lefroy, Professor B. Stewart, M.
Moureau, Captain Schiick, and others.
   The monthly observations with the absolute instruments have been
made as usual, and the results are given in the tables forming
Appendix I of this Report.
   The following is a summary of the number of magnetic observations
made during the year : —

 402                       Report of the Kew     Committee.
         Determinations of Horizontal Intensity                         30
                  „             Inclination                            155
                  „             Absolute Declination                    36
    The dinrnal range of the Declination having become a somewhat
 interesting feature in magnetic reductions, an additional table, giving
 the values for the summer and winter seasons and for the whole year,
 as determined      from selected curves by the graphic method,* has
 been inserted in the Appendix.
                      II.   Meteorological Observations.
    The several self-recording instruments for the continuous registra
 tion respectively of atmospheric pressure, temperature, and humidity,
 wind (direction and velocity), bright sunshine, and rain, have been
 maintained in regular operation throughout the year.
    The only alterations made in the above instruments have been the
following! a screen of blue glass has been interposed in the baro
graph between the barometer tube and the light, with the result of
improving the definition of the photographic curve, and a Stonyhnrst
lifter has been fitted to the Beckley rain-gauge, causing the pencil to
return to its original position after depression more rapidly than
it did previously.
    The standard eye observations for the control of the automatic
records have been duly registered during the year, together with the
daily observations        in connexion with the U.S. Signal Service
synchronous system.          A summary of these observations is given in
Appendix II.
    The tabulation of the meteorological traces has been regularly
carried on, and copies of these, as well as of the eye observations,
with notes of weather, cloud, and sunshine have been transmitted
to the Meteorological Office.
    The terrestrial radiation thermometer (grass minimum) was found
broken on July 11, and replaced by a new instrument on July 21.
    The following is a summary of the number of meteorological obser
vations made during the past year : —

    In   compliance with the usual request made by the Meteorological
 Council to the Committee, Mr. Whipple visited the Observatories at
 Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Stonyhurst, and the anemograph at Swau-
 bister.    He also superintended the erection of new instruments at
 North Shields and Fleetwood.
    Mr. Baker has visited the Valencia and Falmouth Observatories
 for the purpose of inspection.
    With the sanction of the Meteorological Council, weekly abstracts
 of the Meteorological results have been regularly forwarded to, and
                     '             '        '
 published by The Times and                   Tho Torquay Directory.'        Data
 have also been supplied to the Council of the Royal Meteorological
                             '
 Society, the editor of Symons's Monthly Meteorological Magazine,'
 the Secretary of the Institute of Mining Engineers, Messrs. B. Latham,
 Gwilliam, Rowland, and others.            The cost of these abstracts is borne
by the recipients.
   Elect rograph. — Acting upon the recommendation of tho Kew Com
mittee the Meteorological Council have purchased a new quadrant
electrometer, constructed on Mr. de la Rue's principle, with Professor
Clifton's improvements, together with a chloride of silver battery of
60 cells, for the purpose of maintaining the potential of the quadrants
 at a certain point.
   By the kindness of the Chairman of the Committee, experiments
were made at his laboratory in Portland Place by means of which
the scale value of the instrument was determined                   before it was
conveyed      to the    Observatory,      and   erected  in the    place of the
Thomson instrument formerly employed.
   No change has been made in the recording apparatus attached to
it. The instrument has been working for the past month in a satis
factory manner.
   In  accordance      with a request made by the Meteorological Council,
and at their expense, the electrograms for tho two years 1882 and 1883
have been tabulated in absolute values.
                            III. Solar Orservations.
   The sketches of Sun-Rpots, as seen projected on the photohel iograph
screen, have been made on 169 days, in order to continue Schwabe's
enumeration, the results being given in Appendix II, Table IV.
   Transit Observations. —30 1 observations of solar and 76 of sidereal
transits have been taken, for the purpose of keeping correct local time
   VOl. XLl.                                                           2  E

 at the Observatory, and the clocks and chronometers         have also been
 compared daily.      The Observatory Chronometers          Arnold 86 and
 Parkinson and Frodsbam 2408, have been cleaned and re-adjusted,
and the mean-time clocks, Shelton K. O., and Shelton 35, examined
 and re-adjusted by Dent.
    The following clocks, French, Dent 2011, Shelton K. 0., and the
 chronometers, Molyneux No. 2125 and Bregnet No. 3140, are kept
 carefully rated as time-keepers at the Observatory.
    The mean-time clock, Shelton 35, after cleaning, &c., was bolted to
 the wall of the chronometer-room for use in daily comparisons with
 the chronometers on trial.
    In order to facilitate the      inter-comparison of the clocks, the
 chronometer   " Parkinson" has been specially fitted up as a "hack"
 instrument.
    At the request of the Council of the Royal Meteorological Society,
 certain experiments were made with the view of investigating
 Professor W. K. Zenger's solar phenomena and an examination was
 also made of the Kew solar photographs. The results obtained were
 however of a negative character only.           A note of them has been
                    '
 published in the Quarterly Journal Roy. Met. Soc.,' vol. 12, p. 215.
    A comparative trial extending over five months was made of
 Professor McLeod's sunshine recorder (see ' Phys. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 6,
 p. 216), and the Stokes' instrument, which proved the results given
 by the two instruments to be practically identical.
                         IV. Experimental       Work.
    Photo-nephograph. — The report on last year's work in cloud pho
 tography was duly submitted to the Meteorological Council, and
 placed by them in the hands of Professor Stokes for consideration.
    Professor Stokes having investigated the methods employed at the
 Observatory, devised a new graphic process for determining the clond
 heights and motions in a much simpler manner than by the nse of
 mathematical   formula? only. He invented a special apparatus called a
projector, which has been constructed by C. Baker, and is now being
utilized in the reduction of the pictures taken during the past season.
These have amounted to 112 cloud negatives, and were obtained in 15
days.
    For convenience of dealing with the cloud pictures in the
                                                                      projec
tion apparatus with greater facility, the
                                             negatives have all been printed
off on paper prepared by the
                                cyanotype process.
    Certain minor additions were made to the
                                                     cameras, and accessory
apparatus, which have tended to
                                       facilitate their  working, and   their
action   has been  fairly satisfactory ever since.       There is, however,
still an occasional failure
                             due to uncertainty of the duration of the

 time of exposure of the twin cameras, although this is apparently
instantaneous.
    Solar Radiation Thermometers. — The experiments with these ther
 mometers have been continued during the past summer months, and
 at times as many as 8 instruments have been under observation.
    It having appeared that during the winter the vacua in certain of
 the instruments had deteriorated either by leakage or evolution of
gas from the lamp-black coating of the bulbs, experiments were made
in the Chairman's laboratory which proved that such was the case. New
thermometers were made and enclosed in jackets not provided with
platinum electrodes ; the bulbs were also made of black glass, having
the stems covered with black enamel. These, after careful exhaustion,
were placed under observation,         but did not register temperatures
higher than had    been  previously   observed.
   Advantage was taken of an offer kindly made by Professor Thorpe
to make solar radiation observations on his recent Eclipse Expedition
to Grenada, and two of the instruments were lent to him. He has now
returned them to the Observatory, together with copies of the readings
he was able to procure on the occasion.
    Electrical Anemograph. — This instrument, after a lengthened trial
in the Experimental House and the execution of certain minor altera
tions by Mr. Kempe, has been dismounted and forwarded to the
Valencia Observatory by instructions of the Meteorological Council.
The external parts were previously put into thorough repair by
Mr. Munro, in order to fit the anemograph for the rough weather to
which it will be exposed when erected on a hill almost overlooking the
Atlantic.
    Din.es' Anemometer. — Trials have been made of two anemometers
constructed on a new principle by Mr. W. H. Dines, B.A.              Owing,
however, to structural defects, both instruments broke down before
any final results were obtained, and were returned to the maker for
repair.
    Glycerine  Barometer. — This instrument, having very considerably
deteriorated   by age, was dismounted by Mr. Jordan in June, and after
thorough cleaning and repair by Mr. J. Steward, was again erected
and refilled with new fluid.
   Pendulum Experiments. — At the request of General Walker, certain
experiments were made with the view of ascertaining the stability of
the Experimental House as a site for pendulum operations.             These
having proved that building       unsuitable,  a wooden  erection 13 ft. X
9 ft. X 8 ft. has been constructed,        at the desire of the Pendulum
Committee of the Royal Society, in the lower South Hall of the
Observatory, on the spot occupied in 1873 by Captain Heaviside, when
experimenting with the Russian pendulum.          (See Report for 1873.)
   In this room it is the intention to erect the Indian Pendulum Appa
                                                               2 E 2

  recent swings in New York.         Subsequently, it is intended to convey
  the whole to the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, where other series
  of observations and experiments will be conducted with a view to
  connecting Greenwich with Kew.
     At the request of the Meteorological Council, various experiments
  were tried with the view of selecting a suitable paper for use with the
  Beckley anemographs, and also of remedying certain defects found
  attendant on the employment of gelatinised photographic curves in
 processes of mechanical reduction in the Meteorological Office.
                       V. Vebification of Instruments.
    The following    magnetic    instruments have been verified, and their
 constants determined : —
         1  Unifilar Magnetometer and an Inclinometer for the Falmouth
            Observatory.
    Two Inclinometers have been purchased on commission for the
 Bureau of Navigation, Washington, 1 each also for the Ekaterinburg
 Observatory and the Lighthouse Board, Helsingfors.           2 Dip Needles
have been procured and tested for the Mauritius Observatory ; also
1 pair for the Lisbon Observatory ; 7 Thomson's patent compasses
with 7 vertical force instruments have also been examined for the
Imperial Japanese Navy.
   1 Unifilar, 2 Compasses, and 2 Inclinometers        have been tested for
opticians, and 2 Unifilars are at present undergoing verification.
   The total number of other instruments compared in the past year
was as follows : —

    Besides   these, 32 Deep-sea Thermometers have been tested, 16 of
 which    were   subjected, in the hydraulic press, without injury, to
 pressures exceeding two tons on the square inch. 27 Thermometers
 have been compared at the freezing-point of mercury, making a total
 of 11549 for the year.
    Duplicate copies of corrections have been supplied in 84 cases.
    The number of instruments rejected on account of excessive
 error, or which from other causes did not record with sufficient
 accuracy, was as follows : —
         Thermometers, clinical                                     67
                  „        ordinary meteorological                  49

   7  Standard Thermometers have also been calibrated, and supplied
to  societies and individuals during the year.
   1   Redier Barograph, 1 Richard Hygrometer, 1 Air Meter, 2 Tele
scopes, Ac., were also examined.
   There are at present in the Observatory undergoing verification,
43 Barometers, 904 Thermometers, 2 Hydrometers, and 27 Sextants.
   A question having arisen as to the true interpretation of the tables
of Specific Gravity used in connexion with the verification of instru
ments of the hydrometer class, a Sub-Committee has been appointed
to consider the matter and authorize the adoption by the Observatory
of certain definite rules.
                           VI.  Rating of Watches.
   The    arrangements for rating watches mentioned            in previous
Reports    have  been  continued   during the year with  great  success, and
up to the present 834 watches have been examined, of which 16 were
submitted by the owners, and 818 by the manufacturers or dealers.
   490 watches were received as contrasted with 302 received during
the corresponding period of last year.       They were entered for testing
in the following classes :   —
   For class A, 436 ; class B, 36 ; and class C, 18. Of these 148
failed to gain any certificate ; 16 passed in C, 102 in B, 224 in A, and
8  obtained the highest possible form of certificate, the class  A especially
<jood.

 408                     Report  of  the Kexo Committee.
    All  the watches which obtained          Class A certificates had marks
 assigned    to  them,   indicating   the degree of relative efficiency they
 exhibited dnring their trial, according to the following scale : —
    The number of marks awarded to a watch that only just succeeds
 in obtaining an A certificate is 0, while that awarded to an absolutely
perfect watch would be 100, made up as follows : —40 for a complete
 absence of variation of daily rate, 40 for absolute freedom from
 change of rate with change of position, and 20 for perfect compen
 sation for effects of temperatnre.
    In Appendix      III  will be found a statement giving the results of
 trial of the 20 watches which obtained the highest numbers of marks
 during the year, the first position being again attained — with
 86'7 marks — by the maker who occupied it— with 86'1 marks — last
year.
    The number of watches obtaining a high figure in the marks list
has, however, much increased.
    The following table will indicate the nature of the trials to which
ordinary certificates refer : —
                                                   For certificate of Class
      Position of watch during test.

    Owing to the inconvenience and delay attendant on the employ
ment of one safe for both hot and cold tests, a second was procured,
and has been fitted up as a refrigerator, thereby enabling two sets
of watch trials to proceed simultaneously, and more constant tem-
peratnres in both heat and cold to be sustained for the necessary
periods.
    Special attention has been given to the examination of pocket
chronographs, in accordance with the request of the Cyclists' Union.
    Manufacturers have also been advised of certain mechanical defect*
in the action of the chronograph work, and latterly an improvement
has taken place in respect of this.
    Early in the year a communication was received from the President

                      Report   of  the Kew Committee.                   409
 of the Section d'Horlogerie de la Societo des Arts a Geneve, asking
 for full particulars of the system of rating at this Observatory.
 These were forwarded to him, and in acknowledging receipt of ihe
 same he expressed the gratification of his Council at the degree of
 accuracy obtained in the Kew trials during the year.
   Bating of Chronometers. — Application having been made to the
 Committee to extend their system of watch rating to marine chrono
meters,    arrangements were carried out for effecting this. A chrono
meter oven formerly constructed for the Testing Office of the Board
of Trade, being unemployed, was obtained on loan from the Meteoro
logical Council, in whose possession it was, and erected with the
necessary gas-fittings in the Thermograph-room of the Observatory.
   A scheme for rating and certifying was drawn up, of which the
following is a brief abstract.
   The trial occupies 35 days, divided into 5 periods of 6 days each,
and 5 intermediate days, namely, 1 day at the commencement of each
period of test : —

between (a) the average daily rate dnring that period, and (6) the
several daily rates, does not exceed one second in any one of the
stages.
   2.  The mean daily rate has not been affected by change of tem
perature more than one-sixth of a second per 1° F., which is about
a quarter of a second per 1° C.
   3. The mean daily rate has not exceeded five seconds in any stage
of the test.
   The trials were commenced in August, and up to present date
seventeen ordinary marine and one sidereal chronometer have been
rated.
    The Astronomer       Royal     having on enquiry   certified as to   the
excellent working of Kullberg's temperature regulator in the chrono
meter oven at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the inventor has
been instructed to fit a similar one to the Kew testing case.
    A  Richard Thermograph has also been procured, and is arranged
to work in the case with the chronometers, so as to afford a continuous

410                  Report of   the Kexc Committee.
record of the temperatures    which they have experienced    during the
whole of their trial.
   The range of temperature from 55° to 85° F., to which the marine
chronometers are submitted, has been decided upon after careful
consideration, as being amply snfficient for determining the behaviour
of chronometers under conditions to which they are usually exposed
at sea, and no objections have yet been received from makers or
others to the adoption of the above range.
                           VII.   MlSCEELANKOUS.
   Photographic Paper, 8fc. — This has been supplied to the Observa
tories at Batavia, Coimbra, Falmouth, Glasgow, Lisbon, Mauritius,
Oxford, Stonyhurst, St. Petersburg, and Toronto, and to the Meteoro
logical Office.    Blank forms have also been snpplied to various
Observatories   and individuals.
   At the request of Senhor Capello, of the Lisbon Observatory,
an astronomical clock was procnred and shipped to the Loanda
Observatory,   for use during the recent solar eclipse.
   Two barograph tabulators, photographic appliances, and various
other instruments have been procured, verified, and forwarded to the
Observatories at Hong Kong and Mauritius.
   The Observatory has been presented by the Rev. John Rigaud, B.D.,
Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, with a bust of his father,
Stephen Peter Rigand, Esq., M.A., F.R.S., Savilian Professor of
Astronomy and Radcliffe Observer, who formerly assisted his uncle,
the Rev. S. Demainbray, in carrying on the Observatory.
   Exhibitions, Sfc. — At the request of the Council of the Royal
Meteorological Society a number of old instruments were exhibited
at the Exhibition held by the Society in the rooms of the Institution
of Civil Engineers in March, and devoted this year to barometers.
   Four sets of photographs illustrative cf the varions processes in
use at different periods at the Observatory have been contributed
to the Photographic Exhibition, held in the Corporation Galleries
of Art at Glasgow.
   Library. — In July the Superintendent received a letter from the
Secretary of the Royal Society offering a number of duplicate volumes
about to be removed from the Library at Burlington House, and
forwarding a catalogue.
   A selection was made of those suitable for the Observatory Library,
and sixteen volumes were accordingly sent down to Kew.
   Presents of publications were received during the year from —
   34 Scientific Societies and Institutions of Great Britain and Ire
        land, and
   92 Foreign and Colonial Scientific        Establishments, as well as
        numerous private individuals.

    Magnetic Reductions. — At the request of Professor Balfour Stewart,
 the  Superintendent prepared and submitted to the Committee of the
British Association on the Reduction of Magnetic Observations, a
report on the comparison between Wild's, Sabine's, and the Green
wich methods of determining the solar diurnal range of the decli
nation.
    Workshop. — The machine tools procured for the use of the Kew
Observatory by grants from the Government Grant Fund or the
Donation Fund have been kept in thorough order.
   House, Grounds, and Footpath. — These have all been kept in order
daring the year.
   Her Majesty's Commissioners of Woods and Forests have kindly
complied with the request of the President and Council of the Royal
Society that the Observatory Staff should have a free passage at
all hours through the yard tenanted by the lessee of the Old Deer
Park, and accordingly an iron turnstile has been erected at the expense
of the Committee at the entrance gate to the Park.
   The necessary external repairs and painting of the building have
been carried out by Her Majesty's Commissioners of Works as usual.
    Owing to the increase of work now undertaken by the Observatory
Staff it has become necessary to consider means of increasing the
available accommodation, and of providing more space by addition
either to the Observatory building itself or to one of the out
buildings.
    Plans for hoth schemes have been submitted to the Committee,
together with estimates of the approximate cost.
                         Personal Establishment.
   The staff employed is   as follows : —
           G. M. Whipple,    B.Sc, Superintendent.
           T. W. Baker, Chief Assistant and Magnetic Observer.

412 Report of tlve Kew Committee.
                       Report  of the Kew   Committee.                  413
                              APPENDIX I.
Magnetic    Observations made at the Kew Observatory, Lat. 51° 28' 6" N.
     Long. 0" lm 15s 1 W., for the year October 1885 to September 1886.
    The observations of Deflection and Vibration given in the annexed
Tables were all made with the Collimator Magnet marked K C 1, and
the   Kew 9-inch Unifilar Magnetometer by Jones.
    The Declination observations have also been made with the same
Magnetometer, Collimator Magnets 101 B and N E being employed for
the purpose.
    The Dip observations were made with Dip-circle Barrow No. 33, the
needles 1 and 2 only being used ; these are 3i inches in length.
    The results of the observations of Deflection and Vibration give the
valnes of the Horizontal Force, which, being combined with the Dip
observations, furnish the Vertical and Total Forces.
    These are expressed in both English and metrical scales — the unit in
the first being one foot, one second of mean solar time, and one grain ;
and in the other one millimetre, one second of time, and one milligramme,
the factor for reducing the English to metric values being 0-46108.
    By request, the corresponding values in C.G.S. measure are also given.
    The value of log jrsK employed in the reduction is P643G5 at tem
perature 60" F.
    The induction-coefficient fi is 0-000194.
    The correction of the magnetic power for temperature           t0 to an
adopted standard temperature of 35° F. is
                0-0001194(^-35) -r0-00O.000^lS^-SS)'.
    The true distances between the centres of the deflecting and deflected
magnets, when the former is placed at the divisions of the deflection-
bar marked P0 foot and 13 feet, are 1-000075 feet and 1-300097 feet
respectively.
    The times of vibration given in the Table are each derived from the
mean of 12 or 14 observations of the time occupied by the magnet in
making 100 vibrations, corrections being applied for the torsion-force
of the suspension-thread subsequently.
    No corrections have been made for rate of chronometer         or arc of
vibration, these being always very small.
    The value of the constant P, employed in the formula of reduction
    In each observation of absolute Declination the instrumental read
ings have been referred to marks made upon the stone obelisk erected
 1,250 feet north of the Observatory as a meridian mark, the orientation
 of  which, with respect to the Magnetometer, was determined by the
 late Mr. Welsh, and has since been carefully verified.
    The observations have been made and reduced by Mr. T. W. Baker.

               The Minute Anatomy     of  the  Brachial Plexus.         423
  "The     Minute Anatomy of the Brachial Plexus." By W. P.
        Herringham, M.B., M.R.C.P.            Communicated by W. S.
        Savory, F.R.S.        Received March 8, — Read March 25,
        1886.
     It has for some time appeared probable that the spinal nerves which
 form the brachial plexus do not become confounded one with another,
 but retain each its separate course and its separate functions.
    To the naked eye a nerve is a bundle of parallel threads         bound
together, and at the same time divided by a sheath of connective
 tissue.    It seemed to me possible that the course of the spinal nerve
 roots could be traced by a dissection which should follow each through
the plexus to the nerves which branch therefrom, and in these to its
 final destination.
    My dissections were partly upon foetuses or stillborn children, partly
 upon the adult.      The plexus of an infant is in some respects better,
in some worse than that of an adult for an investigation of this kind.
On the one hand its minuteness         needs the confirmation of larger
tissues, but on the other hand the fibrous sheath     uniting the nerves is
very much weaker and less perfect, so that as in the case of the
pectorals, the serratus magnus, and coraco-brachialis muscles, arrange
ments which in the adult need great care in dissection, can be seen in
the infant without nsing the knife at all.
    Adult bodies are best fitted for tracing fibres down a long nerve.
    The present paper is based upon the dissection of fifty- five plexuses,
thirty-two being foetal or infantile, and twenty-three adult.
    The 5th cervical nerve as it lies between the scaleni gives off a
branch which divides into the nerve to the rhomboids, and the upper
root of the posterior thoracic.    The latter is joined by the root from
the 6th, and lower down by one or sometimes two branches from
the 7th.
    In the adult the 5th and 6th usually join before the first digitations
of the serratus magnus are reached, and receive the 7th about the
level of the first rib.   It can generally, even in adults, be seen that
the 7th joins the nerve below the twig given to the first part of the
muscle formed by the two upper digitations, and it is often easy to
separate the 5th from the 6th, and this from the 7th, so far as to show
that the first part of the muscle is supplied wholly by the 5th, and the
second by the 6th alone, or by the 5th and 6th, while the 7th does not
give twigs until the third part is reached.      I have several times been
able to show this to students in the dissecting room.           But in the
foetus there is no dissection necessary.      The branch to the first part
 is given off before the 5th reaches the 6th, and the 7th does not enter

the nerve   until it has descended to the third or lowest part of the
muscle.    The connective tissue which in the adult hinds all the nerve
together   has  not in the foetus yet grown up, and the system of the
nerve is naturally exposed.          The supply of each nerve is variable.          If
the 5th root is large it will send on fibres to supply with the 6th the
middle of the muscle.          If it is small it spends itself entirely on the
upper part,    but  however the different roots may vary in size              I  have
never in the numerous dissections           I  have made seen them alter their
relative positions.
   Two typical examples from adults may be quoted.                    In one, the 5th
gave twigs to the first three digitations, and then a small fibre to the
6th.    There was no root from the 7th. In the other, the 5th supplied
the first two, the 6th alone supplied the next two, and the 6th and 7th
the remaining digitations.           In these there was no splitting of the
nerve necessary.       The drawings shown were made from them.

                1, 2, 3 = First, second, and  third parts of serratus maguiu.
    As the 5th leaves the scaleni it receives a communicating branch
 from the 4th, which therefore does not enter the rhomboid branch, or
 the posterior thoracic.         The communicating branch varies consider
ably in size. I have at times been scarcely able to recognise the twig,
at others it is a sixteenth of an inch thick.             In the remainder of the
 paper this branch is not separated from the 5th.
    Soon after this the 5th root joins with the 6th. It is usually at
 their junction that the suprascapular nerve is given off, but it is not

uncommon to find it springing from the 5th before the junction is
made.      When this is the case it contains no fibres from the 6th, but
when given off at the junction it usually, though not always, receives
a minute fibre from the 6th which passes either behind or through
the fibres of the 5th to reach the suprascapular. The 6th therefore
exercises sometimes an extremely small influence, and sometimes none
at all over the supra- and infra-spinatus.
    The united 5th and 6th then divide into an anterior and a posterior
branch.*
    The anterior joins with an anterior branch of the 7th to form the
outer cord. Just before their junction the united 5th and 6th gives
off one, and the 7th two branches for the pectorals. The upper branch
 from the 7th joins with that from the 5th and 6th to form the external
 anterior thoracic, which, piercing the costo-coracoid membrane, supplies
 the clavicular and the upper piece of the sternal part of the muscle
 as far down as the fibres which arise from the 2nd costal cartilage.
 The lower 7th branch forms that which is usually called the communi
 cating branch of the external anterior thoracic. It has, however, a
 separate origin from the 7th trunk, and contains no fibre of the 5th or

  6th.   It  runs under the costo-coracoid              membrane       over the axillary
  artery, and at the upper border of the pectoralis minor divides into
  two, of which one branch passes in front, running with the branches

 of the acromial thoracic artery, to supply the pectoralis major ; the
 other goes behind the pectoralis minor, sends two twigs through it
  which supply it aud the next parts of the pectoralis major, and close
 to the lower border of the muscle joins with the internal anterior
 thoracic which appears from under the artery.                  The united nerve now
 supplies the lowest part of the pectoralis minor, and turning round
 its edge serves the lowest fibres of the pectoralis major.
     This arrangement was constant in eight consecutive adult cases that
 I  dissected.    I  was, however, able in one of the foetal dissections to
 see more than this.          The branch from the 5th and 6th, before joining
 the branch from the 7th, gave a twig which ran to the clavicular
 portion and which alone supplied that part. The union of the 5th,
 6th, and 7th supplied the upper part of the sternal muscle.                    The 7th
 served the middle as in the- adult, but the internal anterior thoracic
 before receiving the 7th gave off a twig which supplied the lowest
 fibres of the pectoralis major, its union with the 7th serving the fibre
next in order above these.
     Of the nerves interested in the anterior thoracics the 7th always
 contributes.       Of thirteen dissections the 5th and 6th both gave
 branches to the external in five, the 6th alone in eight cases.                  Of ten
 dissections   the  8th   and   9th  both   gave  branches    to the  internal  in eight
 cases, the 8th alone in two.           It appears, therefore, that the pectoralis
 major does not usually receive from the 5th, and does usually receive
from the 9th.»
     Below these branches the 7th joins the 5th and 6th, thus forming
 the outer cord, which bifurcates into the musculo-cutaneous and the
onter head of the median.             I have seen three cases where the musculo
 cutaneous when about to pass under the biceps to the outer side of
 the arm gave back a large bundle to the median.                   Two of these cases
 were   adult,  and    in  them    the  returned    bundle    consisted   in one wholly
 of the 6th root, in the other of fibres from both 6th and 7th.
     The musculo-cutaneous is usually described as supplying the coraco-
 brachialis.     In the adult the nerve to this muscle is given off before
the musculo-cutaneous enters it. If traced up it is seen to come from
the outer cord before the musculo-cutaneous                 leaves it, and ultimately
from the 7th root in the outer cord.               It passes under the cord to get
to the muscle.
     Here again the system is very much clearer in the foetus, for in the
festal plexus the coraco-brachial nerve can be seen running from the
 7th before it joins the 5th and 6th, and passing under the 5th and
    • The first dorsal  I  have here called, and shall henceforth call, the 9th spinal
root, the 2nd  and  3rd  dorsal the 10th and 11th respectively. The 9th receives at its
origin a small branch from the 10th in the majority of cases. It is too small to
dissect in the foetus, and the conditions of a dissecting room do not allow of its
dissection in the adult.    I  have therefore included it in the 9th root.

   Gth  to reach the muscle.    It is therefore quite distinct not only from
   the musculo-cutaneous, but from the 5th and 6th also.           I have found
   this arrangement constant in the foetus in more than twelve consecu
  tive cases, in fact ever since  I first recognised it.    I have also seen it
  in the adult.
                             I
     In one case, however, found the muscle supplied not only by this
  nerve from the 7th, but also by a fibre from the 6th in the musculo
  cutaneous.
     The rest of the musculo-cutaneous, or as should be said, the musculo
  cutaneous nerve proper, hardly ever contains any fibres other than
  those of the 5th and 6th.     In thirty-nine cases, twenty-one foetal and
  eighteen adult, the 7th only contributed to the musculo-cutaneous
  four times, twice in the foetus, and twice in the adult. Of these four
  exceptions, in two the 7th could not be traced down the nerve, in a
  third it ran to the short head of the biceps, and in the fourth, an
  adult case, it entered the cutaneous branch only.
     Twenty-eight cases were examined to see if both 5th and 6th
  entered the nerve.     In twenty-seven this was found to be the fact, in
  one, only the 5th was traced into it.
     In eight cases the 5th and 6th were traced down the nerve. Four
 of these were foetal, and four were adult.         The biceps was found to
 be served by both 5th and 6th in seven instances, in one the 5th alone
  was traced to the muscle.       The brachialis anticus was supplied by
 both the 5th and 6th in four cases, and by the 5th alone in four.
 The cutaneous branch was found to contain fibres from both roots in
 six cases ; in one it was formed by the 6th and 7th. The bundle
 from the 5th was noted as very small in two cases, and in two more
 was found to supply the skin over the outer condyle and the head of
 the radius, the nerve in the forearm being wholly derived from the
 6th root. In another case it ran down the forearm over the flexor
 carpi radial is in front of the branches from the 6th.
     The remaining nerve given from the outer cord is the outer head of
 the median. Into this the 5th does not enter. Thirty-one dissections
 showed no exception to this rule. The supply of the 5th by its
 anterior branch ends therefore with the musculo-cutaneous nerve.
     The median is formed by two heads ; into the outer the 6th and
 7th always enter, while the inner is formed always by branches of the
 8th and 9th, sometimes with the addition of some bundles of the 7th.
 This variety depends upon whether the anterior branch of the 7th
bifurcates or goes wholly to the outer cord.         In order to see whether
both 8th and 9th contribute to the median, twenty-eight dissections
were made, fourteen in infants, fourteen in adults.             In one foetus,
and in one adult, no branch from the 9th was found.                  These two
were, however, the only exceptions to          the rule  that  both  roots send
fibres to the nerve.     The median then is made of the 6th, 7th, 8th,

428                      Mr. W. P. Herringham.
and 9th.     But these roots do not send to it a constant proportion.
There is little variation in the size of the 6th handle, the 7th varies
considerably, the 8th is sometimes equal to, sometimes smaller than,
and sometimes larger than the 9th.
   The 6th bundle runs down the outer side of the nerve from the top
to the bottom, though in dissection the nerve generally becomes so
twisfed that it seems otherwise.     In the lower third of the arm a pair
of fibres are seen crossing from the outer to the inner side.        These
are the nerves to the pronator teres and the flexor carpi radialis.
They are given off almost always by the 6th, and they usually run
over in front of the nerve to reach the muscles.
    I have, however, dissected them running through the nerve and
separating the other bundles.       The nerve to the pronator usually
divides into two before it reaches the muscle, and is sometimes doable
from the beginning. With the nerve to the flexor carpi radialis runs
a nerve to the other flexors, but this comes from a lower root.          In
eight cases where the 6th and 7th were not separated, these two
muscles were supplied by the combined bundle.           The nerve to the
pronator teres was traced seventeen times to the 6th, once to the 7th ;
that to the flexor carpi radialis thirteen times to the 6th, twice to the
7th ; neither to any other nerve.      The 6th does not supply any other
muscles in the forearm.
    The 7th was traced nine times to the flexor sublimis, and in four
of these it also contributed to the anterior interosseous.      It is to be
noted that in two of these four it also formed part of the ulnar.        Of
the five cases when it did not go to the anterior interosseous the ulnar
was traced in four, and did not in any of these receive from the 7th.
Where then the 7th goes to the anterior interosseous it is probable
that it will form also part of the ulnar ; when it is excluded from the
ulnar it probably docs not contribute to the anterior interosseous.      In
seven cases no branch could be traced to the flexor sublimis.
    The 8th and 9th usually supply the flexor sublimis, and always the
deep flexors.      In seventeen instances the flexor sublimis received
from them fourteen times, and three times did not receive from them.
The two nerves were separated six times in adults, with the result
that they seemed to mingle in all muscular branches in the forearm, and
 that no muscle could be said to belong to the one and not to the other.
    After the forearm muscles have been supplied, the remainder of
 the median which comes from under the flexor sublimis always con
 tains fibres from the 6th, 7th, and 8th roots, and sometimes a bundle
 from the 9th.
    The 6th was traced separately eleven times, and the 7th seven
 times in this part of the nerve. Neither was ever found absent.       The
 distribution of the lower two roots in the hand was traced in eleven
 cases.    In six of these they were not separated ; in the other five the

                The Minute Anatomy          of  the Brachial Plexus.                421)
9th ran to the hand in two only ; in three of these, and in one other
case, it was seen to end in the muscles of the forearm.                  Of these six
cases two were foetal, the rest adult. The 8th always ran to the hand.
As a rule then the median in the hand contains only fibres from the
6th, 7th, and 8th.
    The palmar ctttaneous branch was five times noted, twice coming
from the 6th, three times from the 7th.
    The branch to the superficial muscles of the thumb was eleven
times dissected.         In eight cases it came from the 6th, in three from
 the undivided 6th and 7th, never from the 8th or 9th.
    The five digital branches* were more variously distributed. The
first branch was traced fourteen times, nine times to the 6th, and five
times to the united 6th and 7th.
    The second was traced fourteen times, six times to the 6th, five
times to a united 6th and 7th, twice to both 6th and 7th, and once to
the 7th alone. The third was traced eleven times, twice to the 6th,
five times to a united 6th and 7th, once to both 6th and 7th, and
thrice to the 7th.            The fourth was traced eleven times, once to a
united 6th and 7th, three times to the 7th, twice to the 8th, once to a
united 8th and 9th, and in four the radial side of the cleft was
supplied by the 7th or the united 6th and 7th, and the ulnar side by
the lower nerves.          The 5th was traced eleven times ; in one the 7th
served the radial side of the cleft, the other side being supplied by
the united 8th and 9th, in three the 8th alone, in five the undivided
8th and 9th, in one both 8th and 9th (the latter taking the ulnar
half), and in one the 9th alone supplied it.
    These figures are confusing to read, but the table shows that the
first branch is always supplied by the highest nerve, the last always
from one of the lowest, and that in no case is there a break in the
order of supply from the one to the other.

   The origin of the ulnar nerve was traced in thirty-two cases, of
which fourteen were adult.
   It was found to arise in four different ways. Its most common
origin    from the 8th and 9th together.
                is                             This occurred in twenty-
three cases, eleven foetal and twelve adult.     With these sometimes                        is
combined a strand from the 7th, as shown in five cases, four foetal
and one adult. In three foetal cases       arose from the 8th only, and
                                                          it
in one foetal, and one adult case from the 7th and 8th. The 7th                                                    is
only added to the nerve in some of those cases where      gives branch              it             a
to the inner cord.     In several cases the branch from the 8th was
much larger than that from the 9th.       have never seen the reverse.
                                                         I
   The nerve was split down in seven instances, of which two were
foetal.   One of these had fibres of the 7th in    which, however, were  it
not traced separately.    Branches  were traced to the muscles of the
forearm from both nerves in five cases, in two from the 8th alone.
The anterior cutaneous branches were in four cases from the 9th, in
one apparently from the 8th.      The dorsal cutaneous was in all seven
a  branch of the 8th.     The superficial division in the hand going to
the fingers was traced in all, and in three contained fibres from both
8th and 9th, in the other four was wholly from the 9th, while the
deep or muscular branch traced in six was in five wholly from the
8th, and in the sixth received also from the 9th.
   According then to these dissections the 8th and 9th usually both
supply the forearm muscles, the 8th gives the dorsal cutaneous, and
serves the intrinsic muscles of the hand, while the 9th gives sensation
to the skin on the palmar surface of the hand, and of the lower third
of the forearm.
    The origin of the internal cutaneous was noted twenty-three times
in my dissections.     Nine times      contained a fibre from the 8th as
                                                    it
well as the 9th, fourteen times     sprang from the 9th alone.
                                                it                In two
cases of the former class the 8th was separated from the 9th in the
nerve.   In the one the 9th alone supplied the skin of the arm, the
8th not entering the skin until below in the other the 9th was seen
                                                               ;
to supply the skin of the arm and of the front of the forearm, while
 the 8th ran to the back of the forearm.

               The Minute Anatomy       of  the Brachial Plexus.           431
     The lesser internal cutaneous is derived in all but very rare excep
tions from the 9th alone. In twenty cases it only once received from
the 8th also.
     The posterior branches of the nerve roots unite to form the posterior
cord. Each of the four upper roots contributes to the cord, but the
9th rarely joins it.      Out of forty-five cases where the point is noted,
a   fibre from  the 9th  occurs  only six times, three times in foetal, three
in adult cases. In one of these there was an unusually large root
from the 10th nerve. In many adults the branch to the posterior cord
can be seen to leave the 8th root before this is joined by the 9th. It
may be taken then, as a rule, that the 9th does not contribute to
the posterior cord.      In the six exceptions the fibre from the 9th was
invariably very small, and ran with the 8th, from which it was not
isolated.
     The branches of the posterior cord are the three subscapulars, the
circumflex, and the musculo-spiral.
     The first subscapular, which serves the subscapularis muscle, is
 often double, sometimes triple. It never receives from the 7th or 8th
 root, and is often wholly or partly given off from the 5th and Gth
 before they are joined by the 7th.        Dissection shows that even when
 given off after the junction the 7th has still no share in it.           This
 rule was invariable in forty-one cases.         In twenty-three of these a
 dissection was made to see to which of the two upper roots the nerve
 was to be traced.     It was found to come from the 5th in eleven cases,
 from the 6th in three, and from both in nine.           I believe that owing
 to my not being sufficiently mindfnl that the muscle often receives
 more than one nerve,      I have referred too large a number to the 5th
 alone.    Whether this be so or no, it does not represent the whole
 supply given to it, for the lower part of the muscle always receives
 fibres from the second subscapular on its way to the teres major.
     This is a nerve of rather lower origin than the preceding.         It was
 traced three times to the 5th, all foetal cases ; thirteen times to the
 undivided 6th and 5th ; four times to the Gth alone, one being an
 adult case ; nine times to both 5th and 6th, seven being adult cases ;
 nine times to both 6th and 7th, seven being adult cases ; and thrice it
 was formed by a branch from the cord of the upper two roots, and
 one from the 7th.      This shows out of forty-one cases twelve in which
 the 7th contributed to the nerve, and twenty-nine in which it was
 excluded.     There were only three in which the supply lay above the
 6th, and thirteen where it lay wholly below the 5th.
     The question then arose — When the 7th enters the nerve, does it
 form part of the twigs which supply the subscapularis ?             I divided
 the nerve in three such cases, and found that in each the 7th went
  entirely to the teres major.
      The lower part of the subscapularis,    however, is served, though not

   432                      Mr. W. P. Herringham.
   by the 7th, yet by a nerve which is of lower origin than the first
   subscapular.     Thus in four instances, three of them adult, where the
  first subscapular came from the 5th alone, the second contained no
  5th, and in these cases the lower part of the muscle was snpplied by a
  lower nerve.      This confirms also three other adult dissections of the
  first subscapular.      In one it was triple ; the first twig going to the
  upper fibres of the muscle ran from the 5th, the next to the middle
  fibres from the 5th and 6th, and the third from the 6th alone, below
  which came a twig from the second subscapular.            In the two other
  cases the nerve was double, the npper twig coming from the 5th, the
  lower from the 6th root.
      The third subscapular going to the latissimus dorsi was traced in
 forty-two cases.       Once it came from the 5th and 6th alone, three
 times it was formed by the 7th and a branch from the undivided 5th
 and 6th, four times by the 7th and a branch from the 6th (once with
 an addition from the 8th also), twenty-one times from the 7th alone,
 and thirteen from both 7th and 8th.
     It is to be noted that in these three muscles there seems a regular
 progression from above downwards.           The latissimus dorsi is usually
 served by a lower nerve than the teres, and this by a lower than the
 subscapularis, and though they are occasionally equalised their posi
 tions in the series are never reversed.
     The circumflex nerve was shown in forty-three cases to be derived
  from the 5th and 6th alone.       It never received a fibre from the 7th.
 In six cases, two of them adult, it came from the 5th alone, in
 twenty-two from both 5th and 6th, and in the remainder it was un
 divided. It never arose from the 6th alone, and in many cases where
 both nerves helped to form it the branch from the 6th was so small
 that it could not be traced without breakage.       I  dissected the nerve
three times.      In all these the teres minor was supplied by the 5th
only,    and  the  deltoid by both 5th and 6th. The cutaneous branch
was in one from the 5th alone, in the other two received a fibre from
the 6th also.
     The musculo-spiral is formed sometimes by all four of the upper
roots, usually by the 6th, 7th, and 8th alone.       Out of forty-six cases
the 5th and 6th were undivided in twelve, in nine of the remaining
thirty-four the 5th helped to form the nerve. Two of these were
adult.      In twenty-five, fourteen of which were adult, it was
excluded.
    In  one adult case where the 5th entered the nerve       it was found by
dissection    to run to the external cutaneous branch alone.
    The branch first given off is the nerve to the long head of the
triceps, with which sometimes goes the internal cutaneous branch.
The former was twelve times given from the 8th root, thrice from
both 7th and 8th, and once from the 7th alone.                  The internal

cutaneous was seven times noted separately, in all of which it came
from the 8th alone. That part of the muscle which arises helow the
musculo-spiral groove, commonly called the inner head, receives the
ulnar collateral nerve on its inner part, and another branch which also
serves  the anconeus in its onter part. These two nerves were in
six instances derived from the 8th only, in three from both 7th and
8th, in two from the 7th only, and in one from the 7th with the
addition of a fibre from the 6th.  In eleven cases where the supply
of the outer head of the triceps was traced separately, it came from
the 8th alone once only, from both 7th and 8th twice, from the 7th
alone twice, from the 6th and 7th once, and from the 6th alone in
five cases.  In fourteen instances the nerves to the separate heads
were not traced apart, but the whole muscle together with the
internal cutaneous branch was in all supplied below the 6th. In
three more the inner and outer heads were taken together, and in
these also the supply was from the 7th and 8th.
   The 6th therefore only entered the triceps in five out of twenty-
eight cases, and it is to be noted that in No. 19, the only case where
the 6th entered the inner head, it wholly supplied the outer.
   The next branches given off are the two external cutaneous.
The short branch was noticed in fourteen cases.     Eight times it was
shown to come from the 6th alone, once from both 5th and 6th, and
in the remaining five from the first two roots, the 5th not being
excluded.   The long branch sprang from the 6th five times, in two of
which the 5th was not excluded, from both 6th and 7th once, from
the 7th thrice, from the 7th and 8th four times,* and from tho 8th
thrice.
   The nerve then supplies the brachialis anticus.     The branch, or
branches, going  to this  muscle, which  are very small, were isolated
eight times.   They were traced each time to the 6th, but in three
cases the 5th was not excluded.
   The branch to the supinator longus was traced twenty-two times,
always to the 6th, but in twelve cases the 5th was not excluded.
   The extensor carpi radialis longior was served twelve times by the
6th alone (in eight the 5th was not excluded), once by both the 6th
and the lower nerves, and ten times by the lower part of the musculo-
spiral, in four of which the 7th alone was traced to            in five it,
the 7th and 8th were not separated, and in one both were found
supplying it.
   The brevior was supplied by the 6th six times, in four of which
the 5th was not excluded, once by both the 6th and the lower nerves,
and nine times by the lower nerves alone, in four of which the 7th
was the agent, and in one both 7th and 8th.
 *   In   one case formed by the 7th and 8th the twig from   the 7th ran nearer the
radial border than that from the 8th.

434                     Mr. W. P. Herringham.
   The nerve to the supinator brevis was traced thirteen times, in
every case to the 6th, but in five the 5th was not excluded.
   The two remaining divisions are the radial and the posterior in
terosseous.   The former was composed by the 6th alone thirteen
times, in seven of which the 5th was not excluded, twelve times it
was partly formed by the lower nerves.       In all the seven cases when
the  two  lower  nerves  had  been divided  the  7th alone was found to
share in the radial.
   I was able in only one case to dissect the radial consisting of both
6th and 7th.      In it the 6th supplied the ball and dorsum of the
thumb and the radial side of the index, while the 7th took the
remainder.
   The posterior interosseous was in seven cases formed by the lower
nerves entirely.    In four it received also part of the upper nerves.
The question arose whether the 8th ever entered the muscles of the
forearm.    Out of sixteen dissections, eleven foatal and five adult,
twelve of which four were adult showed the 8th to cease before the
forearm muscles were reached, four of which two were adult showed
the 8th coming round to the back of the arm.
   In two of these latter the 7th and 8th formed equal parts of the
posterior interosseous ; in the other two cases the 8th gave so minute
a fibre to the nerve below the triceps that        I  could not trace it
separately.
   In several   of these cases the 5th was not excluded from the
muscnlo-spiral, and must therefore be considered as a possible source
of the supply, but it must be remembered that the probability of its
taking part in the nerve is only, as before shown, nine in thirty-four,
and that when dissected in the nerve it was found only to enter the
short external cutaneous branch.
   These results show considerable variation in the distribution of the
nerve roots, although   I do not think it is greater than in any other
of the structures of the body.    But this variation is not extravagant.
If a type be composed from the foregoing materials and compared
with the varieties, it appears that if a muscle or a piece of skin is not
supplied by the typical nerve, the place is filled only by one of its
neighbours, not by a nerve far removed from it in the series.        The
teres major usually supplied by the 6th is on occasion supplied by the
5th, and sometimes by the 7th, never by the 8th or 9th.
   Again, some muscles seem to bear definite relations to each other,
and their nerve supply seems also to vary solidly, so that the relative
position of the muscles judged by their nerve supply does not alter
although they be not served by the usual nerve.        The best example
of this is in the three muscles which are attached along the inner
side of the bicipital groove, the subscapularis, teres major, and latis-
simus dorsi.    The first is usually supplied by the 5th and 6th, the

                 The  Minute Anatomy of    the Brachial Plexus.            435
second     by the 6th, and the last by the 7th, and however much they
vary     above   and below their typical place, they do not change their
relations to each other. A similar relation exists between the two
supinators and the two radial extensors.          These last are sometimes
supplied by the 6th, sometimes by the 7th, bat they are never in any
case placed above the supinators.        These are always supplied by the
Gth alone.        The flexor group in the forearm show a similar fixed
relation.
    From consideration of the usual regularity of the nerve supply,
and of the limits within which alone it varies, I conclude that the
nerve roots are not always composed of the same fibres, but that
what is in one case the lower bundle of the 5th may be in another
the upper of the 6th, and what is now the upper bundle of the 8th
will at another time be the lower of the 7th root.            This may be
expressed as a law.
     LAW I. — Any       given fibre may alter its position relative to the
 vertebral column, but will maintain its position relative to other fibres.
     It  is to confirm   laws that exceptions are important.     One of my
 infants     showed on both sides a larger root from the 10th or 2nd
 dorsal     nerve than was usual.      On the right side the nerve was
 slightly bigger than the natural, but on the left it was as large
 as the 9th, and this as large as the 8th, whereas the natural
  proportion of the 8th to the 9th is about 2 to 1, and the 10th root is
  a minute fibre only. On the right side the only abnormality in the
  plexus was that the 9th sent a branch to the musculo-spiral.         But on
  the left the musculo- cutaneous received from the 7th, the median
  received no 6th, the teres major was supplied by the 7th alone, the
  circumflex received from the 7th, and the musculo-spiral was formed
  by the 7th, 8th, and 9th. In the ulnar both 8th and 9th entered the
  deep branch in the hand.       Nevertheless the 4th sent a communication
  to the 5th, and the suprascapular and subscapular were given off
   normally.
      It  appears  that in this case the representation of the muscles in
   the   spinal  cord began at the ordinary level, but was more than
   usually lengthened out, its lowest point sinking so far that the 10th
   nerve conveyed an excessive proportion of fibres to the plexus.        This
   unusual formation of the peripheral nerves still maintains the relative
   position of the muscles.
       I do not, however, find that every muscle comprised in the table
   holds fixed relations with all others.    There appear to be groups of
   muscles which are not intimately related.      Thus the rise or fall of
   the three subscapular nerves does not entail a like movement in the
    nerves of the forearm.
       I have drawn up from my dissections the following table, giving
    the usual supply of the muscles of the upper limb.

   The pectoralis major receives from the 6th, 7tb, 8th, and 9th ; the
minor from the 7th, 8th, and 9th.
   The question next arises upon what system are these muscles
innervated ? Is it a system of form or of function ? Are muscles
supplied by the same nerve because they act together or because they
lie near one another ?
   In the first place the movements of the arm are so varied that there
is hardly any combination of muscles unrepresented.             In the com
monest and most necessary of all acts, that of putting a piece of food
into the mouth, the food is grasped by the small muscles of the thumb
and the interossei, the carpus is flexed upon the forearm, the forearm
is half pronated and flexed upon the arm, and the pectoralis major
draws the limb forward across the chest.              Doubtless many other
muscles take an unrecognised share also. But of those here mentioned
the anatomy of ordinary text-books shows that some, the flexors of
the elbow, are served by the outer cord, the 5th, 6th, and 7th, whilst
the interossei are supplied by the ulnar from the 8th and 9th. Ac
cording to my dissections that one action is brought about through
every nerve in the plexus, and there is no action which does not
involve several nerves at once.
   Looking at the theory from another point of view, is it true that
muscles which cause the same movement, or which continually con

                The Minute Anatomy         of  the Brachial Plexus.          437
tract together, are supplied by the same nerve ? The action of the
two pronators is indistinguishable, but the teres is supplied by the
6th, and the quadratus by the 8th and 9th ; the thumb is always acting
with    the fingers, yet the superficial thenar muscles       are served by the
6th, and the others by the 8th.
    It  seems then certain that the place where functions are represented
is higher than the peripheral nerves, and that these are distributed
according to some other plan.
    The other system that suggests itself is the system according to
place, and I find that the nerve supply of the muscles of the upper
limb obeys three rules.
    LAW H. —A.         Of  two  muscles,    or  of two parts of a muscle, that
          which is nearer the head-end of the body tends to       be supplied by
          the   higher, that which is nearer the tail-end          by the lower
          nerve.
    B. Of two    muscles,  that which is nearer the long axis of the body tends
          to be supplied by the higher, that which is nearer the periphery by
          the lower nerve.
    C. Of    two muscles,  that which is nearer the surface tends to be supplied
          by the higher, that which    is further from it by the lower nerve.
    The first rule has been already clearly exemplified in the supply of
 large flat muscles which receive more than one nerve, such as the
 pectoralis major and serratus magnus.             The subscapularis is also an
 example.      In all these muscles it was shown that the upper parts
 were supplied by upper, the lower by relatively lower nerves.                 It
 remains to show how it is exemplified in the remainder of the muscles
 belonging to the limb.
    It has been laid down that in the first position of the foetus the
 great tuberosity and the external condyle of the humerus, the radius
 and the thumb are turned towards the head ; the lesser tuberosity,
 the internal condyle, the ulna, and the little finger towards the tail.
 The first set of points have been called pre-axial, the latter post-axial.
  The muscles corresponding with the pre-axial points will be found to
 be supplied by higher nerves than those connected with post-axial
 points at the same level of the limb.
    Of the muscles which connect the scapula to the spine, the highest
 is the levator angnli scapulae.        This is supplied by the 3rd and 4th,
 and slightly by the 5th.       Below this come the rhomboids supplied by
 the 5th alone.     Of the muscles which join the humerus to the scapula
 those inserted into the outer or pre-axial tuberosity are supplied by the
 5th, with very slight, if any, aid from the 6th.         Of those going to the
 post-axial part, the subscapularis, which is the highest, is supplied by
 the 5th and 6th ; the teres major below it is supplied by the 6th, the
 latissimus dorsi which comes from lower down the body, and the

 438                         Mr. W.   P. Herringham.
  coraco-brachialis continuing down the post-axial border, are served               by
 the  7th*
     Of the muscles rnnuing to the upper end of the forearm, the biceps
  and brachialis anticus are supplied from the 5th and 6th ; the triceps
  by the 7th and 8th, and it is remarkable that of the three heads of
  the triceps the outer,     which is nearest to the pre-axial border,         19  the
 highest in the series.
    At this point    the 5th ends.
    Of the muscles arising about the outer condyle, the highest in rank
 are the two supinators inserted into the radius, next the extensors of
 the carpus going to the radial side of the hand.                 Of those coming
 from the internal condyle, the two outermost, nearest, that is, to the
 radius, are supplied by the 6th.            The innermost, the flexor carpi
 ulnaris, is supplied by the 8th and 9th (and at this point the 9th first
 begins to share in the system) ; the flexor sublimis, between the two,
 is supplied by the 7th and the lower nerves.                   None of the deep
 muscles are served by the 6th, and the 7th seldom runs to them.
 They are as a rule innervated by the lowest of the series.
    Passing to the hand, the superficial muscles on the outer side are
 supplied by the 6th, the superficial on the inner side by the 8th, the
 deep muscles being again supplied by the lowest of the nerves supply
 ing the hand, namely, the 8th.
    It is remarkable and unexpected that the 8th and not the 9th shonld
 be the nerve going to the muscles of the hand.                 The explanation      I
 would suggest     is that  the  motor  part  of  the 9th   is  rather an auxiliary
 nerve than an integral part of the plexus.                 The extremely small
part which      it often   plays  in  the  ulnar,   and    the   fact that in two
 cases none of its fibres could be traced thither at all, confirm this
 view.
    The cutaneous supply of the limb exemplifies still more clearly
the first of the rules laid down for the motor system.                    Over the
deltoid runs the descending branch from the 3rd and 4th, below this
comes the circumflex from the 5th, or from the 5th and 6th.                       The
branch of the 5th in the musculo-cutaneous, and the short external
cutaneous of the mnsculo-spiral given by the 6th, supply the skin over
the outer condyle and head of the radius.             Down to the end of the
radius it is served by the musculo-cutaneous,                either from the 6th
alone, or as in one case by the 5th and 6th ; the thumb is supplied by
the 6th in the median and radial.
    On the inner side, the highest part, the skin of the axilla, is served
by the 10th, the area below this by the junction of the 9th and 10th
(the intercosto-humeral with the nerve of Wrisberg), next by the 9th
   • The deltoid, which would
                                 also exemplify the law, is omitted.    I consider it
uniform with the pcctoralis major, not truly part of the long muscles of the limb.

              The Minute Anatomy        of the Brachial Plexus.          439
in the internal cutaneous which rnns down to the wrist.            The little
finger is supplied by the 9th in front, and by the 8th behind ; the
front of the three middle fingers by the 7th and 8th, the back by the
6th and 7th.
   In the sensory system, therefore, as in the motor, the upper nerves
can be traced down the pre-axial, and the lowest down the post-axial
border ; but a remarkable difference appears between the sensory and
the motor system.        Whereas in the latter it seemed the tendency for
the lowest nerves to supply the lowest muscles, in the sensory nerves
the extreme are nearest the upper, the middle nerves nearest the lower
extremity of the limb.
   Thus, if the limb be seen from the front the two highest nerves on
the outer and inner sides respectively are the 4th and the 10th.
Lower than these the 5th and 6th take the outer, the 9th and 10th
the inner side.      Below the elbow the 6th alone takes the outer, and
the 9th alone the inner. In the hand, while the 6th and 9th continue
their positions, the 7th and 8th for the first time begin to join in the
supply.
   Below the elbow a distinction begins to appear between the dorsal
and palmar surfaces.       If a line be drawn round the lower third of the
forearm from the middle of the front surface to the radial border,
across the dorsum, round the ulna, and so to the middle line again, it
will cut in order cutaneous branches of the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th.
Thus on the outer side behind the 6th in the musculocutaneous
comes the musculo-spiral cutaneous from the 7th, and on the inner
side behind the 9th in the internal cutaneous comes the dorsal
cutaneous formed by the 8th. When the 8th was dissected in the
internal cutaneous it was found going to the dorsum, and where
the 7th and 8th joined to form the musculo-spiral branch the 7th lay
nearest of the two to the radial border.
   In the fingers, again, the 8th is the lowest nerve supplying the back.
The 9th the lowest in front. The extremes therefore are on the palmar,
the dorsal area occupies an intermediate position. Above the elbow
the 8th in the internal cutaneous of the musculo-spiral, holding a
position intermediate between the 10th in the intercosto-humeral,
and the 5th and 6th in the circumflex, is an example of the same
law.
   The sensory nerves therefore obey the following rules : —
   A. Of   two spots on the shin    that which is nearer the pre-axial border
        tends  to be supplied by the higher nerve.
   B. Of two spots in the pre-axial area the lower tends to be supplied by
        the lower nerve, and of two spots in the post-axial area the lower
        tends to  be supplied by the higher nerve.
   This, however unexpected, is not very difficult to understand.        Tho

epiblastic layer which forms the skin ensheaths the mesoblast, from
which the deeper structures are developed.                  Suppose nerves, or what
will afterwards become nerves, to be distributed to both.                  The meso
blast now begins to grow and pushes before it the enveloping sheath
of epiblast.        But, as may be seen with a piece of india-rubber, in any
such process the points furthest from the centre of pressure remain
nearest the top of the tube, and the point which was in the middle
when the stretching began, will be at the furthest point of the sheath
when it is finished. If in the arm the centre of pressure be supposed
opposite to the area supplied by the 7th nerve, this nerve will always
tend to supply the parts lying nearest the axis of the limb, and
furthest from the axis of the body, while the 6th, 5th, and 4th in the
pre-axial, and the 8th, 9th, and 10th in the post-axial area, .will in that
order approach the trunk.              This is the case.
    It appears then that in both sensory and motor systems the pre-
axial area is supplied by higher nerves, the post-axial by lower ; that
the supply of the skin follows rules which obtain in any membrane
subject to the same conditions, but that the supply of the muscles is
modified by laws peculiar to themselves.
    This subject has not to my knowledge been before this investigated
by human dissections.
    Ferrier's* classification of the muscles by means of electric stimula
tion of the spinal roots in monkeys, though he explains the system as
one of function, is not far removed from that now put forward.
    Forgue.t who stimulated not the spinal roots, but the branches
which they gave to the nerves of the plexus, and who watched the
contraction of dissected muscles, draws up the following list for

   Both these observers worked with monkeys, and Forgue's laws are,
with the exception of the first, identical with those which human
dissections have produced for me.       That the details should exactly
correspond is not to be expected in two different genera when indi
viduals of the same vary so widely.
   Electrical stimulation does not show the sensory supply.
    Ihave often tried to complete this account by dissecting the nerves
upwards to the spinal cord.    I have, however, never been able to rely
on the results.   Tho connective tissue permeating the nerve separates
and protects the bundles of nerve fibres composing     and renders their    it,
dissociation impossible.   But as the nerve nears the intervertebral
foramen this tissue very rapidly diminishes, and in the foramen the
root consists of nerve bundles with hardly any connective tissue
between them.     The nerve bundles in the adult might perhaps be
separated even here from one another, but in the fcetus, and these
alone are for this purpose accessible to me, their minuteness and their
softness have prevented any satisfactory dissection.

   The result obtained in the paper on the cell of the honey bee.
read November 26, 1885, by which the side of one of the lozenges
composing the cell was found to be three times the difference
hetween the two parallel edges forming the sides of one of the
trapeziums of the prism, gives a very simple method for constructing
the figure as follows.   On a straight line take a part AD, and lay

 off  DC   equal to twice   AD, from D -erect a perpendicular, and with
 radius AC = 3DA cut off DP ; AC and AP are sides of the lozenge
 ACEP,     which fulfils the required conditions.       It is manifest that
 from this lozenge the remaining two lozenges and also the six
 trapeziums can be immediately constructed.
     The triangular pyramid- which terminates the bee's cell may be in
 scribed in a sphere whose diameter is three times the side of one of the
 edges of the pyramid.      The base of this pyramid is an equilateral
 triangle, the side of which is h\/S, and whose circumscribing circle
 has 2h for its diameter.     This diameter is a chord of the spherical
 segment whose versed sine is x. Hence, if D is the diameter of the
 sphere in which     27i is a chord,  xD=hi+zi, but       also 71=2^23!, and
s=3x, whence
                                 D=9i=3«.

                                      2v/2
    Hence the sphere contains within it all that part of the bee's cell
 bounded by the three lozenges, together with as much of the hexa
gonal prism as may be measured by twice the side of a lozenge on
 the shorter edge of the prism.
     This result, together with the extremely simple mode now given
 for constructing the figure, divests the problem of the complexity
 and difficulty with which it was formerly sometimes regarded, and it
 may also possibly enable the naturalist to more readily explain the
 action of the bees in moulding the cells of the honeycomb to their
 observed shapes.

                                 (Abstract.)
    The author commences by giving a sketch of some of the more
important methods which have been devised for the bacterioscopic
examination of air. In these he includes the experiments of Pasteur,
who was the first to show that the air at different places varied in
the number of micro-organisms which it contained, and of Tyndall,
 who proved that the microbes suspended in the air become rapidly
deposited in the absence of any disturbing influence.            He further
                                                                2 h 2

 444         Dr. P. F. Fraiiklaud.        On the Estimation   of    [Dec. 9,
 describes the process of Freudenreich and Miquel for the quantita
 tive estimation of the bacteria in air, and points ont the great advance
 which haH been made upon their method in the adaptation by Koch,
 and later by Hesse, of a solid nourishing medium for their investiga
 tion. In reviewing these different processes he draws attention to
 the advantages and disadvantages          attending them, and proceeds to
 describe a new method which he has devised, and in which he has
 endeavoured to overcome some of the objections to which the others
 are open.
    The first experiments consisted in aspirating a definite volume of
 air through plugs of either glass-wool or sugared glass-wool, and
 mixing them by violent agitation with a definite volume of either
 broth or sterilised distilled water.
    A portion of this liquid was then added to gelatine-peptone, and
plates were poured in the usual manner.
    In this way a much larger volume of air was capable of being
examined than was possible by Hesse's method, whilst at the same
time the solid medium, with its advantages,             was retained.   The
experiments,     however,    show that although in many cases the
results of two or more plates poured from the same mixture wore
fairly uniform, yet discrepancies did occur, and were sometimes
very considerable,     pointing to the fact that the organisms had
not become evenly distributed throughout the liquid ; also as only a
portion of the air aspirated was capable of being examined, a very
much larger volume of air had to be used in order to give a sensible
result.
    This objection, which applies equally to Miquel's method, which
rests upon the assumption that it w possible to equally apportion out
into a series of flasks or tubes the organisms contained in snch a
liquid, led the author to abandon the plate process, and to devise a
method which should enable the whole volume of air aspirated to be
examined.
    The method consists essentially in aspirating a known volume of
air through a glass tube, containing two sterile plugs, consisting
either of glass-wool alone, glass-wool and fine glass-powder, glass-
wool coated with sugar, or sugared glass-wool and fine sugar-powder.
The plugs are so arranged that the first one through which air is
drawn is more pervious than the second.            After a given volume of
air has been aspirated, the two plugs are transferred respectively to
two flasks, each containing melted sterile gelatine-peptone,            and
plugged with sterile cotton- wool stoppers.          The plug is carefully
agitated  with  the gelatine,  so as  to avoid any  formation of froth, and
when the plug has become completely disintegrated and mixed with
the gelatine, the latter is congealed, so as to form an even film over
the inner surface of the flask.      On incubating these flasks at a tempo

                    Micro-organisms     in the Atmosphere.              445
rature of 22° C., in the course of four to five days the, colonies
derived from the organisms contained in the plugs make their
appearance, and can be readily counted and further examined.
    A large number of experiments were made with a view of testing
the accuracy of the process.        For this purpose experiments were
conducted, using sometimes single plugs, and sometimes double, and
it was almost invariably found that all the organisms were deposited
on the first plug, the second plug in the very exceptional cases when
it did yield anything, containing rarely more than one organism.
    In connexion with Hesse's method, it was found that in experiments
performed in the open air, when a blank Hesse tube was exposed side
by side with the one through which air was being aspirated, a number
of organisms also became deposited in the blank tube, thus intro
ducing an important source of error in the quantitative results
obtained by Hesse's process.      In the flask method, on the contrary,
such blank tubes rarely contained any organisms, and in no case more
than a vanishing proportion of those present in the other tube.
This shows that whereas in Hesse's apparatus any disturbance of the
air during the experiment vitiates the accuracy of the result, in the
flask method such disturbances are immaterial.
     On the other hand, in the absence of aerial currents, there was
a   remarkable concordance between the results obtained by Hesse's
method and by the " flask method." This is important, not only as
showing the quantitative accuracy of the new method, but by clearly
demonstrating that the organisms present in the air exist in an isolated
 condition, and not in aggregates, as suggested by Hesse.         It will be
 remembered that the ping is violently agitated with the gelatine-
 peptone, during which operation such aggregates would undoubtedly
 be broken up wholly, or, any rate, partially ; it would, therefore, be
 reasonable to expect that the
                                    " flask method " would yield a larger
 number, and possibly a far larger number of colonies than those
 formed in Hesse's tabes, but as, on the contrary, the numbers agree,
 under the circumstances described, in so remarkable a manner, it
 points to the fact that they exist in an isolated condition.
     The paper is illustrated with drawings and photographs.
     The following are the principal advantages which the author claims
 for the " flask method."
     1. The process possesses all the well-known advantages attaching
  to the use of a solid medium.
     2. The results, as tested by the comparison of parallel experiments,
  can lay claim to a high degree of quantitative accuracy.
     3. The results, as tested by Control experiments,      are not appre
  ciably affected by aerial currents, which prove such a disturbing factor
  in the results obtained by some other methods.
     4. The collection of an adequate        sample of air occupies a very

 440          The Distribution  of Micro-organisms in Air.        [Dec. 9,
 short space of time, so that a much larger volume of air can be con
 veniently operated upon than is the case with Hesse's method. Thus
 whilst the aspiration of 10 litres of air through Hesse's apparatus
 takes about three-quarters of an hour, by the new method about
 48 litres can be drawn through the tube in the same time, whilst a
 better plan is to take two tubes and alternately draw a definite
 volume of air through each, as by this means duplicate results are
 obtained.
    5. As the whole plug, upon which the organisms           from a given
 volume of air are deposited, is submitted to cultivation without sub
 division, no error is introduced through the multiplication of results
 obtained from aliquot parts, and all the great difficulties attending
 equal subdivision are avoided.
    6. The risk of aerial contamination in the process of flask-cultivation
is practically nil.
    7. The apparatus required being very simple and highly portable,
 the method is admirably adapted for the performance of experiments
at a distance from home, and in the absence of special laboratory
appliances.

   The authors record a number of experiments, made with Hesse's
apparatus,   on the prevalence of micro-organisms in the atmosphere.
The results are intended to form a supplement to those already
obtained by one of the authors, and published in the last volume of
the Society's 'Proceedings' (vol. 40, p.
                                            509). The greater number
of the experiments have been performed on the roof of the Science
Schools, South Kensington, the air of which has now been under
observation    at frequent intervals during the present year.           The
authors point out the variations according to season, which have taken
place in the number of micro-organisms present in the air collected in
the above place.     The average results obtained were as follows : —

   Experiments are also recorded showing the enormous increase in
the number of micro-organisms present in the air of rooms consequent
on crowding.    In illustration of this point the authors cite a series
of experiments made in the Library of the Royal Society during the
evening of the conversazione      in June last, on which occasion the
following results were obtained —          :

   These researches were carried out while acting as assistant to
 Professor Mcintosh, at the St. Andrew's Marine Laboratory. The chief
 material consisted of the intra-ovarian ovum of the gurnard (Trigla
 gurnardus).   Many other marine forms, however, were examined.
                                                                  —
   The paper has been divided into the following five paragraphs:

¦148         On the   Intra-ovarian Egg of some Osseous Fishes,              [Dec   J»,
              I.   The Nucleus and its Changes in the Smaller Ova.
  In    the smallestova the nucleus occupies almost the whole of the
interior, and the nucleoli are mostly attached to the inner surface of
the nuclear wall.    In somewhat larger eggs, the protoplasm sur
rounding the nucleus has increased, and      seen to be divided into n
                                                is
darker internal portion and a lighter external one. The ring of dark
protoplasm becomes separated off from the nncleus in the later stage?,
and ultimately disappears.   The dark protoplasm has no doubt origi
nated from the nucleus.    The view that this has been caused                     bya
substance being added from the nucleus        considerably strengthened
                                                is
by an observation made by  Ransom,  and  published in the Philosophical
                                                                     '
Transactions,' 1867. He found in fact that the germinal spots were
soluble in some of the constituents of the yolk. At this stage the
spots become vacuolate, and assume      variety of different forms, until
                                            a
the nucleus enters a new phase in the development of the intra-
ovarian egg described in the following paragraph.
       II.    The Larger Ova and the Formation       of   the   Yolk Spherules.
  The egg has almost reached its final size, although far from being
mature, when the nucleus   seen to have shrunk a little, and from
                                    is                                              it
project protuberances on all sides. These protuberances or diverti
cula, most of which contain nucleolar particles, are ultimately con
stricted off from the nucleus, and travel towards the periphery of the
egg.    A similar transformation of the nuclear contents has recently
been observed by Balbiani, Boule, and Fol, in invertebrate ova, aud
by Will, in amphibia.     The buds with their enclosed contents form
the yolk spherules, the solid mass in their interior soon breaking up
into fine granules. Both Gegenbaur and Balfour speak in support of
the view that yolk spherules originate within the egg.     As the egg
reaches maturity the nucleus degenerates still more, but     believe     I             it
never entirely disappears.
                             III.   The Egg Membranes.
   Much has been written on this subject, and        still doubtful how
                                                          it    is
many membranes exist.      Almost all observers, however, agree that                   in
the mature egg there       a membrane pierced by minute pores, which
                             is
lias generally been called " zona radiata," though other terms, such as
vitelline membrane, egg-capsule, <fcc, have been applied to it. In the
intra-ovarian egg of the gurnard        found a semi-fluid layer inside
                                          I
the zona, corresponding to the " helle Randschicht " described                         by
Gegenbaur in the ova of birds and reptiles. It disappears in the ripe
ovum.   No membrane external to the zona, such as mentioned                            by
various observers, was seen in this or other fish eggs.
  With regard to tlie pores in the zona radiata,    seems very probable

that they are filled with processes from the follicular epithelium, and
that the egg is nourished in this manner.          In the ova I examined I
could not see any processes, but they have been noticed by other
observers in larger eggs of fishes, as well as of reptiles and mammals.
                         IV.    The  Follicular Layer.
   The follicular layer in the mature ovum consists usually of a layer
of closely-set cells, which, seen from above, have an hexagonal appear
ance. A peculiar modification of the follicular cells is found in the
shanny's egg (Blennitis pholis).         On one-half of the egg's surface
the cells are elongated, their depth gradually increasing towards a
central point. In this way the depth of the cells varies from
0*007 mm. to 0-032 mm.            I  never noticed follicular cells passing
through    the  zona radiata,  as  has been described by many authors.
                                V.  Development.
    No observation was made as to the origin of the egg, and it could
not be determined whether the ovum originated from a simple trans
formation of an epithelial cell, or whether several unite, as in
" elasmobranchs." 1 am inclined to the
                                               belief, however, that Brock's
 and Kolessuikow's views are correct, according to whom only one cell
is concerned in the formation of the primitive egg.         In small ova the
 follicular epithelium is composed of a few large cells. There are
 several possible ways in which the follicular layer might have origi
 nated, either by an aggregation of epithelial cells round the ovum,
 as in elasmobranchs,      or by a collection of connective tissue cells at
 the periphery of the ovum, or from the nucleus, as in many inverte
 brates.    I have not been able to come to any definite conclusion on
 this subject.
    The egg membranes appear after the follicle. The zona radiata is
 formed first, and, as well as the zonoid layer, it takes its origin from
 the yolk.

       18, 1886.
    Direct vision spectroscopes      are very useful in the observation of
 shifting objects,    such   as   aurorae and other meteors.       They are
 generally in request for telescopic work, and also in all cases where
 rapidity of observation is of consequence.           Ordinary direct visisn

spectroscopes with compound prisms have the disadvantage that the
dispersion of the red end of the spectrum is small ; less in proportion
to that of the blue end than in spectroscopes with simple prisms.
Also no measurements of lines can be made with them, except by-
means of a scale fixed     in the field of view, which it is often difficult to
see  for want of illumination.
   Some time since (' Roy. Soc. Proc.,' vol. 28, p. 482) we brought
under the notice of the Society a direct vision spectroscope                 on
Thollon's plan, which had not the faults of the instruments with
compound prisms.         It gave a dispersion equal to that of two prisms
of 60°, and excellent definition, but the number of reflecting and
refracting surfaces which had to be truly wrought was rather large,
and the movement of the prisms by a screw made measurements with
it slow.
    Since then we have tried a spectroscope with one of the Astro
nomer Royal's half prisms, but we found it impossible to get good
definition with the half prism for more than a small part of the
visible spectrum ; and in consequence faint bands near either end of
the spectrum were quite invisible with this instrument.
   The arrangement we have now to describe was intended to obviate
the defects of the others.
   It  has   three prisms symmetrically arranged, the middle one
serving   both    for refraction and reflexion.       The course of a ray
through the prisms is indicated in the annexed diagram. A ray Im
in the line of the axis of the collimator meets the first prism ABC in
m, is refracted at m and w, meets the second prism EGB at o, and is
then refracted, undergoes two internal reflexions at p and q, and is
refracted out at r ; it is then refracted through the third prism DEF
at s and t, and emerges in the direction tu, which is a prolongation of
its original direction Im and coincides with the axis of the observing
telescope.    The prism EGB is fixed, the other two prisms are movable
about   axes  parallel to their edges passing through the points m and
t.   They are rotated simultaneously in opposite directions by a pair

1886.]       On a New Form     of Direct Vision   Spectroscope.        451
of linked levers, of which one carries a graduated arc of 9^ inches
radius, by which the angle of rotation can be determined.       Those rays
which suffer no deviation in passing through the train, must all follow
a course through the fixed prism parallel to opqr, whatever their
refrangibility ; but the angle of incidence at o will be different for the
different values of the refractive index. By turning the two movable
prisms into the positions shown by dotted lines the angle of incidence
at o will be diminished, and a less refrangible ray will follow the
course of no deviation.    If then the first position of the prisms ABC,
 DFE, be that for which an extreme violet ray incident in the line Im
suffers no deviation, all the less refrangible rays incident in the same
direction may be successively brought to suffer no deviation by turn
ing the prisms towards the position shown by the dotted line. The
angles of the prisms have, of course, to be adjusted so that the
extreme violet ray may suffer no deviation. A simple calculation
 suffices for this when the refractive indices of the glass employed are
 known. We have had the fixed prism constructed with the acute
angles about 33j°, and the movable prisms with angles about 62".
 With these angles, when the movable prisms are so placed that the
angles of incidence at m and of emergence at o are equal (the position
of minimum deviation), the ray which suffers no deviation is one
somewhat more refrangible than K of the solar spectrum. When then
 the prisms are turned, less refrangible rays are successively brought
 into the field of view, but no ray much more refrangible than K can
 be brought into the field.      By increasing the acute angles of the
 fixed prism, or by diminishing the angles of the movable prisms, a
 longer range can be given to the instrument, but at the expense of
 some dispersion.
    To prevent light passing directly        from the collimator    to  the
 observing telescope, a stop  HK is  placed midway between the movable
 prisms.
    It will  be observed  that the fixed prism serves both as a reflector
 and refractor, the dispersion produced by it being the same as that of
 a simple refracting prism of 40° (or 186° — 4EBG) in the position of
 minimum deviation. The dispersion for the extreme violet is there
 fore that of two prisms of 62° and one of 46° in the position of
 minimum deviation. For less refrangible rays the position of the
 movable prisms is not that of minimum deviation and the dispersion
 is proportionally increased, so as to help, in a small degree, to correct
 the inequality of dispersion of the two ends of the spectrum. At the
 same time the symmetry of the arrangement is maintained for all
 rays when in mid-field, and sharp definition is secured for all parts of
 the spectrum. This is a most important character. We find that with
 our instrument A and H of the solar spectrum are equally well seen,
 and so are the red and violet lines of the flame spectrum of potassium.

     For greater convenience in manipulation, and at the same time to
ensure a large angular aperture, our instrument has            a   short collimator
and telescope.  The magnification of the image    in consequence but

makes   it   easier to see faint spectra from large objecis, as well as to
catch the   light  of a moving object.   With an eyepiece of low power                it
serves well for the observation of absorption spectra.

quarter minutes with the vernier, considerable accuracy of measure
ment may be attained.           It must be observed, however, that the
change of angle     is not proportional to the change of refrangibility of
the rays brought to mid-field, because a larger proportional rotation
is  required at the violet end, when the prisms are near the position
of minimum deviation, than at the red end. Still there           a rotation
                                                                         is
of 33' 30" in passing from A to B.
    The prisms are enclosed in a box, and though this        an advantage

field.   We effect the latter object by a slit in the side of the box, and
a  small white paper reflector, nb in the figure, which throws light
from the opening in the box on to the side of the object glass,
clear of the prism. The slit in the box may be closed with a shutter
or with glasses of different colours.

I. "Note on Specific Inductive Capacity." By John Hopkinson,
          M.A, D.Sc, F.R.S. Received November 9, 1886.
    Consider a condenser formed of two parallel plates at distance x
fixim each other, their area A being so great, or the distance x so
small, that the whole of the lines of force may bo considered to be
uniformly distributed perpendicular to the plates.                     The space
between the plates is occupied by air, or by any insulating fluid. Let
c be the charge      of tho condenser and V the difference of potential
between the plates.      If the dielectric be air, there is every reason to
believe that Voc e, that is, there is for air a constant of specific
inductive capacity. My own experiments ([1880] ' Phil. Trans,'
vol. 172, p. 355) show that in the case of flint-glass the ratio of V to
f- is sensibly constant over a range of values of V from 200 volts per
cm. to 50,000 volts per cm. From experiments in which the dielectric
is one or other of a number of fluids and values of V upwards of
30,000 volts per cm. are used, Profes.sor                 Quincke concludes
 (' Wiedemann,    Annalen,'   vol.  28, 18B6, p. 549)  that   the value of e/V
is somewhat less for great electric forces       than   for small.      From the
experiments    described   in  that  paper, and   from   his   previous    experi
ments (' Wiedemann, Annalen,' vol. 19, 1883, p. 705, et seq.) he
also concludes that the specific inductive capacity determined from
the mechanical force resisting separation of the plates is 10 per cent,
to 50 cent, greater than that determined by the actual charge of the
condenser.     The purpose of the present note is to examine the rela
tions of these important conclusions, making as few assumptions as
possible.
    The   potential difference V is a function of the charge                e  and
distance x, and if the dielectric be given of nothing else.                    The

   Hitherto we have made no Assumption excepting that energy is not
dissipated in a condenser by charge and discharge. We now make an
assumption concerning /(V), namely, that it is of the form 0(V/a),
i.e., that    — = —,    or in words, that the capacity of a condenser varies
              dx    x
inversely as the distance between the plates.
  Then we have —
                               =    2K-KJ                                    (9)
   In words, the specific inductive capacity as determined by charge or
discharge of a condenser at any given potential and distance between
the plates is the arithmetic mean of the inductive capacity deter
mined by the force resisting separation of the plates and of that deter
mined by lateral pressure, the potential and distance being the same.
This is true whatever be the relation between charge and potential
difference,but it is at variance with the experimental result that            K,,
and     K,   are both greater than         K.

                                    j     V/ (V)dV /\Yf(Y).
   In the accompanying curve, let abscissa of any point  of the curve
                                                                   P

  We are thus unable to account for the observation on the hypo
thesis that the capacity varies inversely as x. Let us now suppose that

 with observation.     Consider, however, the ratio —
 since  0=  ^-<}>{x)

or                             0(x)oe;
    We could, therefore, account for K? being greater than K by sup.
posing that the potential difference with given charge per unit of
area does not vary as x but as xm.          Such a supposition would be sub
versive of all accepted ideas of electrostatics.
    There remains one other consideration to be named.                   We have
assumed throughout        that  the   charge    of  the   condenser depends only
on the distance of the plates and their difference of potential, and is
independent of previous charges or of the time the difference of poten
tial has existed. We have ignored residual charge. It is easy to see
 what its effect will be on determinations of K made by measuring the
potential and charge of the condenser.             It is not so obvious what its
effect will be in all cases on the force between the plates.            Consider a
complete cycle   of  operations  : the  condenser     is  charged  with quantity e,
the distance between the plates is increased from x to x+dx, the con
denser is discharged and the plates return to their initial position.
The work done respectively in charging the condenser, separating the
plates, and recovered in discharging the condenser, will depend on
the rate at which these operations are performed.                There are ideally
two ways of performing them, so that                no   energy is dissipated by
residual charge, first, under certain reservations, so rapidly that no
residual 'charge is developed; second, so slowly that at each potential
the residual charge is fully developed ; in either case the potential is
a function of the then charge, and not of the antecedent charges.
The attraction between the plates will differ according as the charge
is an instantaneous one or has been long applied. If a liquid were
found exhibiting a considerable slowly developed residual charge, the
capacity determined by attraction with continuous charge would be
greater than the capacity determined by an instantaneous discharge
of the condenser through a galvanometer or into another condenser.

I am not aware that residual charge has been observed in any liquid
dielectric.
    The results obtained by Professor Quincke are not easy to recon
cile.   For that reason it is the more desirable that their fall signifi
cance should be ascertained.         Full information is given of all the
details of his experiments except on one point.              It is not stated
whether, in the experiments for determining K by direct discharge of
the condenser, the capacity of the connexion and key was ascertained.
It would in most ordinary arrangements of key be very appreciable
in comparison with the capacity of the condenser itself. If neglected
the effect would be to a certain extent to give too low a value of K,
 the effect being most marked when K is large.
    I  have made a few preliminary experiments to determine K for
colza oil with several different samples, and both with continuous
 charges and intermittent charges from an induction coil. The values
of K range from 2'95 to 3" 11.           Professor Quincke's results in his
first paper are  K=2443,     K,=2385, K,=3296.
    The property of double refraction in liquids caused by electrifica
tion is sometimes cited as showing that electrification is not propor
tional to electromotive force.      The fact that the double refraction in
a liquid under powerful electromotive forces is very small would
 further show that there is a close approximation to proportionality,
and that the deviation from proportionality would be insensible to any
electrostatic test.   Such conclusions, however, cannot be safely drawn
 in the case of bodies such as castor-oil, in which K±^ts.             In such
 bodies, assuming the electromagnetic theory of light, the yielding to
electromotive force is much greater if the force be applied for such
 time as 10~* second than when applied for 10-u second, and it is
quite possible that the law of proportionality might be untrue in the
former case, but very nearly or quite trne in the latter.

    A   cylindrical lens of continuously varying power has long been a
 desideratum,     and one was constructed and described by Professor
  Stokes, at page 10 of the Report of the British Association for 1849
  (Transactions of the Sections). He points out that
                                                         —
     " If two piano-cylindrical lenses of equal radius, one concave and
 the other convex, be fixed, one in the lid and the other in the body of a
 small round wooden box, with a hole in the top and bottom, so as to be
 as nearly as possible in contact, the lenses will neutralise each other
 when the axes of the surfaces are parallel ; and by merely turning
 the lid round an astigmatic lens may be formed, of a power varying
 continuously from zero to twice the astigmatic power of either lens."
    This very beautiful optical contrivance has the disadvantage that
 the refraction varies from zero in both directions at once, the refraction
 at any given position of the lenses being positive in one meridian, and
 negative or concave to an equal degree in a meridian at right angles to
 the first ; moreover, there is no fixed axis in which the refraction is
either zero or any other constant amount.           It has in consequence
never come into extensive use in the determination of the degree of
astigmatism.       The author has planned a cylindrical lens in which the
axis remains constant in direction and amount of refraction, while the
refraction in the meridian at right angles to this varies continuously.
    A cone may be regarded as a succession of cylinders of different
diameters graduating into one another by exceedingly small steps, so
so that if a short enough portion be considered, its curvatnre at any
point may be regarded as cylindrical.         A lens with one side plane
and the other ground on a conical tool is therefore            a concave
cylindrical lens varying in concavity at different parts according to
the diameter of the cone at the corresponding part.             Two such
lenses mounted with axes parallel and with curvatures varying in
opposite directions produce a compound cylindrical lens, whose refrac
tion in the direction of the axes is zero, and whose refraction in the
meridian at right angles to this is at any point the sum of the refrac
tions of the two lenses. ThiH snm is nearly constant for a con
siderable distance along the axis so long as the same position of the
lenses is maintained.     If the lenses be slid one over the other in the
direction of their axes, this sum changes, and we have a varying
cylindrical lens. The lens is graduated by marking on the frame the
relative position of the lenses when cylindrical lenses of known power
are neutralised.

    It  was fonnd by a practical optician to be impossible to work
 glasses on a cone of large diameter, consequently a conical tool was
 constructed with an angle of 45° at the apex, and 8 inches diameter
 at the  base.
    A glass about 4 inches long was ground on the sides of this near
the base, and as the resulting lens if ground on plane glass would
have been too concave for most purposes, the outer side of the glass
 was previously ground to a convex cylindrical curve, and its axis
applied parallel to the generating line of the cone in the plane of the
axis of the coue.
    The result was concavo-convex cylinders of varying power suitable
for the practical measurement of astigmatism.
    Lenses were exhibited varying from 0 to      - 6DCy, and from 0 to

contraction ; it may be as long as 0'75 sec.

   9. An excited contraction starts from the point excited — from the

   10.  The excited contraction travels from its point of origin, indif

   11. The rate of the wave of contraction measured by the graphic
method varies, according to the temperature and state of the heart,
from 3 to 85 cm. per second.
   12. The velocity is (cceteris paribus) greater in the hearts of large
than in the hearts of small animals.
   13. In spontaneous contractions of the ventricle the movement of
the apex appears to precede that of the base.
   Note. — We have followed the wave of both spontaneous and excited
contraction of the frog's ventricle by the graphic method, and
measured its rate.      The rate is from 40 to 80 mm. per second. In
spontaneous    contraction, the movement of the base precedes that of
the apex.
   14. All parts of the uninjured heart are iso-electric         ; the apex,
however, is often slightly negative to the base.
   15.  The electrical variation of spontaneous contraction is sometimes
diphasic (corresponding to the double variation of the beat of the
frog's heart), sometimes monophasic.
   16. Electrical variations can be detected after visible contractions
have ceased.
   17.  The direction of the electrical current follows no definite rule
in our observations, negativity of apex preceding sometimes negativity
of base, at other times the reverse taking place.
   18. The diphasic variation of excited contractions indicates that
the part stimulated is first negative then positive to other parts.
   19. Under conditions of lowered excitability a weak excitation will
give a monophasic, a strong excitation a diphasic variation.
   20. Towards the close of the period of excitability, the variation of
the excited beat is single.     It is less frequently single at the outset of
experiment.
   21. When excitatory variations can no longer be obtained, injury
will produce a change of electrical state indicating negativity of the
part injured.

                                  (Abstract.)
   The most complete experiments which have been hitherto instituted
 to determine the optical effect of polishing the surface of a trans
                                                   '
parent body are those of Seebeck, described in Poggendorff, Annalen,'
vol. 20, 1830, p. 27 ; vol. 21, 1831, p. 290. Seebeck's method was to
quench, as far as possible, the reflected light with a Nicol, and to
measure the angle of incidence.         It was from a change in the angle
of incidence, i.e., the angle of polarisation, that an alteration of the
state of the surface was inferred.
   This method is open to the objection that the light is not completely
quenched, and, therefore, since the effect of polishing as observed by
Seebeck was not very large, our conclusions as regards the surface
state may be modified.      Besides, the investigation is incomplete, for
the precise change produced in the reflected light by polishing is not
determined.
   The present paper, of which this is an abstract, is an account of
experiments made to determine with greater accuracy the effect of
polishing the surface of a crystal of Iceland spar, and also the exact
alteration produced in the reflected light, i.e., the change in the ratio
of the axes of the ellipse, and in the azimuth of the major axis of
the eliiptically polarised light.
   To effect this, an elliptic analyser, consisting of a Nicol and a
quarter undulation plate, was employed. If r, r be the mean readings
of moveable verniers attached to the Nicol in the two distinct
positions in which the light is extinguished, and R, R' similar
readings of fixed verniers which determine the azimuth of the
quarter plate, then tan nr, the ratio of the axes, and I, the azimuth of
the major axis of the eliiptically polarised light, were calculated from
the formulas —
         cos 2w  = sin  (r'-r) / sin (R'-R)    and I = (R + R')/2.
   Especial care was taken to secure fixity of position in all permanent
parts of the instrument, and in the setting of the face of the crystal,
since a small change was to be detected.
   A first series of experiments was made with light reflected from a
natural face, and with light reflected from the same face when
polished. The polishing was performed by myself, and precautions

  464        On  the  Reflexion of Light from Iceland Spar.       [Dec. 16,
  ¦were taken that the polishing was effected under exactly the same
  conditions. To ensure that the face was polished parallel to itself,
  the inclinations of the face to fixed faces were measured before and
  after polishing.    The mean of about 400 readings was taken with
  each state of the face of the crystal, to obtain as accurate a result as
  possible.
     A second   series  of experiments was instituted with a view to
  determine the accuracy with which the means of each of the previous
  sets of observations could be determined. At the same time, a simple
  analyser, consisting of a Nicol and a graduated circle, was set np
  in addition to the elliptic analyser, with the object of testing the
  conclusions of Sir John Conroy as regards polished surfaces, which are
  given in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society for February, 1886.
                                                    '
  The effect of rotation of the face of the crystal through a small
  angle in its own plane is also discussed.        The observations are
 divided into sets, the means of which are compared with each
 other.
    Lastly, a set of experiments was made with a cleavage face split
 off near the former, and the results of these experiments were com
 pared with those of the first series made some fifteen             months
 previously.
    The results of the experiments are embodied in tables, from which
 the following numerical results are extracted.       I' in the case of the
 simple analyser corresponds to I for the elliptic analyser.
    The general conclusions of the paper are as follows : —
    The process of polishing the surface of a crystal of Iceland spar
 with emery and rouge does most certainly alter the state of the
 surface.   This alteration is evinced by a change both in the ratio of
 the axes and in the azimuth of the major axis of the elliptically
 polarised light. Such an alteration was observed in the case of two
 different crystals which were made the subject of experiment.
    The light reflected is shown to be exceedingly nearly plane
 polarised, so that the absolute amount of change in the ratio of the
 axes is small ; but the relative change is considerable, for tan w is
 changed from 0"0334 to 0-0252.      The change in the azimuth of the
 major axis is not very large.       As regards disturbing causes, it is
proved that moderate changes of temperature do not cause any very
 perceptible alteration in the surface state.  The experiments prove a
 result unnoticed by Seebeck, that an emery-rouge polished surface
gives perfectly concordant results on repolishing, and in this respect
is quite as satisfactory as the chalk-polished surface that Seebeck
recommends.      And in general the results of the paper tend to confirm
the views of Seebeck rather than those of Sir J. Conroy, for Seebeck
in his paper prefers polished surfaces because of the liability of the
natural surface to tarnish.

   In   this paper the author continues his account of the properties of
phyllocyanin, one of the products of the action of acids on chloro
phyll. He shows that by passing a current of CO> through an
alcoholic solution of phyllocyanin holding oxide of zinc in suspension,
a compound is obtained containing zinc and carbonic acid, a phyllo
cyanin zinc carbonate resembling phyllocyanin zinc acetate, but that
no analogous componnds containing iron or copper are formed in this
way. Attention is directed to the points of resemblance between the
double compounds of phyllocyanin containing ziuc and chlorophyll
itself, particularly as regards their susceptibility to change when
exposed to the action of air and light, and it is shown that while

these compounds       when in solution lose their colour almost as rapidly
as chlorophyll itself, those containing copper are remarkably stable,
since their solutions may bo exposed for many weeks to light and air
without undergoing any apparent change.
    The products derived from phyllocyanin by reduction are next
described.      The action of tin and hydrochloric acid on phyllocyanin
passes through two distinct stages.               During the first stage a colour
ing matter is formed which is remarkable from its solutions showing
no less than eight absorption bands.              The product formed during the
next stage of the process is interesting from its yielding solutions of a
bright red colour without any tinge of green, and from its resembling
in some respects the colouring matters of red flowers.

    The processes of the germination of the seed have been in recent
 years investigated by v. Gorup-Besanez, who in a series of papers
written in 1874 and 1875,* has stated that the changes in the reserve
proteid materials are probably due to the action of a proteolytic
ferment, as from the seeds of the vetch, hemp, flax, and barley plants
he was able to extract a body which converted fibrin into peptone.
Later, in 1878, Krauchf disputed v. Gorup-Besanez's conclusions,
and claimed that his results were erroneous on account of imperfeefc
methods of working.              As v. Gorup-Besanez based his statement
partly on the detection of peptone by the biuret test after the
digestion had gone on for some time, and partly on a diminution of
the fibrin, Krauch explained his results by saying that the digestive
extract itself gave a biuret reaction, and that the diminution of the
fibrin was only due to a shrinkage of its flocks.
    During the past year I have been carrying out a series of
experiments bearing upon this disputed point, and have succeeded in
 demonstrating in the seeds of the lupin (Lupinus hirsutut) the
existence of such a ferment as v. Gorup-Besanez stated to be present,
and in ascertaining some particulars as to its condition in the resting
 seed, the nature and conditions of its action, and the changes which

it brings about not only in the course of its action on fibrin, but also
on the aleurone or proteid reserve material in the seed itself.
   The method which      I  used in the investigation was somewhat
different from that of v. Gorup-Besanez.       As Krauch claimed that
the biuret reaction obtained was due to some proteid in the digestive
extract used, and as the vegetable peptones found in the seed of the
lupin do not dialyse, while true peptone does so readily, I carried on
my digestions always in carefully tested tubes of dialysing paper, so
that the fluid outside the latter might enable me to see if peptone
were really formed or no.
   Seeds of Lupinus were germinated for about a week, till they had
protruded a radicle of about 1£ inch in length ; they then gave an acid
reaction to litmus-paper.     They were divested of their coats, the
radicles removed, and the cotyledons ground. The resulting powder
 was extracted with glycerine, and the extract dialysed till no trace of
any crystalline bodies that had been formed during the germination
could be detected in the dialysate. No trace of peptone or other
body giving a biuret reaction passed the dialyser, even after a week's
exposure. The extract was then acidified with HC1 to the extent of
0"2 per cent., put into a fresh dialyser, some swollen-up boiled fibrin
added, and the dialyser put into a beaker and surrounded with 0'2
per cent. HC1.     It was then left at a temperature of 40° C. Control
experiments, some with boiled digestive extract, some with 0-2 per
cent. HC1 only, were carried out side by side with the others.        •
   The process of digestion was very slow, the time taken up being
very much more prolonged than is the case with the gastric or
pancreatic ferments.    After some time, however, the dialysate in the
beaker containing the tube in which the unboiled extract of the
cotyledons had been placed gave a very marked biuret reaction, and
after concentration it deposited crystals of leucin. The other dia-
lysates contained no peptone or crystalline body.
   I repeated the experiments many times with varying quantities of
the extract of the cotyledons and with varying amounts of fibrin,
                 I
and in all cases was able to see that a proteolytic ferment was present
in the germinating seed, and that it formed not only peptone but
leucin, behaving like pancreatic rather than gastric juice. In this
latter particular I am somewhat at variance with v. Gorup-Besanez,
who says he was not able to see that the decomposition of the fibrin
proceeded beyond the stage of peptone.
   Further investigations into the condition of the action of the
ferment showed that it worked best in a medium acidified to the
extent of 02 per cent. HC1 : that the temperature most favourable for
its working was 37 —40° C., that its activity was somewhat impeded
by the presence of excess of neutral salts, and that it was speedily
destroyed by contact with alkalis, even to the extent of 1 per cent.

    In    the resting seed the ferment exists in the form of a zymogen, as
is the case with those of the stomach and other digestive organs.
This is. however, very readily converted into the active ferment by
contact with dilute acids.           The point was somewhat difficult of proof,
but was ascertained by a modification of the method adopted by
Langley and Edkins* in their work on the condition of the ferment in
the gastric glands.             From this paper it appears that while both
alkalis and COj destroy both the ferment and the zymogen, the latter
is much more easily affected by COj than the former.                  I found this
to be the case with the extracts of the seeds.             After a stream of COj
had been passed through them, treatment with acid failed to make
them active, though the acid soon developed ferment-power in
extracts not treated with the gas. The reaction of the resting seeds
was neutral.
    The proteids existing in the seeds of Lupinus have been ascertained
by Vinesf to consist of hemialbumose and globulin.                I prepared from
a quantity of the resting seeds a considerable bulk of these by the
methods Vines describes, and submitted them in a state of fair purity
to the action of the ferment. The outcome of a long series of experi
ments so carried out was that the proteids of the seeds were changed
by the ferment in much the same way as fibrin. There was soon a
quantity of parapeptone formed, which was soluble readily in weak
acids or alkalis.         This was followed or accompanied by the appear
ance of peptone, and later, leucin and asparagin were formed.                  The
latter bodies were obtained in some quantity by the method described
by v. Gorup-BesanezJ for the separation of leucin from other bodies
in the fluids in which it is found.
    This course of digestion of the seed proteids was confirmed by
examination of the seeds at different stages in their natural germina
tion. In those which were just starting, parapeptone in quantity was
present in the germinating cotyledons ; a little later abundance of
peptone was found.            In no case was peptone found in the radicles, but
from these plenty of asparagin was easily obtainable.
   Besides the biuret test for the peptone a more delicate one was
generally used, which has been described by many writers.                        It
consists in freeing the solution from all other proteids by boiling with
freshly prepared ferric acetate and then adding to it acetic acid and
phoephotnngstate of soda.             Peptone is then precipitated.
    The conclusions which seem to follow from the whole course of the
experiments        are : —

    The instruments allotted to me consisted of the coronagraph and
 the prismatic camera; the two instruments being mounted on the
 same equatorial stand.
    The prismatic camera is the same instrument which was used at
 the eclipses of 1882 and 1884. It consists of an ordinary photo
 graphic camera with a 60° prism placed in front of the lens.
    The coronagraph consists of a reflecting telescope arranged for
 obtaining photographic records, and in which special precautions are
 taken to avoid internally reflected light.
    This instrument was designed by Dr. Huggins, with the idea that
 it might be possible to obtain photographs of the corona in sunlight,
 that is at other times than at eclipses, and   I was especially directed
 to test the practicability of this method.    The test could be applied
 in two ways   : —
    1st. By obtaining photographs shortly before or after the eclipse,
 and comparing any irregularity that might appear in the halo round
 the sun with any photographs of the corona taken during totality ; a
 similarity of form indicating that the corona had been photographed.
    2nd. To take photographs during partial eclipse.          Then if the
 light of the corona produces any effect    on the plate, the limb of the
 moon should be visible against it.

between the form of the corona as obtained on these plates, and the
form of the true corona as obtained during the total eclipse.
   During totality   I  had intended to carry out the following pro
gramme :  —  During the first minute a photograph was to be taken with
the prismatic camera.      After that four plates were to be exposed
with the coronagraph with the same length of exposure as that given
during sunlight.    The exposure was given automatically by means of
a shutter, with an estimated length of between one-tenth and one-fifth
of a second.   Besides these, two photographs were to be taken with
exposures of five and ten seconds respectively.
   The programme could not be carried out exactly.            Immediately
after I had commenced exposing the prismatic camera, 1 looked up,
and found that the corona was covered by a light cloud.            The sky
became clear again in about fifty seconds.      I  was anxious not to take
any other photographs at the same time for fear of vibration ; but as
nearly a minute had been lost something had to be sacrificed, and          I
decided to take some of the photographs with the coronagraph before
putting the cap on the prismatic camera.         I  do not think that the
work has suffered in consequence, and at all events I obtained all the
plates I had intended to. As to the results,   I   am not yet in a position
to fully report on them.
   The photograph obtained with the prismatic camera shows several
images of the prominences, and it therefore gives every promise of
yielding good results when measured and examined.
   The five and ten second photographs of the corona show signs of a
slight vibration, but they will be useful for the inner part of the
corona.   As my main object was to obtain instantaneous photographs,
these long exposure plates had to be obtained by working the auto
matic shutter by hand ; it was this probably that caused the vibration.
   The instantaneous photographs of the corona when developed were
complete blanks, proving that the exposure was too short. It should,
however, be observed that this does not prove that the light of the
corona was insufficient to cause an appreciable effect on the plate if
combined with other light.      More light energy is necessary to start
photographic action than is required to produce a visible difference
of shade when once the action is started.
   Many of the photographs taken during partial eclipse show what
may be described as a false corona, that is, an increase of density near
the snn and between the cusps, or in
                                        front of the moon. In none of
them can the moon be seen eclipsing the corona.
   The results, therefore, are adverse to the possibility of obtaining
                                                              I
photographs of the corona in sunlight ; it is, however, consider by
no means proved that the method is
                                       impossible. But at present am  I

inclined to consider that the result tends to show that a practical
method of obtaining photographic records of the corona during sun
light is not likely to be obtained. The trial was not conclusive
because the conditions were very unfavourable. In order to reduce
the air-glare to a minimum, so that the light of the corona shall not
be overpowered, the following points must be observed : —
    1st. The air should be clear and dry.
    2nd. The sun should be near the zenith.
    3rd. The station should be at a considerable elevation above the
sea.
    4th. The corona, if it does vary in intensity, should be at its
 maximum brightness.
    Now every one of these conditions was unfavourable. The air was
 saturated with moisture, the sky was of a hazy blue, the sun was
 low, the station was near the sea-level, and the corona according to
 the general impression was not so bright as on other occasions.
    I  hope, however, to deal more fully with the considerations on
 another occasion.

     OBITUARY NOTICES OF FELLOWS DECEASED.
   James   Apjohn, M.D., was Professor of Chemistry in the University
of Dublin from 1850 to 1875. He died on the 2nd of Jnne, 1886, at
Southill, Blackrock, co. Dublin, in his 91st year.      Dr. Apjohn was
born at Sunville, co. Limerick, on the 1st of September, 1796, and,
having received his elementary education at the Tipperary Grammar
School, he entered Dublin University in 1814. After a distinguished
undergraduate course, he took his Arts degree in 1817, and in 1821
obtained the M.B. Sixteen years later he proceeded to the M.D.
degree.    Apjohn's love for experimental science seems to have been
kindled during his medical studies, and after graduating he devoted
himself almost exclusively to the pursuit of chemistry and physics.
About 1824 several eminent physicians and surgeons — including
Groves, Marsh, Jacob, and Cusack — decided to establish a new
medical school at Parke Street, in Dublin, and in the following
year Apjohn joined the staff of the new school as lecturer in
chemistry.     Here he acquired considerable reputation as a lecturer,
and three years later he was transferred to the newly-established
Chair of Chemistry in the College of Surgeons' School, which he held
until 1850, when he was appointed to the University Chair of Che
mistry on the death of Dr. Francis Barker. Apjohn's official con
nexion with the University began, however, in 1841. About that
time the Board of Trinity College founded an Engineering School,
and appointed     Apjohn to the Chair of Applied Chemistry and
Mineralogy   — an office which he continued to hold when he succeeded
Barker in 1850. On Dr. Apjohn's retirement from professorial work,
Mineralogy was transferred to the Chair of Geology in the University,
and Applied Chemistry was permanently attached to the Chair of
Chemistry.
   The principal scientific work of Dr. Apjohn was rather physical
than chemical. The general study of hygrometry had a special
attraction for him, and of the forty-nine scientific papers named in the
Boyal Society's Catalogue, a large proportion relates to that subject.
In the course of his work on the theory of the wet bulb hygrometer,
he arrived at the expression well known as " Apjohn's Formula" for
ascertaining the dew point.
   The study of hygrometry led to much interesting work on the
specific heat of gases, and in 1837 Apjohn received the Cunningham
   VOL. xli.                                                    b

                                    ii
Medal from the Irish Academy for his paper " Upon a New Method
of Investigating the Specific Heats of the Gases."     The method con
sisted in noting the fall in temperature suffered by the wet bulb
thermometer when immersed in the perfectly dry gas, whose specific
heat was required.     From 1838 onwards Dr. Apjohn devoted less
attention to physical work than to mineralogical chemistry. He was
a frequent contributor to the literature of the latter subject.       In
1838 he analysed and described      a  mineral  from Algoa Bay,   South
Africa, which proved to be a somewhat effloresced manganese alum,
which has since been named "Apjohnite." In 1840 he described a
mineral found at Kilbricken, co. Clare, which is closely related to
geocronite, but is non -arsenical.  Again, in 1852 he was concerned in
the description, under the name of " Jellettite," of a yellowish- green
garnet found near Zermatt, Monte Rosa, by Dr. Jellett, the present
Provost of Trinity College.      Papers on the relations of pyrope, of
pennine, and on Mexican hyalite are also to be found amongst his
contributions to mineralogy.
   Dr. Apjohn contributed to the "Cyclopaedia of Practical Medicine"
the articles on electricity, galvanism, toxicology, and spontaneous
combustion, and it is stated that the latter article supplied Dickens
with the facts on which he founded his account of Krook's death in
" Bleak House."
   As the representative of the University of Dublin in the General
Medical Council, Dr. Apjohn took a prominent part in the production
of the "British Pharmacopoeia."     Almost every chemical process and
test described in the first edition of the "Pharmacopoeia" was care
fully examined in the Trinity College Laboratory, and much of the
success of the work was due to Apjohn's laborious revision in detail.
   He was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1853 ; he
was a Vice-President of the Royal Irish Academy ; and at the time
of his death was second on the roll of Fellows of the King and
Queen's College of Physicians.
   Dr. Apjohn was widely esteemed throughout his long life as a
thorough and earnest worker, a singularly lucid and able lectnrer,
and an upright and honourable man.
                                                             J. E. R.
   William Benjamin Carpenter was born at Exeter in 1813, and was
the fourth child and eldest son of Dr. Lant Carpenter, a Unitarian
minister. His sister, Mary Carpenter, who died a few years since,
achieved the most important work as a philanthropist, in relation to
the treatment of prisoners and to questions affecting our Indian
fellow-subjects, and will be remembered by future generations with no
less gratitude than her brother.
   In his childhood Dr. Carpenter      received  an excellent education,

                                      iii
comprising both classics and the principles of physical science, at the
school established by his father at Bristol, and it was his intention to
adopt the profession of a civil engineer. He was, however, persuaded
to accept the opportunity offered by a medical practitioner, Mr. Estlin,
of Bristol, and to enter on the study of medicine as apprentice to that
gentleman.       Shortly after this he was sent, as companion to one of
Mr. Estlin's patients, to the West Indies, and on his return from this
visit he entered, at the age of twenty, the medical classes of University
College, London.       After passing the examinations of the College of
Surgeons and the Apothecaries' Society he proceeded to Edinburgh,
where he graduated as M.D. in 1839.
    His graduation thesis on "The Physiological Inferences to be
deduced from the Structure of the Nervous System of Invertebrated
Animals" excited considerable attention, especially on account of the
views which he advanced as to the reflex function of the ganglia of
the ventral cord of Arthropoda.
    From the first Dr. Carpenter's work showed the tendency of his
mind to seek for large generalisations and the development of philo
 sophical principles. He was a natural philosopher in the widest sense
 of the term —one who was equally familiar with the fundamental
 doctrines of physics and with the phenomena of the concrete sciences
 of astronomy, geology, and biology. It was his aim, by the use of the
 widest range of knowledge of the facts of Nature, to arrive at a general
 conception of these phenomena as the outcome of uniform and all-
 pervading laws. His interest in the study of living things was not
 therefore primarily that of the artist and poet so much as that of the
 philosopher, and it is remarkable that this interest should have carried
 him, as it did, into minute and elaborate investigations of form and
 structure. Although some of his scientific memoirs are among the most
 beautifully illustrated works which have been published by any natural
 ist, yet it is noteworthy that he himself was not a draughtsman, but
 invariably employed highly skilled artists to prepare his illustrations
 for him. Yet we cannot doubt that the man who, with his dominant
 mental tendency to far-reaching speculations, yet gave to the world
 the minute and ingenious analysis of the beautiful structure of the
 shells of Foraminifera, had an artist's love of form, and that the part
 of his life's work (for it was only a part among the abundant results
 of his extraordinary energy) which was devoted to the sea and the
 investigation of some of its fascinating living contents, was thus
 directed by a true love of Nature in which ulterior philosophy had no
 share.
     Two books, Dr. Carpenter has told us, exerted great influence over
 his mind in his student days : they were Sir John Herschel's
                                                                     " Dis
  course on the Study of Natural Philosophy" and Lyell's      " Principles
  of Geology"   — that great book to which we owe the even greater books

                                      iv
of Charles Darwin.        Taking the "Principles" in some way as bis
model, Dr. Carpenter produced in 1839 his first systematic work,
under the title " Principles of General and Comparative Physiology,
intended as an Introduction to the Study of Human Physiology and
as a guide to the Philosophical Pursuit of Natural History."       Admir
able as was the execution of this work in many ways, its great merit
lay in the conception of its scope. It was in fact the first attempt to
                                                         " Biology " in an
recognise and lay down the lines of a science of
educational     form.    Carpenter's "Comparative Physiology" is the
general   or elementary
                           " Biology " of the present day— traced neces
sarily upon the less secure foundations which the era of its production
permitted, viz., one year only subsequent to the date of Schwann's
immortal " Microscopical Researches."
    For five years Dr. Carpenter remained in Bristol, commencing'
medical practice and marrying in 1840 ; but in 1844, feeling a distaste
for the profession of medicine, he moved to London in order to devote
himself entirely to a literary and scientific career. He was encouraged
to take this step by the success which his " Comparative Physiology
                                                                          "
obtained, a second edition having been called for within two years of
the publication of the first. He was appointed Fullerian Professor of
Physiology in the Royal Institution during his first year in London,
and Professor and Lecturer at University College and at the London
Hospital, whilst he was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.
   In 1851 Dr. Carpenter became Principal of University Hall, the
residential institution attached to University College, where he
remained until 1859.       During this period he remodelled his treatise
on Physiology, issuing the more general biological portion as "Com
parative Physiology," whilst that portion dealing with the special
physiology of man and the higher animals appeared as his well-known
" Human
            Physiology," which subsequently ran through many editions.
The " Human Physiology " is remarkable in the first place for the
chapters on the physiology of the nervous system, and especially for
 the theories enunciated with regard to the relations of mind and brain,
 and the attempt to assign particular activities to particular portions of
 the cerebral structure.    In arriving at his conclusions Dr. Carpenter
 had to depend on arguments drawn from the facts of comparative
 anatomy and of diseased or abnormal conditions in man.         There is no
 doubt at the present day of the acuteness which he displayed in his
 treatment of the subject, and of the truth in a general way of the
 results which he formulated.         Experiment and a wider range of
 observation have to some extent corrected — but on the whole rather ex
 tended and confirmed — the doctrinesof the early editions of the "Human
              "
 Physiology      in regard to this subject, so that he was able only a few
 years since to separate this portion of the work and issue it as a
 separate book, the " Mental Physiology," in which is contained by far

                                      'V
the most complete, consistent, and readable account of the phenomena
of    mind, and their relation to the actual structure of the brain, which
exists.     Such topics as Instinct, Mesmerism, Somnambulism, Uncon
scious Cerebration (his own phrase), &c., are discussed in a masterly
"way, and with an abundance of illustration and knowledge which
renders the work one of the greatest value even to those who may
 differ here and there from its theoretical conclusions.
     About the period of his removal to London Dr. Carpenter began to
occupy himself with the minute study of the structure of the calca
reous shells of the Mollusca — being led thereto by a desire to compare
 the results of the operation of living matter upon distinctly mineral
 compounds (such as carbonate of lime), by way of comparison and in
 illustration of the rapidly accumulating knowledge of cell-structure iu
 the softer parts of living things.    This study, which resulted directly
 in some valuable contributions to our knowledge of the structure of
 shells, shown by these researches to be far more complex than had
 hitherto been supposed, led on the one hand to Dr. Carpenter's perma
 nent identification with the pursuit of research with the microscope,
 and on the other hand to those admirable investigations of the struc
 ture and law of growth of the shells of the minute Protozoic Foramin-
 ifera which constitute his most weighty contribution to the special
 literature of science.      His microscopic studies bore fruit in the
 publication of
                   " The Microscope and its Revelations," the sixth
 edition of which was issued in 1881. The studies on the shells of
  Foraminifera were continued throughout his life, being published in
 four memoirs in the " Philosophical Transactions," and in a richly
 illustrated monograph produced by the Ray Society in 1862, whilst
                                                                "
  the last of his memoirs in the " Philosophical Transactions was that
  on Orbitolites bearing date so late as 1882. It was on this subject
 that Dr. Carpenter was busy at the time of his death, having during
  the past few years accumulated a wealth of material and drawings in
  support of his contention that the Eozoon canadeiise discovered by
  Logan in the Laureutian rocks of Canada exhibits the distinctive
  structure of the shell-substance of the higher Foraminifera.        The
  material relating to Eozoon has been placed by Dr. Carpenter's
  executors in the hands of Mr. Rupert Jones, who has undertaken to
  prepare it for publication.
     At the age of forty (1853), what with his larger and smaller books,
  his original researches, his lectures on medical jurisprudence at
  University College, and numerous popular lectures on scientific topics,
  Dr. Carpenter's life was unusually laborious and productive.
     In 1856 he was appointed Registrar of the University of London,
  and for twenty-three years administered the onerous duties of that
  office in such a way as to contribute in no small degree to the success
  of the University, and above all to the maintenance of the high
                                                                b 2

character of its degrees and the ample recognition of the study of
natural science for which the University is now distinguished.
    He was able now to give a larger amount of time than formerly to
his original investigations, and, in his summer holidays at Arran and
elsewhere, commenced, amongst other studies, those researches on the
structure and development of the beautiful little feather-star, which
were from time to time published in the
                                           " Philosophical Transaction*,"
and    led to his association   with Wyville Thomson, and thus to the
deep-sea explorations of the
                                  " Lightning," and subsequently of the
" Challenger."
    Carpenter's memoirs on Comatula give a very full and beautifully
illustrated account of the structure of the skeleton of the feather-star,
but for many years the view which he entertained with regard to the
nature of the axial cord which runs through the segments of the arm-
skeleton of that animal was regarded by all other observers (with
scarcely an exception) as erroneous.      Dr. Carpenter considered these
cords as nerve-cords, and in the Easter vacation of 1876 he made a
special visit to the marine laboratory erected by Dr. Dohrn at Naples,
in order to test his views by the repetition, on an extensive scale, of
experiments which had already appeared convincing to his mind.
These experiments, and others since carried out by younger natural
ists, have at length fairly established the view for the truth of which
the veteran observer had long contended.
    In December, 1875, Dr. Carpenter had communicated to the Royal
Society the outlines of his work on the soft parts of Antedon (Coma
tula) rosacea, and on returning from Naples he communicated a
supplemental note to the Society on the subject of the nervous system
of that animal ("Roy. Soc. Proc," vol. 24, 1876, p. 451).          He lived
to see his conclusions, first formulated in 1865 (" Phil. Trans.," vol. 156,
p. 705), fully confirmed by the experiments of Marshall (" Quart.
Journ. Micro. Sci.," vol. 24, 1884) and by those of Jickeli of Jena
 (" Zool. Anzeiger," No. 170,1884). Important evidence in favour of
these conclusions was also furnished by the anatomical investigations
of Dr. P. Herbert Carpenter on the allied genus Actinometra ("Journal
of Anatomy and Physiology," 1876).         M. Ed. Perrier of Paris, who
had strenuously opposed Dr. Carpenter's conclusions, was thus led to
renewed observations and to a complete acceptance of their correct
ness (" Comptes Rendus," July, 1883, p. 187), whilst the most care
ful student of Echinoderm anatomy among German zoologists, viz.,
Dr. Ludwig, who had also previously opposed these conclusions, has
now endorsed them.        Thus in the " Roy. Soc. Proc," vol. 37, 1884,
 p. 67, Dr. Carpenter was able to give a complete history of the
 question, showing how the opposition on theoretical grounds to the
 view that the axial cords of Comatula were nerve-cords, had gradually
 given way before an appeal to observation and experiment.              Thw

                                    vii
 record of the final triumph of the view which he had originated
 and   so long laboured    to establish was the last scientific paper
 published by Dr. Carpenter.
    The deep-sea explorations -which Dr. Carpenter, assisted by Pro
 fessor Wyville Thomson, arranged, and for which he succeeded in
 obtaining the aid of ships of the Royal Navy, were designed not
 merely to search for organisms in the great depths of the ocean, but
 especially to study the ocean currents both deep and superficial, Dr.
 Carpenter having a strong desire to enter upon the explanation of the
 great physical phenomena presented by the ocean.       He himself took
 part in the earlier expeditions in 1868 and subsequent years, and
 though unable to leave the ties which bound him to home, so as to
 join the " Challenger " Expedition, yet he closely watched the results
 then obtained, and embodied the whole of his observations, and those
 reported from the " Challenger," in some extremely suggestive and
 important memoirs and lectures on ocean circulation. These are as
follows: — Reports in the "Proceedings of the Royal Society" on
 the several cruises of the "Lightning" ("Roy. Soc. Proc.," 1868),
 "Porcupine" (ibid., 1869-70), "Shearwater" (ibid., 1871), and
 "Valorous" (ibid., 1875); a series of memoirs in the "Roy.
 Geograph. Soc. Proc.," 1871, 1874, 1875, 1877 ; lectures delivered to
and printed by the Royal Institution of London and the United
Service Institution ; articles in the " Contemporary and the " Nine
                                                      "
teenth Century" Reviews.
    The more general philosophical views held by Dr. Carpenter, and
his conceptions in regard to those topics where science touches
religion, may be gathered from a series of articles published by him
in the "Modern Review" during the years 1880-84, the titles of
which are as follows : — " The Force behind Nature," " Nature and       ,
Law," " Charles Darwin ; his Life and Work,"' " The Doctrine of
 Evolution and its Relations to Theism," " The Argument from Design
in the Organic World."
    In 1879 he retired from the Registrarship of the University of
London with a well-earned pension, and was at once chosen as a
member of the Senate of that body.       He now devoted himself with
unabated vigour to the prosecution of his studies on Foraminifera and
on Comatula, and to more theoretical matters, such as ocean-currents,
and the explanation of the frauds of spirit-mediums. Though released
from the duties of office, he was still a constant attendant at the
Senate of the University, he rarely missed a meeting of the Royal
Society or one of the annual gatherings of the British Association,
and, besides undertaking the administration of the Gilchrist Trust,
delivered many lectures in all parts of the country himself — both
independently and as an emissary of the trustees.       The scheme of
lectures and scholarships instituted by the Gilchrist trustees, which

                                    viii
 is effecting important educational results in natural science among
 classes of society excluded from regular University teaching, is Dr.
 Carpenter's work. He wrote at this time in the interest of the public
 health some admirable articles on vaccination, as in earlier life (1849)
 he had from a similar point of view treated the subject of alcoholic
 liquors, and had urged the arguments for total abstinence.           When
 past seventy years of age he did not shrink from a journey to the
 United States, where he spoke and lectured with unflagging vigour.
 The last public movement in which he took an active part was the
foundation of the Marine Biological Association, of which he was a
Vice-President, and which is about to carry out, by means of its
 laboratory ou Plymouth Sound, a suggestion which is traceable to his
own proposition for the thorough exploration and study of Milford
Haven.
    The abundant and noble achievements of Dr. Carpenter's public and
scientific career did not pass without recognition in the form of awards
and titles.    He received in 1861 one of the Royal medals awarded by
the Council of the Royal Society, and in 1883 the Lyell medal of the
Geological Society. In 1871 he was made an honorary LL.D. of the
University of Edinburgh, and in 1872 he was President of the British
Association for the Advancement of Science when it met at Brighton.
In 1873 he was elected Corresponding Member of the Institute of
France, and on his retirement from his official position at the Univer
sity of London in 1879 he was nominated C.B.
    It is impossible to do justice to Dr. Carpenter's character as a
scientific man in a few lines: here no attempt has been made to do
more than indicate in something like chronological order and con
nexion of subjects the vast amount of work which he accomplished.
    Upon the present writer, whose father was his fellow-student at
University College, and who has enjoyed since boyhood the privilege
of his friendship, Dr. Carpenter always produced the most vivid
impression of a man of indomitable energy, who had accepted as the
highest duty and keenest delight of his life the promotion, whether by
advocacy or by research, of true knowledge.      The tenacity and vigour
with which he was wont to expound his views on such matters of
research as at the time occupied his thoughts, and the importance and
respect which he assigned to all genuine research, were evidences of
an earnest and just nature which evoked sympathy and esteem in all
men of kindred pursuits.
    In reference to Dr. Carpenter's private life and tastes, the following
extract from a weekly journal states, with the authority of a member
of his own family, what might, in its absence, have been here less
completely indicated.     The journal to which we are thus indebted is
an organ of the Unitarian Church, of which body Dr. Carpenter was,
throughout life, an active and orthodox member, a fact which may or

                                      ix
may      not be brought into connexion with the fact of his incomplete      -
acceptance of the leading doctrines of Darwinism.
     " He was well versed in literature, and turned for refreshment in
hours of weariness to his favourite Scott. Political memoirs of his
own time wore read with the keenest relish, for he had early learned
from his father, Dr. Lant Carpenter, to take a high view of a citizen's
obligations, and the Bristol riots, which he had witnessed, made a
life-long impression upon him. A brief sojourn in Italy called forth
a susceptibility to the enjoyment of art which was a surprise even to
himself ; and in music, from the time that he had taught himself as a
young man to play on the organ, he fonnd unfailing recreation.
Mature, likewise, in her vaster as well as her microscopic forms, was
for him full of charm and delight, and from every excursion he carried
back memories which remained singularly vivid and distinct. In
society his immense stores of information, his sympathetic interest in
others, his thorough enjoyment of humour though he felt unable to
 originate it, made him a genial and ever-welcome companion, while
 his friends learned how strong a confidence might be placed in his
 faithfulness.   Many young men found unexpected help and encourage
 ment   in him, and  he rejoiced when he could open a way to those who
 were involved in the struggles through which he had himself once
 passed.    The dominant conception of his life — as was fitting in one
 of Puritan descent — was that of duty. And if this sometimes took
 austere forms, and led him to frame expectations which others could
 not always satisfy, an enlarging experience mellowed his judgment
 and enabled him to apprehend their position from their point as well
 as his own.    Released from the pressure and strain of earlier life, he
 was able to give freer play to his rich affections ; and in his own
 family they only know what they have lost who will never again on
 earth feel his support as husband and father, brother and friend."

    William Willoughby Cole, third Earl of Enniskillen,           was born
 on the 25th of January, 1807, succeeded to the title and estates in
 March, 1840, and died at Florence Court, co. Fermanagh, on Friday,
 the 12th of November, 1886, after only a few days'      illness.    He sat
 as Baron Grinstead in the House of Lords.
    Lord Enniskillen was educated at Harrow and at Christ Church,
 Oxford, but never graduated.      While at Oxford he devoted much
 time and attention to Geology and Palaeontology, assiduously attending
 the lectures delivered by the Rev. Dr. Buckland.
    In conjunction with the late Sir Philip de Malpas Grey Egerton,
 his friend and college companion, Lord Enniskillen commenced
 collecting organic remains in the neighbourhood of Oxford and
 other parts of the British Islands ; together they ultimately succeeded
                                                                    c

                                       X
  in obtaining a most extensive, complete and valuable collection of
  Fossil Fishes ; probably the largest in the world. From that period
  nntil the death of Sir Philip Egerton they were joint collectors,
  scrupulously dividing their acquisitions, and that so industriously,
  that nearly the same species occurred in each cabinet ; it was owing
  to this union of partnership that the two collections were so inti
  mately interwoven, and for the interest of Ichthyic Palaeontology
  inseparable; hence their subsequent possession by the nation, and
  united preservation in the galleries of the British Museum of Natural
  History, Cromwell Road.
    Three years previous to Lord Enniskillen's doath (1883), that
  portion contained in the Florence Court Collection was purchased by
 the trustees of the British Museum, through a special grant from the
  Treasury.
    Lord Enniskillen* and Sir Philip Egerton, after leaving Oxford,
 travelled through much of Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, solely for
 the purpose of studying and collecting one group of the Vertebrata,
 and to this large division of the animal kingdom they appear always
 to have restricted their researches ; their continental journey was
 also undertaken to still more perfect their knowledge of stratigra-
 phical Geology, in connexion with their palteontologioal researches;
 how completely this was continued, and carried on until both onr
 distinguished Fellows were removed by death, is fully exemplified by
 the union of the two grant collections — or that of Florence Court and
 that of Oulton Park— now arranged together in the galleries of the
 British Museum of Natural History.
    Lord Enniskillen also particularly examined the caves of Germany,
 Belgium, &c., obtaining from Gailenreuth, Kuhloch, and Engis, a rich
series of bones illustrating       the remains of extinct Mammalia,
especially those of the lion, mammoth, rhinoceros, hyaena, and rein
deer.
    At home and abroad every locality and geological horizon 3"ielding
the remains of fish attracted Lord Enniskillen's attention, who never
failed to secure every good as well as new form for his Florence Court
 Collection, duplicates whenever they occurred being also added to the
Oulton Park Museum by Sir Philip Egerton.
    This dual possession and study of Fossil Ichthyology arose through
their intimate acquaintance       in 1830 and subsequent years with
Agassiz, who impressed upon them the importance of confining them
selves to one line or branch of research ; the result of which has been
the formation of these two unrivalled collections of Fossil Fish, the
history of which, through the works of Agassiz and Sir Philip
Egerton, has greatly enriched the literature of this extensive division
in Zoology, especially as regards structure and
                                                   distribution.

                             Xlieu Viscount Cole.

   Lord Enniskillen never published any particulars of, or described
any species of Fossil Fishes, bat the Florence Court MS. catalogue
was kept with the most scrupulous care, every specimen being
recorded with all details essential to the zoological position, strati-
graphical and geographical history of the species in so great a
collection; and this was carried out in every detail.
   This applied not only to the Florence Court catalogue, but also to
the almost duplicate volume of the Oulton Park Collection, kept witli
the same care by Sir Philip Egerton; so that the enumeration of
species contained in one, without reference to the other, would be
incomplete and unsatisfactory.
    Lord Enniskillen     paid considerable    attention to Archaeology,
especially that relating to Ireland, and was one of the first to call
attention to the lake dwellings in that country.
    Lord Enniskillen's public services were great, as also indeed had
been those of the long line of his ancestors through nine generations,
ever since their settlement in Ireland in the year 1612. He sat as
M.P. for Fermanagh from the year 1831 to 1840 ; was Colonel of the
 Fermanagh Militia from 1834 to 1875, and Hon. Colonel from 1875,
and for more than fifty years leading member of the Orange Society,
 Grand Master of the County of Fermanagh, Grand Master of Ireland,
and Imperial Grand Master. He was also one of the Trustees of the
 Hnnterian Museum.        He received the honorary degree of D.C.L.
from the University of Oxford, and that of LL.D. from the University
 of Dublin and the University of Durham.
    Lord Enniskillen was elected F.R.S. in the year 1829, and was
 thus a Fellow of our Society for fif ty-seven years.
                                                                R. E.
    Thomas Andrews was born at Belfast on the 19th December,       1813.
 His father was a linen merchant in good position.      He received his
 early education at the Belfast Academy and, at the Royal Academical
 Institution of Belfast.   He then went to Glasgow to study chemistry
 under Professor Thomas Thomson, whose laboratory was then one of
 the very few places in this country where systematic instruction in
 real chemistry was regularly given to students.       He continued his
 studies in Trinity College, Dublin, where he distinguished himself
 both in Science and in Classics ; and, after spending some time in
 Dumas' laboratory in Paris, went to Edinburgh, where he took the
 degree of Doctor of Medicine in 1835.         Returning to Belfast, he
 devoted himself to the practice of medicine, in which he was very
 successful.  In 1845 he was the first Lecturer on Chemistry in the
 Royal Belfast Academical Institution, but held this office for a short
 time only.    In 1845 the Queen's Colleges were founded and Andrews
 was appointed Vice-President of the Belfast College. With this office

                                       xii
there was conjoined, when the preliminary arrangements had been
made, that of the Chair of Chemistry.         He held these offices till 1879,
when the state of his health induced him to resign them, and to retire
almost   completely from active work.         He continued to take a keen
interest in the progress of Science till his death on the 5th November,
1885.
   He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1849, he was an
Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and a Corre
sponding Member of the Royal Society of Gottingen.               He received
honorary degrees from various Universities.
   He presided over the Chemical Section of the British Association
at Belfast in 1852, and again at Edinburgh in 1871, and was President
of the Association at the Glasgow Meeting in 1876.
   In 1842 Dr. Andrews married Jane Hardie, daughter of Major
Walker of the 42nd Highlanders. He is survived by Mrs. Andrews,
by three daughters and by two sons, the elder of whom is Major
in the Devonshire Regiment, and the younger a member of the Irish
Bar.
   Dr. Andrews was deeply interested in public affairs, bnt very rarely
took an active part in politics, and was quite free from party spirit.
His only writings bearing in any way on political matters are ' Chapters
of Contemporary History.'        The first, entitled " Studium Generale,"
and published in 1867, is a historical and critical discussion of the
function of a University, with special reference to the Queen's
Colleges.    The second, " The Church in Ireland," was published in
1869.
   Of Dr. Andrews' strictly Chemical papers we may mention one on
the blood of cholera patients, in which he showed that it differs from
normal blood only by having a smaller proportion of water ; one on
galvanic cells with strong sulphuric acid as the exciting liquid, and
one on the presence of metallic iron in basaltic and other rocks. Much
more important than these careful and interesting papers is his great
work on Ozone.      This mysterious body had been the subject of in
vestigations by its discoverer, Schonbein, and also by Marignac. De la
Rive, Berzelius, Williamson, Fremy and Becquerel and Baumert, but
its real nature was still nnknown, it was not even certain that a number
of different substances had not been confounded under the name.
That ozone, however prepared, contained oxygen, and was a powerful
oxidising agent was certain, but it was not clear that it did not, some
times at least, contain hydrogen also.        Andrews attacked the problem
with characteristic energy and straightforwardness.           By a series of
experiment?!,  in which   it is difficult to say whether  the ingenuity, the
perfect fitness for their purpose, or the wonderful simplicity of the
methods used is to be most admired, he proved that "ozone, from what
ever source derived, is one and the same body, having identical

                                    xiii
properties and the same constitution, and is not a compound body, but
oxygen in an altered or allotropic condition."
   This work was continued by Andrews and Tait, and the results were
                   '                              '
published in the Philosophical Transactions under the title On the
                                                                    "
Volumetric Relations of Ozone and the Action cf the Electrical Dis
charge on Oxygen and other Gases."         The theory of the constitution
of ozone now universally held is clearly indicated in this paper,
although its apparent improbability deterred the authors from dis
cussing it fully.
   But by far the most interesting and peculiar part of Dr. Andrews'
work is to be found in his investigations in the borderland between
Chemistry and Physics.         There his special ability, his power of
arranging experiments, of devising pieces of apparatus suited to the
particular purpose at the moment in view, of detecting sources of
error and providing simple effective means of avoiding them, and of
doing all this himself with the least possible help from the instrument
maker, comes into remarkable prominence.               The apparatus with
which most of his work was done was made with his own hands, and
when, for instance, he wanted a casting, he personally superintended
the minutest details.     This directness of his work, and his habit of
working     alone, made   him  somewhat intolerant of assistance, as it
made him independent of it. The only exception to the solitariness
of his scientific work, a very notable exception, is the investigation of
Ozone, carried out in conjunction with Professor Tait.        His researches
on the heat developed   in chemical actions,  for   one of which he received
in 1844 one of the Royal Medals, and for the other in 1850 one of the
prizes given by the French Academy of Sciences, and that on the
continuity of the liquid and gaseous states, partly contained in his
Bakerian Lectures, and partly communicated posthumously to the
Society, were done strictly alone.    If this independence and individu
ality limited the amount of work done by him, it has the compensating
advantage that we know that every analysis and every observation
published by him were actually made with his own hands and eyes, so
that a reader of his paper is as nearly as possible in as good a position to
judge as to the soundness of his conclusions as if he had performed
the experiments himself.      In reading his papers we are transported
 at once to the laboratory ; without wearisome repetition we have all
 the details before us, and we can follow every step of his argument as
if we had been present at every experiment on which it was founded.
   The investigation into the heat given out during chemical action
 was begun while he was still engaged in medical practice ; this work
 at once established his position as a genuine scientific discoverer, and
 introduced him to the'ehemists and physicists of Europe.
    But ihe work which will always be most closely connected with his
 name is the great investigation into the relation of temperature, pres

                                     xiv
sure and volume       of carbonic acid, co-nmnnicated to this Society in
the Bakerian Lectures of 1869 and 1876.
     He showed that for temperatures below about 30"9e C. as the
pressure is increased we come to a point whore condensation occurs,
where the gas is converted into a liquid.       At this pressure there art*
two limiting values of the volume, one when all the substance is
vapour, and one when it is all liquid.       Between these the substance
is partly vapour and partly liquid, the distinction between the two
being visible, as the liquid and the vapour refract light differently,
and are separated from one another by a distinct meniscus.          As the
temperature approaches 30"9° the abrupt change of volume on con
densation becomes less and less in amount, above that temperature
 (the Critical Temperature of carbonic acid) there is no abrupt change
of volume, and no visible condensation.         Near 30-9°, but above it
 there is a rapid, but not abrupt, change of volume ; as the temperature
 rises this rapid change of volume becomes less and less marked, and
 the isothermal approximates more and more to the hyperbolic form.
 This extraordinary character of the isothermals — discontinuous below
 a particular temperature, continnous above it — led Andrews to the
 remarkable discovery which gives the title to his Lectures, " The
 Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States of Matter."
     If we represent the relation of temperature, pressure and volume
 by means of a surface, where the rectangular co-ordinates x, y, and s
 correspond to p, t, and v (as was done by Professor James Thomson to
 illustrate Andrews' work), we see that there is what may be called a
 cliff, points at the top of which correspond to the substance at the
  condensing point, but all in the state of vapour, while points imme
  diately below them, at the base of the cliff, correspond to the snbstance
  just condensed and all in the state of liquid.      The cliff becomes less
  and less high as sand y increase, and vanishes at the place correspond
  ing to the critical point.     From a point on the slope above the cliff
   we can pass to a point on the slope below, either by dropping down
   the vertical face or by going round the end of the cliff.       To quote
   Andrews' words " . . . . the author has made carbonic acid pass,
   without breach of continuity, from what is universally regarded as the
   gaseous to what is, in like manner, universally regarded as the liquid
   state.  As a direct result of his experiments, he concludes that the
   gaseous and   liquid states are only widely separated forms of the same
   condition of matter, and may be made to pass into one another by a
   series of gradations so gentle that the passage shall nowhere present
   any interruption or breach of continuity.       From carbonic acid as a
   perfect gas to carbonic acid as a perfect liquid, the transition may be
   accomplished by a continuous process, and the gas and liquid are only
   distant stages of a long series of continuous physical changes. Under
    certain conditions of temperature and pressure, carbonic acid finds

                                      XV
itself, it is trne, in a state of instability, and passes, without change
of pressure or temperature, but with evolution of heat, to a condition
which, by the continuous process, can only be reached by a long and
circuitous route."
    Like most great discoveries, this had been to a certain extent fore
shadowed. In 1822 Cagniard de la Tour observed that certain liquids
— ether, alcohol, water — when heated in hermetically closed tubes,
were apparently totally changed into vapour occupying from two to
four times the original volume of the liquid.               In 1823 Faraday
succeeded in condensing to liquids a number of substances previously
known in the gaseous state only.
    Shortly afterwards Thilorier obtained solid carbonic acid, and
observed the very rapid expansion of liquid carbonic acid when heated.
In 1845 Faraday published a very remarkable paper in the ' Philoso
                        '
phical Transactions on the liquefaction and solidification of gases.
He there pointed ont that as different liquids assume the Cagniard de
la Tour state at different temperatures, so the gases which had not
been condensed — oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, &c. — might be supposed
to have that point below the lowest temperature he had applied (that
of a bath of solid carbonic acid and ether in vacuo), and therefore to
be incapable of condensation to a liquid by any pressure unless the
temperature were much further lowered.
    Faraday conjectured from the results of experiment that the
Cagniard de la Tour state occurred in the case of carbonic acid about
90° F., a value surprisingly near that experimentally              proved by
Andrews.
    But what others had seen obscurely or partially, or had inferred,
Andrews made clearly visible in its entirety, and many physicists and
 chemists can testify to the startling character of the revelation made
by the publication of his discovery.        It is in fact after the discovery
 has really been made that the historian begins to look for foreshadow -
 ings, and we are perhaps somewhat inclined to interpret these early
 indications in the light of the later, more definite knowledge, but the
 unanimous verdict of the scientific world is that the discovery of the
 continuity of the liquid and gaseous states belongs to Andrews and to
him alone.
    Dr. Andrews was loved by all who knew him. Warmly hospitable,
 he was personally almost stoically temperate, allowing himself the
 minimum of rest, of food, and of sleep. While in theological, as in
 all other matters, he thought for himself, he was a consistent and
orthodox Christian and a loyal member of the Church of Ireland.
