The Croonian Lecture.    On the Structure and Uses of the Membrana
  Tympani of the Ear. By Everard Home, Esq., F.R.S. Read Nov. 7,
  1799.    [Phil. Trans. 1800, p. 1.]
THE     part of the ear which was the subject of the present lecture,
has  always  been considered as a common membrane, which, being
stretched or relaxed by means of muscles belonging to the malleus,
became fitted in its various degrees of tension to convey the immense
variety of external sounds to the internal organ.
   Though this description have been generally adopted, yet it will
appear upon further inquiry that, owing no doubt in a great measure
to the extreme minuteness of the part, the structure and some of the
properties of this membrane had not as yet been properly investigated.
And the discovery here announced is broughtforward with the greater
propriety on this occasion, as it affords a new instance of the appli
cation of muscular action, which may ultimately account for certain
phaenomena in the sense of hearing in a more satisfactory manner
than has hitherto been proposed.
   This discovery we owe in some measure to the opportunity Mr.
Home had to dissect the ear of an elephant, where the parts are so
much larger even than they ought to be in proportion to the size of
the animal, that the structure of this membrane, which is usually de
nominated the Drum of the Ear, becomes obvious even to the naked
eye.   On close examination it was found, that instead of being an
uniform coat or skin, a great number of muscular fibres, which seem
incorporated in  it,pass along   its texture       radiated manner from
                                                   in
                                                    a
the rim which surrounds    it,towards the handle        the malleus, with
                                                        of
which the central   part  of
                           the membrane        firmly
                                               is     connected.
   Having thus been put upon the scent, the membrane         inthe human
ear was carefully separated from        itscontiguous parts, and being
viewed  in   a microscope, magnifying         23
                                             times, exhibited the same

texture, the muscular fibres appearing similar throughout the whole
surface; without any central tendons as in the diaphragm, and chiefly
forming the internal layer, on which side they appeared most con
spicuous.
  The blood-vessels of this membrane, the number of which is pro
portionate to                   its
                        action, resemble              great measure those  in   a    the                               of

                                                 3
moveable bridge of the monochord, adjusting it to the vibrations re
quired to be produced.     Thus the combined effects of the action of
these muscles   give the perceptions of grave and acute tones; and in
proportion as their original conformation is more or less perfect, so
will their action be, and consequently the perceptions of sound which
they communicate.
   This mode by which the membrana tympani is capable of being
adjusted to certain tones, or rather musical keys, will it is thought
fully account for the difference between a musical ear, and one
which is too imperfect to discriminate different notes with any degree
of nicety. This delicacy of the ear, as it is found to depend on mus
cular action, may therefore be in some measure acquired, and is
likewise liable to be impaired by illness or other accidental causes,
of which some striking instances are here related.
   In endeavouring to explain the uses of the more internal parts of
the ear, considerable advantage, it is thought, may be derived from
classing them in two divisions, namely, those which are formed for
the purpose of receiving impressions conveyed through the medium
of liquids or of solid substances; and those adapted to receive im
pressions made by the impulses of an elastic fluid such as common
air. The former are the ears of fish, which are found to have fewer
parts than those of birds, quadrupeds and man ; but in the latter we
find that the organ is susceptible of impressions by both vehicles. Thus
men can hear the ticking of a watch by applying it to the forehead,
and shutting the ears: the sound in this instance being evidently
conducted through the bones of the skull, it appears manifest that
only the interior parts of the ear, namely, the vestibulum and semi
circular canals, co-operate to produce this sensation; and these in
fact are the principal parts of that organ in fish.
                                                                                                   as its
   In birds the membrana tympani has no tensor muscle to vary
adjustment, and hence their scale                of
                                            sounds cannot descend          low           so
in  the human ear. The cochlea, which has hitherto been considered

On the Method of determining, from the real Probabilities of Life, the
  Values of Contingent Reversions in which three Lives are involved in
  the Survivorship. By William Morgan, Esq. F.R.S. Read Dec. 12,
  1799.    [Phil. Trans. 1800, p. 22.]
  Mr. Morgan having     already communicated to the Society the so
lutions of seventeen different problems in the doctrine of contingent
reversions depending upon three lives, has been induced, from a wish
to complete the subject, to investigate in the present paper seven
more problems in which the same number of lives are concerned in
the survivorship.  These, he tells us, include, as far as he can perceive,
all the remaining cases involving those complicated contingencies.
      examining the investigation
     In                                  these problems,      appears that
                                                                   in of

                                       thirteen different events.    These
numerous contingencies being all expressed by separate fractions
(each     of
          which     resolved into two
                              is                                      or

Abstract of a Register of the Barometer, Thermometer, and Rain, at

On   the Powerof penetrating into Space by Telescopes ; with a compa
  rative Determination of the Eatent of that Power in natural Vision,
  and in Telescopes of various Sizes and Constructions; illustrated by
  select Observations.  By William Herschel, LL.D. F.R.S. Read
  Nov. 21, 1799.     [Phil. Trans. 1800, p. 49.]
   It has long been observed that the power of distinguishing objects
at great   distances depends not only on the magnifying power applied
to the  telescope  through which they are viewed, but also on the quan
tity of light emitted by the object, and collected and conveyed to the
eye by means of the instrument. The superiority of telescopes with
large apertures must hence appear obvious; and we have long wit
messed the essential improvements made in this respect by Dr. Hers
chel, which have enabled him to extend his view into the firmament
to distances, the bare mention of which is sufficient to astonish a mind
unaccustomed to investigations of this nature. That it is principally
the increased quantity of light that enables us to view luminous ob
jects at great distances will appear manifest if we reflect that, since
the density of light decreases in the ratio of the squares of the di
 stances of the objects emitting the light, it follows that an object may
be removed to distances at which its light will be so rarefied as to
 produce no longer any sensation upon the optic nerve : that if an
 optical instrument be used with an object-glass of a larger diameter
 than the pupil of the eye, the quantity of light collected by this means
 in the eye will be greater in proportion to the greater extent of the
 object-glass compared with that of the pupil; and that hence the
 most distant star that can be seen with the naked eye, if it be viewed
 through a tube with an object-glass of twice the diameter of the pupil,
 it will without any magnifying power be visible at a distance four times
 greater than that at which the naked eye ceased to perceive           Dr.              it.
 Herschel many years ago adverted         this circumstance, when
                                                  to                    his               in
 paper  on  the Construction   the Heavens,

                                                  introduced what     then               he
 figuratively called his sounding line,    which  to             he
                                                       now substitutes the
 appellation     the power
                of            penetrating into space. And
                                    of                         the present      in
paper   he   fully investigates      a    comparative determination              of   the extent
of that power     natural vision, and
                     in                     telescopes
                                                  in                  of
                                                           various sizes and
constructions; all which            he
                               illustrates by     number    a select and cuof
rious observations.
   In the first part     the paper
                          of                 he
                                        establishes the difference between
magnifying and penetrating powers;                     he
                                               rejects some vague terms                        in
common acceptation,            to
                            which            he
                                       substitutes algebraic symbols and
such accurate definitions           as
                               enable him       proceed upon solid ground.

And after distinguishing between self-luminous objects, and those
which shine      by reflected light, and likewise noticing those whose
                     a

                                      6
 brightness is the effect of a considerable depth of luminous matter, he
 shows that these differences noways affect the present inquiry; since
in all these several bodies, it is the quantity of light emitted by their
surfaces which becomes the object of our perception.         As the same
body, however, may be differently luminous in different parts of its
surface, he exhibits a formula by which the aggregate brightness of a
body may be estimated. And he closes this part with an examination
of the opinion maintained by Lambert in his Système du Monde,
where he says that an object is equally bright at all distances, and
that the sun at the distance of Saturn, or still further from us, would
be as bright as it is in its present situation.  This assertion taken in
the general sense in which it is here expressed, he proves to be a pal
pable contradiction; and only admits it in as far as the celebrated
author may mean the intrinsic brightness of a body, which applies to
its surface diminished by distance, and not the absolute brightness of
the whole.
  In the next section the author endeavours to ascertain the general
extent of vision with the naked eye. As to those bodies which shine
with a reflected light, he asserts that none have yet been seen more
distant than the Georgian planet: admitting this as the maximum, it
must after all excite our admiration that borrowed light should be
perceptible to our naked eye at the distance of no less than eighteen
hundred millions of miles; especially if we consider that the light of
the sun on that planet is above 368 times less intense than it is on
our earth, and that probably two thirds of that diminished light is
absorbed by the planet.
  The range of natural vision, with respect to self-luminous objects,
is incomparably more extended. Passing over the intermediate steps
 by which our author arrives at his conclusions, we shall simply men
 tion his inference that no single star above nine or at most ten times
 more distant than Sirius can possibly be perceived by the naked eye;
 admitting, however, that an accumulation of stars will be perceptible
 at a far greater distance.
    From the power of penetrating into space by naked vision, our
 author proceeds to that of telescopes.      Here he first calculates, by a
method recommended by Mr. Bouguer, the quantity of light absorbed
and dissipated by the reflection of the mirror, and refraction of the
eye-glasses; and he finds that a common Newtonian with three
lenses loses about ºths of the whole light it receives, and that in a te
lescope of his own construction with two lenses this loss amounts to
somewhat less than mºnths. The Doctor now enters into a full investi

various circumstances       he
                             could devise, and illustrates the wholea
great number   of  observations, which serve    to  confirm the inferences
deduced   by  him. Here we learn that the penetrating power         of  his
20-feet reflector, applied       asingle star, may extend
                                 to                         as   faras 612
                        Sirius, and also that his large telescope, with
                    of of
times the distance                                                       a

magnitude.

    In the next sections he shows that the penetrating and magnifying
powers, so far from assisting each other, will often prove reciprocally
detrimental, which he thinks may be explained by admitting that
while the light collected is employed in magnifying an object, it can
not be exerted in giving penetrating power, to which perhaps ought
to be added the detrimental effect of the magnifying power on the
heterogeneous ingredients floating in the atmosphere.        Whatever be
the cause, the fact is proved by various observations.
    Lastly, he shows that as we must not limit our vision within the
sphere of the single stars, we must call the united lustre of the sidereal
system to our aid in stretching forward into space.        Supposing one
of these clusters of 5000 stars to be at one of those immense distances
to which only a 40-feet reflector can reach, he calculates that this
distance will exceed at least 300,000 times that of the most remote
fixed star visible to the naked eye. He concludes with a rough cal
culation how much time it would take to sweep the heavens with a
penetrating power of such an immense extent; and finds that in this
climate, with his 40-feet reflector, with a magnifying power of 1000,
this operation for the whole sphere would take no less than 811
years.

 Account   of a Peculiarity in the Distribution of the Arteries sent to the
    Limbs of slow-moving Animals; together with some other similar
    Facts. In a Letter from Mr. Anthony Carlisle, Surgeon, to John
     Symmons, Esq. F.R.S. Read Jan. 9, 1800.           [Phil. Trans. 1800,
    p. 98.]
     This peculiarity was first observed in the axillary arteries and in
 the iliacs of the Lemur tardigradus, which at their entrance into the
 upper and lower limbs were found to be suddenly divided into a con
 siderable number of equal-sized cylinders, which occasionally anasto
 mosed with each other, and were regularly distributed on the mus
 cles; whilst the arteries proceeding to the other parts of the body di
 vided in the usual arborescent form.
     Upon prosecuting this inquiry, it was found that the Bradypus

                                     8
tridactylus, and in some measure also the didactylus, has a similar
distribution of these arteries.
   This peculiar disposition of the arteries in the limbs of these slow
moving quadrupeds, it is thought cannot but retard the velocity of
the blood passing into the muscles of the limbs.       Whence the well
known sluggishness of the animals, to whom this configuration seems
as yet peculiar, will perhaps be ultimately accounted for. Something
similar has been observed in the carotid artery of the lion, which
it is thought may be subservient to the long continued exertion of the
muscles of his jaws, in holding a powerful animal for a length of time;
and lastly, it is conjectured that the ruminating animals have a some
what similar aplexus of arteries in the neck, which operates in retard
ing the velocity of the fluids in those parts.
 Outlines  of Erperiments and Inquiries respecting Sound and Light.
   By Thomas Young, M.D. F.R.S. In a Letter to Edward Whitaker
    Gray, M.D. Sec.R.S. Read Jan. 16, 1800.          [Phil. Trans. 1800,
   p. 106.]
   We are here presented with a numerous set of experiments and
observations, which the author does not deliver as a series calculated
to elucidate any particular object, but rather as the results of the first
steps of an investigation; which being of considerable magnitude, and
not to be accomplished in a short period of time, are here brought
forward in a detached form, in order to preserve them from oblivion,
should any unforeseen circumstances prevent his continuing the pur
suit. They are classed under sixteen different heads, of which the
following are the titles, and some of the principal inductions.
   l. Of the Quantity of Air discharged through an Aperture.This
was deduced from the quantity of pressure of water, on a body of air
rushing through a small aperture at the end of a tube. The result
was, that the quantity of air discharged by a given aperture is nearly
in the subduplicate ratio of the pressure ; and that the ratio of the
expenditures by different apertures, with the same pressure, lies be
tween the ratio of their diameters, and that of their areas.
   2. Of the Direction and Velocity of a Stream of Air.These were
determined by the stream, produced by a known pressure, being made
to impinge, in a perpendicular direction, against a white plate, on
which a scale of equal parts was delineated, and which was thinly
covered with a coloured liquid. The results were here inferred from
the breadth of the surface of the plate laid bare by the stream.The
experiments being repeated at different distances between the orifice
and the plate, the longitudinal form of the stream could be hence de
duced, their sections being bounded by curves, the nature of which
could be determined by their ordinates and abscissae.       The nume
rous results obtained in this manner are entered in various tables,
and likewise illustrated by figures, in which the longitudinal and not
the transverse sections are exhibited to the eye.
   3. Ocular Evidence of the Nature of Sound.This is produced by

                                     9
a stream of air driven through a pipe with a lateral aperture, like a
French flute, where at the part where the stream issues out of the
orifice, vibrations are manifestly perceived, which are rendered still
more evident if the current be impregnated with smoke.
    4. Of the Velocity of Sound.The velocity of any impression trans
mitted by the common air, being corrected by the experiments of
various observers, is at an average here estimated at 1130 feet in
a second of time.
    5. Of Sonorous Cavities.What is here said relates chiefly to the
reflection of sounds in rooms or galleries.    This we find takes place
as often in a second as double the breadth of the room or passage is
contained in 1130 feet, that breadth determining the pitch of the
 musical note thereby produced.
    6 Of the Divergence of Sound.Various observations are here re
lated which militate against the received opinion that sound diverges
equally in all directions, and that there is no substance impervious
to sound.      On this head, however, the author admits that a more
ample investigation will be required than has hitherto been insti
tuted; and he intimates that he shall engage in it as soon as his
leisure will permit.
    7. Of the Decay of Sound.The two hypotheses, 1st, that sound de
cays nearly in the simple ratio of the distances, and 2nd, that this di
minution is in the subduplicate ratio, are here stated, and some falla
cies are mentioned, which will likewise render a further inquiry ne
    *s,
cessary.
            the Harmonic Sounds of Pipes.The object of this section
appears from a table exhibiting the results of a set of experiments,
made with a view to ascertain the velocity with which organ-pipes
 of different lengths require to be supplied with air, according to the
various appropriate sounds which they produce.
    These were made on pipes of the same bore, and of different
lengths, both stopped and open.        The general result was, that a si
 milar blast   produced as  nearly the same sound as the length of the
 pipe would permit, or at least that the exceptions, though very nu
 merous, lie equally on each side of this conclusion.
    9. Of the Vibrations of different Elastic Fluids.-The difference of
 these vibrations has been received as being reciprocally in the sub
 duplicate ratio of the density of the fluid.   Hence in pure hydrogen
 gas they must be 3-6 times greater than in common air. And
 this will explain why an instrument will often appear out of tune,
 when, in fact, the fault lies in the change of temperature of the at
 mosphere; and why the pitch of an organ will be found to differ ma
 terially in summer and winter.
    10. Of the Analogy between Light and Sound:While the author
 vindicates the Newtonian theory of light against the criticisms of
 Euler, he freely admits that it is liable to some objections, among
 which he chiefly insists upon the uniformity of the motion of light in
 the same medium, and the partial reflection from every refracting
 surface.    Having reasoned largely upon this subject, he admits the

                                             10
  probability of an analogy between the colours of a thin plate and
  the sounds of a series of organ-pipes; and observes that the same
 colour recurs whenever the thickness of the plate answers to the
 terms of an arithmetical progression, in the same manner as the same
 sound is produced by means of an uniform blast from organ-pipes
 which are different multiples of the same length.
     11. Of the Coalescence of Musical Sounds.-In this section Dr.
 Smith's assertion that the vibrations constituting different sounds are
 able to cross each other in all directions, without affecting the same
 individual particles of air by their joint forces, is minutely investi
 gated and controverted.
     12. Of the Frequency of Vibrations constituting a given Note.
     13. Of the Vibrations of Chords.
     14. Of the Vibrations of Rods and Plates.
     Of the contents of these three sections no account will be here          at
 tempted, as they consist chiefly of experiments and demonstrations
 illustrated by diagrams.
     15. Of the Human Voice.A technical description is here given
 of the formation of sounds by the configuration and inflexions of the
 different parts of the vocal organ. And it is intimated that by a close
attention to the harmonics entering into the constitution of various
sounds, much more may be done in their analysis than could other
wise be expected.
   16. Of the Temperament of Musical Intervals.-After pointing out
some imperfections in most of those who have treated this subject
before him, the author suggests his own method of distributing the
imperfection of the scale, so as to produce a modulation that shall be
found the least defective. And here he observes, as upon an average
of all music ever composed some particular keys occur at least twice
as often as others, there seems to be a very strong reason for making
the harmony the most perfect in those keys which are the most fre
quently used; since the aggregate sum of                all
                                               the imperfections which
occur   inplaying, must by this means be diminished the most pos
sible, and the diversity      of
                            the character    the same time accurately
                                                    at
preserved.

                                         ten was attacked with           an   in
flammation and suppuration         the left ear, which continued dis
                                        in
charging matter for several weeks; and who after the space          of
                                                                    about
   twelvemonth had the same symptoms        his right ear, the discharge
                                                   in
in aboth cases being thin and fetid, and conveying many small bones
and particles       of
                  bones.   On probing the ears when the youth was
about   twenty years     of
                        age,   was found that the membrana tympani
                                   it

                                                 11
of the left ear was totally destroyed, and that but a small part of it
remained in the right ear. So free was the passage through both the
ears, that the patient, by closing his nostrils and contracting his
cheeks, could with ease force the air from the mouth through the
meatus auditorius; and yet what is most remarkable, the sense of
hearing was by no means materially impaired by this imperfection;
especially in the left ear, where the whole of the membrane was dis
solved.   The organ even retained a nice musical discrimination.
   From this, and amother similar instance here described, it is                                                 in
ferred that the loss of the membrana tympani, though it somewhat
diminishes the power of hearing, does not absolutely destroy it; and
that probably where this membrane is wanting, its functions are
supplied by the membranes of the fenestrae ovalis and rotunda, which
being placed over the water of the labyrinth, will, when agitated by
the impressions of sound, convey their vibrations to that fluid, in a
similar manner as is done by the membrana tympani in          healthy                            its
state.    It also intimated that the principal use  this membrane             of

    The numerous experiments described in this paper were chiefly
made on marine animals, particularly herrings and mackerel, which
were exposed either in the air, or in water impregnated with different
salts, and of different temperatures, in a dark vault to which the
Doctor assigns the name of his laboratory.
    The results obtained in this investigation are described in nine
sections, the summary contents of which are as follows:
    1. The quantity of light emitted by putrescent animal substances
does not arise from the greater degree of putrefaction in such sub
 stances, as is commonly supposed; but, on the contrary, they begin
to shine some time before any apparent signs of putrefaction take
place, and the greater the putrescence, the less is the quantity of light
emitted.
    2. Light is a chemical element, or a constituent principle of some
bodies, and particularly of marine fishes; and it may be separated
from them by a peculiar process, or be retained, and rendered per
manent for some time. The experiments from whence this inference
is derived were made with pieces of herrings and mackerel, and with
living tadpoles immersed in solutions of Epsom salt, sea salt, Glauber's
salt, and in all which a quantity of light was manifestly imparted to
the saline menstruum, which the latter under various circumstances
retained for a considerable time.      These experiments seem also to
evince, that light is not partially but wholly incorporated with every
particle of the animal substance; that it is probably the first elemen
tary principle that escapes after the death of fishes; and that as the
putrescence was by no means promoted, but rather retarded by this
emission of light, it is highly probable that no offensive putrefaction
ever takes place at sea after the death of such myriads of animals as
must needs daily perish in the vast ocean, which hence continue long
a wholesome food to the many kinds of fish that feed upon their
congeneries.
    3. Some bodies or substances have a power of extinguishing spon
taneous light when it is applied to them.       These are water, both
pure and impregnated with quicklime, carbonic acid gas, and hepatic
gas, fermented liquors, ardent spirits, fixed and volatile alkalies, cer
tain neutral salts, vegetable infusions, pure honey, and the rust of
iron, calamine, minium, and manganese dissolved in water.
    4. Other bodies or substances have a power of retaining sponta
neous light for some time when it is applied to them.        These sub
stances are most of the solutions mentioned in the second article,
which, when impregnated with some of the lucific matter scraped
from herrings and mackerel, retain the light for some days, especially
if assisted with some agitation of the phial containing them. The
appearances here exhibited are described as being both beautiful and
surprising, as they enable us to take light from one substance and
transfer it to another, so as to render the latter most brilliantly   lu
minous; or in other words to impregnate a liquid with light.

stances, it is not lost, but may be again revived in       former splen                       its

Account of a Series of Experiments, undertaken with the view of de
    composing the Muriatic Acid.        By Mr. William Henry.        Commu
    nicated by the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart.        P.R.S. Read
    Feb. 27, 1800.      [Phil. Trans. 1800, p. 188.]
    In the introduction to this paper the author points out the great
utility that would accrue to chemical science, were it possible to        ar
rive at a complete analysis of certain acids, since the new, and in
deed every system of chemistry, will ever be incomplete and liable to
subversion till the particular agents here alluded to have been re
 solved into their constituent principles. The obstacles, however,
which impede the progress of this investigation, are much greater
than may appear at first sight; and among these are particularly
mentioned the difficulty of obtaining the acids completely separated
from all other substances, which, by their presence, will ever tend to
introduce uncertainty into the results of the process; it being ob
served that the attraction between compound particles at all times
increases in proportion as we recede from the point of saturation,
and that the smallest remnant is often sufficient to perplex all further
analysis.    The liquid state is thought to be totally unfit for the pur
pose of this inquiry: and after some other strictures, it is shown that
the state of the gas is the only one in which acids can become proper
objects of analytical investigation.
   In the series of his experiments on the muriatic acid in the gaseous
state, Mr. Henry employed the electric fluid as an agent much pre
ferable to artificial heat.        This mode of operating, he says,
enables us to confine accurately the gases submitted to experi
ment; the phaenomena that occur during the process may be di
stinctly observed, and the comparison of the products with the ori
ginal gases may be instituted with great exactness.          The action of
the electric fluid   itself,  as a  decomponent,  is no doubt extremely
powerful; since it is capable of separating from each other the con
stituent parts of water, of the nitric and sulphuric acids, of the vege
table alkali, of nitrous gas, and of several other bodies whose com
ponents are known to be strongly united.           The experiments were

                                           15
made in straight glass tubes of various diameters, armed at the sealed
end with a metallic conductor, through which the shocks were intro
duced, the gas being at the other end confined by quicksilver.
   The experiments, eighteen in number, are arranged under two
heads, the first of which relates to the effects of electricity on mu
riatic gas, either pure or with the admixture of common air and
oxygenous gas; and in the second are recorded the effects of elec
trifying the muriatic acid gas with inflammable substances.
   The results of these experiments, which in the first set were ge
nerally a diminution, and in the second an expansion of the aerial
fluid within certain limits, plainly evinced that no decomposition
whatever of the muriatic acid had ever been effected, the residue al
ways exhibiting the characters of hydrogenous or carbonic gases,
whence it was reasonable to infer that with                     all
                                                     the precautions that
were used, the muriatic gas had never been perfectly freed from some-
admixture    ofwater   orother ingredient.
   The following general conclusions are deduced from these results.
                                                                                                   of be

produced, still contains     aportion       of
                                          water. The most decisive

portion is  decomposed; the hydrogen                 of
                                            the water which unites with
the electric matter, constituting hydrogenous gas; and the oxygen
which combines with the muriatic acid which                         at
                                                       the same time acts

                                       intermediate agent        combining         in
oxygen with muriatic acid; while the really acid portion           the mu               of
riatic gas does not sustain any decomposition by the action           elec                   of
tricity.

                                                 the compound inflam
mable   gas, and carbonic acid and  hydrogenous   gases are the result.
   5)  When all the water        of
                               the two gases has been decomposed,                                  no
effect ensues from continuing the electrization.

vourable circumstances for being separated from the muriatic acid,
and combining with     itsoxygen, evinces

On double Images caused by atmospherical Refraction. By William
  Hyde Wollaston, M.D. F.R.S.     Read March 6, 1800.    [Phil.
  Trans. 1800, p. 239.]
    The remarkable instances of double and triple images of the same
 object produced by aerial refraction near the horizon, lately commu
 nicated to the Society by Mr. Huddart, Prof. Vince, and Mr. Dalby,
 have given rise to the present paper, in which the author attempts to
 explain these phaenomena on theoretical principles, and to illustrate
 his conclusions by artificial experiments.
    Admitting the inference given by Professor Vince, that these ap
 pearances arise from certain unusual variations of increasing density
 in the lower strata of the atmosphere, our author undertakes, 1st, to
 investigate the successive variations of increasing or decreasing den
 sity to which fluids in general are liable, and the laws of the refrac.
 tions occasioned by them ; 2dly, to illustrate and confirm the truth
 of this theory by experiments with fluids of known densities; and
 lastly, to ascertain, by trial upon the air itself, the causes and extent
 of those variations of its refractive density on which the inversions
of objects and other circumstances observed in the above phaenomena
seem to depend.
    Under the first head we find the demonstrations of three propo
sitions, deduced from the general laws of refraction.              The first im
ports, that if the density of any medium varies by parallel, indefinitely
thin strata, a ray of light moving through it in the direction of the
strata, will be made to deviate during                     its
                                                  passage; and the deviation
will ever     beproportionate          to
                                    the increment      density where
                                                                 of      passes.      it
From the second         appears, that when two fluids

the manner in which, according to this theory, an object viewed
through a medium of various densities, producing or rather repre
sented by a curve of contrary flexure, and at the same time a con
tiguous stratum of uniform density, will exhibit three different images;
the one through the uniform medium, in its proper place; the other
through the convex part, somewhat higher, but inverted; and the
third refracted by the concave part, still higher, erect, but somewhat
smaller.
    Grounded upon these principles, Dr. Wollaston proceeded next to
 the set of experiments which are the subject of his second section.
 The first and most explanatory of these experiments was made with
a square phial, about one-third filled with clear syrup, and the other
third with pure water, the two liquids forming by degrees, at the
plane of contact, a thin stratum of decreasing density from the syrup
upwards. Here the effect was obviously conformable to the theory,
an object viewed through these media being represented to the eye,
erect and in its proper place when seen through the syrup of uniform
density; higher and inverted behind the adjacent variable medium;
and still higher and erect behind the upper part of the variable
stratum.     This effect of varied density was repeated by filling the
remainder of the phial with spirits of wine; when at the plane of
contact between the spirit and the water, another variable stratum
was gradually produced, which exhibited the same phaenomenon as
in the former instance.The next experiment proves that a difference
of temperature between adjacent strata of the same fluid will pro
duce the same effect.And a third experiment, which may be con
sidered as a corollary, showed that the air round a heated body (a
red-hot poker for instance,) will assume the same varied densities,
and exhibit precisely the same appearances.                                   -
   Under the third head the author      observes, that though  three  images
have as yet been rarely seen in the atmosphere, yet this circumstance
does by no means invalidate the above theory; since            appearing  its                 so
seldom may        well accounted for by the less rarefaction produced by
                 be
the heat    of  the sun, than by      red-hot iron,
                                                a                    or

above used. Over water, the evenness            the surface,

vourable    to the production              of
                                   such appearances.
   Some observations are, lastly, added concerning Mr. Huddart's
opinion, that the peculiar state         the atmosphere which produced
                                                 of
the   appearances        at he
                        witnessed  may   have been occasioned merely by
the   evaporation      the surface    the sea condensing the lower strata
                                                of
of  the  atmosphere.    Dr. Wollaston does not altogether accede          this           to
opinion; but       hedoes not absolutely deny that the cold produced by
this evaporation may             in
                            some instances occasion       density that may

On a new fulminating Mercury.               By Edward Howard, Esq. F.R.S.
-
      Read March 13, 1800.                 [Phil. Trans. 1800, p. 204.]
    We learn from the introduction to this paper, that mercury, and
most, if not all, its oxides, may, by treatment with nitric acid and
alcohol, be converted into a crystallized compound, possessing all the
inflammable properties of gunpowder, as well as many others peculiar
to itself. After stating the gradual steps by which he arrived at this
discovery, Mr. Howard describes the following process and manipu
lations, which he found best calculated for producing this powder.
     One hundred grains, or a greater proportional quantity, of quick
 silver, are to be dissolved with heat in a measured ounce and a half
of nitric acid. This solution being poured cold upon two measured
ounces of alcohol, a moderate heat is to be applied, until an effer
vescence is excited.     A white fume then begins to undulate on the
surface of the   liquor, and the powder will be gradually precipitated
upon the cessation of action and re-action. This precipitate is to be
immediately collected on a filter, well washed with distilled water,
and carefully dried in a heat not much exceeding that of a water
bath. This immediate edulcoration of the powder is material, it
being liable to the re-action of the nitric acid, which, while any of
that acid adheres to       it,
                           renders   subject
                                       it                 to
                                                the influence     light.                of
The quantity         of
                    the powder produced varies according     the nature        to
of  the ingredients; 100 grains           quicksilver yielding from 120
                                           of                                                     to
132 grains      ofthe compound.
   The principal agents which decompose this mercurial powder are
the nitric, the sulphuric, and the muriatic acids. The most remarkable
effect is  that      the sulphuric acid, which, when much concentrated,
                     of
produces    an  explosion nearly      the instant
                                      at                      of
                                                       contact, on account,                       it
is thought,     of the sudden and    copious  disengagement                   of
                                                                    the caloric.
When the acid          less concentrated, no explosion takes place; but
                      is                                                                          a

    Upon the whole          the investigation, Mr. Howard concludes that
                           of
this mercurial powder          composed
                                is              of

cious appearances and plausible inferences in our researches both
after physical and moral truth, the Doctor acknowledges that a general
diffidence of this nature had raised a doubt in his mind, that the
power of heating and illuminating objects is not equally distributed
 among the various coloured rays.           This surmise received some con
firmation from the different sensations he experienced on viewing the
 sun with his large telescopes, and through various combinations of
 differently coloured glasses.        With some of these combinations he
felt a sensation of heat, though he had but little light; while others
gave much light, with scarce any degree of heat.                Suspecting hence

                        the inferences here laid down.
   These   general  inferences are, that the red-making rays are very
far from  having  the illuminating power        any eminent degree; that
                                                                 in

                                             of   it
more; that the maximum                   of
                                 illumination lies   the brightest yellow   in
or palest green; that the green itself         nearly equally bright with
                                                                 is

                                          21
the yellow; but that, from the full deep green, the illuminating
power decreases very sensibly, the blue being nearly upon a par with
the red, while the violet is still more, and the purple the most defi
cient of any.
   From a collective view and a due contemplation of these well
established facts, it is inferred, that perhaps they may lead to the
discovery of different chemical properties in the different coloured
rays; and that the various degrees of heat in different coloured
flames will probably be fully explained on the principles that may be
deduced from them.
   Here follows a section in which the author advances a position,
that radiant heat is of different refrangibility, and that it is subject
to the laws of the dispersion arising from this different refrangibility.
We perceive from the drift of his arguments here advanced, that he
inclines in favour of a distinction between calorific rays and colorific
light, both being liable to refraction, but under different angles, and
hence probably possessed of different momenta.        This, if admitted,
will  apply to the invisible heat of red-hot iron  gradually  cooled till
it ceases to shine, and likewise affords a solution of the reflection of
                                                       -
invisible heat by concave mirrors.                                          /
   We come next to an application of the result of the foregoing ob
servations to the method of viewing the sun advantageously, with
telescopes of large apertures and high magnifying powers. It is well
known, that even with the naked eye, and much less with telescopes
of large apertures, the sun cannot be viewed without a darkening
apparatus.    Dr. Herschel had repeatedly used red glasses for this
purpose; but always found, that though the lustre was thereby suf
ficiently abated, yet they did not prevent an irritation on the eye,
which was manifestly the effect of heat. This induced him to make.
experiments with glasses of various other colours, the result of which
was, that, as might have been inferred from the above investigation,
dark-green glasses are the most efficacious for intercepting the red
or more calorific rays, and will therefore answer one of the purposes
of the darkening apparatus.      But as in viewing the sun we have,
besides the   heat, also its splendour  to contend with, further trials
were made to obviate this inconvenience: and for this purpose, com
mon smoked glasses were found the most efficacious.         Some direc
tions are here given for smoking glasses uniformly, and in the most
convenient manner.
   From a series of telescopic experiments respecting this darkening
apparatus, which concludes the paper, we learn, that as the heat will
often crack the glasses when placed at or near the focus of the pencils
of rays, a safer and more advantageous way of applying them is to
place them before and near the small speculum, or immediately be
hind the second eye-glass.     In this last position a single dark-green
glass was found of great utility; but a deep blue glass, with a blueish
green smoked one upon             it,
                             was still preferable: the sun appeared   of
  whiter colour than with any other composition, and the sensation
of a   heat was   by   no   means inconvenient.

 Erperiments    on the  Refrangibility of the invisible Rays of the Sun.
    By William Herschel, LL.D. F.R.S.             Read April 24, 1800.
    [Phil. Trans.   1800, p. 284.]
    In a paper read to the Society at a former meeting, the Doctor an
 nounced some observations which seemed to indicate that there are
 two sorts of rays proceeding from the sun; the one the calorific rays,
 which are luminous and refrangible into a variegated spectrum; and
 the other the invisible rays, which produce no illumination, but
 create a sensible degree of heat, and appear to have a greater range
 of refrangibility than the colorific rays. To the latter he assigns
the name of radiant heat. Having lately had some favourable oppor
tunities to prosecute this investigation, he here delivers an account
of the series of experiments he made on the subject, which seem to
him to confirm the above conjecture. The mode of conducting these
experiments was simply this:
    On a horizontal tablet covered with white paper, and divided into
squares, for the conveniency of measurement, a part of the extreme
colour of a prismatic spectrum was suffered to fall, the remainder of
the coloured rays passing by the edge of the tablet, so as not to     in
terfere with the experiment.
   Three thermometers were placed on the tablet, at different distances
from the termination of coloured rays. The general results of the ten
experiments here described were as follows:
   From the four first it appears, that there actually are rays coming
from the sun which are less refrangible than any of those which
affect the sight; that they are invested with a high power of heating
bodies, but with none of illuminating objects, which probably is the
reason why they have hitherto escaped unnoticed.
   The fifth and sixth experiments showed that the power of heating
is extended, though in a feeble degree, to the utmost limits of the
most refrangible or visible purple rays, but not beyond them ; and
that it is gradually increased as the coloured rays grow less refran
gible. And from the four last experiments we gather that the maxi
mum of the heating power resides among the invisible rays without
the prismatic spectrum, and is probably about half an inch beyond
the last visible one, or from the confines of the red ray. These like
wise show that the sun's invisible rays, in their less refrangible state,
still exert a heating power, considerably beyond this maximum, fully
equal to that of the red-coloured light; and that consequently, if we
may infer the quantity of the efficient from the effect produced, these
invisible rays of the sun probably far exceed the visible ones in
number.
   The inferences deduced from these results are, that the range of
refrangibility of radiant heat, or colorific rays, when dispersed by a
prism, begins at the purple-coloured light, where they are most re
fracted, and have the least efficacy; and that their refrangibility
lessens and their power increases as they approach the confines of
the red-coloured    light, but that these confines are not the limits of

                                                                  23
their decreasing refrangibility and increasing power, these having
been traced far beyond the prismatic spectrum in an invisible state;
that as their density gradually decreases, their energy at last vanishes,
till at length the thermometrical spectrum, as the Doctor is willing to
call   it,becomes wholly imperceptible.        Hitherto the effects     these                                      of
heating rays have been observed          far     one inch and      half from
                                                                   as            as                       a

   Having thus determined the subject           his investigation, the Doctor   of
distinguishes heat into six different kinds; whereof three are solar,
and three terrestrial. These, however, are reducible into three gene
ral divisions, each       the solar and terrestrial kinds resembling each
                                      of
other  respectively.   The first the heat produced by luminous bodies,

respecting the latter, which not only are well known to be founded.
but are also best calculated to elucidate the comparison.  These are
the seven following:1. Light, both solar and terrestrial, is a sen
sation occasioned by rays emanating from luminous bodies; 2. These
rays are subject to the laws of reflection; 3. They are refrangible;
4. They are of different refrangibility; 5. They are liable to be de
tained by different diaphanous bodies; 6. They are liable to be
scattered on rough surfaces; and 7. They have hitherto been sup
posed to have a power of heating bodies, which however remains as
yet to be examined.
    The similar propositions respecting heat which the Doctor intends
to prove, are as follows:1. Heat, both solar and terrestrial, is a
sensation occasioned by rays emanating from candent substances;
2. These rays are subject to the laws of reflection; 3. They are re
frangible; 4. of different refrangibility; 5. liable to be detained in
their passage through other bodies; 6. liable also to be scat
tered on rough surfaces; and lastly, They may be supposed, when in
a certain state of energy, to have a power of illuminating objects;
which last, however, remains as yet to be examined.
    The paper before us is limited to the experiments on the three
first of the above-mentioned comparative propositions.               They are
twenty in number, of which the ten first relate to the reflection, and
the ten last to the refraction of these rays, under                all

Chemical    Experiments   on Zoophytes;  with some observations     on the
    component  Parts of Membrane.     By Charles Hatchett, Esq.    F.R.S.
    Read June   12,  1800.   [Phil. Trans. 1800, p. 327.]
    Having completed the series of experiments on the component
parts of shell and bone which he described in a former paper, it was
suggested to Mr. Hatchett that there still remained a large class of
substances belonging to the animal kingdom, namely, the various
species of Zoophytes, which had never yet been carefully analysed,
and the investigation of which would probably lead to some curious,
and perhaps useful inferences.     Although aware of the extensiveness
of the inquiry, he yet readily engaged in it; and we have now before
us the fruit of his indefatigable industry and ardent zeal for the ad
vancement of science.
    The first part of the paper contains a full account of the series of
experiments he made on the abovementioned substances, which, in
the present pressure for time, we must pass over unnoticed in order
to hasten to the second, which consists of observations on those ex
periments, in the course of which the subject necessarily led to an
inquiry into the nature and properties of several other analogous
substances, such as horn, nail, hoof, quill, hair, feathers, tortoiseshell,
the scales of fish, amphibious animals and insects, albumen, and even
muscular fibre.
    We must here recollect that in his former paper on shell and bone
Mr. Hatchett had arrived at the conclusion that their essential in
gredients were carbonate of lime in the former, and phosphate of
lime in the latter, the bases in both consisting of different modifi
cations of a glutinous, gelatinous, or membranaceous substance. This
conclusion he had the satisfaction of seeing corroborated, and the
chain of connexion widely extended, by the facts deduced from the
present inquiry.     The general results of which are, that the Madre
 pores and Millepores (like several of the shells) are formed of a gela
tinous or membranaceous substance, hardened by carbonate of lime,
the difference consisting only in the mode in which these materials
 are combined: that in the Tubipora, Flustra and Corallina, some
phosphate of lime is mixed with the carbonate of lime: that in the
 Isis the basis is a regularly organized membranaceous, cartilaginous
 and horny substance, hardened by carbonate of lime, one species only
 (the Isis ochracea) yielding also a small proportion of phosphate of
lime. That the hardening substance of the Gorgonia nobilis is
 likewise the carbonate of lime, with a small portion of phosphate;
 but that the matter forming the membranaceous basis consists of two
 parts, the interior being gelatinous, and the external a complete mem
 brane, so formed as to cover the stem in the manner of a sheath or
 tube.   That the other Gorgoniae consist of a horny stem coated by
 a   membrane,   which is hardened by carbonate of lime. That the
 Sponges are of a nature similar to the horny stems of the Gorgoniae,
 and only differ from these and from each other by the quality of tex
 ture. And lastly, that the Alcyonia are likewise composed of a soft

                                     26
  flexible membranaceous substance, very similar to the cortical part
 of some of the Gorgoniae; and in like manner slightly hardened by
 carbonate, mixed with a small portion of phosphate of lime.
      From this mass of evidence we collect, in general, that the varieties
 of bone, shell, coral, and the numerous tribe of Zoophytes with which
 the last are connected, only differ in composition by the nature and
 quantity of the hardening or ossifying principle, and by the state of
 the substance with which this principle is mixed or connected; the
 gluten, or jelly, which cements the particles of carbonate or phos
 phate of lime, and the membrane, cartilage, or horny substance
 which serves as a basis, appearing to be only modifications of the same
 substance, which progressively graduates from a viscid liquid, or gluten,
 into a gelatinous substance, which again, by increased inspissation,
 and by the more or less perfect degrees of organic arrangement,
 forms the varieties of membrane, cartilage, and horn, which it seems
 form the peculiar differences of the several species.
      It is obvious that in this inquiry much depends upon an accurate    in
 vestigation of the gluten, or jelly, so often mentioned as a principal
 ingredient in the substances under examination. This gave rise to
 the experiments on the analogous substances above mentioned, which
 led to a better acquaintance with the substance which now obtains
 the name of gelatin.
     Not being allowed to enter into a detail of these experiments, we
 shall only observe at present, that this gelatin is a component part
 of most of the animal substances above enumerated; that it varies
in quality from a very attenuated jelly or mucilage, to that viscid
substance called glue, the varieties of which also differ in solubility
and tenacity: that it is present in various proportions, so that certain
bodies, such as the cutis and cartilages of the articulations, seem to
be entirely formed by it; while others, like nail, quill and tortoise
shell, can hardly be said to contain any; and that by its presence in
various states and proportions, it may be regarded as the principal
cause of those degrees of flexibility, of elasticity and of putrescibility,
so various in different parts of animals.
     In all these substances, when   all     the gelatin they contained had
been      separated,   either   by  repeated  boiling
                                                  in     water, or   bybeing
steeped  in     dilute  acids,
                           a       more insoluble substance remained
                                                                          of
                                                                          a
very different nature from the gelatin, and which became the object
of    another extensive analysis.       The results here led
                                                           to    the curious
and important conclusion, that the substance known by the name            of
albumen   is   in    fact the primary animal matter from which all the
others, and even the gelatin and the animal fibre, are ultimately de
rived, the formation  of       the two latter beginning with the process  of
sanguification  in     the foetus,   and the immense variety
                                                           in    the animal
creation     being  deducible from the infinite diversity and modifications
in    texture, flexibility, elasticity, and other properties of    the same
substance composing the several parts which constitute the bodies
of animals.

                                 a              the other hand touches the  in
 summit       the column, will experience shocks and
                 of                                          pricking pain                           a                             as
 high      as   the wrist           of    the hand plunged                   in    the water, and even some

                                       28
  times as high as the elbow, while in some cases even the wrist of
  the other hand will experience a similar sensation.
     It has been ascertained by repeated trials, that these effects are
  stronger in proportion to the greater distance of the metallic pairs,
  which are made to communicate.          Some sensation will be produced
  when the foot of the column is connected with the third or fourth
  pair, but it will perceptibly increase as we proceed further towards
  the summit.    This naturally led to an extension of the column much
  beyond the number of metallic pairs above mentioned; and expe
  dients are here suggested for rendering such extended columns stable
  and at the same time sufficiently manageable.         With a column of
  about sixty pairs of plates, shocks have been felt as high as the
  shoulder; such a column may be even divided into two or three
  distinct cylinders, which being well connected by metallic conduc
  tors, will be equally powerful and much more convenient.
     Among various other modes of applying the same agents, the author
  describes an apparatus in which the fluid is interposed between the
  metals without being absorbed in a spongy substance. This consists
  of a number of cups or goblets, of any substance except metals, placed
  in a row either straight or circular, about half filled with a saline so
  lution, and communicating with each other so as to form a kind of
  chain, by means of a sufficient number of metallic arcs or bows, one
  arm of which is of silver, or copper plated with silver, and the other
  of zinc. The ends of these bows are plunged into the liquid in the
  same successive order, namely, the silver ends being all on one side,
 and those of zinc on the other,        a condition absolutely necessary to
 the success of the experiments, it having been observed that if out of
 sixty bows, for instance, the twenty intermediate ones be turned in
 the opposite direction from the remainder, the effects produced by
  the apparatus will be far less perceptible.
     It was observed, that if a circular communication be completed by
 means of a bow connecting the first and last of a long series of cups,
 two hands, or even two fingers plunged into one of these cups will
 still receive an electric sensation. This is explained by admitting the
 fact, that warm animal substances, and particularly their fluids, are
 in general better conductors than water.
    The sensible effects of either of these apparatus, composed of
forty or fifty links, do not, it seems, consist merely in shocks, con
tractions, or spasms in the muscles or limbs; but, besides affecting
the sense of touch, they are also capable of exciting an imitation in
the organs of taste, sight, and even hearing.         A particular account
is  given  of these singular  effects, from which we learn, that the more
sensible the   parts  are which are exposed to the impressions of this
agent, the more    quick will be the sensation;that as to taste, we have
only to recollect the experiments formerly described by the author,
in which the tongue was sensibly affected by the combination of two
metals applied to each side of it;-that with respect to the sense of
vision, the sparks yielded by this apparatus are sufficient evidence of
the effect, certain expedients only being necessary for facilitating the

                                                   29
perception  of these explosions;and lastly, that the hearing will be
strongly affected by introducing into the ears two probes, the oppo
site extremities of which are connected with the two ends of the ap
paratus. No effect has as yet been produced upon the sense of smell
by this machine, which is ascribed to the circumstance of the electric
effluvia not being expanded in and conveyed by the air, which it is
thought is the proper vehicle for exciting sensations in the olfactory
InerWeS.
      the close of the paper the author points out the striking analogy
     At
there is between this apparatus and the electric organs of the tor
pedo and electric eel, which are known to consist of membranaceous
columns filled from one end to the other with a great number of                                   la
minae or pellicles, floating in some liquid which flows into and fills
the cavity. These laminae cannot be supposed to be excited by fric
tion, nor are they likely to be of an insulating nature; and hence
these organs cannot be compared either to the Leyden phial, the
electrophore, the condenser, or any other machine capable of being
excited by friction.   As yet, therefore, they can only be said to bear
a resemblance to the apparatus described in this paper.      The effects
hitherto known of this apparatus, and those which there is every
reason to expect will be discovered hereafter, are likely, it is thought,
to open a vast field for reflections and inquiries, not only curious but
also interesting, particularly to the anatomist, the physiologist, and
the physician.

similar to that of the Duck, and calculated for the same purposes, is

                                                                         as   to

                                                               of     but other parts
considerably deviate from each other, we find that the coloured and
the heating rays differ widely, both   their mean refrangibility and    in
                                                       *   Page 20,

                                    31
in the situations of their maxima. And we also collect that the pro
jecting part of the heating rays, being on the side of the red or least
refrangible coloured ray, the aggregate of the former may be said to
be less refrangible than that of the latter.
   The Doctor now goes on to prove by experiments, that the sines
of refraction of the heat-making rays are in a constant ratio to their
sines of incidence, and points out the results of a correction of the dif
ferent refrangibility of heat, by contrary refractions in different media.
    Experiments are also described which show that the focus pro
duced by a lens is in fact twofold, that which is produced by the rays
of heat being in the same axis, but at some distance further from the
lens than the luminous focus,        a property that might have been in
ferred, a priori, from the less refrangibility of the heat-making rays.
    In the fifth article, which treats of the transmission of heat-making
rays through diaphanous bodies, besides the accurate description of
the various apparatus which it was necessary to contrive for the
purpose, and which can only be clearly understood by inspecting the
figures added to the paper, we find the results of 170 experiments
distinguished under the six following sections.         1. On the transmis
sion of solar heat through colourless substances; through glasses of
the different prismatic colours; through liquids, such as well and sea
water, and different spirits; and through scattering substances, such
as ground glasses, paper, linen, silk, &c.         2. On the transmission
of the heat of terrestrial flame through various substances. 3. On
the transmission of the solar rays, which are of an equal refrangibility
with the red prismatic rays. 4. On the transmission of fire-heat
 through various substances.        5. On the transmission of invisible
rays of solar heat. And lastly, (the subject which appears most preg
 nant with useful inferences for the common purposes of life,) on the
transmission of invisible terrestrial heat.      Not only the general po
 sition, that the rays of heat, both solar and terrestrial, are detained
in their passage through various bodies, appears to be here completely
 evinced, but the great variety in the power of the transmitting bodies
seems also to be determined with abundance of accuracy, and affords
matter of much consideration and curiosity.
    From the sixth article, in which it is intended to prove that the
rays of heat, both solar and terrestrial, are liable to be scattered on
rough surfaces, it appears that   all  bodies, even the most polished, are
sufficiently rough  to              in
                         scatter heat    all directions. And the chief ob
ject of  the twenty-four experiments here described,        is compare the
                                                                 to
effects   of rough surfaces  on   heat with their simultaneous effects     on
light. The general and rather unexpected result        is here brought for
ward, that colours have no concern whatever       in   the laws that relate
to the scattering  of heat.
   The chief   object   of
                         the whole  of this inquiry follows next      in
                                                                       the
seventh  article, where the question    discussed, Whether light and
                                        is
heat  be occasioned by the same     orby different rays     *One      of
                                                                       the
leading facts deduced from the experiments      in the fourth section,     is
that there are rays      heat, both solar and terrestrial, not endowed
                        of

                                         32
 with a power to render objects visible, and that there are different
degrees of heat in the prismatic spectrum of these invisible rays.
This being established, the question now, according to the original
enunciation, is in fact, Whether some of these heat-making rays
may not have a power of rendering objects visible, superadded to
their own already established power of heating bodies " From a ge
neral and comparative view of those among the preceding experiments
which apply to this question, we gather that no kind of regularity
takes place among the proportions of the luminous and heating rays
which are stopped in their passage, and that hence it might be rea
sonably inferred that heat and light are entirely unconnected.   Yet,
not to evade the above    hypothesis, the Doctor enters into a more
minute investigation of the subject, and shows that, admitting, ac
cording to the supposition, that the same rays being both luminous
and calorific, may in their passage through certain media be so af
fected as to produce the very discordant results observed in the ex
periments, it is yet evident, on a due comparison of those results,
that no given proportion that may be ascribed to this operation of
the transmitting media, will anyways account for the general phae
momena; the degrees of heat being in some instances greatly redun
dant, and in others as much deficient, both ways deviating from any
given proportion. Thus it is that he reduces his opponent to the di
lemma of either maintaining that the same agent may under different
circumstances produce effects perfectly dissimilar, such as heat with
out light, decreasing heat and increasing light, or the reverse; or
else to admit that there actually is a difference between the rays that
 give light, and those which produce heat.
    A more direct proof of the difference of the two sorts of rays is
deduced from the manifest results of the experiments, in which the
stoppage of one sort of rays does by no means occasion the stoppage
of the other sort. In investigating this subject the Doctor contro
verts a conjecture that the phaenomena observed may be ascribed to
a peculiar texture or configuration in the diaphanous substances,
which produce differences in the transmission of the rays, though
there be no difference in the rays themselves.     This hypothesis also

An Account of the Trigonometrical       Survey, carried on in the Years
   1797, 1798, and 1799, by Order of Marquis Cornwallis, Master
   General of the Ordnance.       By Captain William Mudge, of the
   Royal Artillery, F.R.S.     Communicated by His Grace the Duke of
   Richmond, F.R.S. Read July 3, 1800. [Phil. Trans. 1800, p. 539.]
   The mode of conducting this important survey having been already
noticed in the Journals of the Society on various former occasions, it
will only be necessary here to state the progress of the operation,
which we find has now been carried on over Essex, the western part
of Kent, Suffolk, and Hertfordshire, and portions of the counties con
tiguous to them.     A distinct section contains the calculations of the
sides of the   principal and secondary triangles extended over the
country in the three abovementioned years, together with an account
of the measurement of a new base-line on Sedgemoor, and a short
historical narrative of each year's operations.    Another section con
tains the computed latitudes and longitudes of the places on the
western coast intersected in 1795 and 1796, and also of such others
since determined as lie conveniently situated to the newly observed
meridians.    Here we find likewise the directions of those meridians;
one on Blackdown in Dorsetshire, another on Butterton Hill in De
vonshire, and another on St. Agnes Beacon in Cornwall; as also the
bearings, distances, &c. of the stations and intersected objects from
the several ascertained parallels and meridians.
The Croonian Lecture.      On the Irritability of Nerves.    By Everard
  Home, Esq. F.R.S. Read Nov. 20, 1800. [Phil. Trans. 1801, p. 1.]
   Its object is principally to investigate the opinion hitherto enter
tained, that the nerves may be considered as chords that have no power
of contraction within themselves, but only serve as a medium by
means of which the influence of the brain may be communicated to
the muscles, and the impressions made upon the different parts of
the body may be conveyed to the brain. After pointing out the ex
treme difficulty of such an inquiry, owing to the few opportunities
that offer for investigating the real state of the nerves in the living
body, Mr. Home intimates that he resolved to avail himself of every
opportunity that might offer of any operation in surgery performed
upon nerves, either in a healthy state, or under the influence of dis
ease, in order to elucidate this intricate point, without neglecting
certain experiments he thought he could devise upon animal bodies,
before they are wholly deprived of life.
   The first case, which explains some circumstances respecting the
actions of the nerves when under the influence of disease, was that
of a middle-aged person, who, having hurt his thumb by a fall, expe
rienced long after an occasional swelling and convulsions in that part,
attended with spasms, which at times extended in the direct course
of the trunks of the radial nerve up to the head, the patient being at
times afflicted with absolute insensibility.    In order to put a stop to
                                     D

                                   34
the progress of this irritation, which seemed to constitute the disease,
it was proposed to divide the nerve as it passes from under the an
nular ligament of the wrist. This operation was accordingly per
formed, but not altogether with the desired success, owing probably
to the wound not healing by the first intention.
   Among several singular circumstances in this case, we find also a
retraction which took place in the cut ends of the nerve at the time
of the operation; and the first idea that suggested itself, was to en
deavour to ascertain whether this effect arose from an increase of a
natural action in the nerves, or of one newly acquired and entirely
produced by the disease.        Various experiments were accordingly
made on the cutaneous nerves of rabbits, and the phrenic nerve of
horses immediately after they were killed.     The results were, that a
considerable retraction always took place, and that any action the
nerves are capable of exciting is nearly as strong after apparent death
has taken place from a violence committed upon the brain (the horses
having been killed by such means), as while the animal is in perfect
health.
    As it might be suspected that the cellular membrane is the agent
 by which this retraction of the divided nerves is produced, further
 experiments were made in such a way as to prevent any other sur
 rounding part from acting upon the nerve. Other experiments were
 also attempted, with a view to determine whether the power of con
 traction in a nerve continues for any length of time after apparent
 death has taken place, and also to ascertain what proportion of elas
 ticity may be possessed by the nerves. The results were, 1. That
 in all cases the nerves of an animal in health are capable of retracting
 themselves when divided, and that this effect is entirely independent
 of the parts by which they are surrounded.      2. That this contraction
 takes place in the nervous fibres themselves, and is independent of
 the brain from which they originate, and the muscles and other parts
 in which they terminate.      3. That the contracted nerve exhibits to
the eye an appearance of contraction (a serpentine or undulated        di
rection), which does not appear when the nerve is in a relaxed state.
    As the nerves are so easily influenced by electricity in exciting the
muscles to action, it naturally suggested itself that some further     in
formation might be obtained in the present investigation, by means
of experiments made upon the nerves by the electric fluid. From a
number that were made for the purpose, it appeared that when the
nerve had been previously contracted in consequence of being divided,
no increase of that contraction was produced by the electric fluid, nor
was any sensible effect perceived when the nerve had not been pre
viously irritated.
    During this investigation a singular case occurred, from which it
appears that electricity is capable of depriving a nerve of all  itsfunc
tions for certain time, without destroying them entirely.
          a                                                   A    young
woman, while   in   the actof   bolting the window-shutter, was struck
across the eyes by lightning, and a    second flash struck her
                                                             a   few mi
nutes after, while she was rubbing her eyes with her hand having       a

                                                 85
thimble on one of the fingers. This deprived her of sight for ten days,
after which, having had a severe hysterical paroxysm, her vision re
turned, but convulsive and hysterical sensations still remained, from
which she was not relieved till six weeks after. This case, which the
author conceives to be a proof that the electric fluid is capable of sus
pending the functions of the optic nerve without altogether destroy
ing them, suggested the idea of some further experiments, with a
view to ascertain whether electricity could be so applied, by artificial
means, as to destroy the power of contraction possessed by nerves.
The effects seemed to prove the negative; but it is owned these ex
periments were made under circumstances which did not inspire much
confidence.
   It appears, in general, that these experiments, and the observations
deduced from them, materially illustrate an action or power inherent
in the nervous chords, capable of producing the symptoms which oc
curred in the cases here related; and that the once favourite hypo
thesis of a nervous fluid, does not give a satisfactory solution of those
nervous agitations, which only proceed for some way in the course
of a nerve, and are there arrested without being allowed to proceed
to the brain. The disorder known by the name Tic Douloureux, is
given as an example of the manner in which spasmodic tremors are
propagated along the nerves. And a case of a locked jaw occasioned
by an injury to the thumb, is lastly mentioned, which corroborates
all that has been said concerning the first case mentioned in this
paper.
The Bakerian Lecture. On the Mechanism of the Eye. By Thomas
 Young, M.D.F.R.S. Read Nov.27, 1800. [Phil. Trans. 1801, p.23.]
   The copious contents of this lecture relate chiefly to the power pos
sessed by the eye to accommodate itself to the perception of objects
at different distances, concerning which a variety of opinions have
been entertained.

it appears that though the extent of the field of perfect vision for each
position of the eye be not very great, yet there is reason to believe

where a perpendicular from the centre falls on the line bisecting the

place and magnitude of the image of a small object after refraction
at any number of spherical surfaces.      6. To determine the law by
which the refraction of a spherical surface must vary, so as to collect
parallel rays to a perfect focus.   7. To find the principal focus of a
sphere or lens, of which the internal parts are more dense than the
external. And lastly, to find the nearer focus of parallel rays falling
obliquely on a sphere of variable density.    How these various propo
sitions, both problems and theorems, apply to the structure and func
tions of the eye, will be manifest to those anyways acquainted with
investigations of this nature.
   As the focal distances of the eye, whether permanent or variable,
 must be one of the principal data upon which this inquiry is to pro
 ceed, an instrument for readily determining these distances could not
but be avery essential desideratum. Although due praise be here given
to Dr. Portenfield's optometer, invented for that purpose, Dr. Young,
thinking it capable of considerable improvements, describes another
apparatus of a more simple construction, and much more convenient
and accurate in its application.       Its principle depends on the cir
cumstance, that when we look at any object through two small holes
within the limits of the pupil, if the object be at the point of perfect
vision, the image on the retina will be single; but in every other case
the image, for reasons previously stated, will become double, and
will appear as two lines crossing each other in the point of perfect
vision. Thus we see that this point of intersection coincides with that
of perfect vision, and by the help of a lens, and of a scale deduced
from one of the corollaries of the fourth proposition, we are enabled
to determine the focal distance of every eye. The mechanical part of
this apparatus must be learnt from the figures which accompany the
lecture.
   On these principles, and with this instrument, the author proceeds
next to investigate the dimensions and refractive powers of the human

efficacy of a change of figure in the lens, was derived from various
instances of persons, who, after they were deprived of that part of the
organ, still retained the faculty of accommodation. The result of this
inquiry was, contrary to expectation, that in an eye deprived of the
crystalline lens, the actual focal distance, as ascertained by the opto
meter, is totally unchangeable: for the proofs deduced in favour of
this assertion, the author acknowledges himself indebted to Mr. Ware,
who obligingly introduced him to several of his patients on whom the
operation had been performed.       Having thus, then, pointed out the
inconveniences attending all the other hypotheses, and some imper
fections in the experiments adduced in their favour, and having re
moved the principal objections to the opinion of an internal change
of the figure of the lens, the Doctor proceeds to describe some ex
periments which he conceives come very near to a mathematical de
monstration of the existence of such a change, and likewise in a great
measure explain its origin and the manner in which it is effected.
The results of these experiments are deduced from the different dis
tribution of light in the image of a lucid point on the retina, according
to the different states of the eye; and inferring thence, on the ma
thematical principles above laid down, what form of the lens will ac
count for those different impressions.     It is here acknowledged that
the mere action of the external coats of the lens, does not, as was
stated by the author eight years ago, afford a satisfactory explanation
of the phaenomenon. It seems, however, manifest, that changes of
figure take place in the lens, which can be produced by no external
cause; and this seems to establish the muscularity of the lens, long
since suggested by Dr. Pemberton, Albinus, and others.         The words
of the author on this subject are,    If  we compare the central parts
of each surface of the lens to the belly of a muscle, there is no diffi
culty in conceiving their thickness to be immediately (or sponta
neously) increased, and to produce an immediate elongation of the
axis, and an increase of the central curvature; while the lateral parts
cooperate according to their distances from the centre, and in dif
ferent individuals in somewhat different proportions. And an inti
mation is here added, that it would be worthy of inquiry, whether
the state of contraction may not also immediately add to the refrac
tive powers of the lens.
   In the last section we find some anatomical illustrations of the
construction and capacity of the organs of various classes of animals
for the functions attributed to them. The human lens is not only
ascertained to be of a radiated structure, but, on close inspection,
the number of radiations is found to be ten on each side.            The
greatest pains were taken to trace nerves into the lens, but as yet
without success. The author, however, declares his conviction of
their existence, and of the precipitancy of those who have absolutely
denied them ; and adduces some observations in favour of this asser
tion. He next describes a zone, or gland, surrounding the margin
of the crystalline, which he has observed in many animals, and which,
from some phaenomena of vision, he also infers in the human eye.

                                     39
   Some observations are lastly added concerning the nature and
situation of the ciliary processes in various animals; also on the
nature of the marsupium nigrum of birds, and the horseshoe-like
appearance in the choroid of fishes; both which have improperly
been termed muscular,     the former being a mere duplicature of a
membrane which may be unfolded; and in the latter the whole mass
being evidently of an uniform texture, the fibrous appearance which
has misled some former observers being the effect of transverse fis
sures, or cracks, which may easily be mistaken for filaments.
   The lecture concludes with a few observations on the bony scales
of the eyes of birds, to which the author denies any concern in
changing the focus of the eye; and on a cavity observable in the
eyes of some insects which has been supposed to be in some measure
                                                                   -

On the necessary Truth    of   certain Conclusions   obtained by Means   of
  Imaginary Quantities.    By Robert Woodhouse, A.M. Fellow of
  Caius College.   Communicated by the Rev. S. Vince, A.M. Plumian
  Professor of   Astronomy  in the University of Cambridge.   Read
  January 8, 1801. [Phil. Trans. 1801, p. 89.]
    The object of this paper is to show, that we may be assured of the
justness and accuracy of conclusions obtained by means of imaginary
quantities, without verifying such conclusions by separate investiga
tions, or without inferring their truth from analogy. In the first part
 the author premises at some length certain arguments, to show that
 the operations with impossible quantities must have a logic equally
 strict and certain with the logic that appertains to real quantities,
 and that the aid obtained by these quantities would be perfectly use
 less if such conclusions rested only on the frail basis of analogy.
    The author proceeds next to show that operations with imaginary
 quantities are by no means mechanical, but that they are conducted
 according to the rules of strict and rigorous logic; and that, although
 strictly speaking no proposition concerning them can be true or false,
 yet, after the demonstrations of certain formulae for real quantities,
 demonstrations with impossible quantities may be legitimately and
 logically conducted.    The series, for instance, for the development
 of an  exponential,  when the exponent is an impossible quantity, can
 never, independently of certain arbitrary assumptions, be duly esta
 blished; and yet, when the exponent is the sign of a real quantity,
 the formula for the development may be rigorously proved.          With
 regard to demonstration, it is shown, as in the case of real quantities,
 it actually proceeds by a series of transformation, each proved to be
  the same as the foregoing, not by any arguments grounded on the
 properties of real quantities, but by reference to the forms certain
 abridged symbols are made to represent, and to the nature of the
 operations directed to be performed with certain signs.
     After thus establishing the principle by which operations with
 imaginary characters are regulated, the author shows      its
                                                             efficacy and

the use of imaginary characters in the summation of series, proceed
ing according to the powers of the series and cosines of arcs in
arithmetical progression.  He likewise shows, that according to his
mode of explanation, certain ambiguous expressions that occur in
analysis are perfectly intelligible, and that in the controversy con
cerning the logarithms of negative quantities, carried on formerly
between Leibnitz, Bernoulli, Euler, and Dalembert,             paradox and                   all
ambiguity may        made   bedisappear,      referring
                                               to                       by
                                                             the origin and                 to
real import     the impossible
                      of        exponential   quantities.
   Although the principal object       this paper             of
                                                          vindicate the           is   to                              in

   The head of this animal, or rather foetus, for it was not born alive,
was disproportionately small, and had no resemblance to the natural
form except in the external ears, which were contiguous, and placed
on the front part of the head. Between them was an opening, which
proved to be the common passage to both the oesophagus and the
trachea.    All the organs which are usually found on the face were
here wanting; there being neither eyes, nose, nor any of the appa
ratus belonging to the mouth : the cranium was formed into a hard
bone, bearing a near resemblance to the head of a tortoise, and about
the size of a plover's egg.
   On dissecting this singular production, it was found that the whole
cerebrum and             all   its
                       nerves were wanting.              hence inferred that

which a structure has been observed, of which no other animal is as
yet known to partake.
   In cutting through the eye, four processes were met with, arising
by distinct tendons from the internal or posterior portion of the scle
rotic, which, passing forward, gradually became broader, and insen
sibly lost themselves in and formed a part of the choroid. These
processes had a muscular appearance.            The ciliary processes were
affixed to the  crystalline  lens,  which was nearly spherical, with the
anterior surface somewhat flattened.

culiar    this          After     historical account     the little that
has hitherto been known concerning this substance, Count Bournon.

                                      44
 proceeds to describe the external appearance of the specimens he
 has had opportunities to examine; and from these characters,             to
 gether with an accurate analysis of the different sorts made by
  Mr. Chenevix, he deduces the following classification of this new
  mineral.
     The principal distinction is in arseniates of copper and of iron.
  Of the former there are four species:
     1. Arseniates of copper, in the form of an obtuse octaedron.        This
 is said to be the most simple, and appears to be the original form of
  an ore. The minute descriptions of the crystals are in this, as in all
 other species, illustrated by delineations.     This sort is very light, its
  average specific gravity being 28.819. Its hardness is inconsiderable,
 and its transparency seldom perfect.        Its colour is either a beautiful
 deep blue or a fine grass-green, and sometimes white with a slight
 blue cast. According to the analysis, this variety of colours depends
  chiefly on the quantity of water which enters into the crystallization.
     2. Arseniate of copper in hexaedral laminae with inclined edges.
 The colour of this ore is a fine deep emerald green, and sometimes a
 light green. Two of the six sides have so great a lustre that they
 often assume the appearance of metallic foils. Its specific gravity is
  25.488. It is less hard than the preceding species. Its thin crystals
  are transparent, and it frequently decrepitates in fire.
     3. Arseniate of copper in the form of acute octaedrons. Its colour
 is a brown or bottle-green, the surface often reflecting a golden tint.
 Its specific gravity is 42.809. It is sufficiently hard to scratch fluor
 spar, but not glass. Its transparency is generally very great. These
 general characters are by no means permanent.           Its crystals are not
 always determined, nor does it at all times exhibit a similarity of
 colours. These differences of form and aspect have induced the
 Count to distinguish five varieties, which are denominated as follows:
 1. Capillary of a determinate form; 2. Capillary of an indetermi
 nate form; 3. In crystals perfectly regular in one part of their
 lengths, and fibrous at their extremity; 4. Amianthiform, consisting
 of very delicate flexible fibres; and 5. Hematitiform, not unlike the
 tin ore known by the name Wood-tin.
    4. Arseniate of copper in the form of a triedral prism.As the
 crystals of this species are seldom sufficiently insulated to be distinctly
perceivable, and are in general so small as to escape the naked eye,
all their various forms are here more particularly described, and also
their progressive change of figure as they deviate from their primitive
configuration. Its specific gravity is 42-809. Its hardness is not so
great as that of the preceding species, as it does not easily scratch
calcareous spar.      Its crystals are often transparent, and of a very
beautiful blueish-green colour; but their surface easily decomposes,
and the crystals then become black and perfectly opaque.
    The second class, being the arseniates of iron, is distinguished into
two species:
    1. The arseniates of iron, properly so called.This ore crystallizes
in perfect cubes, sometimes, though rarely, a little flattened. . Its

                                     45
specific  gravity is 30'000:      its hardness just sufficient to scratch
calcareous spar.     Its crystals, which are tolerably transparent, are
of a dark green colour, with sometimes a brownish tinge; and when
a decomposition takes place, the crystals pass into the state of a
pulverescent oxide of a fine reddish yellow colour.
   The 2nd species is denominated cupro-martial arseniate. Its
crystals are of an uncommon brilliancy, and perfectly transparent:
their form is a rhomboidal tetraedral prism. Its specific gravity is
34:003 : its hardness rather greater than that of the arseniate of
iron; the colour, a very faint sky-blue, sometimes a little deeper.
Hitherto this ore has not been met with in any form but that of a
perfect crystal.

.  After having perused the accurate detail of the external characters
and crystalline varieties by which Count de Bournon, in a paper he
lately communicated to the Society, identified the several species of
the ores mentioned in the title, the mineralogist will surely be grati
fied to find in this, which may be considered as a continuation of the
Count's treatise, an elaborate analytical investigation, whereby not
only the above-mentioned classification is fully confirmed, but also
some progress is made in the theory of the docimastic art. After
pointing out the principal imperfection of this art, and in what
manner more precision is likely to be obtained, both as to the pro
cesses and the terms used in describing them, Mr. Chenevix enters
into a full detail of the mode in which he proceeded in his inquiry,
and of the many precautions he used in order to obviate every pos
sible deception.    The results, he repeatedly declares, have been to
him singularly satisfactory, as they fully evince that great confidence
can be placed in the crystallographical arrangement, and that in fact
the evidence obtained by the two modes reciprocally contribute to
confirm the inferences derived from each.
   These results, as far as they relate to the arseniates of copper, are
briefly these :
   The natural arseniate of copper exists in three different states of
combination; the first containing 14, the second 21, and the third
28 per cwt. of the arsenic acid.
   Each of these may contain different proportions of water, either as
constituting a hydrate, or as water of crystallization.
   Upon losing their water they generally pass from a blue to a pale
green colour, and finally to brown.
    One species only, being the first of the Count's classification, can
 be considered as a real arseniate of copper; the others, from the

                                       46
  quantity and combination of the water they contain, being more
  properly arseniates of hydrate of copper.
     This first species is not to be put on the same footing with the
 others; since, by admitting a due proportion of water, it would, by
  calculation, be reduced to a lower class than that which it really
  occupies.
     Lastly, the proportion of acid in each of the species except No. 2.
 is here assigned. And as to this last-mentioned species, it is observed,
 that it is to be considered as a particular variety, consisting of a much
 greater proportion of oxide, with a less quantity of water, combined
 with nearly the same proportion of arsenic acid.
     After having carefully examined the natural arseniates, Mr. Che
 nevix paid some attention to a few artificial ones, being precipitates
 from nitrate of copper, by an arseniate of ammonia.          And here he
 found very different proportions of the ingredients, the arsenic acid
 in one species being no less than 40 per cent.         Hence we gather,
 that only two simple ingredients, combined in four different pro
 portions, produce no less than eleven different species or com
 binations, which are now determined both by external and chemical
 characters.
     Speaking next of the arseniates of iron, Mr. Chenevix observes,
 that they have but lately been distinguished from those of copper.
 One species, in fact, contains a sufficient proportion of this last metal
to merit the name of cupreous arseniate of iron. This proportion was
 27.5 of iron to 22:5 of copper, both in the oxide state; the arsenic
 acid amounting to 33°5, whilst 12 of water and 3 of silica made up
 within 1; the 100 parts on which the experiment was tried. The
 proportions of what is properly called the arseniate of iron were
 45 oxide of iron, 9 oxide of copper, 31 arsenic acid, 10 water, and
4 silica. Upon this ore are often seen certain crystals of a cubic
form and of a deep brownish red, which, according to Count de
Bournon, are in a state of decomposition. These were found to con
tain but little acid or water, probably owing to their decomposition.
    Artificial arsemiates of iron, produced by the decomposition of green
and red sulphate of iron by arseniate of ammonia, were next examined.
The ingredients of the green arseniate were found to be, 43 oxide of
iron, 38 arsenic acid, and 19 water; and of the red arseniate, 36-5
oxide of iron, 41-5 arsenic acid, and 20 water.
    Observing in the course of these experiments a great variety of
appearances assumed by the combinations of iron with salts, the
oxygen, and other ingredients, the author enters into a curious        in
quiry on this subject; from which he deduces, in particular, the great
variety of colours exhibited by that metal in divers stones or fossils,
in which that variety, he infers, is derived from the different degrees
of oxygenation of the iron.
    In a third section the author enters into an analysis of a red
octaedral copper ore found in Cornwall, of which he had occasion to
examine several specimens in the preceding investigation. After
describing several fruitless attempts, chiefly by means of acids, to

                                                             47
decompose this ore, he had recourse to a process to which he was
led by some instances he had before observed, in which a mixture of
two compounds of the same ingredients, but in different proportions,
remained insoluble, while a third substance seemed to operate upon
 at least one of these two compounds, and to produce the decompo
sition that was aimed at. The following is the manner in which he
explains this operation:When a metallic oxide A, for instance,
containing 25 per cent. of oxygen, is in contact with the metallic
 oxide B, containing 10 per cent., they will each remain quiescent in
their respective states; but if a solvent C, for which the substance B
has no affinity at 10 per cent. of oxygen, but a powerful one at 15
or 20 per cent., comes to be added, then may the oxide A lend a
                                            B,

     This singular production has hitherto been found only         small                                 in   a
lake    in   Carniola, called Sitticher See, and has never yet been met

with in other large lakes of the neighbourhood,     although these be
known to communicate with the former by subterraneous channels.
The specimens which have as yet reached either the public or private
collections are so few, that all the descriptions hitherto given by
Laurenti, Scopoli, Herman, Schneider, and Gmelin, have been found
equally defective and erroneous, especially as to the anatomical con
struction, which, indeed, those able naturalists have scarcely had
opportunities of investigating. This defect probably gave rise to a
difference of opinion concerning the class to which this animal is to
be annumerated; some considering it as a species arrived at    degree                                      its
ofperfection, while others maintain that     the larva      some kindit   is                   of

respiratory organs or lungs of other amphibious animals; but a simi
lar viscus he has hitherto sought for in vain in the larvae of water
lizards or other animals of that description.
   Concerning the habits of this singular animal, we learn from a
friend of the author, who resides near the lake where it is found, and
who had the good fortune to keep one of them alive during several
days, that it seemed at all times very torpid; that though it would
occasionally swim with the help of its broad tail, it was in general
motionless at the bottom of the water.        Sometimes it rose to the
surface, stretched its head out of the water, seemed to take in air,
but immediately returned to the bottom.        It crept by means of its
feet both at the bottom and on the side of the vessel, but so slowly
that the circumstance may be thought characteristic of the animal.
Sometimes, putting its head out of the water, it produced a hissing
noise, louder than could have been expected from so small an animal.
   The author, lastly, compares this singular production with the Siren
lacertina of Linnaeus, which has since been classed with the fishes
under the name of Muraena Siren, and finds a considerable analogy
between the two: and though he seems unwilling to determine whe
ther the animal he describes be perfect, or only a larva of some un
known species, the facts he has adduced will probably be thought to
favour the former of these opinions.

   The following definitions of these new terms, together with the
principal circumstances relating to those appearances, as deduced
from a long series of observations, will, it is hoped, sufficiently indi
cate the contents of this section. Whoever peruses this paper must,
however, here recollect that Dr. Herschel has long considered the
sun as an opake habitable globe, possessed of an atmosphere in
which luminous clouds, ever varying in form and dimensions, are
continually floating, and produce the appearances of which the fol
lowing is an enumeration.
   I. Openings, or places where the luminous clouds are removed.
When these are large, they have generally flats about them; and the
small ones are without flats. They are also frequently attended by
ridges and nodules.     New and incipient openings frequently break
out near former   ones;   and they often change their figure, run into
each  other,  and turn into shallows, or other appearances of a different
description.
   2. Flats.-These are described as planes depressed below the ge
neral or brightest surface of the sun, or places from whence the                       lu
minous solar clouds of the upper regions are removed. Their thick
ness is visible at the edges of the openings: from the various changes
they undergo, it is inferred that they are occasioned by some emana
tion, perhaps an elastic gas, coming out of the openings, which by
 itspropelling motion drives away the luminous clouds from the place
where     meets with the least resistance,
           it                                   which by     nature dis
                                                              or              its

                                        them.
      Ridges,
      3.              or
                      elevations above the general surface                   of
                                                                    the luminous
  clouds   of  the sun.These generally accompany openings, and often
  gather and disperse alternately. They are ascribed                         to
                                                                     some elastic
  gas, acting below the luminous clouds, which first lifts them up, and
 at   last forces itself passage through them
                           a                                       by
                                                          throwing them aside.
      4.  Nodules.These are small but highly elevated luminous places.
 They may frequently              ridges fore-shortened, and are probably
                                 be                                                     in
 all cases produced        inthe same manner.
     5.   Crankles.These consist            elevations and depressions, which
                                               of
 produce    a   mottled  appearance     that often spreads over the whole disk
of    the sun.     They    frequently   change their shape and situation, and
 may perhaps         be
                      occasioned          by
                                         the expansion      ridges  of        or
                                                                       nodules.
     6.  The dark    parts     crankles are here called Shallows.-The small
                                of
 ones have      noopenings; but          some larger ones apertures have been
                                          in
 perceived, through which the opake part                      of
                                                       the sun was discernible.
 They are thought          to   be   of
                                    the same nature       flats, and are perhaps
                                                                   as
at   the same depth below them               the flats are below the general
                                               as
 surface of the sun.
     7.  Dimples are small depressions,           indentures, and often contain
                                                    or
very small openings.          They differ from crankles chiefly         size.     in
   8.    Lastly, the low places         dimples are called Punctures.
                                          of                                These
increase sometimes, and become openings, and                            at
                                                              other times vanish
very rapidly.
  Having thus enumerated, according                      to   his new nomenclature,    the

                                                          51
phaenomena from which he derives his inferences concerning the na
ture of the sun, Dr. Herschel proceeds next to treat of the regions of
solar clouds. The point he here principally insists upon,        that the                                   is,
above-mentioned appearances are wholly incompatible with the hy

fluid    of atmospheric nature; since,       the laws                   by
                                                            hydrostatics,                           of

              as                       The opinion he advances              that this                    is,

phoric clouds, residing             the higher regions
                                                                                  or of
                                              in             the solar atmosphere.
Of these           he
                assumes two different regions,                   double stratum           a                                 of

                                                                             is

clouds are also more closely connected, while the upper ones are
chiefly detached from each other, and permit                     everywhere       see     us                           to

  A     number        additional observations are here added; from which
                           of
itis   inferred, that the inferior clouds are opake, and probably not
unlike those          our planet; and that their light

 clouds, the absence of ridges, nodules, large openings, and flats, de
 note a spare emission of heat, and may induce us to expect severe
 SeaSons.
    Pursuing this last idea, Dr. Herschel subjoins, at the end of his
 paper, a comparative view of the best accounts that are to be met
 with of the appearances of the sun at particular periods as far back
 as the middle of the seventeenth century, with the state of the sea
sons during the same periods.      Of the latter, the best information
could  only be  gathered from the state of vegetation, particularly of
corn, of the price of which registers have been kept many years back:
and though this price be by no means an accurate criterion of the
quantity of corn produced, yet it is recurred to as the least objec
tionable that could be obtained.     The result of this review actually
leads to the conclusion, that the price of wheat has constantly risen
during the time the sun has been without spots; and that it has
always fallen when those spots began to re-appear.
   The Doctor seems aware of some fallacy in this mode of argumen
tation; but he adds some hints by which several of the objections
might, he thinks, be obviated.
Observations on the Structure, and Mode of Growth, of the grinding
  Teeth of the Wild Boar, and Animal incognitum.       By Everard
  Home, Esq. F.R.S. Read May 7, 1801.          [Phil. Trans. 1801,
  p. 319.]
  The author on a former occasion laid before the Society an account
of certain peculiarities in the growth of the grinding teeth of the
Sus aethiopicus, and pointed out the similarity of their structure to
 that of the elephant. Having since discovered that a like resemblance
 extends also to the dentition of the wild boar, though in a less de
 gree, and at a later period of life, he is pleased to communicate to
 the Society, in his present paper, some further remarks on this cu
 rious subject.
    We here learn, that in the species of the Sus, the first or tempo
 rary grinders are sixteen in number; viz. four in each side of the
 upper, and as many in the under jaw; that these are shed in the usual
 manner; and that their places are supplied by larger teeth, rising
 from the substance of the jaw, immediately under the old ones;
 that before these first teeth are shed, one of the more permanent
 grinders is formed in the posterior part of each jaw, which, although
it be in    its
             place with the first set,
                                     is  yet  to   beconsidered    belong
                                                                  as
ing  to the second;   that besides these five   teeth, the rudiments   of
                                                                        a
sixth are formed      each jaw, which afterwards grows larger than the
                       in
preceding ones, the jaw increasing        size,
                                         in        so   as  make room for
                                                             to
this as the posterior grinder;   that this tooth, when perfect,   isdouble
the size     the other grinders,
            of                     its  masticating surface having eight
fangs,    so
           that   very much resembles two large grinding teeth
                  it                                                   in
corporated into one; that,   in  time, the rudiments         of
                                                             seventh tooth
                                                              a

                                               53
appear in each jaw, but that the further progress of these could not
be observed, none of the specimens the author has had opportunities
of inspecting, appearing to be more than seven years old.
   Mr. Home proceeds next to observe, that the elephant, the Sus
aethiopicus, and the wild boar, are the only recent animals in which
he has hitherto met with so extensive a masticating surface of the
grinding teeth; the human species only excepted, in which the mode
of dentition is somewhat upon the same principle as that of the wild
boar, with this difference, that the hindmost teeth, called, from the
late period of life at which they cut the gum, Dentes Sapientiae, do
not exceed the others in size, and have often not sufficient room in
the jaw to come into their regular place. A conjecture is hence de
rived, that when the period of man's life was longer than it is at
present, the growth of the posterior part of the jaw was continued
for a greater length of time, so as not only to make room for the
present, but perhaps also to admit of a succession of a still greater
number of additional grinders.
   Upon comparing the grinders of the boar with the large fossil
teeth found on the banks of the Ohio, they were found so much alike,
both in their external appearance and internal structure, as to render
it more than probable that they are teeth of the same kind, only dif
fering in size. Not so, however, those of the fossil skeleton some
time since found in South America, and described by M. Cuvier.
These were found so unlike those of the boar, or the above-men
tioned incognitum, as to leave no doubt of        being         its
                                                            animal                 an              of
                                                                                                   a
different genus.
   From the progressive mode         dentition above described,
                                           of                        in                     it    is

                                       the wild boar, some quotations
from ancient authors are here adduced, which indicate that boars of
enormous size have         different times existed; whence the proba

the bark.   For this purpose, circular incisions were made round a
number of   young  healthy trees, and the bark removed for the space
of about half an inch,  or more, of the whole circumference. This,                                       it
was found, by no means impeded the growth of the upper part of the
tree; but, on the other hand, the part of the stem below the incision
scarcely grew at all, and in time even seemed to wither.     From the
whole of this investigation it seems probable, that the current of sap
which adds the annual layers of wood to the stem, so far from
ascending, actually descends from the young branches and leaves
through the bark.     The branches and leaves which supply this fluid
became hence the next objects of the inquiry. ------             -     -
   The conjecture just now mentioned was here confirmed by the
circumstance, that when a branch or leaf was left between two                                       cir
cular incisions, it continued to receive its nourishment as usual; and
the bark under it gave evident marks of increasing vegetation, while
that above was not only stationary, but seemed even to decay.
   It became now necessary to investigate by what channels leaves
receive their nourishment. Some annual shoots were cut from trees,
and placed in a coloured infusion.       Although this fluid, it was ob
served, certainly rose into the leaves, yet neither the bark nor the
medulla was sensibly tinged by it; but in the centre of the stalks
of the leaves were found several bundles of tubes which had been
manifestly coloured, and must hence have been the channels of com
munication. These tubes were surrounded by others, which, being
traced downwards, were found to enter the inner bark, and by no
means to communicate with the tubes of the wood : these being
colourless, it may reasonably be concluded that they convey a dif
ferent fluid from that which ascends into the leaf.                  -
   To the  former, or internal tubes, which had not   yet been distin
guished by any name, the author thinks          assign the appellation
                                                                   fit   to
of Central Vessels.    He then mentions certain spiral tubes which
are everywhere              appendent         to    these vessels, and seem               to   proceed
from the sides of the medulla to the leaf-stalk.       Particular attention
         paid      to                           By   extracting  parts
                                      so of

chiefly of a continuation of his observations on the appearances of
that body from the 2nd of March to the 3rd of May last.
   Conceiving that there might be some advantage in getting rid of
the darkening glasses in viewing the sun, he was led to substitute for
them various liquors, such as spirits of wine, port wine, ink diluted
with water, a solution of green vitriol with a small proportion of
tincture of galls, and even plain water; which latter he found keeps
off the heat so effectually, that the brightest sun may be viewed some
time through it without any inconvenience.
   Through diluted ink, the image of the sun appeared as white as
snow; and when the liquor was still more diluted, the sun was of a
purple hue, while the objects on                      its
                                          surface continued         distinct as                as

observation of the angular distance of the two objects to that of the
coincidence of their images in one field.    In his instrument the te
lescope is fixed at such a distance from the centre that the rays of
light may arrive at the centre-glass both from the right and the left:
double distances and cross observations are thus easily obtained,
which essentially correct any imperfection in the construction of the
instrument.
    The peculiar advantages of these improvements being chiefly to
 afford the means of multiplying the observations of the distance re
quired, Mr. Mendoza has directed his attention to some further im
 provements, which he thought might be deduced from the same
principle. He accordingly favours us with an account of his new
reflecting circle, of which a distinct idea can only be obtained by an
inspection of the three accurate delineations which accompany his
paper.
   One of the additions is a compound handle, which facilitates the
holding the instrument with the same ease in every direction. But
the chief improvement appears to be a divided circle, moving round
the centre, within, and close to the graduated limb, and capable of
being alternately attached to each of the indexes.       This the author
calls the Flying Nonius; and shows how in every direction the two
divisions may be made to exhibit the number of degrees on the limb,
and of the minutes and seconds on the flying nonius. The manner
in particular of making the crossed observations, by connecting the
limb and the nonius alternately with the centre and horizon indexes,
is here fully explained.    And lastly, a small graduated semicircle is
added to the horizon    index, the use of which is to prepare the    in
strument   previous  to an observation, so as to facilitate the operation
of bringing  the  images  to coincide in the field of the telescope.
Observations and Experiments upon Dr. James's Powder; with a
  Method of preparing, in the humid Way, a similar Substance. By
  Richard Chenevix, Esq. F.R.S. M.R.I.A. Read June 4, 1801.
  [Phil. Trans. 1801, p. 375.]
   From the experiments of Dr. Pearson on the nature of Dr. James's
powder, published in the 81st volume of the Philosophical Transac
tions, our author infers that the mode in which it is prepared is far
from being the best that the present improved state of chemical
knowledge might afford; the use of fire in delicate processes, whether
analytical or synthetical, being in general thought inferior to those
performed in the humid way.
   This powder, we are told, is prepared by mixing equal quantities
of bone shavings (or phosphate of lime) and crude antimony, and
calcining them together in an intense heat.
   Here it is observed, that the portion of oxide of antimony, which
is not volatilized in the process, becomes in a great measure insoluble
in    all
       acids.   The humid process which Mr. Chenevix recommends.
 aspreferable  tothe above, consistsin dissolving together  separately,

in the least possible portion of muriatic acid, equal parts of the white
oxide of antimony and phosphate of lime; after which, pouring this
solution gradually into distilled water previously alkalizated by a
sufficient quantity of ammonia, a white and abundant precipitate will
be produced, which, being well washed, and dried, is the substitute
he proposes for James's powder. A few observations are added on
the theory of this combination; as also an assertion, that this powder,
administered as a medicine, perfectly agreed in its general effects
with James's powder, and the pulvis antimonialis, often prescribed
in lieu of            it,
              with this advantage, that being more mild,   may be                                         it

they can immediately form some judgement both of colours and                                             di
stances, and even of the outline of strongly defined objects.             , ºr
  That when children have been born with         cataracts, the crystalline
humour has generally been found, either in a soft or a fluid state;
and that in these cases, if the capsule be simply punctured with a
couching-needle, there is reason to expect that the opaque matter
will sooner or later be absorbed, and the sight be restored, and that
should any opacity in the capsule itself render this operation ineffec
tual, the other, viz. that of extraction,
                                 --
                                          may still be recurred to with
every prospect of success.                . . .
   Lastly, that this operation of couching being much more easy than
that of extraction, it may be attempted at a very early period; and
that thus the benefit of education may be afforded to children, much
sooner than if they were to wait till the proper age for extraction. ,
   Mr. Ware acknowledges in a note, that about a month after the
above operation he couched the other eye of his young patient, but
that he did not prove equally successful: this he ascribes to some
opacity in the capsule, which was incapable of being absorbed. The
eye, however, he adds, remained as           ever for another operation.

   The first experiments were made with tin, small plates, or arcs, of
which were made to alternate with acid and water. About twenty
sets of these produce a galvanic battery, in which the wire from the
oxidating surface of the plates evolved hydrogen, and that from the
non-oxidating surface (when of silver) deposited oxide. The second
series consisted of plates, or arcs, of silver, copper, or lead, placed
alternately between cloths steeped in water, and in solution of sul
phuret of potash.    The effects of this combination were much more
perceptible than those of the preceding.      And a still more powerful
battery was obtained by using metallic substances oxidable in acids,
and capable of acting on solutions of sulphurets, and connecting them
with oxidating fluids, and solutions of sulphurets of potash, in such
a manner that the opposite sides of every plate may undergo diffe
rent chemical changes.      How this is to be effected is here explained
at  length, and an  apparatus,  contrived by Count Rumford, is lastly
mentioned, for facilitating and giving permanency to the alternate
succession of the different substances, so as to prevent, particularly
in the fluids, the interference with each other, which would materi
ally affect the results.

   A short description is here premised of an apparatus for exposing
luminous bodies to different kinds of air, which, in addition to the
well-known glass phial or tube inverted in water, consists in a small
stand, to the top of which the luminous substance is fixed, and thus
inserted into the inverted phial, into which the species of air to be
employed is previously let up to the quantity of about eight ounces.
   With these instruments a copious set of experiments has been
made, of which the following are the principal results.
   In common or atmospherical air, all the objects which abound with
spontaneous light in a latent state, such as herrings, mackerel, &c.,
do not emit it when deprived of life, except from such parts as have
been some time in contact with the air. Nor does the blast of a pair
of bellows increase this species of light, as it does that which pro
ceeds from combustion.
   Oxygen gas does not act upon this kind of light so as to render it
much more vivid than atmospherical air. And as to azotic gas,
which is incapable of supporting light from combustion, it is remark
able that it should be so favourable to the spontaneous light emitted
from certain fishes, as to preserve its existence and brilliancy when
immersed in   it,while   prevents the flesh

rotten wood.

    Hydrogen gas in general prevents the emission of spontaneous
light, and also extinguishes it when emitted; but at the same time
it does not hinder                   its

of a preceding one by the same author, printed in the last volume of
the Philosophical Transactions, and contains an enumeration of many
more facts and circumstances, from which we gather that an aper

power of the ear, and that even a complete -destruction of that mem

gratitude to our late ingenious brother, Mr. Ramsden, to whom he
says he is chiefly indebted, not only for the information which was
necessary to enable him to prosecute his investigations upon the sub
ject of vision, but also the zeal which influenced his early exertions
 in the philosophical career.
    The opinion here alluded to was brought forward in Mr. Home's
 Lecture for the year 1794, and was founded upon experiments which
 seemed to prove that the removal of the crystalline lens does not de
prive the eye of the power of seeing distinctly at different distances.
    An additional case is here mentioned of a man who had a cataract
 extracted from each of his eyes, -and yet preserved a considerable
range of vision.
    In the Bakerian Lecture of last year, Dr. Young, having entered
minutely into the inquiry, thought himself authorized to doubt the
above inference; and in order to insure the accuracy of the ex
periments he intended to make on the subject, he constructed an
optometer upon the principle of that of Dr. Porterfield, by which he
 could ascertain the different focal lengths, and hence the power of
adjustment of every eye. The result of his experiments was, that
eyes deprived of the crystalline lens have lost their power of adjust
 ment.
    This difference of results induced Mr. Home to reconsider the sub
ject, and having sent for the man from whose eyes he had last ex
tracted the cataracts, he repeated the experiments with Dr. Young's
optometer, somewhat simplified by leaving out the lens which was
placed before the eye.       With this instrument that man was un
questionably found to have distinct vision at different distances, the
nearest focus being at only 8-3 inches, and the furthest at 13-3 inches,
while with Dr. Young's optometer he could never observe any dif
 ference whatever.
    Besides this individual, others, whose eyes had never been dis
 ordered, tried the effects of both optometers; and it should seem,
from the various impressions produced upon them, that the contra
 diction in the above results depends chiefly, if not entirely, on the
 difference of the instruments.
 The Bakerian Lecture.      On the Theory of Light and Colours.         By
    Thomas Young, M.D. F.R.S. Professor of Natural Philosophy in
    the Royal Institution.   Read November, 12, 1801.       [Phil. Trans.

    Although the mode, much practised by the ancients, of accounting
for a variety of phaenomena by a preconceived hypothesis, be, if not
wholly exploded, at least greatly discountenanced by modern phi
losophers; yet it must be owned that when a number of facts have
been collected and duly ascertained, it cannot but be conducive to
the extension of knowledge, to arrange them under certain heads,
 and, if possible, to ascribe them to some general cause; and that
 with men who are candid and not over-tenacious, even an error in

                                                           64
such a proceeding may often be the means of eliciting some further
information, which progressively may tend to the advancement of
science.  The immortal Newton has given us a striking example of
this in his Theory of Light, which, should the principle he assumed
prove ultimately erroneous, his investigation and mode of reasoning
will yet remain an everlasting monument of acuteness and ingenuity,
which it is likely will ever be found the best source of information to
those who shall engage in this delicate branch of natural philosophy.
   Under this impression, Dr. Young, having resolved to contemplate
the subject of light and heat, in the present Lecture, proposes to take
a general survey of what is extant, using the materials which, chiefly
through Newton's means, are now at hand, and at the same time to
add some new experiments of material importance in the investi
gation, in hopes thereby to establish a general principle which may
apply to all the phaenomena hitherto discovered.
   The Newtonian system of emanation, though illustrated in so
masterly a manner by its author, partly on account of the stupen
dous velocity it implies, has been ever thought liable to difficulties,
which could not be satisfactorily obviated.          Accordingly another
hypothesis, namely, that of an ethereal fluid, producing             effects                       its
either by an undulatory motion         by continued pressure, had been
                                                       or        a
substituted by some, without however entering             methodical man           in   a
ner into the abstruse disquisition necessary                              to
                                                  establish their theories.

sages, and adduces them      support    inthe three following hypotheses.

of of
    the motion      this ether, Newton uses the term vibration instead
    undulation, which two words manifestly convey different mean
ings, the one being the alternate motion        pendulum, and the other
                                                                     of   a

colours.
  These three hypotheses, which may                                  be
                                               called essential, are here
shown          literally
               to    be  parts                        of
                                   the more complicated Newtonian
system.   But    fourth
                      a   now   advanced,
                                       is   which appears diametrically
opposite    thatto   Newton,  of
                               and differs      some measure from any in
that has been hitherto proposed                        by
                                     other writers, although the author
does not consider this difference       affecting           as
                                                      any degree      ad           in                    its

missibility.   It assumes that all material bodies have an attraction
for the ethereal medium, by means of which it is accumulated within
their substance, and for a small distance around them, in a state of
greater density, but not of greater elasticity.
   The whole theory is now applied to the phaenomena, in Nine Pro
positions, together with several scholia and corollaries. As the argu
ments on which the doctrine rests cannot be abbreviated without
impairing their evidence, we must content ourselves with merely
enumerating the heads, adding, however, a few observations which
may facilitate the understanding of the main object of the inquiry.
   All impulses, says the author in the First Proposition, are propa
gated in a homogeneous elastic medium, with an equable velocity.
The truth of this theorem has been mathematically demonstrated by
various writers, the actual motion being considered as very minute.
Prop. 2. An undulation conceived to originate from the vibration of
a single particle must expand through a homogeneous medium in a
spherical form, but with different quantities of motion in different
parts. Prop. 3. A portion of a spherical undulation, admitted through
an aperture into a quiescent medium, will proceed to be further pro
pagated rectilineally in concentric superficies, terminated laterally by
weak and irregular portions of newly-diverging undulations. The
chief purport of this last Proposition is to obviate the objection, that
if light were the effect of a widely-expanded fluid put in motion by
an impulse, it would, like the waves of water, and air in the instance
of sound, spread laterally from the original direction of the motion,
and agitate the contiguous quiescent medium; by which means we
ought to see objects as well as we hear sounds, behind an opaque
body. It is here alleged that, according to Newton's own words,
sounds diverge much less than the waves of water, the air being more
rare and elastic; and that in the very rare luminous medium, after
its undulations have passed by an opaque substance, they will indeed
diverge a little from their first direction, but this in so small a de
gree as to be almost imperceptible; whereas the loss of even this
small degree of impulse will make the progressive undulatory beam
appear somewhat contracted.        It is no small confirmation of the
theory, that this effect perfectly agrees with the result of an experi
ment mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton; though, having adopted a dif
ferent principle, he used it rather as an objection to the undulatory
system.    The subject of this Proposition having always been con
sidered as the most difficult part of the last-mentioned system, the
author has taken particular pains to clear it as much as possible from
all objections.                                       -
   The mere recital of the enunciations of the four next Propositions
will probably enablethose at            all
                                conversant with the science      optics,
                                                                       of
                                                    explain, according
to to
        perceive
               what manner the author means
                   in                                     to
  his theory, the important phaenomena      Refraction, Reflection, and
                                                    of
Colours. They are stated      the following manner.When
                                    in                              un       an
dulation arrives     surface which     the limit of media of different
                        at
                        a                      is
densities,     a   partial reflection    takes place, proportionate   in   force   to
                                              F

                                    66
the difference of the densities.   This, it is thought, may be well illus
trated, if not demonstrated, by the analogy of elastic bodies of dif
ferent sizes.    When an undulation is transmitted through a surface
terminating different media, it proceeds in such a direction that
the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction are in the constant
ratio of the velocity of propagation in the two media.           When an
undulation falls on the surface of a rarer medium so obliquely that it
cannot be regularly refracted, it is totally reflected at an angle equal
to that of its incidence.    And if equidistant undulations be supposed
to  pass through   a medium of which the parts are susceptible of per
manent vibrations somewhat slower than the undulations, their ve
locity will be somewhat lessened by this vibratory tendency; and the
more so in the same medium, the more frequent the undulations.            If
we ascribe the sensation of colours to the different velocities of the
coloured beams or undulations, this last Proposition will afford a so
lution to the phaenomena of dispersion according to the new system.
    When two undulations from different origins coincide either per
fectly or very nearly, in direction, their joint effect is a combination
 of the motions belonging to each. This is the Eighth Proposition,
 which, at first sight, appears so consistent with the most obvious
 mechanical principles, as scarcely to need any illustration; yet its
 extensive utility in explaining the phaenomena of colours renders it
perhaps the most important in the lecture.         In a first corollary the
}.
author treats of the colours of striated surfaces, where, after showing
in what manner these depend on the breadth of the undulations in
             to the distance and position of minute surfaces, it is shown
 from original experiments in what manner this circumstance affords
a very strong confirmation of the theory. But a still more interesting
 coincidence is shown in the second and third corollaries, which treat
 of the colours of thin plates, and of thick plates. It is here explained
by what means the breadth and duration of the respective undulations
may be deduced from Newton's measures of the thicknesses reflect
ing different colours; and the law of variation of colour, in conse
 quence of the change of obliquity, which is very embarrassing on every
other supposition, and had never been reduced to any analogy, is re
ferred to a simple and necessary consequence of the author's theory.
    The whole visible spectrum being estimated to be comprised within
the ratio of 3 to 5, the undulations of red, yellow and blue appear to
be related to each other in magnitude as the numbers 8, 7, and 6.
 On these data a table is constructed, showing for each primitive
 colour, and the intermediate ones between each pair of them; 1.
The length of an undulation in parts of an inch in air. . 2. The num
ber of undulations in an inch, And 3. The number of undulations
in a second. All these numbers agreeing accurately with the phae
momena, will probably be considered as a strong evidence in favour
of the theory. The appearances of colours in inflected light are like
wise explained in a subsequent corollary.                         -
    The last Proposition  may be considered as the   general  result of the
whole investigation; in consequence of which, Dr. Young thinks him,

                                                   67
self authorized to assert, without hesitation, that radiant light con
sists in undulations of the luminiferous aether. The general infer
ences he draws from his arguments are, that it is clearly granted by
Newton that there are undulations, although he denies that they
constitute light; and that it being shown in the three first corolla
ries of the Eighth Proposition, that all cases of the increase or dimi
nution of light are clearly referable to an increase or diminution of
such undulations, and that all the affections to which the undulations
would be liable are distinctly visible in the phaenomena of light, it
may therefore be very logically inferred that the undulations are
light. .           -

   The iron contained in this ore is in the same state as it is found
in Wolfram, namely, brown oxide; and this oxide is mineralized by
the new metallic acid in the same manner as the oxides of iron and
manganese are mineralized by the tungstic acid, or rather oxide.
Several facts which have appeared in the course of this investigation
seem to prove that this new metal differs from tungsten and the
other acidifiable metals by a more limited extent of oxidation; for,
unlike these, it seems to be incapable of retaining oxygen sufficient to
enable the total quantity to combine with fixed alkalies.

 the most striking peculiarities, from which some idea may be gathered
 of the importance of this performance.
    Besides four grinding teeth, one at each end of the two jaws, the
 animal has two small pointed horny teeth upon the projecting part of
 the posterior portion of the tongue, the points of which are directed
 forwards. These, it is thought, are intended to prevent the food
 from being pushed into the fauces during the process of mastication;
 and such have as yet been observed in no animal except the fla
mingo, which has a row of similar small teeth at each side of the
tongue.
    The fifth pair of nerves, which supplies the muscles of the face,
 and extend to the membrane that covers the bills, were found un
 commonly large; whence it is inferred that probably the sensibility of
 the different parts of this bill is very great, and that being capable
 of nice discrimination in         feeling,     its
                                                answers      some respects the

On the Independence of the analytical and geometrical Methods of       In
  vestigation; and on the Advantages to be derived from their Sepa
  ration. By Robert Woodhouse, A.M. Fellow of Caius College,
  Cambridge.    Communicated by Joseph Planta, Esq. Sec. R.S.
  Read  January  14, 1802.   [Phil. Trans. 1802, p. 85.]         --- -
   The author, in the prefatory part of this paper, points out the dif
ference between the two methods of solving problems,     the one using
 lines and diagrams as the signs of quantity, and making an individual
to represent a genus; and the other employing generic terms and
 signs, which bear no resemblance to the things signified; and insists
 that, in order to make the process of deduction distinct, exact, and
luminous, only one of the two methods ought to be adhered to. This,
he says, has not been sufficiently attended to, expressions and formu
las of the two methods having often been blended together, the con
sequence of which has been much ambiguity and paradox; since the
true method of combining algebraical formulas cannot be well under
stood, unless we duly attend to their true analytical source and com
bination. To show that the language of algebra need not be infected
with the mode of expression adopted by geometricians, and that it is
of itself an adequate instrument of argumentation, is the principal
object of Mr. Woodhouse's paper.          And he declares that he has
entered on this inquiry, not merely for the sake of gratifying specu
lative curiosity, being firmly of opinion that the process of calculation
will be much more direct, sure, and expeditious, if it be duly freed
from all foreign encumbrances.
    In order to illustrate and confirm this opinion, he has selected a
few cases from those expressions and formulas which are supposed
to require for their solution the aid of geometrical theorems, and of
the properties of curves.
    From purely analytical principles he has given demonstrations;
1st, of the integrals of a series for the sine of an arc in terms of the
arc; 2ndly, of the expression for the root of a cubic equation in the
irreducible case; 3rdly, of the resolution of the series a" +   a", &c.,
into quadratic factors; and, 4thly, of the series for the chord, sine,
cosine, &c. of a multiple arc, in terms of the chord, sine, &c. of the
simple arc.    These demonstrations the author presumes to be direct
and  rigorous,  which advantages, he asserts, are in a great measure
owing to the deductions being expressed in algebraical language, and
effected throughout by analytical processes.
   The paper concludes with a brief comparison of the ancient geo
metry and modern analysis respecting the advantages of perspicuity
and commodious calculation. The result of this comparison        is,
                                                                  that
some  of the excellencies ofthe former science have been exaggerated,
and others deemed essential, which         fact are only accidental.

Observations      and Experiments upon orygenized and hyperorygenized
     Muriatic Acid   ; and upon some Combinations of the Muriatic Acid in
     its three States. By Richard Chenevix, Esq. F.R.S. and M.R.I.A.
     Read January 28, 1802.       [Phil. Trans. 1802, p. 126.]
  The author introduces the subject of his paper by stating that
Mr. Berthollet, having observed a large portion of common muriate
of potash to be always produced along with the hyperoxygenized
muriate, had formed an ingenious conjecture, that the quantity of
oxygen, relatively to the acid, was greater in the salt than in dis
engaged oxygenized muriatic acid; but that no experiments having
appeared since the year 1788 to prove this assertion, he was induced
to examine the properties of the salt, and the nature of the acid it
contains.     He next mentions such authors as have treated any part
of his subject; and intimates that Mr. Hoyle of Manchester appears
to him to be the chemist, who, after Mr. Berthollet, has approached
nearest to the truth.       He then proceeds to describe the means by
which he has determined that the acid contained in his hyperoxyge
nized muriate of potash             is,
                                   fact, an acid sui generis; and those by
                                          in
which he arrived        at
                        the proportion     oxygen. After which

                   could ascertain whether there was      any  disengage

                           of                       from the salt     held
                                                                         or                   it
in solution. No    oxygen   was disengaged                     or
                                                 absorbed; and hence                               it
appears that the same quantity was now condensed           the hyperoxy       in
genized muriate      potash
                      of         was originally contained
                                          as                      relative          in   a
quantity     of
             oxygenized muriatic acid.     The salt thus obtained, Mr.
Chenevix, for the sake      brevity, calls entire salt. He analysed
                                 of                                                                it,

and found it to contain common muriate of potash 84, hyperoxy
genized muriate 16.    But by the proportions established above, 16
hyperoxygenized muriate contain 6 of oxygen, and this, with the acid
contained in the whole 100 of entire salt, gives the proportions,

   These proportions differ a little from those obtained by Mr. Ber
thollet and by Mr. Cruikshank; the former mentions 11 per cent. of
oxygen, the latter 43. But Mr. Berthollet, in all probability, used
an acid which already contained a little simple muriatic acid, or
else he did not expel                   all
                           the oxygen from his oxygenized muriatic
acid by the light            of
                      the sun.    And Mr. Cruikshank having made use
of  hyperoxygenized muriate         potash and muriatic acid,

                 examined, the result was      mixture    oxygenized anda                 of
hyperoxygenized muriatic acid gases.
   Having stated the proportions         the acids, the author passes on

man was dreadfully wounded, and was near losing his sight: by drop
ping the salt into sulphuric acid there is less danger of explosion at
the beginning; but still the acid does not come over without decom
position. By cooling the first receiver with ice, the author thinks that
he has obtained the acid in the form of little orange-coloured octahe
dral crystals.
   Nitric acid produces nearly the same phaenomena.
   Muriatic acid decomposes the salt, and takes a part of the oxygen
from the hyperoxygenized muriatic acid, and becomes oxygenized.
   Phosphoric, tartareous, oxalic, arsenic, and citric acids decompose
this salt with the help of heat.
   Some attempts were made to combine diamond with oxygen, in the
humid way, by means of this salt and this acid; but they did not
prove successful.    Caloric is mentioned as a considerable ingredient
in this as in all hyperoxygenized muriates.

    The sixth species of hyperoxygenized muriate of ammonia cannot
 be formed by direct combination.                   By pouring a solution of car
 bonate of ammonia into a solution of any of the earthy hyperoxyge
 nized muriates, the earth is precipitated with the carbonic acid, and
 hyperoxygenized      muriate of ammonia remains in the liquor.                      This
 salt is decomposed at a low temperature, and has all the characters of
 the genus to which it belongs.              It is a very striking example of the
 force of co-operating affinities which can unite this acid with ammo
 nia; while oxygenized muriatic acid decomposes that alkali. It is
 also a proof of the different attractions             exercised by these two acids
 toward the salifiable bases.
    Hyperoxygenized muriate of magnesia is the seventh species.                        Its

    The author has not determined the proportions of the eighth spe
 cies, viz. hyperoxygenized muriate of alumina, because this salt was
 always decomposed by phosphate of silver; and he imagines that
hyperoxygenized muriate of silica does not exist.
    He then states some corrections which he has made in the propor
 tions of common muriates, respecting the quantity of water they con
tain. This he esteems to have been rated too high by the chemists
who have examined them.              He exposed a given weight of muriate
of  potash  to a red  heat,    and examined it to know if any of the acid
had been    expelled.    Some portion had been volatilized, and upon
this correction he established- the           proportions
                                                -- -              he has announced in
                                        -
this  paper.
    He then passes to the metallic salts of this genus, a number of
which he has formed by passing a current of oxygenized muriatic acid
through water, in which the oxide was suspended.                            Copper, iron,
lead, and silver, he readily combined with the acid. The last of these
salts he considers with greater attention for two reasons : first, be
cause it affords a very striking difference between the hyperoxyge
nized and common muriatic acids; and, secondly, on account of its
extraordinary properties. This salt is soluble in three parts of water,
crystallizes by cooling, is not affected by light, but is decomposed by
all the weak acids, even vinegar.               Rubbed in a mortar with about
three-fourths of sulphur, it detonates by a very gentle pressure, and
with so much violence that Mr. Chenevix estimates the expansive
force at nearly ten times that of a mixture of sulphur and hyperoxy
genized muriate of potash.

                                        75
   He then states two extraordinary and unforeseen productions of
this acid: one was during an analysis of manachanite from Botany
Bay, in which oxygen had passed from oxide of titanium into a com
bination of potash with muriatic acid, and formed hyperoxygenized
muriate of potash; and the other was in distilling nitro-muriatic acid
upon platina. He tried the action of manganese in the same manner
as the titanium, but could not succeed; nor did nitric acid convert
oxygenized into hyperoxygenized muriatic acid.
   Mr. Chenevix states that Mr. Berthollet had proposed to consider
muriatic acid as the radical of the other two, and says that oxygenized
                                                      º
muriatic acid corresponds with nitrous and sulphureous acids, and    -- -
hyperoxygenized muriatic acid with nitric and sulphuric.
   Our author states the arguments in favour of the old and the new
mode of denomination;     and upon the consideration that many bodies
called acids have not been proved to contain oxygen, and that of some
the contrary has been demonstrated, he seems inclined to think that
an impartial hearing of both sides of the question must, in the present-
state of chemical knowledge, decide in favour of

   In considering the copious contents of this paper, we shall find it
convenient  to distribute them under the four following heads: 1. The
historical part; 2. The descriptive part; 3. The analytical part; and
4. General observations on the subject, and a comparison of these
stones with other substances which seem to bear some affinity to them.

to draw a comparison between their results, and those he deduces

    The instances next in succession, and which are the principal
objects of this paper, are: 1. The several stones, about twelve in
number, which in the year 1794 were seen by several persons falling
from the clouds near Sienna, in the midst of a violent thunder-storm,
and eighteen hours after an enormous eruption of Mount Vesuvius.
As an ample account of this extraordinary phaenomenon is printed
in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1795, it will be need
less to dwell here any longer upon               than merely       it,

    II. For the descriptive part of the four stones which have been
analysed by Mr. Howard, we are indebted to the Count de Bournon,
who observes in general, that none of them are, or appear ever to have
been, of any regular shape; and that when entire they are all coated
with a black crust, the thickness of which however is very incon
siderable.    The Benares stone being that which has the most striking
mineralogical characters, obtained the preference in these descriptions,
and served as an object of comparison in the account to be given of
the others.     The crust already mentioned, which is common to all,
is of a deep black colour, and of an uneven surface.            It strikes fire
with steel, and frequently contains particles of native iron. The stone
itself when broken is of a grayish ash-colour, and of a granulated
texture: it appears evidently to be composed of four different sub
stances; one of them, which is in great abundance, shows itself in the
form of small spherical bodies of various sizes, of a gray colour, some
times inclining to brown, perfectly opake, and so hard as to give
faint sparks when struck with steel. Another of these substances
is a martial pyrites, of a reddish yellow tinge, somewhat inclining to
the colour of nickel. When powdered it is of a black colour, and not
attractable by the loadstone.        The third substance consists of small
particles of iron, in a perfect metallic state. These, although they
compose only about ºth part of the whole stone, give, however, to
the whole mass the property of being attractable by the magnet.
    These three substances are united together by means of a fourth as
a  cement,   which is nearly of an earthy consistence, and of a whitish
gray. The specific gravity of the aggregate stone is 3352.
    The constituent parts of the stone from Yorkshire are exactly the
same as those of the above, except that its grain is finer, that the
globules are more irregular in their shape, that the martial pyrites is
in less, and the iron in greater proportion, and that the earthy cement
is more compact.        Its specific gravity = 3508.
    The Sienna stone was more similar to that from Benares than the
last mentioned; the particles of iron were in a somewhat greater
proportion.      It contained some particles of black oxide of iron; and
likewise one    single  globule of a vitreous substance, of a pale yellow
colour   inclining  to green,   and of a hardness rather inferior to that of
calcareous spar.      The specific weight of the aggregate was = 3418.
    Lastly, the stone from Bohemia was most similar to that from
 Yorkshire, except that it appeared to be totally free from any par
ticles of pyrites, and on the other hand to have a much larger pro
portion of globules of native iron; many of which, perhaps, on account
 of the stone having remained longer in the earth, had undergone a de
 gree of oxidation on their surfaces.       Its specific gravity was = 4281.
    From these     descriptions  we learn that these stones, though they
 have not the smallest       analogy    with any of the mineral substances
 already known, have a very peculiar and striking resemblance to each
 other; a circumstance surely which must excite the attention and

 stimulate the endeavours of philosophers, and particularly of chemical
  analysts.
     #. The foremost among these was Mr. Howard, who, in the
  third part of his paper describes the several methods by which he
  examined each of the constituent parts of these stones separately,
  avoiding thereby the mistakes of the Abbé Bachelay and Professor
  Barthold, who by making their experiments only upon the stones in
  the aggregate, obtained of course none but fallacious results.                    -
     The Benares stone being, as Count de Bournon had already men
  tioned, the most characteristic, was the first he undertook to examine.
 In analysing the crustaceous matter, in which some nickel was soon
 found to be contained, the process led to an investigation of the triple
 salt, described by Mr. Hermstadt as an ammoniacal nitrate of nickel,
 which was soon found to be a proper menstruum for discovering the
 presence of the last-mentioned metal.              The presence of iron and
 nickel was    manifestly  discovered in their     substance;     but the quantity
 that could be obtained was so small that it was found impracticable
 to give the proportions of their constituent parts.
 ... The pyritical part was next examined. The result                 the analysis,               of

stances already examined, became the subject of investigation; and
the mean result of two analyses gave, in 100 grains of the earth,
48 silica, 18 magnesia, 34 oxide of iron, and 2% oxide of nickel,
   When we observe that the three other stones were found to con
tain the same elements as that just now described, only in somewhat
different proportions, we may be excused from detaining the Society
with the particulars of their several analyses. Nor shall we here
dwell upon Mr. Howard's manner of reconciling his results with
those of the Abbé Bachelay and Prof. Barthold, any further than to
state, that the inferences drawn are favourable to the supposition,
that the stones they examined were of the same nature as those here
described.                                   -
   IV. In this section we collect some of Mr. Howard's principal
observations on this curious subject. It must be admitted, that not
withstanding the concurring evidence we have of the fall of some of
these substances from the atmosphere, yet the fact itself is so repug
nant to what we know as yet of the operations of nature, that we
are likely to pause a while before we shall venture to form any de
cided opinion on the subject.   Had the fall of all these stones been
attended with meteors, we should naturally combine the two phae
nomena; and in this case Mr. Howard contends, that as these me
teors generally move in a direction nearly horizontal, and probably
not very high in the atmosphere, the objection of the stones not
striking deeper into the earth, owing to their accelerated velocity,
would be obviated. The imperfect knowledge we have of the origin
and nature of meteors may likewise be considered as an encourage
ment for inquiring further into this hypothesis.
   Should these masses, after all, turn out to be the effects of some
regular and simple operation of nature, it is likely that many more
will be found on the surface of the earth, which will become the ob
jects of future inquiry. Meanwhile, Mr. Howard has thought proper
to take a comparative view, not only of the masses of what has been
denominated Native Iron in South America and Siberia, but also of
every other specimen that could be met with in our collections of the
substances that came under the same denomination.        For a descrip
tion of these substances, together with various observations there
upon, we are likewise indebted to Count de Bournon, who seems to
think, that were the particles of iron and nickel in the stones here
examined so numerous as to be in contact with each other, and were
the earthy particles interposed between them wholly destroyed, as
 may happen by a variety of causes, the ferruginous cellular texture
 that would remain would be very similar to the native iron of Siberia
 and South America; both which have, moreover, by chemical analy
 sis, been found to contain an ample proportion of nickel. The Count,
 in describing the Siberian iron, mentions the hard transparent no
 dules found in the cells of that metal, which bear a great resemblance
 to the peridot (chrysolite of Werner), the decomposition of which
 leaves the empty cells which we observe in  all the specimens that are
 brought to  us, Mr. Howard,   on  analysing these transparent nodules,

                                     80
 found them consisting of the same elements      as the earthy   globules of
 the stone from Benares.
     From a collective view of the contents of this paper, we may now
 reasonably infer, that all the substances here mentioned, not except
 ing the native irons from Siberia and South America, and some from
 Bohemia and Senegal, have a manifest relation with each other.
 Mr. Howard recapitulates these analogies; and, with a view to the
 further investigation of the subject, closes his paper with the follow
 ing queries:1st. Have not all fallen stones, and what are called
 Native Irons, the same origin 2nd. Are all or any the produce of
 meteors and 3dly. Adverting to the circumstance of the Yorkshire
 stone having fallen during a serene sky, might not this stone have
 formed a meteor in regions too elevated to be within the reach of
 our observation?
  Observations on the two lately discovered celestial Bodies. By William
     Herschel, LL.D. F.R.S. Read May 6, 1802. [Phil. Trans. 1802,
    p. 213.]
     The observations described in the first part of this paper relate to
 the magnitude, the colour, the disc, and the atmosphere of the two
 moving stars lately discovered by Mr. Piazzi and Dr. Olbers, to
 which they have assigned the names of Ceres and Pallas; and also
 to the question, whether they be attended by any satellites.        Their
 magnitudes were determined by means of a comparison of their re
flected images with a lucid spot of a disc micrometer placed at con
siderable distances. The results of many observations were, that the
diameter of Ceres does not subtend an angle of more than 0":40, or
 in actual length only 1624 miles; and that the diameter of Pallas
 can hardly measure more than between 71 and 72 miles. The colour
 of these bodies was ruddy, and in one instance Pallas was of a dusky
white. Their discs were never of a well defined planetary appear
ance; and as to their atmospheres or comas, the greatest extent of
that attending Ceres was in one instance about two diameters beyond
its disc; in another instance the whole had a cometary appearance;
or when viewed most accurately, it bore a great resemblance to a
small, much compressed, but ill-defined planetary nebula.            Pallas
never exhibited more than a faint haziness.       As to satellites, it was
inferred previous to the observations, that bodies of such very small
dimensions could hardly contain a quantity of matter sufficient for
the retention of secondary bodies; and in fact the several appearances
that seemed to denote the existence of such attendants, were on more
careful inspection found to be fallacious.
    In the second part of the paper Dr. Herschel enters into an inquiry
concerning the nature of these new stars, particularly as to the ques
tion whether they be planets or comets. And in order to proceed upon
certain grounds, he previously enumerates certain criteria by which
the heavenly bodies may be properly distinguished. These, as to the
planets, are seven in number.      1. Those till lately discovered are all

                                                           81
of a considerable size; 2. They move in not very excentric ellipses
round the sun; 3. The planes of their orbits do not deviate many
degrees from the plane of the earth's orbit; 4. Their motion is direct;
5. They may have satellites or rings; 6. They have an atmosphere
of considerable extent, which, however, bears hardly any sensible
proportion to their diameters; and lastly, Their orbits are at certain
considerable          distances from each other.
   These characters being next applied to the new stars, we find, in
the first place, that as to the magnitude, they can certainly not be
classed among planets; since the least of these (Mercury) is no less
than 73,839 times larger than Pallas; 2. Their motions may perhaps
agree sufficiently; but 3. The planes of the orbits of the new stars
appear to deviate so much from that of the earth, that, were they
admitted into the number of planets, we should have to extend the
zodiac far beyond          present limits; and
                              its                             not improbable that

excentricity round the sun, the planes of which may be inclined to

 fect, and the latter, or the gems, perfect Corundum.
    The author now enters into a minute account of the appearances
 and the principal properties of this substance.    And first he treats of
 its colour. This, he tells us, is at best but an uncertain character in
 stones, but yet it may at times afford some secondary marks of di
 stinction. The common or imperfect corundum varies, in this respect,
 according to the country where it is found. That from the Carnatic
 is of a grayish white, sometimes approaching to a pale green, and
 sometimes, though rarely, of a red or blue colour: that from China
 and Ava is generally of a dull green or brown colour; and that from
 the coast of Malabar appears of a reddish brown.                       -
    The perfect corundum which is found in Pegu and in Ceylon is
 either red, blue, or yellow.    The former is the Oriental ruby; the
blue is the sapphire; and the yellow the topaz. From a duly pro
 portioned mixture of the blue and the red is produced the purple
 colour, which constitutes the Oriental amethyst.        The union of the
blue and yellow forms the green colour, which is proper to the Ori
ental emerald; and a larger proportion of yellow produces the colour
proper to the chrysolite.
    2. As to transparency, the crystals of corundum from the Carnatic,
having usually rough surfaces, are of course very imperfectly diapha
nous; but when broken, their fragments have generally a certain de
gree of semi-transparency: most of these fragments, when held up to
the light, show a number of fissures in their substance, which in a
great measure prevent the transmission of light. These fissures arise
from a want of cohesion between all the parts of the crystalline la
minae. The red and blue corundum of the Carnatic has a greater
degree of transparency than those of any other colour; the blue in
particular having generally the preference in this respect.
    3. In hardness the corundum comes next to the diamond; but this
quality, with regard to intensity, differs greatly, according to the co
lour and degrees of purity of the specimens. The corundum of the
Carnatic, when it is neither blue nor red, is less hard than any other
sort; whilst the imperfect blue species exceeds all the other varieties
of this kind in hardness, such is     its density thatit  will emit pretty
bright sparks when struck with steel.
  4.   This substance, like quartz, becomes phosphorescent by colli
sion. The crystals    ofa   red colour, whether  of   the perfect or   im

that of a red hot iron.

   The paper closes with some account of corundum, which, contrary
to the received opinion, that this stone was only found in the East
Indies, has been thought to exist in other parts of the world. The
author dwells mostly upon the appearances of a stone he himself dis
covered in the mountainous parts of the Forez in France, and which
the Abbé Hauy considers only as a species offelspar. The Count al
leges his reasons for classing it with the perfect blue corundum,
known by the name of Sapphire. As to various stones found in
Germany, in the Isle of Tirree on the western coast of Scotland, on
Chesnut-hill near Philadelphia, and elsewhere, which have by some
been considered as corundum, the author cautions us against acqui
escing in those assertions till more conclusive arguments shall appear
in their favour.

    Next follow the tables of the contents of six kinds of corundum,
 viz. the sapphire, the ruby, and the corundum from the Carmatic,
from Malabar, from China, and from Ava.         The proportions of the
first species are 54 silica, 92 alumina, l iron, and 13 loss. The pro
portions of the other kinds do not differ very considerably from these.
    The matrices of these stones being more easily fused than the six
kinds above mentioned, the usual and well known mode of treatment
by potash was found sufficient to render them soluble in acids.                                              Al
though this mode be now very familiar to chemists, the author, how
ever, in order to leave no cause for suspicion, describes the process
he used with the matrix of the corundum from the peninsula of India.
The results gave 42% silica, 37% alumina, 15 lime, 3 iron, and 2 loss,
with a trace of manganese.       By similar treatment the various sub
stances contained in this and some other matrices, viz. felspar, fibro
lite, and three sorts of thallite, were analysed, and the results are
given in tables.   It is remarkable that while all the other substances
yield in different proportions the same ingredients as the matrices
themselves, the fibrolite was found to consist only of silica and alu
mina, the quantity of iron it contained being so small as hardly to
deserve notice.
   In the prosecution of this inquiry Mr. Chenevix observed, that if
a quantity of potash be for some time kept in fusion in a platina cru
cible, the latter will be found to lose some grains of        weight. The                its
quantity        of
              the metal thus lost     actually found   hethe potash; and            in

is solely appropriated to the passage of the semen, its external orifice
being subdivided into several openings, so as to scatter the semen
over an extent of surface, while the urine passes by a separate canal
into the rectum.     And lastly, the female has no common uterus, the
tubes, which correspond to the horns of the uterus in other quadru
peds, receiving the semen immediately from the penis of the male.
   Mr. Home concludes his paper with a conjecture, that more species
of this extraordinary animal will be gradually discovered; a drawing
having already been received from Van Diemen's Land of an indi
vidual similar to the Hystrix here described, only with the spines
much shorter.     And he thinks it probable that the class will in time
be found to consist of various kinds, and that those hitherto known
will be arranged under different genera.
A Method of              examining refractive and dispersive Powers, by prismatic
     Reflection. By            William Hyde Wollaston, M.D. F.R.S.                                      Read
     June 24, 1802.             [Phil. Trans. 1802, p. 365.]
    The principle of this method depends on the reflection of light at
 the inner surface of a denser refracting medium.           Its application in
 the first instance is deduced from a      theorem,   from which we gather,
 that since the  range  of inclination within which total reflection takes
 place, depends not only on the density of the reflecting prism, but
 also on the rarity of the medium adjacent to             the extent          it,
                                                                           that                     of
range will vary according                 to

 media.     And that hence when the refractive power              one medium             of
is  known, that      the rarer medium may

ranged according to their refractive powers, chiefly deduced from ex
periments made according to the method here described; some to
which the machine for measurement would not apply, being ob
tained by other means, or borrowed from other authors.
   The second part of the paper treats of the dispersion of light. The
principles and observations on which the inductions here given chiefly
depend, are these :-When a glass prism is placed in contact with
water, and brought near the eye, in such a position that it reflects
the light from the window, the extent of perfect reflection is seen to
be bounded by a fringe of the prismatic colours in the order of their
refrangibility.     But it may happen that two media which refract un
equally at the same incidence, may disperse equally at that incidence;
and, under these circumstances, a pencil of rays passing from one of
these media into the other, will be refracted without dispersion of its
colours. The boundary of prismatic reflection will then be found a
well defined line, free from colour, if the surface at which the reflected
light emerges from the prism be at right angles to                           its
                                                                      course. More

lustrates  it still further, by applying it to some new distinct cases re
lating to the colours of fibres, and to the colours of mixed plates.
    The case respecting fibres is that of the coloured fringes produced
by the interposition of a hair between the luminous object and the
eye.     Here it is observed that the fringes are larger and brighter in
proportion as the hair is thinner, the phaenomenon being most con
spicuous when a single thread of a silkworm is interposed. The cause
here assigned is the interference of two portions of light, one re
flected from the fibre, and the other bending round its opposite side,
and at last coinciding nearly in direction with the former portion;
hence as both portions deviate more from a rectilinear direction, the
difference of the length of their paths will be gradually increased,
and consequently produce the appearances of colour usual in such
 cases. The rule given to calculate the difference of the paths for the
light least inflected, is the analogy between that difference to the
diameter of the fibre, which will be as the deviation of the ray at any
point from the rectilinear direction, to its distance from the fibre.
    When a number of fibres of the same kind,-as, for instance, an
uniform lock of wool, are held near to the eye, we see an appear
 ance of halos surrounding a distant candle; but their brilliancy, and
 even their existence, depends on the uniformity of the dimensions of
the fibres, and they are larger as the fibres are smaller. To an effect
 similar to this are ascribed the coloured atmospherical halos, substi
 tuting to the above fibres a number of particles of water of equal
 dimensions, and properly situated between the luminary and the
 eye.
    Speaking of the colours of mixed plates in looking at a candle
 through two pieces of plate-glass with a little moisture between them,
 we are told that the fringes here produced are the effect of moisture,
 intermixed with portions of air, exhibiting an appearance similar to
 dew.     Here the light transmitted through the water, moving in it
 with a   velocity  different from that of the light passing through the
 interstices filled only with air, the two portions, it is said, will inter
 fere with each other, and produce the effect of colours according to
 the general law.
    In further applying this general law, the author found it impossible
 to avoid another supposition, which is a part of the undulatory theory
 he defended in his former paper; namely, that the velocity of light
 is the greater the rarer the medium ; and he suggests an idea, which
 appears to him to lead to an explanation of the dispersion of colours
 by refraction, more simple and satisfactory than that which he for
 merly advanced.        He supposes that every refractive medium trans
 mits the undulations constituting light in two separate portions, one
 passing through its ultimate particles, and the other through its
 pores; and that these portions re-unite continually after each suc
  cessive separation, the one having preceded the other by a very mi
  nute but constant interval, depending on the regular arrangement of
  the particles of a homogeneous medium.           Having briefly discoursed
  on the  application   of this doctrine,  he concludes by mentioning some

                                    94.
observations which appear to him to confirm what he had advanced
on a former occasion touching the dispersive powers of the eye.

    The ultimate results of the experiments made on this substance,
which it seems had never before been properly analysed, arethat
25 grains contain 12# grains of argillaceous earth, 2 of silex, and 8
of iron; that 1 grain was not dissolved, and that the remainder,
being 1% grain, was lost in the process. Another process gave the
same components, but in somewhat different proportions.       These in
gredients being very similar to those found by Mr. Klaproth in Dia
mond spar, it is thought that emery is essentially a substance of the
same nature, with perhaps a somewhat greater proportion of iron.
Quelques   Remarques sur la Chaleur, et sur l'Action des Corps qui l'in

    Communicated by Thomas Young,       M.D. F.R.S.   Read July 1, 1802.
    [Phil. Trans. 1802, p. 403.]
   The remarks here brought forward relate chiefly to Dr. Herschel's
experiments on the solar and terrestrial rays that occasion heat, pub
lished in the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1800, and are
meant to rectify some anomalies which appear in their results. The
paper consists of two parts: the first being the observations on Dr.
Herschels experiments, and some new ones, with inferences deduced
from them; and the second the exposition of a theory, which the
author thinks may reconcile all contradictions.
    In the first part he sets out with briefly stating the manner in
which Dr. Herschel conducted the experiments he made, in order to
estimate, by the indications of different thermometers, the quantity
of heat transmitted through various substances, compared with the
heat afforded by direct rays from different luminous bodies, or more
properly sources of heat. Here the author soon starts a difficulty
concerning the mode of estimating the intercepting power of the
substances used in the experiments.       As these experiments consist
of a series of observations made progressively at intervals of one mi
nute between each other, it follows that the ratio Dr. Herschel adopted
between the heat produced by direct rays, and those transmitted
through coloured media, is not, as he imagined, a constant proportion,
he having uniformly deduced his inferences from the differences be
tween the initial and the final degrees of heat; whereas, had he at
tended to the intermediate observations, he would have found that
each of them would have afforded a different ratio.
   Having maturely considered this subject, the author, adverting to
this circumstance of the various proportions of heat progressively
yielded in these experiments, observes, that it can hardly be con
ceived why the faculty of transmitting and intercepting heat should

                                                            95
thus vary in any substance, merely because it has transmitted or in
tercepted   it for a greater or less length of time. Hence he thinks it
essential to have recourse to some permanent rule from which the
results may in all cases be accurately derived, and which, when the
phaenomena do not correspond, may lead us to the investigation of
some other cause.       Such a law has been deduced from direct expe
riments, and implies that a body placed in a medium of a constant
temperature, becomes heated or cooled in such a manner, that the
differences of            its
                     heat from that      the medium are     of geometrical                     in   a

of   any series      of    observations.

to some new ones here described,         found              is to

the continual repetition of these changes will likewise produce an
equilibrium. According to these principles he undertakes to explain
all the laws of increasing and decreasing heat; he supplies us with
various examples as to the application of them, and shows how this
theory coincides with the general law laid down in the first part of
the paper.

leading principles deduced from the various parts of his investigation.
   1. The effect of a constant source of heat upon the thermometer
is not proportional to the heat of that source.
   2. We nevertheless possess a method of determining the heat of
the source by                  its
                      effect on the thermometer, because we know the
law this effect follows in its successive increments.

Newton, he informs      us of the circumstances which led him to the
present investigation, namely, the occasion he had some years ago
to solve a problem which required the rectification of an equilateral
hyperbola.
   He then enters upon his subject; and in a first section he investi
gates in nine theorems the several series which apply to this curve,
whose different characters, namely, the ratios of their terms, or rather
the rates of their convergency and divergency, depend on the relative
proportions of their elements. Of these series one only, and that not
the best, is all that he has hitherto been able to find in other works.
Two are of the form which is called ascending, and six descending.
 One of them is of a peculiar form, which can only be understood by
turning to the paper.     Among these series, he observes, may always
be found some which will converge, whether the portion of the hy
perbolic arch taken from the vertex be long or short, or of a mode
rate length; but the ascending series always differs from the de
scending one by a constant quantity.
   In  a second section the author treats of the methods of computing
the values of the constant quantities, by which the ascending series
differ from the descending ones. Here he has recourse to two methods,
of which he has already given an illustration in his Mathematical Es
says: the one by computing the value of both an ascending and de
scending series, taking for the ordinate to the axis some small definite
quantity; and the other by comparing the values of those series to
gether, when the ordinate is taken immensely great.          The former
method he    says is more  general;   but the latter, when it can be ap
                                                           -
plied, usually affords the easiest computation.
   In the third section are given five examples, which show the use
of these theorems, as well as the manner of choosing such as are best
adapted to any particular case.      In one of these the author corrects
an error in the length of a large arch of an equilateral hyperbola,
which was first published in the year 1771, and has been since re
printed by some eminent mathematicians.
   Lastly, he concludes with some remarks on former writers, and
takes notice of the defects of two series given by the late Dr. Waring
for the rectification of an hyperbola.

   To this catalogue is prefixed a classification of the multitude of
sidereal bodies hitherto discovered, not according to their appa
rent magnitudes or appearances on our earth, but according to their
peculiar nature and arrangement in the heavens. They are divided
into the twelve following classes:

of mutual attraction; such as our Sun, Arcturus, Capella, Lyra,      Si

  clusters of stars, at great  distances,  the light of which is gathered so
 nearly into one point, as to leave but just enough of it visible to pro
 duce the appearance of burrs.

 different  kinds,  one of them    being  deceptions; namely, such as arise
 from extensive regions of closely connected clustering stars contigu
 ous to each other, like those that compose our milky way: the other,
 on the contrary, being real, and possibly at no very great distance
 from us. The milky nebulosity of Orion, discovered by Huygens, is

A   chemical Analysis   of   some Calamines.     By James Smithson, Esq.
 F.R.S.     Read November 18, 1802.            [Phil. Trans. 1803, p. 12.]
  The uncertainty that has till now prevailed concerning the nature
and composition of the ores of zinc called Calamine, has induced our
author to enter upon the investigation now before us. In the first
part of the paper, we find the analysis of four kinds of calamines;
the first from Bleyberg in Carinthia, the second from the Mendip
hills in Somersetshire, the third from Derbyshire, and the fourth an
electrical calamine from Regbania in Hungary.        Referring to the
paper for the detail of the four processes there circumstantially de
scribed, we must content ourselves with reciting here the results de
duced from each of them.
   1000 parts of the Bleyberg ore were found to consist of 714 calx
of zinc, 135 carbonic acid, and 151 water. Some carbonate of lime
and lead were likewise found in it; but these appeared to be mere
accidental admixtures, and in too small quantities to deserve notice.
   1000 parts of the Mendip ore consisted of 648 parts of calx of
zinc, and 352 of carbonic acid, and yielded no water.
   In the Derbyshire ore were found 652 of calx of zinc, and 348 of
carbonic acid.
   And in the Hungarian ore, 683 of calx of zinc, 250 of quartz, 44
water: and here there moreover appeared a loss of 23, owing, no
doubt, to some defect in the manipulation. The water was by no
means considered as an essential part of this ore; and hence the pro
portions of the two other ingredients were as 739 to 261.
    In a second part of the paper, the author communicates some ob
servations to which he was led by the uncertainty that still prevails
in our chemical researches, and the want of uniformity in the results
of the multitude of experiments that are daily made, which appear
to him to clash essentially with the simplicity of nature. When we
consider, he says, the simplicity found in all those parts of nature
which are sufficiently known to come within the reach of our obser
vation, it appears improbable that the constituent parts of bodies,
which we consider as endowed with reciprocal affinities, should be
so loosely united as is often indicated by the most accurate analysis.
Hence he is led to conjecture, that in all chemical combinations,
those ingredients which are really essential to the compound are
but few in number; that they are by nature certain aliquot parts of
the whole compound; and that as the aliquot may be expressed by
fractions, the denomination of these fractions will always be a small
quantity, perhaps never exceeding the number 5.
    The author applies this theory to the above-mentioned experiments
on calamine; and finding that, with a trifling correction, the results
coincide with this theory, he entertains sanguine hopes that future
investigations will finally establish           so,     he
                                          a it.
                                                  If    thinks that the
 discovery will introduce     chemistry

it  has not hitherto been thought susceptible; that      will enable the

 able errors of his manual operations, and authorize him to eliminate
 from the essential elements of a compound those products of an ana
 lysis whose quantity cannot be reduced to any admissible proportion,
 and may therefore be considered as extraneous.
     The author, at the close of his paper, controverts the opinion of
 those who think that crystallization requires a previous state of solu
 tion in the matter crystallized; and contends, that as long as any
  quantity of fluid is present in a solution, no crystallization can pos
 sibly take place.

 Mr. Cavendish, Dr. Priestley, Dr. Nooth, and others, respecting the
 impregnation of water with different gases, our author observes, that
 the circumstance of the different degrees of temperature and pressure
 had not been as yet sufficiently attended to.     Dr. Priestley, indeed,
 had long since remarked, that, in an exhausted receiver, Pyrmont
 water will actually boil at a common temperature, by the copious
 discharge of its air; and that hence it is very probable, that by means
 of a condensing engine, water might be much more highly impreg
 mated with the virtues of the Pyrmont spring: but this conjecture
 remained as yet to be proved by experiments; and this is the task
 our author has undertaken in the present paper.
     This paper consists of two sections; the first treating of the quan
 tities of gases absorbed by water under the usual pressure of the
 atmosphere; and the second, of the influence of pressure in promoting
 the absorption of gases. The apparatus contrived for these experi
 ments may be described as a siphon, of which one side, or leg, is a
glass vessel of comparatively a considerable diameter, and the other
 a long glass tube of about a quarter of an inch bore; the junction
of these two parts at the bottom being a short pipe of India rubber,
well secured by proper integuments of leather, thus forming a joint,
which admits of the vessel being briskly agitated.        This vessel has
a stop-cock both at top and bottom, in order to insert and emit fluids
and gases; and both the vessel and tube are accurately graduated.
It may now be understood, that a known quantity of water and of a
certain gas being put in the vessel, and the tube being filled to a
certain extent with mercury, the absorption of the gas will be accu
rately measured by the column of mercury in the tube. Those who
are particularly interested in this inquiry will find in the paper va
rious precautions and additional contrivances, all tending to insure
the success and accuracy of the investigation.
    The first experiments were made on the absorption of carbonic
acid gas by water: and here a singular disagreement was observed
in the first trials made under exactly the same circumstances.         It

                                          104
soon occurred that this might be owing to the variable amount of the
residua of the gas, after the absorption; and this was actually con
firmed by the observation, that, of a greater quantity of gas, more
would be absorbed than of a smaller, though both quantities were
sufficient for saturation of equal quantities of water. This was found
to be owing to the quantity of common air, which will ever be extri
cated from the water, though it be ever so pure, and which will form
a greater proportion of the smaller than of the greater dose of the
residuary gas.                                                        :
   A table of nine experiments is next given, in which are entered
the temperature, the quantities of water and gas, the quantities of
gas absorbed, the residua, and the quantities absorbed by 100 inches
of water. The two extreme results are, that, at the temperature of
55°, 13 measures of water, exposed to 32 measures of gas, absorbed
14 measures, leaving a residuum of 18 measures; so that the ab
sorption of 100 measures of water would be 108 measures of gas.
In  the temperature of 110°, 20 measures of water, exposed to 20
measures of gas, absorbed 9 and left 11 ; so that 45 in 100 was the
total of the absorption.
   A series of experiments on other less absorbable gases have afforded
for one temperature, viz. 60°, and in 100 cubic inches of water, the
following results:nitrous gas 5 inches, oxygenous gas 2-63, phos
phorated hydrogen gas 2:14, azotic gas 1:20, and hydrogen gas 1-08.
Some experiments are next described on the quantity of atmospheri
cal air that may be extricated from water; the general result of which
is, that 100 cubic inches       common spring water will yield 4.76
                                of                                                      of
gas; which, being analysed, was found               to
                                                 consist            of

acid, and 1:38 atmospherical air.

Experiments    and Observations on the various Alloys, on the specific
    Gravity, and  on the comparative Wear of Gold. Being the Substance
   of a  Report   made to the Right Honourable the Lords of the Com
   mittee of   Privy  Council, appointed to take into Consideration the
   State of the Coins of this Kingdom, and the present Establishment
   and Constitution    of His Majesty's Mint.    By Charles Hatchett,
   Esq. F.R.S.     Read January 13, 1803. [Phil. Trans. 1803, p. 43.]
   From the introduction to this paper we learn, that in the year 1798,
His Majesty was pleased to appoint a committee of members of his
Privy Council, to take into consideration the state of the coins of the
kingdom; and that this committee, having remarked the considerable
loss which the gold coin in particular had sustained by wear within
certain periods, had applied to Mr. Cavendish and Mr. Hatchett for
their opinion what were the causes of this diminution, and what
remedy might be applied to the defects by which it is occasioned.
The mode of carrying on this investigation having been agreed upon
by these two gentlemen, it fell to Mr. Hatchett's lot to perform the
preconcerted experiments, and to draw up the account of them.        Of
this account, as it was too voluminous, and consisted of too many
tables to be read in public, Mr. Hatchett has been pleased to commu
micate to the Society the Abstract, the reading of which took up the
whole of this and the preceding meeting. On a general contemplation
of the subject, it soon occurred that the inquiry was to be directed to
two principal points;1st, which of the two sorts of gold, whether
that which is very ductile, or that which is as hard as is compatible
with the process of coining, suffers the greatest loss under the gene
ral circumstances of friction;and 2dly, whether coins with flat,
smooth, and broad surfaces, wear less or more than coins which have
certain protuberant parts raised above the ground or general level of
the pieces. With a view of arriving at some certain data respecting
these questions, three objects were principally kept in view, which
gave rise to the three sections that compose the body of the paper.
The first of these comprehends the chemical experiments, those which
relate to the effects produced upon gold by the addition of different
metals in certain relative proportions;the second includes those
experiments which relate to the different degrees of density observed
in gold when differently alloyed;and the third consists of those
experiments which may be called mechanical, and which were ex
pressly intended to ascertain the comparative wear of different kinds
of gold by various modes of friction.
   In the numerous set of experiments which are described in the first
section, the effects of every metal and semi-metal upon the colour
and ductility of gold were ascertained with all possible care and pre
cision. All the semi-metals were found to affect the quality of gold
too essentially, though in different degrees, to be ever used as alloys.
And among the metals, lead in very small proportions was likewise
found to render gold so completely brittle, as to be absolutely unfit
for coinage.    Tin was not near so pernicious; and iron, though it

                                                               106

                                                                        in                                    an

each        frame,
                a   one       which was made           move backwards and
forwards over the other with certain determined degrees             velocity                                  of

and pressure. In the second, 200 pieces of gold differently alloyed were
inclosed within a wooden box, which was kept constantly turning
round, until, by the continued rubbing and striking of the pieces
against each other, and against the sides of the box, they were found to
be perceptibly diminished.     And in the third mode, the pieces to
be examined were pressed against the rim of a flat horizontal wheel, by
 means of equal weights, so that by turning the wheel round, they all
suffered an equal degree of friction.    The part of the wheel against
which the pieces rubbed was sprinkled or coated with some kind of
powder, which was varied in the different experiments.
    The general results of the many experiments made with this appa
 ratus were, 1. That when equal friction, assisted by a moderate pres
 sure, takes place between pieces of coin which are in each series of
 a similar quality, then, abrasion is most commonly produced in an
 inverse ratio to the degree of ductility;-2. That the contrary effect
 happens when pieces of different qualities rub against each other,
the more ductile metal being then worn by that which is harder;-
and 3. That earthy powders and metallic filings produce similar ef
fects, and tend to wear the different kinds of gold in proportion to
                                                                  -
their respective degrees of ductility.
    The practical inferences to be deduced from these results are,
that pure gold, being extremely ductile, is not the most proper to be
formed into coin; that gold, on the other hand, brought by its alloy
to the greatest degree of hardness that will bear the manipulation of
coining, will be so destructive to the instruments in the Mint, as to
render the expense occasioned by this detriment much greater than
the small saving that would accrue from the greater durability of the
metal; and that hence gold of a moderate ductility must be that
which is best adapted for coin, which degree of ductility will be
 found in the standard proportion of one-twelfth of alloy consisting- of
about equal parts of silver and copper.
     Several incidental circumstances are mentioned at the close of this
paper, some of which relate to the cause of the changes of colour in
 gold coins, which are ascribed to certain chemical changes in the
 alloy near the surface of the piece during the processes of annealing
 and blanching. We are also informed that the obliteration of the
 impressions on gold coins is not always attended with a diminution
 of weight, but that the supposed abrasion of the prominent parts is
 in fact a depression of those parts into the mass, bringing them to a
 level with the rest.
     Upon the whole, our author concludes that the great loss which
  the gold coin of this kingdom is stated to have sustained, cannot
 possibly be attributed to any important defect in the composition or
  quality of the standard gold; and that  all that can be said upon this
  subject      is,
              that some portion of  this loss may have been caused by
  the rough impression and milled edge now      in  use, by which each
  piece                      acted upon by the others, in             of

more than 10:392.           Whence         appears, that the densities are here

humours of the eyes of birds are chemically of the same nature as
those of quadrupeds.
   It is also observed, that the crystalline in animals not through           all                 is
out      the same density; the result
        of                                    some experiments made on

common origin with the stones fallen on the earth.     This he obtained
from Colonel Kirkpatrick, and it consists of a translation from the
Persian, made by the Colonel, of a passage in the Memoirs of the
Emperor Jehangire, written by himself.        The substance of this ex
tract is as follows: In the first year of this Emperor's reign (A. 1030
of the Hegira) there arose one morning in a village, about 100 miles
East of Lahore, such a tremendous noise as had near deprived the                                                       in
habitants of their sense of hearing.      During this noise, a luminous
body was observed to fall from above on the earth, suggesting to the
beholders the idea that the firmament was pouring fire. In a short
time the noise having subsided, and the inhabitants having recovered
from their alarm, a messenger was dispatched by them to the Aumil,
or fiscal superintendant of the district, to apprise him of the event.
This magistrate immediately repaired to the spot, and there perceived
that the earth, to an extent of about ten or twelve yards in diameter,
was burnt to such a degree that not a blade of grass nor the least trace
of verdure remained ; nor had the heat, which had been communicated
to      it,   as   yet subsided.
    The Aumil hereupon caused the aforesaid space                    ground      be           of
                                                                                                                  to to
dug up. The deeper they went the greater was the heat found                     be.
At length lump iron made its appearance, the heat which was
                    a           of                                                                  of

of importance, when we find that they ultimately lead to a safe and
effectual method of removing a portion of the tongue, when that
organ has assumed a diseased action or morbid excrescences of a
cancerous nature, to which this, as well as many other glandular
structures, are known to be liable.        In a physiological view they will
likewise be found to merit particular attention, as they tend to prove
that the internal structure of the tongue is not of that delicate and
sensible nature which, from           its
                                      being the organ        taste, we should of
be   led to  imagine.
    The first case here mentioned, and from which various inferences
                                                    treating the disorders

the    tongue,   was that   of   gentleman    whose tongue had been acci
dentally bit near the tip, and had hence become completely insen
sible, insomuch that every article              of
                                           nourishment       took was equally he

                                         spasmodic tendency having accom
panied these symptoms, Mr. Home inferred that the nerves supplying
this, and perhaps the other organs           sense, are not
                                                     of          liable    irri     so            to

    Encouraged by this observation,                  he
                                                 three instances performed
                                                          in                                           a
 new operation upon the tongue, which consisted            removing     portion
                                                                         in                   a
of    that organ by means         ligatures, and with that portion certain
                                 of
 fungous excrescences which might have been productive                     fatal               of
 consequences.        The first patient was boy eight years
                                                          a          age, who            of
 had been born with    a    small excrescence on the right side         the an            of
 terior   part   of
                  the  tongue.       had been removed no less than eleven
                                    It
 times by ligatures round its base, caustics and amputation, but al
 ways with considerable and dangerous haemorrhages; and after all
 without success, the fungus always reappearing soon after the ope
 rations. Mr. Home      at    length resolved     take out the portion
                                                              to             the                  of
 tongue upon which the fungus grew. This was effected by passing
a   crooked needle, armed with           double ligature, through the sub
                                          a
 stance   of   the tongue, somewhat within the excrescence: the needle
 was drawn out below, leaving the ligatures, one              which was tied   of
 very tight before the excrescence, and the other equally            behind              so            it,
 so  that    a segment of    the tongue was confined between these two
 ligatures,       which the circulation was completely stopped.
                 in                                                      On the
 fifth day after the operation this portion           the tongue came away
                                                                   of
 with the ligatures, leaving         sloughy surface, which likewise sepa
                                      a
 rated    on the fifteenth day. The excavation         few days after this be
                                                                    a
 came completely cicatrized, leaving only           small fissure
                                                               a       that side          on
 of   the tongue.
      The two other operations were performed                            on   persons above forty

                                                                   112
 years    of age. In these cases the excrescence was a tumour no larger
 than a pea, but the appearance of which threatened the formation of
 a cancer.       Both these were successfully removed by the ligatures
 above    described;    and, except a small fissure, no kind of deformity
 was left upon the tongue.
      The principal inference derived from these operations                that the                            is,

   Concerning the second part of this paper, namely, the causes which
often affect mirrors so as to prevent their showing objects distinctly,
though it be well known to astronomers that telescopes will act very
differently at different times, yet no particular inquiry had yet been
made respecting the cause of this imperfection.      The experience our
author has   acquired  during  his long series of observations, in which
he never lost sight of this circumstance, has enabled him to combine
a set of facts, from which he thinks himself authorized to deduce                 in
ferences which will be found to throw a considerable light upon the
subject.
   These observations are here described at length, and arranged
under different heads, chiefly according to the state of the atmosphere
at the time they were made. Their results will in some measure
point out the nature of them.    They seem to establish, as a general
principle, that in order to see distinctly with telescopes, it is re
quired that the temperature of the atmosphere and mirror should be
uniform, and that the air be impregnated with moisture. Hence it
appears that a frost after mild weather, or a thaw after frost, will
sensibly derange the performance of our mirrors, till either the frost.
or the mild weather are sufficiently settled that the temperature of
the mirror, and indeed of the whole telescope, may accommodate
itself to that of the air. That when a frost, though very severe, be
comes settled, the mirror will soon accommodate itself to the tem
perature, and the telescope will be found to act well.  That no tele
scope brought into a cold atmosphere out of a warm room, can for a
time be expected to act properly; and that no delicate observations,
with high magnifying powers, can well be made when looking through
a door, window, or slit in the roof of an observatory. It equally ap
pears that windy weather in general, which must occasion a mixture
of airs of different temperatures, cannot be favourable to distinct
vision: and that the aurorae boreales, when they induce, as they
often do, a considerable change in the temperature of the different
regions of air, are likewise detrimental as to distinctness.
   Sometimes the weather may be perfectly serene, and yet the tele
scopes will act imperfectly. This may be owing to the dryness oc
casioned by easterly winds, or by a change of temperature arising
from an agitation of the upper regions of the atmosphere, or perhaps
                                                     -
by both these causes combined together.
   Dry air, it seems, is by no means proper for vision; and hence
dampness, haziness, and fogs, to a certain degree, will generally be
found favourable to distinctness: damp situations, therefore, and the
neighbourhood of lakes or rivers, need not be objected to in choosing
a spot for an observatory.  As the warm exhalations of the roof of a
house in a cold night must disturb the uniformity of the temperature
of a certain contiguous portion of air, it is to be expected that the
appearance of stars seen over a house, and at no considerable distance
from   it,
         will   affected by that emanation.

   Lastly, one  ofthe most essential causes         of

in   the performance   of   telescopes must,   it   seems,   be   ascribed   to   the

effects of heat and cold upon the figure of the mirrors. This cir
cumstance has called forth a particular investigation, in which heated
bodies were approached at different distances, both before and behind
mirrors, either of glass or metal; and it was remarkable how their

sidual matter, chiefly sand and calcareous earth. The same quantity
of the extract from Bengal yielded        grains     tannin,  97 grains           of             73                of
peculiar extractive matter,      grains           16

matter; viz. sand, with a small quantity of calcareous and aluminous
earth.
       The importance of the object will, we trust, justify our inserting
here what our author has ascertained concerning the application of
this substance to tanning. Of two pieces of calf-skin, he tells us,
which weighed when dry 132 grains each, and which had been pre
pared for tanning: one was immersed in a large quantity of the                                               in
fusion of extract of catechu from Bengal, and the other in an equal
portion of the infusion of the extract from Bombay.    In less than a
month they were both found converted into leather. When freed from
moisture by long exposure in the sunshine, they were weighed. The
first piece had gained about 34 grains, and the second piece 35%
grains. The colour of the leather was much deeper than that tanned
with galls, and on the upper surface it was of a reddish brown. It
was not acted on by hot or cold water; and                                     in its
                                                   apparent strength
was the same as that of similar leather tanned    the usual manner.

              inferred that their sap, having been absorbed                                                             by    the

bark of the root, is carried up by the alburnum, or white wood of
the root, the trunk, and the branches; that it passes through what
he calls the central vessels into the succulent part of the annual
shoot, the leaf-stalk, and the leaf; and that it thence returns to the
bark through the returning vessels of the leaf-stalk. The principal
object of the present paper is to point out the causes of the descent
of the sap through the bark, and the consequent formation of wood.
   The causes to which he ascribes this descent are: 1. Gravitation;
2. Motion communicated by winds or other agents; and 3. Capil
lary attraction, and perhaps some peculiar circumstances in the con
formation of the vessels themselves, which renders them better cal
culated to carry fluids in one direction than in another.
   Before he proceeds upon the experiments from which he has de
duced these conclusions, he premises a few observations on the func
tions of the leaf, from which all the descending fluids in the tree ap
pear to be derived.       He describes an experiment he made on a leaf
of a vine, in which its lower surface being placed in contact with a
clean piece of plate glass, this glass was soon found to be covered
with a strong dew, which had evidently exhaled from the leaf; and
at the end of half an hour so much water was found to have been
discharged from the leaf, that it ran from the glass when it was held
obliquely. The position of the leaf being then inverted, and its upper
surface being brought in contact with the glass, not the slightest
portion of moisture appeared, although the leaf was for some time
exposed to the full influence of the meridian sun.             Hence it is in
ferred, that the vessels intended for perspiration are confined to the
under surface of the leaf, and that these, like the cutaneous lym
phatics of the animal oeconomy, are also capable of absorbing mois
ture when the plant is in a state to require it; whereas the upper
surface seems chiefly formed for absorbing light; and if anything
exhale from         it,   probably vital air,
                          it    is                  some other permanently
                                                         or

from    apart       of    it,
                       and thus cut off all communication through the
bark between the shoot and the parent stem.               Former experiments
have shown, that had this shoot grown                  erect position, the lip

of the bark above the wound would have shown an accumulation of
fresh wood and bark; but           this instance the contrary was found
                                          in                                     to

from the following experiment.   Several young standard apple-trees
were, by means of stakes and bandages, prevented from yielding to
the impulse of the wind up to about the middle of their stems, the
upper parts of the stems and the branches being left in their free na
tural state. In the course of one summer it was found that much
new wood had accumulated in the parts which were kept in motion
by the wind; whereas the lower parts of the stems and roots had
increased very little in          One of these trees was afterwards con
                                       size.

north to south, in that   part of the stem which was most exercised by
the wind, exceeded that in the opposite direction, in the following
autumn, in the proportion of 13 to 11. Several curious inferences
may be hence deduced as to the growth of trees in different situations.
   In those which are exposed on high grounds, and are kept in al
most continual motion, the sap circulates with great rapidity, and
will be accumulated chiefly in the roots and lower parts of the trunk;
and hence the diameter of the trunk will diminish rapidly as it re
cedes from the root: the progress of the ascending sap will of course
be impeded, and it will thence cause lateral branches to be produced,
the forms of which will be similar to that of the trunk; and thus the

and the horizontal branches would hence soon extend so far and be
come so bulky, as to render it impossible for the trunk to support
them. The principal office here ascribed to the horizontal and spread
ing branches, is to nourish and support the blossoms and fruit, or
seed; little or nothing of the sap being here returned to the parent
tree, and hence very feeble powers being wanted in the returning
system.
   Our author had long entertained an opinion that the ascending
fluids in the alburnum and central vessels are everywhere the same,
and that the leaf-stalk, the tendril of the vine, the fruit-stalk, and
the succulent point of the annual shoot, might in some measure be
substituted for each other: experiments have proved his conjecture
in many instances to be well founded.         In several of these experi
ments, leaves continued to perform their office when grafted on the
fruit-stalk, the tendril, and the succulent shoot of the vine; and the
leaf-stalk, the tendril, and the fruit-stalk, equally supplied a branch
grafted upon them with nourishment.
    On examining the manner in which wounds in trees become co
vered, an additional proof was found, that the medullary processes,
namely, the knobs of wood formed at the junction of a grafted bud,
with the stock in which it is inserted, are like every other part of
the wood generated by the bark. This is mentioned in contradiction
to the opinion still entertained, that the hardest, most durable, and
most solid part of the wood, is composed of the soft, cellular, and
perishable substance of the medulla.     Lastly, some observations are
 stated, which seem to imply that the sap in                      its
                                                   descent may undergo
some modification which fits      more effectually

excite the curiosity of several mineralogists; and among these, Mr.
Chenevix, to whom the manner in which this object was presented
to the public appeared suspicious, was among the foremost in pro
 curing a sufficient quantity of the substance to enable him to insti
 tute a proper analysis by which the fallacy, if there were any, might
 be detected. The substance, as exposed to sale, had been worked by
 art: it had been rolled out in flatting-mills, the largest of the lamina
 being about three inches in length and half an inch broad, and
 weighing on an average twenty-five grains each.             It had much the
 appearance of platina; but its specific gravity was so low as from
 10-972 to 11:482; that of pure platina in the same state being at
 least 22. The laminae were flexible, but not very elastic.
    After describing these its physical properties, the author proceeds
 to a circumstantial account of his chemical analysis, and gives an
 ample detail of the action, on this metal, of caloric; of simple com
 bustible bodies, such as sulphur and charcoal; of other metals, form
 ing various alloys; of alkalies and acids, in the latter of which he
found that the true solvent of palladium was nitro-muriatic acid,
 which attacked it with great violence, and formed a beautiful solu
 tion; and lastly, he mentions the appearance and principal proper
ties of the precipitates from its various solutions. From the results
of this investigation we learn, that the vender of this substance was
not guilty of misrepresentation when he ascribed to it the following
properties:
    1. It dissolves in pure spirit of nitre, and makes a dark red solu-
tion.
    2. Green vitriol throws it down in the state of a regulus from this
solution, as it always does gold from aqua regia.
    3. This solution, when evaporated, yields a red calx, that dissolves
in spirit of salt or other acids.
    4. It is thrown down by mercury and by                                all

   Reflecting, however, upon the various modifications which sub
stances undergo when in union with each other, and on the varia
tions produced in the laws of affinity by the intervention of new
bodies, he was induced to try whether, by the affinity of platina with
some other metal easily reduced, and the interference of an interme
diate agent, a reduction of both metals might not be brought about,
although no such effect could be produced upon each metal when
separate. Mercury was thought the most likely to succeed, as being
the most reducible; and the intermediate agent adopted was green
sulphate of iron.      A solution of this sulphate was poured into a salt
of platina, and also into a salt of mercury; in neither of which any
precipitate took place.        The two liquors were then united, and a
precipitate, exactly resembling that which is formed by green sul
phate of iron in palladium, was instantly formed.              This precipitate
was collected and      exposed  to a  strong    heat, and a metallic substance
was obtained, not to be anyways distinguished from palladium.
   Thus, after having been baffled in his attempts to discover, by
analysis, the component parts of this substance, which he could never
bring himself to consider as a new metal, a synthetic process at length
led him to the discovery, that the whole pretence was an imposition,
and that the substance             fact,  is,   in
                                             combination   a  platina and mer  of

iron, mixed with a portion of argill. Its appearance altogether might
easily induce mineralogists to refer it to that kind which has been
distinguished by the name of Arragonite ; but various reasons are
here assigned for considering them as distinct substances. Chemical
analysis has not yet afforded any criteria for distinguishing this spe
cies either from the arragonite or the common carbonates of lime.
And it is lastly thrown out, merely as a conjecture, whether its
greater degree of hardness and specific gravity may not be owing
merely to            its
              constituent particles being more minute and more closely
connected.

give an account of a series of observations on double stars, compre
hending a period of twenty-five years, which, in his opinion, will go
to prove, according to the above assumption, that many of them are
not merely double in appearance, but must be allowed to be real
binary combinations of two stars, intimately held together by the
bond of mutual attraction.
    In this inquiry, three bodies or points are to be exclusively attended
to:1st, the largest of the two stars which make up the double star;
2nd, the smaller of these two stars; and 3rd, the place of the sun,
which at the great distance of the fixed stars may be taken for that
of the observer.      It is obvious, that as this investigation must be
conducted in an     hypothetical  manner, it is necessary to consider the
appearances that would be produced by the motion of these three
bodies, either singly, by pairs, or collectively. This renders it neces
sary to contemplate a variety of cases, and previously to lay down a
certain theory to which the observations may be referred upon the
supposition of either of those cases.        For this purpose the author
has drawn      up tables,  showing   the appearances   as to distance and
angle of position that must result from the motions of either of those
three bodies, whether in right ascension or declination.
    As the number of double stars in which he has ascertained mani
fest changes in their relative positions amount already to more than
fifty, our author thinks it advisable to confine himself in this paper
to only a few of those instances; and, accordingly, we find here an
investigation of the changes of six double stars, viz. c. Geminorum,
y Leonis, a Bootis, & Herculis, 3 Serpentis, and y Virginis; reserving
himself to treat of the others in a future paper.
    His observations on the double star a Geminorum commenced so
long ago as the year 1779, and have been regularly continued to the
present time.      In this interval of twenty-three years and a half, the
distance of the two stars has not varied, being constantly about two
 diameters of the large star; but the angle of position has altered
 considerably. In the year 1779 it measured 32° 47' north preceding;
and by the last observation in the present year it is now only 10°54';
 so that in the space of twenty-three years and a half it has manifestly
 undergone a diminution of no less than 21°54'; and the interme
 diate observations leave no room to doubt that this change has been
 the effect of a gradual and regular motion.
     A revolving star, it is evident, would at once explain such a pro
 gressive change in the angle of position, without an alteration of the
 distance; but this being a supposition of which we have not hitherto
 any precedent, it ought certainly not to be admitted without the
 fullest evidence.    Accordingly, our author enters into a minute ex
 amination, founded on geometrical and optical principles, whether
 the above-mentioned phaenomena cannot be satisfactorily explained
 by other motions of the stars or of the sun, according to the several
 hypotheses above indicated, with the addition of others in which the
 two stars are not supposed to be at equal distances from the Sun.

   Dr. Herschel being aware that the observations he brings forward
in this paper are of a nature so delicate and minute as to afford op
portunities for cavil, has been at considerable pains to point out the
principal circumstances that contribute to the perfection of telescopes
and micrometers, and the precautions to be used as to the state of
the atmosphere. Those ought, he thinks, to be particularly attended
to by accurate observers.
An Account of the Measurement of an Arc of the Meridian, extending
 from Dunnose, in the Isle of Wight, Latitude 50° 37' 8", to Clif

  In this paper we are presented with a further continuation of the
several accounts given, ever since the year 1785, of the trigonometri
cal surveys carried on over various parts of the kingdom. Having
now proceeded a great way in these surveys, Major Mudge thought
it high time to attempt the measurement of a considerable arc of the
meridian in our latitudes. He first assigns his reasons for preferring
the meridian he has here adopted, which depend chiefly on the nature
of the country being less hilly and liable to less obstruction than any
other tract of the length of this arc in the island. He fixed on Dun
nose, in latitude 50° 37' 8", for the southern extremity, and on Clif
ton, a small village in the vicinity of Doncaster, latitude 53° 27' 31",
for the northern termination of this arc: and near the latter place
he found a convenient plain, viz. Misterton Carr, for the measure
ment of a base of verification.                      -
   As the accuracy of the zenith observations would be most es

the arc; the calculations of the sides of a series of triangles extend

the meridional distance between Dunmose and Clifton.    Then come
the observations with the zenith sector at   Dunnose,  Clifton,  and
Arbury Hill, near Daventry, a point almost in the middle of the
arc, which was chosen with a view to ascertain how far the obser
vations at the terminations would agree with others made for finding
the value of its parts.  A few additional observations made at the
Royal Observatory      are also given, serving to demonstrate the pre

The Bakerian Lecture.   Eaperiments and Calculations relative to phy
  sical Optics.  By  Thomas Young, M.D. F.R.S.        Read Novem
  ber 24, 1803.   [Phil. Trans. 1804, p. 1.]
     It
      consists of six sections, the first of which is intended to convey
an experimental demonstration of the general law of the interference
of light. This demonstration rests on two experiments, the results
of which are brought in proof, that fringes of colours, and even the
crested fringes described by Grimaldi, are produced by the inter
ference of two portions of light.        These results are, that if one of
the two   edges  of a shadow     produced   by a narrow opake body be
intercepted by a screen at a small distance from that body, the op
posite edge will no longer exhibit the fringed appearance which it
had in common with the former edge, when the latter was not inter
cepted.
   Under the second head we have a comparison of measures of the
intervals of disappearance of light when refracted between two edges
of knives, or intercepted by a hair or a thin wire. The experiments,
which were partly suggested by some observations of Sir Isaac New
ton, are here collected in tables: and the author states, as a general
inference, that if we thus examine the dimensions of the fringes
under different circumstances, we may calculate the differences of
the lengths of the paths of the portions of light which have been
proved to be concerned in producing those fringes; and we shall
find, that where the lengths are equal, the light always remains
white; but that where either the brightest light, or the light of any
given colour, disappears and reappears a first, a second, or a third
time, the differences of the paths of the two portions are nearly in
an arithmetical progression.
   In the third section, these principles are applied to explain the
repetition of colours sometimes observed within the common rain
bow, particularly those described in the Philosophical Transactions
by Dr. Langwith and Mr. Daval. The train of reasoning here ad
duced would lose too much of                its

are told, may be separated by the prism into seven distinct portions,
nearly equal in magnitude : the two first are red, the third yellowish
green, the fourth green, the fifth blue, the sixth bluish violet, and the
seventh violet. This division, it seems, agrees perfectly with that of
the light reflected by a plate of air Rºth part of an inch in thick

    The sixth and last section describes an experiment on certain dark
rays, which were first noticed by Ritter, and relates to the exis
tence of solar rays accompanying light, but cognizable only by their
chemical effects.      This fact our author has confirmed by observing
the effect of the reflection of these invisible solar rays from a thin
plate of air capable of producing the well-known rings of colours.
This image he threw on paper dipped in a solution of nitrate of
silver, and in less than an hour he distinctly perceived portions of
three dark rings, nearly of the same dimensions, but manifestly dif
ferent from the coloured rings. This seems to coincide with Dr.
 Herschel's late discovery of rays of invisible heat; but our author
 doubts whether we are yet possessed of thermometers of sufficient
 delicacy to place implicit confidence in the experiments hitherto
 made on these rays by means of that instrument.
 Continuation of an Account of a peculiar Arrangement in the Arteries
    distributed on the Muscles of slow-moving Animals, &c. In a Letter
   from Mr. Anthony Carlisle to John Symmons, Esq. F.R.S. Read
    December 8, 1803.       [Phil. Trans. 1804, p. 17.]
     Since the communication of his former paper on that subject, the
 author has collected further illustrations respecting the connexion
 between the disposition of the blood-vessels and the actions of the
 muscles.     His first observations relate to the spermatic and inter
 costal arteries, and those of the diaphragm in men; which, he finds,
 are distributed in a different manner from those of the ordinary
 muscles. Compared with the distribution of the coronary arteries, it
 is found that the latter are much more subdivided or arborescent
 than any other set, and that accordingly these supply the heart, La
 muscle whose actions we know are more rapid than those of any
 other part of the muscular system.
     It is hence inferred, that any impediment to the accustomed course
 of the blood, flowing through muscles, induces a corresponding dimi
 nution in their power of action; and that wherever we find cylin
 drical arteries emitting few lateral branches, we may conclude that
 they appertain to muscles of slow but in general of long-continued
 motion. Of this, instances are given in the human eye, the swim
 ming-bladder of fishes, the intestinum ileum of the Cavia Aguti, and
 various animals of the amphibious class. The better to illustrate his
 observations, the author has added figures of the swimming-bladder
  of the tench, and of the ileum of the Aguti.

An Account of a curious Phaenomenon observed on the Glaciers of Cha
  mouny; together with some occasional Observations concerning the
  Propagation of Heat in Fluids.   By Benjamin Count of Rumford,
  V.P.R.S.  Foreign Associate of the National Institute of France,
  &c. &c. Read December 15, 1803.      [Phil. Trans. 1804, p. 23.]
  The fact here stated is    as follows:At the surface of a solid mass
of ice, of vast thickness and extent, viz. the Glaciers of Montanverd,
certain pits are frequently met with, about seven inches in diameter,
and more than four feet deep, perfectly cylindrical, and always quite
full of water: their sides are smooth, or rather polished, and their
bottoms hemispherical and well defined.       They are always found on
the level  parts of the ice, and  only in the summer season, increasing
gradually in depth as long as the hot weather continues, and dis
appearing at the return of winter, when they are completely frozen
up.
  After calling upon those who maintain that water is a conductor
of heat, to solve this phaenomenon according to their principles, and
pointing out to them, that as the water in these pits, being sur
rounded by ice, must continually be at the freezing point of tempe
rature, it is not the general heat of the fluid that can melt the ice at
the bottom of the pits, our author proceeds to give the following ex
planation of this singular effect.
   The warm winds, he says, which in summer blow over the surface
of this column of ice-cold water, must evidently communicate some
small degree of heat to those particles of the fluid with which this
warm air comes into immediate contact; and the particles of the
water at the surface so heated, being rendered specifically heavier
than they were before by this small increase of temperature, sink
slowly to the bottom of the pit; and here they come in contact with
the ice, and communicate to it the heat by which the depth of the
pit is continually increased.
    Count Rumford mentions next the singular but well-authenticated
fact, of the equal temperature, at                   all
                                              seasons,      the water       of

    The copious contents of this paper are arranged under the three
 following heads:1. A description of the sulphuret of lead men
 tioned in the title; 2. Observations on the various modes of attrac
 tion which influence the formation of mineral substances; and 3. Ob
 servations upon the different kinds of sulphuret of copper.
     1. The cupro-antimonial sulphuret of lead, described in the first
 part, has hitherto been found only in Cornwall; and though many
 specimens of it are to be met with in various collections in the king
 dom, yet no writer has hitherto taken any particular notice of                 nor                               it,

total quantity that should be contained in the three sulphurets of
which this substance consists. The specific gravity of this substance,

   2. The author, proposing to avail himself of the opportunity af
forded him by this inquiry, to enter into an investigation concerning
the various ores that are produced by the combination of sulphur and
copper, of the nature of which neither mineralogy nor chemistry has
yet supplied us with any certain information, thinks it necessary, in
the second part of his paper, to offer some remarks concerning the
different modes of attraction that appear to influence the formation
of mineral substances.
   Two kinds of attraction have hitherto been admitted to prevail in
the formation of mineral substances, viz. the attraction of composition,
and the attraction of aggregation. The former, which is more gene
rally known by the name of chemical attraction, takes place only
between the most simple or primitive molecules of a substance;
which, however, must be of dissimilar nature: and to its action is
owing the formation of new, or, as they may properly be called, se
condary or integrant molecules; because they, and they only, deter
mine the nature of                all
                       the compound bodies belonging        the mineral              to
kingdom.     The difference existing between mineral bodies           now                            is
said to depend1st,     Upon the nature      the primitive molecules, by
                                                               of
the combination       which they are produced; and 2ndly, Upon the
                             of
proportion      which these molecules, supposing them
                   in                                           the same,            to    be
are combined together.       The combination      these secondary mole
                                                                     of
cules    effected by the attraction
         is                             aggregation, which unites them
                                                    of
into one     several masses, perfectly homogeneous
               or                                             their parts.      in   all
This attraction       aggregation
                             of     seems         susceptible   to       be
                                                                   various                     of
modifications, which alter its manner       acting upon the constituent
                                                           of
molecules.     Of these, two are here mentioned          The crystalline      1.

                of                    The simple attraction

is either regular, irregular,           or
                                 amorphous. The first     these produces        of
solid bodies, which are either constantly      the same form,   of subject                      or
to certain laws      variation,

          to                               This, like all other crystalline
attractions, can only take place          fluids, which, among other con

being composed of an aggregate of irregular grains, will appear to
consist of small crystals of a very regular form, as may be very fre
quently seen in manganesian carbonate of lime. At other times,
again, the molecules, instead of uniting together by the influence of
the crystalline attraction of aggregation, are precipitated in a de
tached but confused manner; and then a simple aggregation takes
place, which banishes all appearances of crystallization, and affords
the aspect which has been distinguished by the name of compact or
earthy.
   This last, or the amorphous species of crystallization, is here de
scribed as being that kind which, though it produces no determinate
form, is nevertheless the result of a regular aggregation.     This is
thought to depend on the peculiar form of the primitive molecules;

to ascribe      these   substances,

     Atthe close     this part   of the paper, the author acknowledges
that the different kinds       attraction here described may

more than simple modifications of one and the same power, origi
nally belonging to matter; but he maintains, at the same time, that
these modifications certainly exert as much force, at the time of their
operation, as could be exerted by attractive forces that are really dif
ferent.
   In the third part, which treats of the different kinds of sulphuret
of copper, we are first apprised of the importance of this inquiry, by
the observation, that, on comparing the different characters of this
substance with those of the triple sulphuret described in the first part
of this paper, we shall find that the antimony and the lead, which
have been generally considered as constituent parts of the last-men
tioned ore, are, in fact, nothing more than accidental ingredients,
introduced merely by the attraction of aggregation.
   In the sequel of the paper, the author introduces an ample stock
of observations and analyses respecting                         various   cupro-sulphurets,
which have been hitherto very imperfectly examined.                And first he
treats of the gray tetrahedral sulphuret of copper, which is found to
consist of copper, iron, and sulphur, in different proportions; the
gray copper ore, called Fahlerz by the Germans, being of the same
composition.    The yellow copper ore, or Kupferkies of the Germans,
appears to be double sulphuret of copper and iron, but constituting
a species distinct from the gray sulphuret of the same tetrahedral
form. Among these, there is one in particular which has not yet
been described as belonging to this ore; namely, the dodecahedron
with rhombic planes, which has hitherto been found only in Corn
wall, and there only in small quantities, though in crystals of con
siderable size.    It is also shown at length wherein most of the cha
racters of the tetrahedral yellow cupro-martial sulphuret differ from
those of the octahedral sulphuret of iron.
    The following question is next proposed, and strongly recommended
 to the future investigation of mineralogists.         As the true sulphuret
 of copper and the fahlerz are of a blackish gray colour, how comes it
 that the kind of cupro-martial sulphuret, commonly called pyritical
 copper, has always that brilliant yellow colour which particularly
                   to it,
 characterizes       and which       the principal cause that leads many
                                       is
 mineralogists       consider     it  being nothing more than
                                       as                                martial    a

 told, will materially contribute           to

scribed, and that many of those with which we are acquainted have
not been sufficiently examined.
   A general observation, which he tells us is founded upon long ex
perience,        is,
             that there exists   great variety    minerals which have
                                                        a                         of

                                         is        this paper, has been       of

these lateral orifices; that they have not as yet been discovered in
the genus Anguis; and that in general it appears that only venomous
snakes have this distinctive character.
   From Mr. Home's description and remarks, we learn that these
orifices do not lead to the nostril or to the ear, but to a distinct bag
of  a rounded form, there being within the skull a hollow of the same
shape, surrounded by bone, which seems purely intended to receive
                                                cup, formed by the bones
 of it.

 the cylinder. Six of these instruments, with proper stands, and
 auxiliary implements of obvious construction, were prepared for the
 sake of comparative experiments.
    A previous trial was made with two of the cylinders, the vertical
 polished sides of the one being naked, and those of the other covered
 with one thickness of fine white Irish linen, strained over the metallic
 surface.    Here it was found, contrary to expectation, that in a cer
 tain  space  of time the covered cylinder had lost considerably more
heat than the naked one.
   In reflecting on this experiment it occurred to the author, that in
order to insure the accuracy of the comparison between experiments
made at different times and at different places, it would be necessary
to fix on some particular interval of the scale of the thermometer
above the temperature of the air by which the instrument is sur
rounded. He therefore determined that                            all
                                                  experiments should begin

   Led      by this conjecture, several experiments were made with
                on
cylinders covered with one, two,        more coatings     glue, and

cessive coatings having been applied, the cooling again became less
rapid, and
                                                                                            is of

produced the greatest effect. No probable reason     yet assigned for
this limitation.
     The next object was    find out what effect colour would produce
                                            to
   the experiments, and accordingly the cylinder with eight coatings
of in
   varnish was painted black;      was also painted   itthe same manner                     in
after all the varnish had been washed     away;  and  lastly,  was like                                    it

 the blackened sides, as 5,654 is to 10,000 very nearly, the velocities
 being as the times of cooling inversely.
    Before he proceeds further in his investigation, the author finds it
 necessary to describe an additional instrument which he contrived
 for measuring, or rather for discovering, those very small changes of
 temperature in bodies which are occasioned by the radiations of other
 neighbouring bodies that happen to be at a higher or a lower tempera
 ture. This instrument, which he calls a Thermoscope, consists of two
 glass balls joined with and opening into the two ends of a glass tube,
 which is bent in two places at right angles, so that the balls, when
 the instrument is erected, are at the same horizontal height. A small
 quantity (about one drop) of coloured spirits of wine was introduced
 into this tube before it was finally closed, which, when the tempera
 ture of the air in the whole tube and the two balls is equal, keeps its
 place nearly at the middle of the lower or horizontal part of the tube.
 No sooner, however, does this perfect equilibrium cease, than the drop
 will move towards the side that is least heated.  A scale is here ap
plied, which indicates the difference of the temperature of the air in
the two sides of the tube, and in the respective balls.     A vertical
  screen between the two balls prevents the radiance of a heated body
  approached to one of them from affecting the other. This instrument
  was found of so delicate a sensibility, that the naked hand presented
  to one of the balls at the distance of several inches, would put the
  spirit of wine in motion, and the approach of a person at some feet
  from it would immediately affect                  it.
    A    conjecture      now proposed, which this instrument was intended
                          is
 to   elucidate and probably confirm. There being great reason                  con
  clude, that all the heat which          hot body loses when exposed

  light, generate heat only then and there where they are intercepted
  and absorbed;         may hence

     The first experiment, which has thrown some light upon this sub
ject, was made with two brass cylinders equally heated, but                     one             in

station till the effect was compensated by proportionably altering
the distances of the heated cylinders from the balls. In some further
experiments, instead of blackening one of the flat surfaces of one of
the cylinders, the other coverings used in the foregoing trials were
applied, and the results were such as might have been expected.
They all tended to prove that different bodies, or rather different
surfaces, emit heat not by any conducting power in themselves, or
in the surrounding bodies, but by a power which is here called ra
diation, the nature of which had hitherto escaped our notice.
     Several experiments were next made with heated cylinders of dif
ferent metals, but the results proved that all metals give off heat with
the same facility, or rather with the same celerity. May not this, it
is asked, be owing to their being                 all

    Before these questions can be solved, another and very important        a
point  in  this inquiry must be decided, viz. whether bodies are cooled
in   consequence     of the rays they emit,          by those they receive
                                                        or                        Our
author was manifestly led             this problem by the celebrated experi

istence   of these cold emanations universally; and this being success
fully effected,    it   is proved by other processes, the detail               which     of
would far exceed our bounds, that the radiation                 cold   of well as  as                  of
hot bodies being established, the rays which proceed from cold bodies
have likewise the power              generating cold
                                       of                         in

thermoscope affected the indications very sensibly and rapidly,                    oc
 curred that perhaps animal substances emit both calorific and frigo
 rific rays more copiously than other substances, and that probably
living animal bodies emit them               still greater abundance than dead
                                                  in
 animal matter. This was confirmed by very conclusive experiment,

               -

substance were likewise found to be much more efficacious in pro
ducing cold than those from the polished surface; though in what
proportion could not be ascertained with any degree of accuracy. In
general, however, there is every reason to conclude that at equal                                                     in
tervals of temperature, the rays which generate cold are just as real
and just as intense as those which generate heat, or that their actions
are equally powerful in changing the temperature of neighbouring
bodies.
   Our author, ever doubtful of the existence of the caloric of the
modern chemists, thinks himself authorized here to throw out the
following observation respecting that favourite hypothesis.            On a
supposition that caloric has a real existence, and that heat or an                                                    in
crease of temperature in any body is caused by an accumulation of
that substance in such body, the reflection of cold would indeed be
impossible; and to maintain                    its
                                    reality must      unprejudiced minds to    all
appear   an absurdity.
   By further experiments            proved that
                                          it   is    those circumstances      all
which are favourable          the copious emission
                                 to                    calorific rays from     of                                          .
the surfaces        of
                   hot bodies, are equally favourable           the copióus                to
emission    offrigorific rays from such bodies when they are cold. That,
on the other hand, those substances which part with heat with the
greatest facility       celerity, are those which acquire
                           or                                     also most                     it
readily. Also that              an
                             animal substance, for instance goldbeater's
skin, will throw off more heat, and         more sensibly affected by the

frigorific rays     colder bodies when blackened, than when they are
                     of
of  their natural colour.    This latter fact        applied        proof
                                                                    is          the       as                     of

availing themselves         this circumstance when they visit the torrid

countries,    of besmearing their bodies with oil               other unctuous       or

the hypothesis of radiation, depending very much on the polish of
their surfaces. Thus if those substances which supply the warmest
coverings, such as furs, feathers, silk, &c. be viewed through a mi
croscope, we shall find the surfaces of their fibres or minute laminae
not only smooth, but also very highly polished: and those substances
will be warmest which excel in these respects, the fine white shining
fur of a Russian hare being much warmer than coarse hair; and fine
silk, as spun by the silk-worm, being preferable for warmth to the
same silk twisted together into coarse threads.
   A considerable part of the paper is now bestowed on the theory of
heat, which the author attempts to deduce from the foregoing facts
and observations.     Heat and cold, he says, like fast and slow, are
mere relative terms; and as there is no relation between motion and
rest, so there can be none between any degree of heat and absolute
cold, or a total privation of heat.    It has long been thought, and it
appears more and more probable, that motion is an essential quality
inherent in        all
                matter: this    illustrated
                                       is                           by
                                                 many examples; and by
applying the analogy above given, and the observations since brought
forward, there seems every reason          believe that, without having
                                                        to
recourse     any specific element, all the phenomena
              to                                            heat may be                  of
accounted for  by  the simple operations       motion;   that motion,
                                                             of                     or                        in
fact, constitutes the heat       or     temperature              of   sensible bodies.

               no
effects  of frigorific   rays; but this objection       answered by the ob

  Hence there is reason to think that, contrary to the general opinion,
 white garments are warmer than any other in cold weather; and in
 deed if they are well calculated to reflect calorific rays in summer,
 they ought to be equally well calculated to reflect those frigorific rays
 by which we are annoyed in winter. Fur garments have been found
 by experience to be much warmer in cold weather, when worn with
 the hair outwards, than when it is turned inwards.
    This is alleged as a proof that we are kept warm by our clothing
 not so much by confining the heat of our bodies, as by repelling those
 frigorific rays which tend to cool us. The fur of several delicate
 animals we know becomes white in winter in cold countries; and
 bears which inhabit the polar regions are likewise known to be white
 in all seasons. Now                  if,

in of
   the mould, contained        pots about ten inches

above-mentioned conjecture of the retrograde motion of the sap be
founded, it would follow that in the subsequent vegetation the in
verted would display a more vigorous growth than the proper end;
and this accordingly was soon found to be the case, with this addi
tional circumstance, that the parts beyond the buds on the inverted
ends were observed to increase considerably, while the same parts
on the proper ends not only withered, but even gradually died away.
   In another experiment a number of cuttings of gooseberry and
currant trees were planted, some in their natural erect, and others
in an inverted position. Many of these, especially the gooseberry
cuttings, failed altogether; but in those that survived, the same ac
cumulation of wood was observed on the upper ends of the inverted
cuttings as on the vine shoots: similar effects were likewise observed
in inverted grafts of the apple-tree, and in some respects also in cut
tings from the sallow-tree, where, however, they being of some
length, the accumulation of wood did not take place at the summit,
but about the base of the cuttings.

may all be deduced from the author's theory, which, in addition to

 liquefied by fire, and formed into cakes. And, 4. Shell lac, being the
 original comb, liquefied in water, strained through a cotton cloth, and
 spread upon a junk of a plantain-tree so as to form thin transparent
 laminae: this kind contains the least of the tinging substance, as may
 well be expected from the mode in which it is prepared.
    Among the chemists who have hitherto analysed this substance,
 none deserve notice except M. Geoffroy; but our author's present
labours render his investigations of little or no avail.
    The first section of this paper treats of the effects of different
 menstrua on the varieties of lac, from which it appears that it is so
luble in alkalies, and in some of the acids. And the second section
 contains an account of the analytical experiments made on stick,
 seed, and shell lac. From the ample series of facts herein contained,
 of which it is in vain to attempt a compendious abstract, we collect
 in general that the varieties of lac consist of four ingredients, namely,
 extractive colouring matter, resin, gluten, and a peculiar kind of
 wax; and that the resin is the predominant ingredient, insomuch
 that, strictly speaking, we ought to consider lac as consisting prin
 cipally of resin mixed with certain proportions of a particular kind
 of wax, gluten, and colouring extract. The mean results of the ex
periments give the proportions as follows:100 parts of stick lac
 are found to contain resin 68, colouring extract 10, wax 6, gluten 5%,
 and extraneous matter 6; ;-seed lac, resin 88%, colouring extract 2%,
 wax 4%, gluten 2;-and shell lac, resin 90.90, colouring extract #,
wax 4, and gluten 2-80. Each of these ingredients, we must ob
serve, has been separately and carefully analysed.
    The third and last section contains a number of general obser
vations, chiefly relating to the uses of this substance.         From the
whole of the experiments here related, it appears that although lac
be indisputably the production of insects, yet it possesses few of the
characters of animal substances; and that the greater part of its ag
gregate properties, as well as those of its component ingredients, are
such as more immediately appertain to vegetable bodies.            Its uses
are various, and some of them important. The Indians manufacture
it into rings, beads, and other female ornaments. When formed into
sealing-wax, it is employed as a japan, and is likewise manufactured
into different coloured varnishes.     The colouring part is formed into
lakes for  painters;  and as a dyeing   material it is in very general use.
The resinous    part is employed   to make grindstones, by melting and
mixing it with about three parts of sand, or with a like proportion
of powder of corundum for those stones which are used by lapidaries.
We owe to Mr. Wilkins the information, that a peculiar and ex
cellent kind of ink is prepared by the Hindoos of shell lac, dissolved
in water by the mere addition of a little borax, and by adding to the
solution a certain quantity of ivory- or lamp-black. This process has
the further advantage of teaching us to prepare an aqueous solution
of lac, which probably will be found of very extensive utility, espe
cially in the preparation of varnishes and pigments, which, when
perfectly dry, will not be easily affected by damp or water.

                                                       150
   The opinion generally adopted by chemists, that acids and alkalies
do not act upon resinous bodies, appears from this investigation to be
altogether erroneous; since the chief ingredient of lac which we have
seem is soluble in those menstrua, is now determined to be of a re
sinous nature.
   Some hints are lastly given concerning the further uses that may
be made of these preparations in various manufactures, especially in
dyeing, and the preparation of colours: nor is it thought unlikely that
medicine may derive some advantages from the application of the
extensive series of acid and alkaline solutions of resinous substances,
which till now were thought to be unattainable.

Observations on Basalt, and on the Transition from the vitreous to the
  stony Terture, which occurs in the gradual Refrigeration of melted
  Basalt; with some geological Remarks.     In a Letter from Gregory
  Watt, Esq. to the Right Hon. Charles Greville, V.P.R.S.        Read
  May 10, 1804. [Phil. Trans. 1804, p. 279.]
     The number of conjectures that have been formed respecting the
nature   of basalt, and the variety of opinions hitherto entertained
concerning its aqueous or volcanic origin, not having yet proved sa
tisfactory to those who are more seriously bent upon the discovery
of truth than the triumph of victory in a controversy; we are much
indebted to the author of this paper for the ample body of obser
vations and ingenious remarks it contains, from which, though they
by no means establish either of the contested hypotheses, much may,
however, be collected, which cannot fail to throw additional light
on various intricate points in mineralogy and geology.
    The main object here agitated, is the transition from the vitreous
to the stony texture, which takes place in the refrigeration of glass;
and the following experiment takes the lead in this investigation,
and affords the materials for the subsequent disquisitions.
    About 7 cwt. of the kind of basalt called Rowley Rag, of which a
minute description is here given, were put into a common reverbera
tory furnace, strongly heated for several hours. It soon melted with
a less degree of heat than would have fused an equal weight of pig
iron, and subsided into the deeper part of the furnace in the form of
a liquid but rather tenacious glass.         A portion of               it,
                                                                 on being taken
out and suffered     to  cool, retained the character         perfect glass. But
                                                                   of
the remainder     of   the mass was left        the furnace, which was gra
                                                  in
 dually cooled, and       ineight days      was extracted, being cold
                                           it                                   its           on
 surface, but still retaining   a  considerable    degree      internal heat. Its
                                                                   of
shape being very irregular,      it  was      differently affected
                                                so                       the same   by
 degree       heat, and the same progressive refrigeration, that              uni        no

 mation   of  minute globules, thickly disseminated throughout the mass.
In    the process  of   cooling, these globules adapt their form             their       to
 confined situation, gradually filling up every interstice; and they
 finally assume the appearance           of   substance apparently homoge

particles of the mass be continued, another change immediately com
mences, in the progress of which the whole acquires a more stony
texture, and a greater degree of tenacity. This is generally effected
by a gradual formation of secondary spheroids in the heart of the
jaspideous substance, whose centres are more distant, and dimensions
greater than those of the above-mentioned globules: they are radiated
with distinct fibres. When two of these spheroids come into contact
by mutual enlargement, no intermixture of their fibres seems to take
place; they reciprocally compress each other, and their limits are de
fined by planes, at which a distinct separation takes place.       When
 several spheroids come in contact on the same level, they are formed
by mutual pressure into prisms of tolerable regularity, whose division
is perfectly defined: and when a spheroid is surrounded on          sides                                        all

enter into this new bond          association, they must form

gradually propagate itself till the temperature of the glass is equal
ized, and then the recurrence of the circumstances which induced
the first particles to arrange themselves will cause other particles to
arrange themselves also ; and these the attraction of aggregation will
dispose round the point first formed.      A second emission of heat in
every direction will now take place; the temperature will again be
equalized; and again another concentric coat of arranged particles
will apply itself to the little globule. That these globules are formed
of concentric coats does not clash with the circumstance of their being
likewise radiated; as every one may have remarked the connexion
that almost uniformly exists between the radiated structure and the
formation by concentric coats; the more obvious instances of which
 are the haematites and the calcareous stalactites.      In what manner
this is likely to be effected is stated at some length in the paper.
    Some curious remarks are next made on the observation of Mr.
 Smithson, that solution, far from being necessary to crystallization,
 effectually prevents its commencement;        since, while solution sub
 sists, crystallization cannot take place: and many of the phenomena
being duly considered, it seems most probable that the particles of
bodies apparently solid must be capable of some internal motion,
 enabling them to arrange themselves according to their crystalline
polarity while they are in a solid state. Among the instances given,
 are the conversion of glass vessels into Reaumur's porcelain, the tem
 pering of steel, and the process of annealing. This does not alto
 gether disprove the crystallizations formed by molecules suspended
 in aqueous solutions; but it is in general insisted upon, that all cry
 stallizations are dependent on heat, there being, in fact, no fluidity,
 and consequently no solution, which heat does not produce.
    These observations tend to prove the analogy which exists between
 the igneous and aqueous formations, and to show that precisely the
 same order and kind of arrangement is followed in the generation of
 stony masses from water as from fire.        Among the many instances
 that are adduced to justify this assertion, are, on the one hand, the
 phenomena exhibited by lavas, in which may be observed every step
 of the passage from the vitreous to the stony, from that to a porphy
 ritic, and finally to the granitic state : on the other hand, we may
 select the formation of calcareous stalactites, in which the successive
 depositions of calcareous carbonate form a mass which at first is
 fibrous; a continuance of the process causes the fibrous structure to
 disappear, and the stalactite becomes irregularly spathose;          after
 which the    irregularities vanish  altogether,  and it becomes    perfect
 calcareous spar, divisible into large rhomboids, with the form pecu
 liar to that mineral.
     Adverting now to the chief object of this paper,     the basalt,   the
 author observes, that should, in fact, the analogy between the aqueous
  and igneous formation appear founded, the transition from glass to
  stone can no way affect the great question which has so long divided
  geologists about the origin of basalt: for though it be synthetically
  demonstrated that basalt may be formed by fire, the proofs in favour

                                                                     154

weight.             In
            fact, while the frequent instances                                            of be    petrifactions found
in  basalt support the aqueous hypothesis, the equally numerous indi
cations that the heat emanating from           has manifestly changed beds it
of   coal into coke and indurated strata         stony substances, strongly     of
argue       favour

fibres of the spheroids,will produce convex articulations in the lower
joints of the prisms.  If the generating centres are not equidistant,
the forms of the pillars will be irregular, and of different number of
angles; and as the compression of the fibres will be greatest on the
level of the generating centres, the lower part of the prisms will be
most compact.
   All the observations hitherto made on the great basaltic masses in
nature, seem to confirm this simple theory; and the author bestows
some pains in accounting for the appearances which seem at first
sight not to agree perfectly with                        it.

the treatise.
   Lastly, the author directs his attention       the many instances     to                                        of
other substances, besides basalt, which affect       columnar form, and        a
which afford convincing proofs that their configuration not confined                     is

Chemistry        Madrid, who has taken considerable pains
                      at                                              ascertain               in

ing the constituent parts of this ore, both analytically and syntheti
cally.  In the progress of this inquiry, a certain analogy soon pre
sented itself, between these compounds of sulphur and iron and
those of other inflammable substances, such as carbon and phospho
rus, with the same metal, which suggested the idea of some experi
ments on the subject; from whence various facts were deduced, not
only of much curiosity, but also likely to lead to some useful pur
poses, as will appear hereafter.   The principal results of this labo
rious investigation are,      L
   1. That the component ingredients of the magnetical pyrites are
sulphur, and iron in the metallic state, the former being to the latter
in the proportion nearly of 37 to 63.
   2. That the chemical and other properties of this substance are
very different  from those of the common martial pyrites; which,
however, are likewise composed of sulphur and iron, but varying in
proportion from between 52 to 54 of sulphur, and 48 to 46 of me
tallic iron. Whence it appears, that the relative proportions in the
composition of the magnetical pyrites, and of the mean of the com
mon pyrites, is between 16 and 17.
   3. That as the magnetical pyrites agrees in analytical results, as
well as in all chemical and other properties, with that sulphuret of
iron which hitherto has been only known as an artificial product,
there is no doubt that it is identically the same, and that its pro
portions are probably subjected to a certain law, which, under cer
tain circumstances, may be supposed to act in an almost invariable
IIlanner.
   4. That in the formation of the common martial pyrites, there is
a deviation from this law, and that sulphur becomes a predominant
ingredient, variable in quantity, but which, by the present experi
ments, has not been found to exceed between 54 and 55 per cent. ;
a proportion, however, which possibly may be surpassed in other
pyrites which have not as yet been chemically examined.
   5. That iron, when combined naturally or artificially with 36 or
37 per cent. of sulphur, is not only still capable of receiving the mag
netic fluid, but it is also rendered capable of retaining                           it,   so   as

ficially combined with 45% per cent.      sulphur.  of

iron, so are the effects of phosphorus found to be ; phosphoret of iron

by their union with iron, many chemical effects, of much similarity,
so do each of them, when combined with that metal in certain pro-.
portions, not only permit it to receive, but also give it the peculiar
power of retaining the magnetical properties; and thus henceforth,
in addition to that carburet of iron called steel, certain sulphurets
and phosphurets of iron may be regarded as bodies peculiarly suscep
tible of strong magnetical impregnation.                                -
   Among the observations which are subjoined to this paper, we find
some remarks on the vitriolization of pyrites; from which we collect,
that, contrary to the opinion of Mr. Proust, who thought that only
those pyrites in which the proportion of sulphur is very small are
liable to this change, the vitriolization is not so much owing to the
proportion as to the state of the sulphur in the compound; and that
this state is probably the effect of a small portion of oxygen, pre
viously combined with a part or with the general mass of the sul
phur at the time of the original formation of the substances; so that
the state of this ingredient is tending to that of oxide.
   It is,   no doubt, remarkable, that the magnetical properties        the                         of
sulphuret        iron, which forms the principal subject

Observations    on the Change    of some of the proximate Principles of
   Vegetables   into  Bitumen;   with analytical Eaperiments on a pecu.
   liar Substance which is found with the Bovey Coal. By Charles
   Hatchett, Esq. F.R.S. Read June 14, 1804. [Phil. Trans. 1804,
   p. 385.]
   Among the several spontaneous permutations          in the productions
of  nature,  none  perhaps  are more    striking, and in many cases more
unaccountable, than those which transfer bodies from one kingdom
of nature into another; and those changes which transform organized
into fossil substances are certainly not the least extraordinary and
instructive.
    The most numerous instances of this transformation are, no doubt,
what we distinguish by the name of Eatraneous Fossils; some of
which still retain part of their original substance, whilst others can
only be regarded as casts or impressions. An attentive observer will
soon perceive a kind of gradation in these fossils, whether from ani
mals or vegetables, commencing with those whose matter retains a
marked analogy with that of the recent substances, and terminating
 in bodies decidedly mineral.     And a curious remark occurs here,
 that as animal petrifactions are most commonly of a calcareous na
 ture, so, on the contrary, vegetable petrifactions are generally sili
 CeOus.
    Without entering any further into a general disquisition on this
important subject, our author proposes to discuss, in this paper, one
particular case of the changes which organized, and especially vege
table, substances undergo, by being long buried in earthy strata, and
 thus exposed to the effects of mineral agents: and the instance he
 selects is the bituminous substances, concerning which he has long
 suspected that they are derived from the organized kingdoms, and
 especially from the resin and juices of vegetable substances, by the
 action of some of the mineral principles.
    He cites three instances in this kingdom in which nature points
 out these changes, and which exhibit the gradations above intimated.
 These are, 1. The submarine forest at Sutton, on the coast of Lin
 colnshire, the timber of which has not suffered any very apparent
 change in its vegetable characters; 2. The strata of bituminous wood
 (called Bovey Coal) found at Bovey, in Devonshire, which exhibit a
 series of gradations, from the most perfect ligneous texture to a sub
 stance nearly approaching to the characters of pit-coal; and 3. All
 the varieties of pit-coal, so abundant in many parts of this country,
 in which almost every appearance of vegetable origin has been ob
literated.
    As the Bovey coal appears to be the mean in that gradation, and
 therefore most likely to afford instructive results, our author resolved
 to limit his inquiry into this process of nature, which may not im
properly be called Carbonization, to that fossil, and to a peculiar
bituminous substance with which it is often accompanied. But here
he finds it expedient to premise some observations on a remarkable

                                                         160
schistus found at Reykum, one of the great spouting hot springs in
Iceland. The singularity of this substance     that great part                 is,             a                       of  it

which we    collect,    that this       peculiar

that of the bitumen called Asphaltum; the resin being in the largest
proportion, 100 grains affording 55 of resin, and 44 of asphaltum.
Thus we have an instance of a substance found under circumstances
which constitute a fossil, although the character of it partly apper
tain to the vegetable and partly to the mineral kingdom
    In the concluding section the author enters into an inquiry on the
action of alcohol on resins and bitumens. Its power of dissolving the
former is well known; but, contrary to the adopted opinion, he found
that it also acted on bitumen, though indeed in a slight degree. His
chief object was to ascertain whether a small portion of resin is con
tained in any of the bitumens, or, if not, to determine the nature of
the substance which can be separated, although very sparingly, from
those substances by digestion in alcohol. The results prove that the
small portion which can be extracted from bitumen by digestion with
alcohol is petroleum.
    From a general view of the subject, the author thinks himself jus
tified in asserting, that in bitumens the process of transformation ap
pears to have been completed; whereas in the Bovey coal, and espe
cially in the substance which accompanies         Nature seems       it,

some other unknown metallic ingredient.       Since those experiments,
two French chemists, Messrs. Descotils and Vauquelin, having like
wise examined that substance, found the same new metal; but nei
ther of them observed that       contains moreover another metal dif
                                            it
ferent from any hitherto known.
   The black powder used      the process, which
                                        in        the subject   this        is                       of
paper, was obtained from platina carefully separated from     extra                            all
neous particles;            so
                    that the above ingredients,    found, must have         if
been contained in that metal.
  The first set         of
                   experiments relates   the effects produced   tothis                               by
powder when alloyed with other metals.         combines  readily withIt
lead; but the compound, even when the lead greatly predominates,
is not very fusible. With bismuth, zinc, and tin, the effects are
nearly similar; but with copper,   strong heat produces
                                                  a        much more                      a

intimate union. The union of this substance with silver and gold
produced upon it very little alteration; but, what is most remark
able,    could not be separated from these metals by the usual pro
         it
cesses    of refining.The alloys retain a considerable share of duc
tility; and the colour of that which is alloyed with gold is not ma
terially different from that of pure gold.
   The next experiments relate to the analysis of the black powder,
and the properties of the two metals which enter into its composition.
The method of dissolving the powder was similar to that employed
by M. Vauquelin, viz. by the alternate action of caustic alkali and
of an acid. The acid solution was found to contain that particular
metal which has been noticed by Descotils.       And of this metal, a
considerable number of characters are here described, in addition to
those already mentioned by the French chemists.
. As to the alkaline solution, which Vauquelin considered as con
taining a portion of oxide of chrome, it is observed, that though some
kinds of platina may contain chrome, and of course exhibit a certain
quantity of it in its black powder, yet the precipitate which, upon
accurate investigation, is yielded by it affords a very volatile metallic
oxide, which evidently has not the characteristic qualities of that
metal.    As it is expedient to assign a specific name to every new
substance, our author wishes to distinguish this precipitate by the
appellation of Osmium, from the strong smell it emits. After show
ing in what manner it may be expelled from the alkali by an acid,
and obtained by solution with water and distillation, the author men
tions many of its relative properties and characteristic qualities. The
                                                                                                    *
most striking test of this oxide, we are told, is the mixture of its
solution with an infusion of galls, which presently produces a purple
colour, and becomes soon after of a deep vivid blue. It parts freely
with its oxygen to            all
                         metals excepting gold and platina.

    The attraction of cohesion in the parts of muscle appears to be
 strongest in the direction of the fibres, and to be double that of the
 contrary or transverse direction. When muscles cease to be irritable,
this attraction in the direction of the fibres is diminished; but it re
mains unaltered in the transverse direction.
    When muscles act more powerfully or more rapidly than is pro
 portionate to the strength of the sustaining parts, they do not usually
 rupture their fleshy fibres, but generally break their tendons, or even
 an intervening bone; whence it is inferred, that the attraction of
 cohesion is more active and powerful in the contracted state of the
 muscle than during its relaxed or passive state.
    The muscular parts of different classes of animals vary materially
in colour and texture; and such variations occur not unfrequently in
 different parts of the same individual.
    Sect. 2. Of the anatomical structure of muscles, and their relations with
 other parts of the animal body.The lecturer in this section professes
 to give no more than a rapid sketch of the history of muscular struc
 ture. One example of the origin of a muscle he deduces from the
process of the incubated egg: but here it remains doubtful whether
the rudiments of the punctum saliens be part of the cicatricula or
ganized by the parent, or merely a structure resulting from the first
process of incubation. The anatomical structure of muscular fibres,
he next observes, is generally complex, according as they are con
nected with membrane, blood-vessels, nerves, and lymphaeducts;
which seem to be only appendages of convenience to the essential
matter of muscle.
    A muscular fibre, being carefully inspected in a powerful micro
scope, is found to be a solid cylinder, the covering of which, as had
already been intimated in a previous part of the lecture, is a reticu
lar membrane, and the contained part a pulpy substance, irregularly
granulated, and of scarce any cohesive power when dead.
    The arteries articulate copiously upon the reticular coat of the
muscular fibre; they anastomose with corresponding veins; but this
continued canal is not supposed to act in a direct manner upon the
matter of muscle. In what manner the capillary arteries terminating
in the muscular fibre may effect all the changes of increase in the
bulk or number of fibres, in the replenishment of exhausted mate
rials, and in the repair of injuries, is as yet matter of conjecture;
but these arteries, it is thought, must be secretory vessels for de
positing the muscular matter, the lymphaeducts serving to remove
the superfluous fluids and the decayed substances which are unfit for
use.    These lymphaeducts appear to receive the fluids they contain,
not, as has been represented, from the projecting open ends of tubes,
but from the interstitial spaces formed by the reticular or cellular
membrane.
    The functions of nerves in the muscular system are the next object
of contemplation. These also, it seems, terminate in the reticular or
cellular membrane, the common integument, and the connecting
medium of all the dissimilar parts of an animal.        We have to regret

                                    165
that we cannot dwell longer on this curious part of the lecture, espe
cially where it treats of the combination, by means of nerves between
animated and what may be deemed inanimate matter, as in the in
stances of bones, shells, teeth, and other extravascular and insensible
substances, which, when completed, are no longer alterable by the .
animal functions.
  Sect. 3. Of the connerions between the functions of muscles and the
temperature and respiration of the animal.That different parts of an
animal are susceptible of different degrees of temperature, is a fact
which stands in no need of demonstration; and it is equally obvious
that every animal, besides being susceptible of the external changes
 of temperature, possesses also the power of generating heat within
itself. This last-mentioned power is ascribed, in a great measure,
 to respiration; and this opens a field of inquiry, in what manner
and to what degree the different classes of animals are possessed of
 that faculty. In this disquisition we find, among other interesting
facts, a curious account in what manner hybernating animals are
 enabled to subsist several months without respiration.
     The irritability of the heart, we are next told, is inseparably con
 nected with respiration, and the blood appears to be the medium of
 conveying heat to the different parts of the body; and hence it is
 naturally inferred, that the changes of animal temperature in the
 same individual are always connected with, and proportionate to, the
velocity of the circulation. After death, the blood of an animal is
 presently coagulated, and the muscles are usually contracted; but,
 from some observations here stated, it appears that the final con
 traction of muscles is not inseparable from coagulation of the blood
 within them, nor of a change in the reticular membrane.            Lastly,
 it is asserted, that the reiterated influx of blood is not essential to
 muscular irritability; since the limbs of animals, separated from the
 body, continue for a long time afterwards capable of contractions
 and relaxations.
     Sect. 4. Of the application of chemistry to this subject.Our lec
 turer asserts, under this head, that the constituent elements of both
 animal and vegetable substances are not separable by any chemical
 process hitherto instituted, in such a manner as to admit of a syn
 thetical re-combination: and he maintains, that, until such a re
 combination can be effected,    all  chemical discussions and investiga
tions  on   the matterof   muscles are not likely   afford any conclusive
                                                      to
 illustration.

                                                 to
preceding arguments.-We meet here with            number

tractions of death. The latter always contain more red particles in
their substance than those of cold blood, and are sooner deprived of
their irritability, even though their relative temperature be preserved.
It appears, also, that respiration in the former tribe is more essential
to life than in the latter.
   Various experiments are next mentioned on the substances which
accelerate the cessation of irritability in muscles when applied to
their naked fibrils, such as all narcotic vegetables, poisons, muriate of
soda, the bile of animals, &c.        Discharges of electricity, passed
through muscles, destroy their irritability, but leave them apparently
inflated with small bubbles of gas, owing, perhaps, to some combi
nation which decomposes water. Workmen who are exposed to the
contact of white lead, nitric acid, or quicksilver, frequently expe
rience local spasms or partial palsy.
   Lastly, some arguments are adduced which prove that a smaller
quantity of blood flows through a muscle in the state of contraction
than during its quiescent state; that when muscles are vigorously
contracted, their sensibility to pain is nearly destroyed; and that the
human muscles are susceptible of considerable changes, from extra
ordinary impressions on the mind, such as grief, fear, uncommon
attention, mental derangement, &c.; in all which cases uncommon
muscular exertions have been observed, which could not have been
affected without the operation of those stimulants.
   Sect. 6.-This section contains some conclusive remarks, chiefly
on the effects of stimuli on the muscles, as they are distinguished
into voluntary, involuntary, and mixed.          For the classification of
these agents here stated, we must refer the curious physiologist to
the paper itself; having already, perhaps, trespassed too far upon
the time that can well be spared for the abstract of this lecture.
Eageriments      for ascertaining how far Telescopes will enable us to
   determine    very small Angles, and to distinguish the real from the
   spurious Diameters of celestial and terrestrial Objects : with an
   Application of the Result of these Eaperiments to a Series of Ob
   servations on the Nature and Magnitude of Mr. Harding's lately dis
   covered Star.      By William Herschel,    LL.D. F.R.S.      Read   De
   cember 6, 1804.      [Phil. Trans. 1805,   p. 31.]
   Dr. Herschel commences his paper by stating, that, being desirous
of ascertaining the magnitude of the moving celestial body lately dis
covered by Mr. Harding, and intending, for that purpose, to make
use of a ten-feet reflector, it appeared to him a desideratum highly
worthy of investigation, to determine how small a diameter of an
object might be seen with that instrument. He had, he says, in
April 1774, determined a similar question relating to the natural
eye; and found that a square area could not be distinguished from
an equal circular one till the diameter of the latter came to subtend
an angle of 2' 17"; but, as he did not think it right to apply the
same conclusions to a telescopic view of an object, he, in order to

                                                        167
determine the first-mentioned question, made a series of experiments,
of which the following is a summary account.
   Dr. Herschel's first experiment was made upon the heads of pins,
the size of the largest of which was 1375, and that of the smallest
'0425 of an inch. These pins were placed at the distance of 2407-85
inches from the centre of the object-mirror of the author's ten-feet
telescope; the focal length of the mirror of which, on Arcturus, is
119:64 inches, but on the objects above mentioned 125:9.
   Dr. Herschel soon found that none but the smallest of those objects
could, at the distance at which they were placed, be of any use; and
that an object of that size, namely, '0425 of an inch, may be easily
seen, in his telescope, to be a round body when the magnified angle
under which it appears is 2' 18".9, and that with a high power a
part of    it,
            subtending     angle    0"-364, may
                                       an          conveniently per

     Inthe second experiment, Dr. Herschel made use                globules                      of
sealing-wax. These globules were                              of                                                to of

                               the experiment was, that, with          globule                         a

                                                                   of
to 2370-5 inches. By this experiment        was found that the telescope

   The fourth experiment was made with globules             pitch, bees' wax,        of
and brimstone. From the two first-mentioned substances, no satis
factory inference could       drawn; but when four globules

  The fifth experiment consisted    observing the globules
                                                        in   sealing                                  of

substance were invisible       that distance; but all the silver globules
                                         at
except the smallest (which, having met with           accident, could not       an
be  examined,) appeared round.
   The sixth experiment was made by fixing some             the silver glo
                                                                    by                    a of

gular experiments upon them.

                                   168
    Dr. Herschel then, in order to investigate the causes of the spu
rious diameters of celestial objects, relates some observations made
upon several of the fixed stars, from which he deduces the following
inferences:
    1. That the spurious diameters of the stars are larger than the
real ones, which are too small to be seen.
    2. That the spurious diameters are of different sizes; but that,
under the same circumstances, their dimensions are of a permanent
nature.
     3. That the spurious diameters are differently coloured, and that
these colours are permanent when circumstances are the same.
    4. That these diameters are proportionally lessened by increasing
the magnifying power, and increase when the power is lowered.
     5. That the above-mentioned increase and decrease is not inversely
 as the increase and decrease of the magnifying power, but in a much
less ratio.
     6. That the magnifying power acts unequally on spurious diame
 ters of different magnitudes; less on the large diameters, and more
 on the small ones.
     7. That when the aperture of the telescope is lessened, it occa
 sions an increase of the spurious diameters; and when increased,
 reduces them.
     8. That this increase and decrease is not proportional to the dia
 meters of the stars, but that an alteration in the aperture of the te
 lescope acts more upon small spurious diameters and less upon large
 OneS.
     9. That stars which are extremely small lose their spurious dia
 meters, and become nebulous.
     10. That many causes will influence the apparent diameter of the
  spurious discs of the stars; but that, with a proper regard to those
  causes, the conclusion already drawn, that under the same circum
  stances their dimensions are permanent, still remains good.
     A number of experiments then succeed on the spurious diameters
  of terrestrial objects. The first series of these were made by means
  of the silver globules already mentioned. The inferences drawn from
  them are similar to those drawn from the observations of celestial
  objects, except that the spurious discs of terrestrial objects, contrary
  to what happens with celestial ones, are smaller than the real discs,
  and that they are apt to be lost for want of proper illumination, but
  do not on that account change their magnitude.
      Similar experiments were made with drops of quicksilver, the     re
  sults of which differed so little from those of the experiments with
  globules of silver, as not to require any further description of them.
      After two preparatory experiments, one with black and white
  circles, which showed that no material deception can take place in
  estimating by such circles, on account of their colour, and another,
  which showed that no difference in the apparent size of the globules
  was produced by a different mode of illuminating them in the micro
  scope, Dr. Herschel proceeded to measure the spurious disc of one

                                                 169
of the globules. For this purpose, he viewed it with apertures of
different dimensions and of different kinds. Some of them being of
the usual annular opening or outside rim, from 6-5 to 8:8 inches,
which reflected less than half the light of the mirror, produced a spu
rious disc less than 18 in diameter; while the whole light of the
mirror gave a disc of 31 : he thinks it fair to conclude, that it is not
the quantity of light, but the part of the mirror from which it is re
flected, that we are to look upon as the cause of the magnitude of
the spurious discs of objects; and this, he says, points out an im
proved method of putting any terrestrial disc, that we suspect to be
spurious, to the test: for the inside rays of a mirror will increase the
diameter of those discs; but the outside rays alone will have a greater
effect in reducing            it,
                       than when the inside rays are left      join with                        to
them.
   Dr. Herschel then   placed two other globules         small distance          at   a
from each   other,  without  having  previously  measured either their
size  orthe distance between them. Upon viewing them with power                                        a
of 522:7, they appeared     the shape in  half-moons;    of
                                                          estimated the               he
                                                 on be
vacancy between the cusps              one fourth the diameter
                                            to                      the                                    of
largest; and found afterwards,        measuring the diameters and                                               di
stance, that his estimation did not differ ºwth       an inch from the
                                                                   is            of
truth.       Insecond experiment the difference between the real and
                a
the estimated distance was still less.
     In
      order        to
              ascertain whether these half-moons were real      spu                                    or
rious, Dr. Herschel viewed them first with the inside rays        the                                      of
mirror, then with the outside rays, and lastly, with the whole mirror
open,     but      no
               alteration             in
                             the distance     the lunes could      per
                                                                   of                                  be
ceived.   He then divided the   aperture    the mirror into twoofparts,
one from       4-4 inches, the other from 4-4
               0   to                              8:8; and found, on       to
measuring the spurious diameter          globule, that with the inside
                                                   of     a
rays     was 40; with the whole mirror open
        it                                          was 31; and with        it
the outside rays     was 22.
                         it
   From this,     says, we may conclude, that the diameters given by
                        he
the inside rays, by all the mirror open, and     the outside rays, are     by
in an arithmetical progression; and that the inside rays will nearly
double the diameter given by the outside.
  a  Lyrae being then examined      the same manner,
                                                 in       spurious disc                   its
 was found         small with the outside rays; with the whole mirror
                   to   be
 open   itwas larger;  and with the inside rays       was largest.         it
    The double star Geminorum was then viewed with power
                                 a                                                                               of
 410:5; with the outside rays they appeared unequal, and           diameter                     14 a
 of the largest asunder; with the whole mirror open they were more
 unequal, and            1%
                    diameter      the largest asunder; with the inside
                                           of

   Dr. Herschel, having made these preliminary experiments,           pro
ceeds to apply them to investigate the nature and magnitude of the
star lately discovered by Mr. Harding.       A regular series of obser
vations on this star are detailed, beginning on the 29th of September,
and ending on the 11th of October.        Of these we must necessarily
confine ourselves to mention merely the general result with the con
clusions deduced by the author from the whole of the investigation.
These conclusions are as follows:
   1. A ten-feet reflector will show the spurious or real discs of ce
lestial and terrestrial objects, when their diameter is one fourth of a
second ; and in favourable circumstances that diameter may be di
vided, by estimation, into two or three parts.
   2. A disc of the above diameter, whether spurious or real, to be
seen as a round well-defined body, requires a magnifying power of
500 or 600, and must be sufficiently bright to bear that power.
   3. A real disc of half a second in diameter will be so magnified
by the above-mentioned power, that it may be easily distinguished
from a spurious one of equal size, the latter not being affected by
magnifying power in the same proportion as the former.
   4. The different properties of the inside and outside rays of a
mirror, with regard to the appearance of a disc, will show whether
it is real or spurious, provided its diameter is more than one-fourth
of a second.
   5. When discs, either spurious or real, are less than one fourth of
a second in diameter, they cannot be distinguished from each other,
because the magnifying power is not sufficient to make them appear
round and well defined.
   6. The same kind of experiments are applicable to telescopes of
different sorts and sizes, but will give a different result for the quan
tity here stated at one fourth of a second, being more when the        in
strument is less perfect, and less when it is more so.
   The general results of Dr. Herschel's observations on Mr. Harding's
newly discovered celestial body, to which the name of Juno has been
given, are,
  1. That it is in every respect similar to those discovered by
Mr. Piazzi and Dr. Olbers, so that Ceres, Pallas, and Juno, are cer
tainly three individuals of the same species.
   2. That these bodies (the last of which appears to be the smallest,)
are incomparably smaller than any of the planets; for a telescope that
will show a diameter of one fourth of a second, will not determine
whether their discs are real or spurious, although a power of more
than 600 has been applied to each of them.
   3. That the criterion of the apertures of the mirror has, on account
of the smallness of the object, been equally unsuccessful;   every   me
thod that has been tried only proving their resemblance to small stars.
   4. That the definition of the term asteroid, formerly given by
Dr. Herschel, will equally express the nature of Juno, which, on ac
count of  itssimilar situation between Mars and Jupiter, and     itsde
parture from the general condition  of planets, by the smallness     of   its

disc, and the great inclination and eccentricity of      orbit, may also                  its
be considered as    true asteroid.
                          a
   Dr. Herschel concludes by observing, that the specific difference
between planets and asteroids appears now, by the addition         third                                      of   a
individual        of
             the latter species,       more fully established; and that

and repulsions of floating bodies: these attractions are found to vary
ultimately in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances; and
they appear to be the same as are found to cause an apparent co
hesion between any moistened surfaces nearly in contact: the mag
nitude of this cohesion, as measured, in a particular case by Morveau,
being found to agree with the calculation of the effect of capillary
action.
   The attraction of a drop of a fluid towards the line of contact of
two plates of glass, which was found by Hawkesbee to vary nearly
in the inverse ratio of the square of the distance of the plates, was
supposed by Newton to indicate an immediate cohesive force, varying
in the simple inverse ratio. But Dr. Young has shown that the fun
damental law of the equable tension of the surface is sufficient to
explain this phenomenon, and to remove the apparent irregularity
in the laws of cohesive forces.
   The equable tension of the surface is shown to be a consequence
which may be mathematically deduced from the existence of a stable
equilibrium between the forces of repulsion and of cohesion, which is
a necessary condition of liquidity, as the repulsive force always varies
more rapidly than the cohesive force.        The mutual attractions of
solids and fluids are then considered; and Dr. Young agrees with
Clairaut, although upon different grounds, in affirming that a fluid
will be elevated when in contact with any solid of more than half its
attractive density.   The tension of the common surfaces of a solid
and a fluid, or of two continuous fluids, is supposed to be proportional
to the difference of the attractive densities; and this supposition is
confirmed by some observations, with which the paper is concluded,
on the phenomena of oily substances floating on water.
Concerning the State in which the true Sap   of Trees is   deposited   during
  Winter. In a Letter from Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq. to the
  Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B. P.R.S. Read January
  24, 1805.  [Phil. Trans. 1805, p. 88.]
   This paper may be considered as a continuation of Mr. Knight's
former   communications     respecting the motion of the sap in trees.
Du   Hamel,  and other   subsequent   naturalists, have shown that trees
contain two kinds of     sap ; and the chief purpose of Mr. Knight's
paper is to prove that one of them (called by Du Hamel suc propre,
and by Mr. Knight the true sap,) is generated in the leaf; and that
this fluid, in an inspissated state, or some concrete substance depo
sited by  it, exists during the winter  in     the alburnum, from which
substance,  dissolved in  the ascending aqueous sap,     derived the
                                                            is
matter which enters into the composition       of
                                               the new leaves     the  in
spring. To the above-mentioned deposition, Mr. Knight attributes
the well-known superiority   of winter-felled wood, which superiority
has generally  been  supposed owing  merely    to
                                               the absence    the sap
                                                                 of

  Du Hamel has remarked, that trees perspire more when the leaves

                                      173
are    full grown,  and when the annual shoots have ceased to elongate,
than at     any  earlier period. This energy in the powers of vegetation
must     certainly,  Mr. Knight thinks, be employed in some very im
portant operation. He has observed that the produce of his meadows
has been greatly increased when the herbage of the preceding year
had been left till the end of autumn, on ground that had been mowed
early in the summer; from which he has been led to imagine, that
leaves are employed during the latter part of the summer in the pre
paration of matter calculated to afford food to the buds and blossoms
of the succeeding spring.
     In order to determine whether the foregoing opinions were well
founded or not, Mr. Knight made the following experiments.
     Having made incisions in the trunks of sycamore and birch-trees
 (some of these incisions being close to the ground, others at the ele
 vation of seven feet), he found that the sap obtained from the syca
 more close to the ground, was of the specific gravity of 1:004, while
 that obtained at the height of seven feet had a specific gravity of 1:008.
 The sap of the birch was somewhat lighter; but the increase of spe
 cific gravity, at different elevations, was comparatively the same. The
 sap of both these trees, when extracted near the ground, was almost
 void of taste; but when obtained at a greater height, it was sensibly
 sweet.      In one instance it was extracted from the sycamore-tree at
 the    height  of twelve feet; it was then   very sweet, and its specific
                                           -
 gravity was 1:012.
      Mr. Knight then made an experiment to compare the sap obtained
 from a recent incision with that obtained from an old one. He found
 that the sap from an old incision was reduced in specific gravity to
  1-002, while that from the recent incision continued at l004, as
 before.      These incisions were made in a sycamore-tree, and were
 close to the ground.
      Some observations then follow on the variation in the specific gra
 vity of the alburnum at different seasons. After taking every pre
  caution to avoid error, the author found the specific gravity of winter
  felled oak to be 0.679, and that of summer-felled oak to be 0:609,
  after they had both been immersed five minutes in water.        This dif
  ference appearing to Mr. Knight very considerable, he repeated the
  experiment several times, but found no reason to suspect any error
  in it; and upon measuring pieces of both kinds of wood, which were
  equal in weight, it appeared that the winter-felled pieces were much
  less than the others.      The more recently formed layers of winter
  felled wood had a specific gravity of 0:583; that of the summer-felled
  wood was only 0.533. In another experiment the former was 0.588,
  the latter 0'534.
       On pouring boiling water on equal quantities of summer- and of
  winter-felled wood, it appeared that the latter communicated a much
   deeper colour to the water than the former; it also raised the spe
   cific gravity of the water to 1-002; the specific gravity of the other
  infusion was 1-001.
       Mr. Knight thought     he had reason to believe that the matter  de

veral successive years; he therefore cut off, in the winter,              the                                       all

following, when numerous buds and leaves,             large size, appeared;     of
and   in autumn every part was covered with very vigorous shoots.
The number        leaves appeared
                      of                  Mr. Knight   to exceed very much           to

the slightest degree of sweetness in decoctions of the wood in winter.
He therefore is inclined to believe, that the saccharine matter is ge
nerated by a process similar to that of the germination of seeds; and
that the said process is always going on during the spring and sum
mer; but that towards the conclusion of the summer, the true sap
simply accumulates in the alburnum, and thus adds to the specific
gravity of winter-felled wood, and increases the quantity of its ex
tractive matter. He says also, that he has some reasons for thinking
that the true sap descends through the alburnum, as well as through
the bark; and that he has been informed, that if the bark be taken
from the trunks of trees in the spring, and such trees be suffered to
grow till the following winter, the alburnum acquires a great degree
of hardness and durability.
    Mr. Knight concludes by observing, that he conceives himself to
be in possession of facts, which prove that both buds and roots ori
 ginate from the alburnous substance of plants, and not, as he believes
 is generally supposed, from the bark.
On the Action  of Platina and Mercury upon each other. By Richard

   [Phil. Trans. 1805, p. 104.]
   Mr. Chenevix, in the month of May 1803, presented to the Royal
Society a paper, which was printed in the Philosophical Transactions
for that year, respecting the nature of a metallic substance which
had been offered to the public as a new simple metal, under the name
of Palladium. In that paper he not only attempted to prove that the
said substance, instead of being a simple metal, was merely a com
pound of platina and mercury, but he also described certain processes
by which he had been enabled to produce              He now expresses his

 is not well founded; and        the latter part
                                      in               of to
                                                    his paper,      says, thathe

                                       176
in order to ascertain the matter, he observed the methods recom
mended by those chemists for obtaining pure platina, but did not
perceive any difference in the facility with which either kind of pla
tina combined with mercury.
   Mr. Chenevix then adverts to the experiments of Messrs. Rose and
Gehlen, who attempted to repeat some of the processes described by
him for the formation of palladium.      The experiments of those gen
tlemen were unsuccessful; but this, Mr. Chenevix considers as not
militating against his experiments, as he shows that the processes
made use of by them, though meant to be an exact imitation of his,
were, in fact, materially different.   The same gentlemen, Mr. Che
nevix says, seem to question his having fused platina, as they could
not succeed, although they exposed it to a heat, the degree of which
Wedgwood's pyrometer ceased to mark.          Upon this Mr. Chenevix
remarks, that they do not mention their having made use of any flux;
whereas he employed borax for that purpose.       He then describes, at
full length, the method used    by him,  which consists in filling a Hes
sian crucible with lamp-black    pressed hard together, and placing the
platina, surrounded by borax, in the centre of the lamp-black, at the
bottom of which there is previously formed a cavity to receive the
platina when fused.
   Mr. Richter also attempted to make palladium by the process
which Mr. Chenevix describes as the best for that purpose, but failed.
He was, however, convinced by his trials, that mercury is capable
of entering into combination with platina, so that it cannot afterwards
be separated by fire.
   It appears also that Mr. Tromsdorff, and likewise Mr. Klaproth,
have made some fruitless attempts to obtain palladium. As these
gentlemen, as well as Messrs. Rose and Gehlen, and Mr. Richter,
seem disappointed at their want of success, Mr. Chenevix takes oc
casion to observe, that they appear to have placed a reliance upon
his processes, which his words did not authorize; and says that his
paper, as far as regards palladium, is rather a narrative of fruitless
attempts, than a description of an infallible process, and more likely
to create aversion to the pursuit, than to inspire a confidence of suc
cess.
   The compound nature of palladium, Mr. Chenevix thinks, has re
ceived some support from the galvanic experiments of Mr. Ritter,
who found   itsgalvanic properties different from what they ought    to
be, upon the supposition    of   its
                                 being simple metal.
                                             a
   As further excuse for the failure that has attended the repetition
     a
of  his processes, Mr. Chenevix mentions that Prof. Lampadius,       a
few years ago, in distilling some substances that contained sulphur
and charcoal, obtained  a  peculiar liquid, whichto hecalled sulphur-al
cohol; and that, after many fruitless attempts       procure the liquid
a second time, he abandoned his researches.       Messrs. Clement and
Desormes, however, some time after obtained this liquid, but were
equally unsuccessful in  their numerous attempts   to produceit  again.
In February last, Professor Lampadius accidentally discovered, and

                                         177
has published, a method          of obtaining the above-mentioned                   liquid,
which never fails.
    By  taking the reasoning on this subject in its widest extent,
Mr. Chenevix thinks we shall be led to conclude, that metals may
exercise an action upon each other, even in their metallic state, ca
pable of so altering some of their principal properties, as to render
the presence of one or more of them not to be detected by the usual
methods. In this is contained the possibility of a compound metal
appearing to be simple.        But to prove this proposition must be a
work of    great time and    perseverance,   and can only be done by con
sidering, singly and successively, the different cases which it con
tains, and by instituting experiments upon each.
   As an example of the foregoing position, and to prove that mercury
and platina act upon each other so as to disguise the properties of
both, Mr. Chenevix states, that when a solution of green sulphate of
iron is poured into a solution of platina, no precipitate, nor any other
sensible change, ensues; but if a solution of silver, or of mercury, be
added, a copious precipitate, in part metallic, takes place.           He has
tried to produce the same effect with other metals and platina, but
has not observed anything similar.          From this he thinks it fair to
conclude, that whenever a solution of platina is precipitated, in a
metallic state, by a solution of green sulphate of iron, either silver or
mercury is present.       He adds, that the precipitation of a mixed so
lution of platina and silver, requires no further caution than to free
the salt of platina, as much as possible, from muriatic acid.
   Mr. Chenevix then makes some observations, which cannot well
be abridged, on the precipitation of platina by mercury; but which
show that the state of oxidizement of the latter metal, as well as
the acid in which it is dissolved, produce a considerable modification
in the result. It then occurred to him, that a method of uniting
platina and mercury, without the intervention of any other metal,
or of any substance except the solvents of these metals, might be ac
complished, as in the case of silver and platina: and he describes
an experiment, which shows that when the mercury is at              minimumits
                      nitric acid, the addition      green sulphate                 of
is of
    oxidizement   in                                     of               iron
   superfluous.    But,     onthe contrary,      mercury
                                                    if               be
                                                                raised      its      to
           of                     nitric acid, no precipitation occurs till
                                 is in
marimum        oxidizement
the green sulphate     of iron    added.
   Mr. Chenevix also makes variety  a           observations respecting the
                                                    of
complicated affinities which take place when the muriates                  the      of
above metals are employed.         These we shall pass over, and proceed
 to notice those experiments which form the principal object              this      of
paper. From the first experiment
                                                                                          of of

                                                                   if      a
highly oxidized nitrate     of mercury poured into mixed solution
                                          is                   a
platina and green sulphate          iron,
                                   of       muriate

and also  a   metallic precipitate; the former         retained
                                                          is         solution;
                                                                           in
the latter weighs more than the original quantity               platina, even
                                                                   in of
after nitric acid has been boiled repeatedly, and              large quanti
ties, upon  it.  By exposure       heat,

                                             acknowledges that little more,

                                  178
in general, is left, than the original weight of the platina; and ad
mits that even a diminution of weight may be sometimes observed.
Before the precipitate has been exposed to heat, it may be dissolved
in nitro-muriatic acid more easily than platina itself.
   The second experiment is to show that when a mixed solution of
platina and mercury is precipitated by metallic iron, a precipitate
nearly equal to the sum of the two former metals is generally ob
tained, the properties of which appear to be similar to those of the
precipitate obtained in the first experiment.
   We learn, from the third experiment, that when an amalgam of
platina, formed by means of the ammoniacal muriate of that metal,
according to the method of Count Mussin Pushkin, is exposed to
heat, a metallic powder remains, which is soluble in nitro-muriatic
acid, and affords a copious precipitate by means of green sulphate of
IrOn.
   The fourth experiment states, that if sulphur is added to the     in
gredients used in the formation of the above-mentioned amalgam,
and the whole treated as before, the precipitate caused by green sul
phate of iron is more considerable.
   The fifth experiment informs us, that if sulphur is rubbed with
ammoniacal muriate of platina, the mixture may be melted on a sand
bath.     If mercury is then added to the melted mass, and the whole
exposed to a strong fire, a button remains, which, being dissolved in
nitro-muriatic acid, gives a precipitate, as before, with the green
sulphate of iron.
   In the sixth experiment we are told, that if sulphuretted hydrogen
is passed   through a mixed solution of platina and mercury, and the
precipitate afterwards melted with borax, the button will not contain
any sulphur. Green sulphate of iron causes a precipitate in the so
lution of this button.
   The seventh experiment serves to show that phosphate of am
monia, when added to a solution of platina and mercury, causes a
precipitate, the solution of which is acted upon by green sulphate of
Iron.
   By the eighth experiment it appears, that if the precipitate formed
by adding nitrate of mercury, at the minimum of oxidizement, to
muriate of platina be washed, reduced, and afterwards dissolved in
nitro-muriatic acid, another precipitate may be produced by means
of green sulphate of iron.
   The ninth experiment relates to the action of recent muriate of
tin, which Mr. Chenevix says is one of the most delicate tests in
chemistry, detecting the presence of mercury. If a single drop of
neutralized nitrate or muriate of mercury is put into 500 grains of
water, the addition of muriate of tin causes the liquor to become
turbid, and to assume a smoke-gray colour. And even if the above
liquor is diluted with ten times its weight of water, the effect is still
sensible.     But if recent muriate of tin is poured into a solution, not
too much     concentrated,  of platina and mercury, it can hardly be di
stinguished from a simple solution of platina.   If,  however, too much

                                   179
mercury be present, the excess is acted upon as in the case of mer
cury, the liquor assuming a darker colour than with platina alone.
  From the above experiments, Mr. Chenevix infers that mercury
can act upon platina, and confer upon it the property of being pre
cipitated, in a metallic state, by green sulphate of iron. The first
and second experiments prove, he says, that platina can protect mer
cury from the action of nitric acid; and also that mercury increases
the action of nitro-muriatic acid upon platina. The third, fourth,
fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth experiments show that mercury can
combine with platina, in such a manner as not to be separated from
 it by the degree of heat necessary to fuse the compound. The eighth
 experiment proves that the action of mercury upon platina is not
 confined to the metallic state, but that these metals can combine and
 form an insoluble triple salt, with an acid that produces a very so
 luble compound with platina alone. The ninth experiment shows
that platina can retain in solution a certain quantity of mercury, and
prevent its detection by a substance which acts powerfully when pla
 tina is not present.
    Mr. Chenevix admits that one or two of the above-mentioned ex
periments appear to contradict some of those he described in his
former paper on Palladium; for in the present experiments, platina
protects mercury against the action of nitric acid, whereas in pal
ladium the mercury is not only acted upon itself, but contributes to
the solution of platina in the same acid. The discussion of these
objections, Mr. Chenevix says, he shall defer to another opportunity.
He also acknowledges that there is some incorrectness in his former
paper, with respect to the proportional quantities of the ingredients
that enter into the composition of the metallic precipitate formed by
means of green sulphate of iron; and after making various remarks
on that head, states the mean result to be about 17 parts of mercury,
and 83 of platina, when the specific gravity of the compound was
about 16.
    Mr. Chenevix concludes by observing, that he has as yet seen
no arguments of sufficient weight to convince him, in opposition to
experiment, that palladium is a simple substance.        Nothing is more
probable, he says, than that nature may form the alloy called palla
dium, and even form it better than we can do; and he thinks that
the amalgamation to which platina is submitted before it reaches
Europe, is sufficient to account for       its
                                           containing     small portion

palladium.     With respect  to  the failure that has happened      inthe
                        make palladium,          he
                                                       it he
attempts  of  others to                       says        himself too well
                                                           is
accustomed    to  such failure not to believe that     will happen, even
in  well conducted trials; but    he considers four successful experi
ments, which were not performed         secret,
                                       in             as                  to

that  objection.
    The experiments above related tend,        his opinion,

former results; but he allows that

beginning        October
                    in       1795,   and    ending        October 1801. These
 observations are detailed         full length  at    two tables; and        appears
                                                                             of in
                                                                                                                 it
 from  them,  that the   periodical    returns       brightness    are uncommonly
 fluctuating, and that the differences between the extremes are very
considerable.      Mr. Pigott then, by way                explanation, offers the    of
following opinions and inferences.
    1st. That the bodies of the stars are dark and solid.
    2ndly. That their real rotation             their axes       regular, following
                                                                    on                           is
uniform impulses.
   3rdly. That the surrounding medium does,                                                  at   times, generate and

             its   luminous particles,                              manner nearly similar
                                                                                                                 to to
absorb                                                   in                                                            that
which Dr. Herschel has supposed                               to a  take place with regard                               the
sun's atmosphere.
     4thly. That          as
                  the variable star    Sobieski's Shield occasionally
                                                              in                                  is
diminished     appearance
                   in         the 6th    7th magnitude,
                                                  to        even   or                                  or                to
                                                                                                                         a
smaller magnitude,      appears that these luminous particles are but
sparingly dispersed                  in it
                       its atmosphere.
  5thly. He asks, may we not with much plausibility represent such
luminous particles    spots, somewhat circular, and
                                  as                        great ex                             of    no
tent.
   6thly. That the principal bright parts are but slight patches, may,
he says,     presumed, from the perpetual changes they undergo, and
              be
also from such changes being very visible            us.                     to
   7thly. He thinks we may obtain some idea              the relative situation   of
or intervals between these bright parts, by the observations                 the                                  of
increase and decrease        brightness,of                      as
                                              thereby the changes and times
elapsed are pointed out.
   Mr. Pigott says         has tried, practically, the effect
                                     he                              the above                     of
suppositions, by placing small white spots on             dark sphere, which      a
sphere being turned round, represented the various changes               nearly                              as
 as could     expected. Of these changes several views are given, ac
              be
companied with some observations on variable stars                 general;                       in                     in
the course      which the author supposes
                   of                              probable that many stars
                                                                        it
have lost their light, and that there are many others which have never
shown    aglimpse       brightness.
                                of     He even asks, whether we may not
suppose the number            these  unenlightened
                                          of          stars equal       that                                to            of
those endowed with light?            so,     thinks that by being collected
                                                    If         he
together      clusters,
              in                 the Milky Way, they must intercept all
                                        as     in
more distant rays; and         free from any intervening lights, must ap
                                             if
pear    as
         dark spaces      the heavens, similar
                                  in                 what has been observed  to
in the southern   hemisphere.

strong reasons      believe that the sun's luminous appearance has been

description cannot well      abridged, and    be too long        repeated.  is                      to   be
We shall therefore only say that Mr. Mushet states,                 general                           as   a
remark, that the grain and density       these cakes      wootz were uni
                                                                  of                        of
formly homogeneous, and free from metallic iron towards the under
or round surface, but that they were always the reverse towards the
upper side, called by Mr. Mushet the feeder.
   The appearances observed upon forging these cakes are then par

                                                       184
ticularly described, from which Mr. Mushet deduces the following
general remarks.
   The formation of wootz, he says, appears to him to be in conse
quence of the fusion of a particular ore, which he supposes to be cal
careous, or to be rendered so by a mixture of calcareous earth, along
with a portion of carbonaceous matter. The fusion, he thinks, is
performed in a clay vessel or crucible, in which vessel the separated
metal is allowed to cool. Hence, in his opinion, arises the crystalli
zation that occupies the pits and cells observed in and upon the under
or round surface of the cakes.
    The want of homogeneity and solidity in these cakes, appears to
Mr. Mushet   to be owing to the want of a sufficient degree of heat
to effect a perfect reduction; and this opinion, he thinks, is strength
ened by observing, that those cakes which are the hardest, or which
contain the largest portion of carbonaceous matter, and, of course,
form the most fusible steel, are always the most solid and homoge
neous; while, on the contrary, those cakes which are the most easily
cut by the chisel, are in general cellular, and abound with veins of
malleable iron.     If the natives of the country which produces the
wootz were capable of rendering it perfectly fluid, Mr. Mushet thinks
they would certainly have run it into moulds, by which, he says,
they would have acquired a kind of steel more uniform in its qua
lity, and more         fit
                     for the purpose   being worked and applied
                                                        of           the                                    to
arts.
   Some   of the cakes here described had, around the feeder, and
upon the upper surface      general, evident marks
                                         in                the hammer.                     of
This appearance Mr. Mushet accounts for by supposing, that when
the cake was taken from the pot        crucible, the feeder was most
                                                         or

-   From the time     leaving the Land's End,
                                  of              April 19th, 1802, the         on
 mercury was fluctuating and irregular, till April 29th, lat. 26° N.,
 long. 20° W., when      constantly performed two elevations and two
                                       it
 depressions every twenty-four hours.     These Mr. Horsburgh calls
 equatropical motions.    From lat. 26°      10° the difference       to
                                                                    the                                       in
 high and low stations    the mercury was not
                                        of         great      was from           so               as   it

the latter latitude across the equator, and from thence to lat. 25° S.
Within the last-mentioned limits, the difference was very consider
able, being generally from five to nine hundredths of an inch, both
in the day and the night.                       -
   When the ship arrived in lat. 28° S., long. 27° W. (June 7th), the
mercury no longer performed the equatropical motions, but was irre
gular and fluctuating until July 11th, when the ship was in latitude
27° S., long. 51° E. The equatropical motions then took place again,
and continued with great regularity while the ship sailed up the
Madagascar Archipelago, and across the equator, until the arrival of
the ship at Bombay, on the 31st of July.
   On the 6th of August the barometers were placed on shore, and,
from that day to the 12th, the mercury appeared to have a small
tendency towards the equatropical motions; from the latter day to
the 22nd of the same month, that tendency was so much diminished
as to be generally imperceptible.
   On the 23rd of August the barometers were again put on board
the ship, which left the harbour of Bombay on the 26th. The mer
cury then immediately began again to perform the equatropical mo
tions, and continued them, with great uniformity, down the Malabar
coast, across the bay of Bengal, in the strait of Malacca, and through
the China Sea, until the ship arrived in Canton river, on the 4th of
October. The mercury then became nearly stationary, or, if it
showed at times a small inclination towards the equatropical mo
tions, such inclination was not by any means so perceptible as at
Sea.
    The ship remained at Canton till the 2nd of December, and, al
 though there appeared at times a slight tendency in the mercury to
 perform the equatropical motions, the rise and fall was in general so
 small as to be frequently imperceptible; but, on the departure of the
 ship from Canton river, the motions instantly took place, and con
tinued until the ship arrived in Bombay harbour, on the 11th of                       Ja
nuary 1803.
   From that day to the 23rd of May, the ship remained at Bombay;
and during the whole of that time, no tendency towards the equa
tropical motions worth noticing could be perceived.          On the above
mentioned day, the instant the ship left the harbour, the motions of
the mercury again took place, and continued, but not always with
equal regularity, until the 2nd of July, when the ship again entered
Canton river.
   During the time the ship continued at Canton, no appearance of
the motions here treated       of,
                                 worth remarking, could          perceived;
                                                                       be

passed the narrow part    of  the strait.    On the 21st       October the
ship arrived in  the harbour    of Prince     Wales's Island, and
                                                of                     great      a
diminution   again  took  place      in
                                    the   equatropical  motions;  but upon

                                  187
leaving the harbour, on the 5th of November, they again returned,
and continued, with their usual regularity, until the arrival of the
ship at the entrance of Hoogly river, on the 3rd of December. While
the ship continued in the lower part of that river, a slight tendency
to the equatropical motions might be perceived; but up the river,
at Diamond harbour, the mercury was nearly stationary the whole
twenty-four hours.
   On the 13th of January 1804, after clearing Hoogly river, the
equatropical motions again returned, and continued until the arrival
of the ship at Bombay, on the 12th of February; from which day to
the 18th, when the journal ceases, no signs of the above motions
could be perceived.
Concerning the Differences in the magnetic Needle, on Board the Inves
   tigator, arising from an Alteration in the Direction of the Ship's
   Head.    By Matthew Flinders, Esq. Commander of His Majesty's
   Ship Investigator. In a Letter to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks,
   K.B. P.R.S. Read March 28, 1805. [Phil. Trans. 1805, p. 186.]
   In  the years 1801 and 1802, while Capt. Flinders, on board the
Investigator, was surveying the south coast of New Holland, he ob
served a difference in the direction of the magnetic needle, for which
there appeared no other cause than that of the ship's head being in
a different direction. The compasses made use of on board the above
mentioned ship were of Walker's construction, one excepted, which
was made by Adams; and it appears, from a table of observations
given by Capt. Flinders, that some of the variations here treated of
were 4° less, and others 4° greater than the truth. It also appears,
that when this error was to the west, the ship's head was to the
east, or nearly so; when the error was eastward, the ship's head was
in a contrary direction; and when the observations agree best with
those taken on shore, which may be considered as having the true
variation, the ship's head was nearly north or south.     A minute in
spection of the table seems to favour the opinion, that the excess or
diminution of the variation was generally in proportion to the incli
nation of the ship's head, from the magnetic meridian, on either side.
   Capt. Flinders, having ascertained the certainty of a difference in
the compass, arising from an alteration in the point steered, thought
it necessary, when he wanted a set of bearings from a point where
the ship tacked, to take one set just before and another immediately
after that operation. Several specimens of the manner in which these
bearings were taken are given; also a specimen of the plan he fol
lowed in protracting such bearings: these specimens are in the form
of tables, and are not of a nature to be abridged.
   With respect to the cause of the differences here treated of, Capt.
Flinders offers the following conjectures:
   1st, That the attractive power of the different substances in a ship,
which are capable of affecting the compass, is brought into a sort of
focal point nearly in the centre of the ship, where the shot are de

                                                             188
posited; the greatest quantity of iron being collected together at
that part.
   2ndly, That this point is endued with the same kind of attraction
as the pole of the hemisphere where the ship is: consequently, in
New Holland, the south end of the needle would be attracted by                                                                   it,
and the north end repelled.
   3rdly, That the attractive power           this point,       ship  of war,                   in   a          of               is
sufficiently strong                    to
                         interfere with the action        the magnetic poles,             of
upon    compass placed upon
                                                        or
          a                               the binacle.  in
   The above suppositions, Capt. Flinders thinks, will account for all
the observed differences: and, admitting this opinion                      well                                to    be
founded,      ought,
                  it       says,      follow, that when the ship
                                       he               to                  the                                     is   on
north side               of
                 the magnetic equator, the differences            the variation                          in
of the magnetic needle, arising from             change       the ship's head,

tions are given, which tend           confirm this opinion, and which also

                                                                       of
we shall pass over, that we may        the more particular   beour account                                in
of the varieties observed in the last-mentioned bone in other animals.
     The configuration                      of   the stapes,          or   indeed        of    the other ossicles,               is

                                   189
not governed, Mr. Carlisle says, by the form, habits, or voice of the
animal, except in those mammalia which inhabit the waters, such as
the seal, the walrus, and the whale tribe: in these the stapes is more
massive; but in the otter, which only dives occasionally, the stapes
does not differ from that of the fox. In the tiger, the dog, and other
ferae, the crura are straight, and meet in an acute angle; but the
same figure occurs in the horse, in the beaver, in the goat, and in
many other herbivorous quadrupeds.         In the cete, the muscle of the
stapes pulls the capitulum at such an angle, as very much to depress
its subjacent end into the fenestra vestibuli; and the joint appears
capable of considerable motion. In the walrus, this ossicle is entirely
solid: in the seal, and in the cete, the bone has only a small per
foration instead of the crural arch.
     Mr. Carlisle has discovered a very remarkable singularity in the
stapes of the marmot, and in that of the guinea-pig.          In those ani
 mals, the bone is formed of slender crura, constituting a rounded
 arch : through this arch an osseous bolt passes, so as to rivet it to
 its situation. This bolt, to which Mr. Carlisle has given the name
 of Pessulus, is placed near the top of the arch, so that, by the action
 of the stapedeus muscle, the upper part of the straight crus is brought
 into contact with the pessulus. The use of this mechanism is not
 obvious, there being nothing in these animals, excepting their shrill
 whistle, peculiarly different from others which are destitute of such
 mechanism. In the kanguroo, the stapes is like the corresponding
 ossicle in birds, called Columella. In the two species of Ornitho
 rhynchus (paradoxus and hystrix), this resemblance to the columella
 is still more striking, and forms an additional point of similarity be
 tween these singular quadrupeds and birds.         These columellae are
  articulated to a small bone, which performs the office of the manu
 brium of the malleus; whereas, in birds, the capitulum of the colu
  mella is slightly expanded, and is joined to a triangular plate of car.
  tilage attached to the membrana tympani. In some birds, a small
  foramen occurs in the middle of this plate.
      The amphibia are provided with columellae similar to those of birds;
  but the cartilage is united to the under surface of the true skin, with
  out any apparent application of muscles to alter its tension.
      From the preceding circumstances, Mr. Carlisle is led, he says, to
  the following conclusions:In man, and in most of the mammalia,
  the figure of the stapes is an accommodation to that degree of light
  ness which seems a requisite condition; and that bone is especially
  designed to press on the fluid contained in the labyrinth; the ulti
  mate effect of which pressure    is,   anincrease of  the tension of  the
  membrane closing the fenestra cochleae.
      There does not,  in   Mr. Carlisle's opinion, appear   to   exist any
  motion between the ossicula auditàs that bears       any   relation
                                                                    to  the
  peculiar vibration of sounds. He rather conceives, that the different
  motions  of   these bones only affect the membrana tympani,      so   as   to
  lessen the intensity of  violent impulses. Sounds   of  less impetus, not

                                       190
requiring such modulation, are transmitted by the vibrations of the
integrant parts of these bones, unaccompanied by muscular action.
    This reasoning, Mr. Carlisle says, is suggested by the columellae
in the aves and amphibia; for, since many birds accurately imitate
a variety of sounds, it may be inferred that they hear as acutely and
as distinctly as mankind.
    The muscles of the ossicula auditàs appear to be of the involun
tary kind; their peculiar stimulus is sound, and the chorda tympani
is a gangliated nerve. If the above supposition is true, the muscles
may be considered as all acting together; especially as it is well
known that some persons who hear imperfectly are more sensible to
sounds when in a noisy place; as if the muscles were then excited
to action.
    It cannot, Mr. Carlisle thinks, be allowed, that the pressure of the
watery fluid in the labyrinth is necessary to produce the sensation of
hearing, since birds hear without any such mechanism: such pres
sure, however, would give increased tension to the fenestra cochleae;
and, as the membrane of that fenestra is exposed to the air con
tained within the cavity of the tympanum, it appears adapted to re
ceive such sounds as pass through the membrana tympani, without
exciting consonant motions in the ossicula auditàs.
    In order to investigate the truth of the above opinions, Mr. Car
lisle had water, at the temperature of his body, dropped from a small
vial into the meatus externus, the tragus being previously pulled to
wards the cheek. The first drop produced a sensation like the report
of distant cannon; and the same effect succeeded each drop until
the cavity was filled.
    In this experiment the vibrations of the membrana tympani must,
he says, have been impaired, if not destroyed; yet the motions of the
membrane produced by each drop of water affected the air contained
in the tympanum, sufficiently to produce a sensible impression.
    That something like this occurs in many kinds of sounds,        is,
                                                                    Mr.
Carlisle thinks, more than probable; and            as
                                                 the cochlea consists     of
two hollow half cones, winding spirally, and uniting       their apices,
                                                              at
it follows that the sounds affecting either   the cones must pass from
                                               of
the wide      the narrow end; and the tension
                to                                  the parts,
                                                         of       either
                                                                   in
case,   will necessarily aid the impression.

                  Tannin.  By Charles Hatchett, Esq. F.R.S.      Read
  April 25, 1805. [Phil. Trans. 1805,          p.

     Mr. Hatchett, after mentioning the experiments made by several
eminent     chemists     the substance generally called Tannin (but
                          on

which     thinks would         of be
                              better expressed
serves, that the results     those experiments have established, that
tan   isapeculiar substance, naturally formed, and existing     many
                                                                   in
vegetable bodies, such         as
                             oak  bark, &c.; but that         no
                                                        one has ever

                                    191
supposed   it could be produced by art, unless a fact observed by Mr.
Chenevix, namely, that a decoction of coffee-berries did not precipi
tate gelatine until they had been roasted, may be considered as an
exception. Some recent experiments, however, have, he says, con
vinced him, that tan may be formed, not only from vegetables, but
even from mineral and animal substances.
   The powerful effects observed by Mr. Hatchett to be produced on
resinous substances by nitric acid, and the discovery made by him of
a natural substance, composed partly of resin and partly of asphal
tum, induced him to extend his experiments to the bitumens. He
had found, that almost every species of resin is completely dissolved
in nitric acid, and so totally changed that water does not cause any
separation; and that, by evaporation, a deep yellow viscid substance
is obtained, equally soluble in water or in alcohol: whereas, the first
effect of the above acid on some of the bitumens, for instance, asphal
tum and jet, was to form a dark brown solution, whilst an orange
coloured mass was separated, which, by subsequent digestion in an
other portion of nitric acid, was completely dissolved, and, by eva
poration, afforded a yellow viscid substance, nearly similar to that
obtained from the resins.      But coals, which contained little or no
bitumen, did not yield the yellow substance above mentioned.
    Mr. Hatchett then made a similar experiment upon charcoal, and
found it was more readily dissolved than the preceding substances;
no residuum was left; and the solution was of a reddish brown
colour.
    All the above solutions, when carefully evaporated to dryness, left
a brown glossy residuum, which exhibited a resinous fracture; that
left by the solution of charcoal having the most beautiful appearance.
    The chemical properties of these residua were as follows:
    1. They were speedily dissolved by cold water and by alcohol.
    2. Their flavour was highly astringent.
    3. When exposed to heat, they smoked but little, swelled much,
 and afforded a very bulky coal.
    4. Their solutions in water reddened litmus-paper.
    5. These solutions copiously precipitated the metallic salts, espe
 cially muriate of tin, acetite of lead, and oxysulphate of iron.
    6. They precipitated gold from its solution in the metallic state.
    7. They also precipitated the earthy salts, such as the nitrates of
 lime, of barytes, &c.
    8. The fixed alkalies, as well as ammonia, deepen the colour of
 these solutions, and, after some hours, render them turbid.
    9. Glue or isinglass was immediately precipitated from water by
 these solutions. These precipitates were, in every respect, similar
 to those formed by the solutions of tan hitherto known, excepting
 that this factitious tan appeared to be exempt from the extract,
 gallic acid, and mucilage, which commonly accompany natural tan.
    Mr. Hatchett, having thus discovered that tan might be so readily
 formed from vegetable and mineral coals, was led to examine whether
 it could not also be formed from animal coal. For this purpose, he

 as well    from vegetable and mineral coal; and
                  as                                     also appears, from                     it

                                   193
but dark brown.      If four or five hours elapse before the solution is
poured into the water, the resin precipitated is found to be com
pletely black. And if the digestion is continued for several days, or
until there is no longer any production of sulphureous gas, the tur
pentine is converted into a black porous coal, which does not contain
any resin, although a substance hereafter noticed may frequently be
separated from it by digestion in alcohol.
   When common resin was treated in the same manner, about 43
per cent. of the coal was obtained, which, after exposure to a red
heat in a loosely-covered platina crucible, still amounted to more
than 30 per cent., and appeared to possess properties very similar to
those of some of the mineral coals.
   Mr. Hatchett having obtained, in the manner above described,
yellow resin, brown resin, black resin, and coal, from a quantity of
common turpentine, dissolved a portion of each of these, and also of
the turpentine, in nitric acid, and then reduced the solutions to dry
ness. The residua, which varied in colour, from yellow to dark
brown, were dissolved in distilled water, and examined by solution
of isinglass and other re-agents.
   1. The solution of the residuum of turpentine was of a pale straw
colour, and did not contain any tan.
   2. That of the yellow resin resembled the former in every respect.
   3. That of the brown resin was of a deeper yellow, but did not
afford a vestige of tan.
   4. That of the black resin, on the contrary, afforded a consider
able portion of tan.
   5. That of the coal afforded tan in great abundance.
   Hence it appears, that these modifications of turpentine yield tan
only in proportion to the quantity of their original carbon, progres
sively converted into coal.
   Other substances, particularly various kinds of wood, copal, am
ber, and wax, when reduced into coal in the humid way, were in
like manner converted into tan by nitric acid.
   But tan may, Mr. Hatchett says, be artificially produced, without
the help of nitric acid; for if any of the resins, or gum resins, after
long digestion with sulphuric acid, are digested with alcohol, a dark
brown solution is formed, which, by evaporation, yields a mass that
is soluble in water or in alcohol, and which copiously precipitates
gelatine, acetate of lead, and muriate of tin, but produces only a
slight effect on oxymuriate of iron.
   In the subsequent section of this paper, Mr. Hatchett mentions
some circumstances which induce him to think that a natural pro
cess, similar to those above described, sometimes takes place in peat
moors, and that tan has been, and continues to be, formed during
the gradual carbonization and conversion of the vegetable matter
into peat. Supposing this opinion to be correct, it seems, he says,
at first difficult to conceive how the formation of tan is effected
during the growth of those vegetables from which it has hitherto
been obtained; but after adverting to the experiments and observa
                                    O

                                    194
tions of Mr. Biggin and Mr. Davy, which show that the proportion
 of tan in the same trees is different at different seasons, and that it
is principally contained in the white interior bark, which bark is
 comparatively most abundant in young trees, he observes, that there
 seems to be an intimate connexion between the formation of new
wood and the formation of tan, in those vegetables which afford the
latter; and thinks it very probable that such vegetables have the
 faculty of absorbing more carbon and oxygen than is required in
the formation of the vegetable principles, especially of the woody
fibre; and that this excess of carbon and oxygen, by chemical com
bination, becomes tan, which is secreted in the white interior bark,
and afterwards decomposed, and employed in the formation of the
new wood.
    The ligneous substance of vegetables, Mr. Hatchett says, appears
to be composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen; and he
has reason to think, from some synthetical experiments he has made,
that tan consists of 53 parts of pure carbon, and 47 of oxygen.
    In the concluding section, Mr. Hatchett observes, that the whole
of the present paper may be concentrated into one simple fact,
namely, that tan is composed (at least essentially) of carbon and
oxygen; and that, although it has hitherto been deemed a peculiar
principle, formed by nature in certain vegetables, it may, with the
greatest ease, be produced, by presenting oxygen to carbon in the
humid way, under the circumstances which have been described.
    Since the experiments which have been related were made, Mr.
Hatchett has, he says, further proved the efficacy of the factitious
tan by actual practice; as he has converted skins into leather by
means of tan produced from materials which, to professional men,
must appear extraordinary, such as deal sawdust, asphaltum, turpen
tine, pit-coal, wax candle, and a piece of the same sort of skin.
Allowing, therefore, that the artificial production of tan must for the
present be principally regarded only as a curious chemical fact, not
altogether unimportant, yet, as the principle on which it is founded
has been developed, we may, Mr. Hatchett thinks, hope that a more
economical process will be discovered, so that every tanner may be
enabled to prepare his tan, even from the refuse of his present ma
terials.
The Case   of a full-grown Woman in whom the Ovaria were deficient.
    By Mr. Charles Pears, F.L.S. Communicated by the Right Hon.
    Sir Joseph Banks, K.B. P.R.S. Read May 9, 1805. [Phil.
    Trans. 1805, p. 225.]
   The woman whose case is here described was born in Radnorshire
in the year 1770. She was of a fair complexion, and, except when
irritated, of a mild temper.     In her diet she was remarkably abste
mious, eating very   little, either of animal or vegetable food; and if
at any time she ate a hearty meal, or took several kinds of food, she
was so much affected by it as to faint. She was of a costive habit,

                                            195
 seldom having a passage oftener than once in nine days, sometimes
 only once in fourteen days. She ceased to grow at ten years of age,
 and was only four feet six inches in height. Across the shoulders
she measured fourteen inches, but her pelvis measured only nine
inches, from the ossa ilia to the sacrum.        Her breasts and nipples
never   enlarged   more than those of a     man;   nor did she ever men
struate, or show any other sign of puberty, either in mind or body;
on the contrary, she always expressed aversion to the familiarities of
young men.
   At the age of twenty-one she became uneasy at finding herself
different from other women, and, attributing the difference to her
not having menstruated, frequently applied for medical advice.
   She was, from her infancy, subject to the attacks of a complaint
in the chest, attended with cough. These attacks increased in vio
lence as she advanced in age; and in her twenty-ninth year, one of
them came on, attended with convulsions, of which, after a few hours,
she died.
   Upon examining the female organs after her death, it appeared that
the ostincae and uterus had the usual form, but had not increased
beyond their size in the infant state. The passage into the uterus,
through the cervix, was oblique, and the Fallopian tubes were per
vious to the fimbriae. The ovaria were so indistinct that they rather
showed the rudiments which ought to have formed them, than any
part of their natural structure.
   From the history of the preceding case, it appears, not only that
an imperfect state of the ovaria is attended with an absence of all
the characters belonging to the female after puberty, but also that
the uterus itself, although perfectly formed, was checked in     growth,                  its
in  consequence     ofthe imperfect structure    those parts.  of

 On the Direction and Velocity of the Motion of the Sun, and Solar
   System.   By William Herschel, LL.D. F.R.S.       Read May 16,
   1805.   [Phil. Trans. 1805, p. 233.]
    Although, in the title to this paper, Dr. Herschel mentions both
the direction and velocity of the solar system, it is his intention, he
says, to limit his inquiries, at present, to the first of these subjects,
and to discuss the other at some future opportunity. He is induced
to enter into this inquiry, because a solar motion, if established,
seems to contradict the original intention for which it was intro
duced; namely, to take away many of the proper motions of stars,
by investing the sun with a contrary one. But as the solar motion
will reveal a greater number of concealed real motions than need be
admitted if the sun were at rest, the necessity of admitting              motion                           its
ought        to     be
                 well established.
    From the motion          the secondary planets round the primary ones,
                                      of
and      these round the sun, the solar motion must be allowed
          of                                                                   be                                 to
  very possible event; and the rotatory motion            the sun, from which        of
a adisplacing        the solar centre has been inferred, also indicates
                          of                                                                                               a
motion          of
              translation      space; for   in does not appear probable that
                                                                  it
any mechanical impression should produce the former without occa
sioning the latter.
       would, Dr. Herschel thinks, be worth while for those who have
      It
fixed instruments,         observe those stars which change their magni
                                    to
tudes periodically; for,         this change  as probably owing         rotatory                      to
                                                                       be is

motion,      real motion
                a               space may   in   expected      attend it: and,              to
on the other hand, all those stars that have motion               space may    a                 in                        be
supposed            to
                 have also    rotation on their axes.

    Dr. Herschel has delineated the meeting of the arches, arising
 from a calculation of the proper motions of the 36 stars in Dr. Mas
  kelyne's Catalogue, on a celestial globe; and finds that, in the
  northern hemisphere, no less than ten of those intersections are made
  by stars of the first magnitude, in a very limited part of the heavens,
  about the constellation of Hercules. Upon all the remaining surface
  there is not the least appearance of any other than a promiscuous
  situation of intersections, and only one of these made by arches of
  principal stars.
     A table is then given of the calculated situations of the above
  mentioned ten intersections in right ascension and north polar di
  stance; and it is observed, that if the intersections made by the
  proper motions of some large stars of the next order, and the arches
  in which the stars of the first magnitude move, are examined, no
  less than fifteen unite with the former ten in pointing out the same
  part of the heavens as a parallactic centre. This, Dr. Herschel
  thinks, can hardly fail to be considered as a convincing proof of the
  motion here treated of.
     The changes in the position of double stars are next considered;
  and these, Dr. Herschel thinks, it will be more eligible to ascribe to
 the effect of parallax than to admit so many separate motions in the
 different stars, especially as the parallactic motions of at least half
 of the 56 double stars described by him, point out the same apex of
 a solar motion by their direction to               its
                                                 opposite parallactic centre.
     Dr. Herschel then remarks, that           the proper motions
                                                if                           of

                                    to    they  would exhibit an   incongruous
 mixture   of great velocity and extreme slowness. Of this incongruity,
 several instances are enumerated; but               will, he says,
                                                          it             shown,be
 when the direction and         velocity       of
                                             the solar motion are    explained,
 that these incongruities are mere parallactic appearances.

                          the occultation           small star by large one,

                                           consider the direction          of
                                                                       the solar
 motion; the expedience          ofadmitting such motion being,          thinks,  he
 after what has been      said,no   longer   questionable.
    He begins        by
                     proving, that when the proper motions
                                                                          be of
                                                                      two stars
 are  given,    an
                 apex   may    be found,      which,

                                                                if    supposed
to   move with   a  certain velocity, the two given motions may               re       be
solved into apparent changes, arising from sidereal parallax; the
stars remaining perfectly           at       The mode         proving this,
                                                                                                of in
                                     rest.                           of
which Arcturus and Sirius are used                examples, will not admit
                                                    as
abridgement.       But, from the nature            proper motions,      follows,
                                                      us of
                                                                            it
that when   a   third star does not lead                      to
                                                       the same   apex       the       as
other two, its apparent motion cannot                 resolved by the effect
                                                           be                                   of
parallax alone: and, although we may account for the proper motion
of  the third star, Capella for instance,             by
                                                   retaining the same apex                      of
the solar motion which explained the apparent motions                     of
                                                                     the other

                                             J.99
two, yet, in doing this, we must assign a high degree of real motion
to Capella. To this it may be objected, that we have no reason to
deprive Arcturus and Sirius of real motions, in order to give a motion
of the same nature to every star that has a proper motion not tending
to the same parallactic centre as the motions of Arcturus and Sirius.
   It appears, therefore, that such an apex for the solar motion ought
to be fixed upon as is equally favourable to every star that is proper
for directing our choice; and our aim must be, to reduce the proper
motions of the stars to their lowest quantities.
   From a table given by Dr. Herschel, it appears, that the sum of
the apparent motions of the six principal stars whose intersecting
arches are given, namely, Sirius, Arcturus, Capella, Lyra, Aldebaran,
and Procyon, is 5'-353; and if we suppose the point towards which
the sun moves to be A Herculis, the annual proper motions of the six
stars will be reduced to real motions of no more than 2"-219.
    It appears, from the inspection of a figure that represents the
quantities of real motion required when A Herculis is fixed upon,
that, by a regular method of approximation, a situation might be
found where the apparent motion of the six stars would be much re
duced. Accordingly, by fixing upon a point near the following knee
of Hercules, whose right ascension is 270° 15', and north polar di
stance 54° 45', the annual proper motion of the six stars was reduced
to 1":459, which is 0".760 less than when the apex was A Herculis.
    In approximating to the above point, the line of the apparent mo
tion of Sirius was principally considered; but, as Sirius is not the
star that has the greatest proper motion, it occurred to Dr. Herschel
that another minimum, obtained from the line in which Arcturus
seems to move, would be more accurate; and he was soon led to a
point, not only in the line of the apparent motion of Arcturus, but
equally favourable to Sirius and Procyon, the remaining two stars
that have the greatest motion. The right ascension of this point is
245° 52' 30", and         its
                           north polar distance 40° 22'.
  If   the  principles  which have been laid down for determining the
 solar motion are admitted, the above apex must                     be
                                                             very near the
truth; for     an                                  right ascension     polar
                                                                          of or
                  alteration      of

                                   a                          in
distance, either way, will increase the required real motion          these
stars. The sum       of the real motions with the before-mentioned apex
is  only 859, being less than that        the former calculation by 599.

for the phenomena          proper motions, the foregoing arguments can
not  be  affected   bythe result; for,         known that proper motions

 exist, and    no solar motion can resolve them entirely into parallactic
motions, we ought         togive the preference                to

motion    of   the sun that will take away more real motion than any
 other.

      On the Reproduction           of Buds. By Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq.

           Mr. Knight        his paper by stating, that every tree, in the
                              begins
      usual course of its  growth,  generates the buds that expand in the
      succeeding spring; but if these buds are destroyed, during the winter
      or early part of the spring, other buds are in many species gene
      rated; which buds perform the office of those that previously existed,
      except that they never afford blossoms or fruit.   This reproduction
      of buds has not escaped the notice of naturalists; but it does not
      appear that they have ascertained from which of the various sub
      stances of the tree the reproduced buds derived their origin.

      by the annual roots.
        Mr. Knight,        former paper, has remarked,

vessels appear to derive their origin from the alburnous tubes; he
now thinks it not improbable that the lateral, as well as the terminal
orifices of the alburnous tubes, may possess the power of generating
central vessels, and that these vessels give existence to the repro
duced buds and leaves.
   Mr. Knight attempted to discover in seeds a similar power to re
generate their buds; but no experiments he could make were de
cisive, as he was never able to satisfy himself that  the buds could                     all
be  eradicated without the base    the plumula being destroyed.

was rendered firm and coherent; when the bandage was removed,
the bird appeared to be covered with the same kind of bituminous
substance that had cemented the strips of cloth.       As much of this
substance as could be removed without injuring the bird was now
carefully taken off; and after the labour of several hours, Mr. Pearson
succeeded in displaying the whole bird as it had been originally de
posited by the embalmer.
   The neck of the bird was twisted, so that the vertex of the head
lay a little to the left of the sternum.   The bill descended between
the feet, and reached to the extremity of the tail. The feet were
bent upwards, and placed one on each side of the head. The wings
were brought close to the sides of the body. The feathers of the
back and wings were white, tipped at their extremities with dark
brown. The tail feathers could not be sufficiently cleared from the
bituminous substance, to determine their colour.      From the state of
the quills of the wing feathers, it appeared that the bird had attained
its full growth.                                                       -

stated by Herodotus to have been the practice in embalming human
bodies, that the stomach and intestines were not removed, as upon
examining the interior parts of the last-mentioned Ibis, Mr. Pearson
met with a soft spongy substance, containing several scarabaei in an
imperfect state. These, he supposes, had been taken as the food of
the bird, and were not digested at the time of its death.    He also
observes, that as larvae of dermestides and other insects have been
detected among the dust and bones of the mummy of an Ibis, it may
be presumed that this bird was not always in a fresh state at the
time when it was embalmed.
Observations   on the singular   Figure of the Planet Saturn. By William
   Herschel,   LL.D. F.R.S.      Read June 20, 1805. [Phil. Trans. 1805,
   p. 272.]
   Notwithstanding the variety of extraordinary phenomena already
observed respecting the planet Saturn, there remains, Dr. Herschel
says, a singularity which distinguishes the figure of Saturn from that
of all the other planets.
   He had, in the year 1776, observed that the body of Saturn was
not exactly round, and had found in the year 1781 that it was flat
tened at the poles, at least as much as Jupiter.      In the year 1789
he measured the equatorial and polar diameters, and supposing there
could be no other particularity in the figure of the planet, ascribed a
certain irregularity he perceived in other parts of the body, to the
interference of the ring.
   Dr. Herschel now relates a series of observations made in the
months of April, May, and June, of the present year, of    -  which the
following are the most remarkable.
   April 12.The flattening of the polar regions appeared not so
gradual as in Jupiter, and seemed not to begin till at a highlatitude.
   April 18.The situation of the four points of the greatest curva
ture was measured with Dr. Herschel's angular micrometer, power
527. Their latitude was found to be 46° 38'; but as neither of the
cross wires could be in the parallel, no great accuracy, Dr. Herschel
says, could be expected.
   April 19.Ten-feet reflector, power 400. The figure of Saturn
was somewhat like a parallelogram, with the four corners rounded
 offdeeply.    measure
               A          the position
                         of              the four points
                                             of           of the greatest
curvature, taken this night, gave their latitude 45°44'5.
   May the 5th, 12th, and 13th.-Ten-feet reflector, with different
powers. Jupiter and Saturn were viewed alternately, and compared.
   greater curvature was evident      the polar and equatorial regions
of AJupiter than   at
                    those regions    in at
                                      Saturn. These alternate obser
vations were many times repeated, and the oftener the planets were
compared, the more striking appeared the difference     intheir shape.
   May 26.Ten-feet reflector, power 400. The difference         in   the
three diameters of Saturn was evident without measurement.          That
which passes through the points      the greatest curvature being the
                                      of

                                                    204
largest; the equatorial             diameter          the next; and the polar diameter
the smallest.
   June    1-Two   measures of the latitude of the greatest curvature
were taken, by setting the fixed thread of the micrometer to the di
rection of the ring. The mean of these was 43°20'.
   June 2nd.The two planets were viewed alternately, with powers
of 300, of 200, and of 160; and even with the lowest of these, the
difference in the figure of the planets was very evident.
   The telescopic appearance of Saturn was then compared with a
figure drawn from the measures Dr. Herschel had taken, combined
with the proportion between the equatorial and polar diameters de
termined in the year 1789.        From these a corrected figure was
formed, of which an exact copy is given. The dimensions of                                                     it,   in

    It was  in attempting to analyse this second metallic precipitate,
that he first discovered palladium. After separating from it a quan
tity of lead, and some iron by muriatic acid, and dissolving out some
copper by dilute nitrous acid, he was endeavouring to extract the
remainder of the copper by a stronger nitrous acid, when he remarked
that the colour of the solution, instead of being blue, as before, turned
to a dark brown, in consequence of the solution of some other me
tallic ingredient. The first thought which occurred to him was, that
some iron had remained, and had communicated this colour to the
solution; but when he considered that this substance had been more
slowly acted upon than copper, he relinquished that hypothesis, and,
endeavouring to precipitate the metal by a clean plate of copper, he
obtained a black powder, which was redissolved in nitrous acid, and
formed a red solution.
    The solubility of this precipitate in nitrous acid, showed that it
 did not consist either of gold or platina: the colour of the solution
proved equally that it was neither silver nor mercury; and since the
precipitation by copper excluded the supposition of               other known          all
metals,      he
              presumed that              he
                                   was engaged with        new metallic body,a

precipitated       by mercury, with which
                    it                             formed     itamalgam.      By
 treating this amalgam              he

Erperiments on a Mineral Substance formerly supposed to be Zeolite;
  with some Remarks on two Species of Uran-glimmer.    By the Rev.
  William Gregor. Communicated by Charles Hatchett, Esq. F.R.S.
  Read July 4, 1805.  [Phil. Trans. 1805, p. 331.]
    The mineral substance treated of in this paper, is similar to that
of which Mr. Davy, some months ago, gave an account, under the
title of Hydrargyllite or Wavellite. That which is now described by
Mr. Gregor is produced from a mine called Stenra Gwyn, in the
county of Cornwall.                             -
   Two species of this substance, the author says, are found in the
above-mentioned     mine; the first, and most common, consists of an
assemblage of minute and delicate crystals, in radiated tufts, attached
to quartz crystals.   These crystals are in general white and trans
parent; sometimes, however, they have a yellowish hue. They vary
considerably in their size, but seldom exceed a quarter of an inch in
                                -
length.
   Among these crystals are frequently seen two kinds of crystalline
laminae;  one of them being in the form of parallelopipedons,      with
truncated angles, and of a green colour; the other forming an as
semblage of square plates, varying in thickness, and the angles of
which are not always coincident; these are of a bright wax yellow.
This last kind is also found adhering to the sides of quartz crystals,
in the cavities of granite.
   The other species of the substance here treated of, consists of
crystals closely compacted together in the form of mammillary pro
tuberances, generally of the size of small peas, and forming a stratum
about one eighth of an inch thick, upon quartz, in the cavities or
fissures of compact granite. The striae of these mammillae diverge
from a centre, like zeolite.
  The detached crystals of the first speciesareeasily reduced topowder.
Their specific gravity, at 56°Fahr., was found to be 2:22. The se
cond, or more compact species, is sufficiently hard to scratch calca
reous spar; its specific gravity, at the temperature of 55°, was 2.253.
   The crystals of the first species, when suddenly exposed to the
action of the blowpipe, decrepitate; if gradually exposed to           ac      its
tion, they grow opake, but show          signs
                                          no            of
                                                   fusion, even under the
strongest heat. Both species, when exposed for some time               red    to
                                                                               a

   The silica and the lime, Mr. Gregor considers as essential to the
composition of this mineral, as he has always discovered them, even
in the purest specimens.
   In order to examine the nature of the volatilized matter, the author
submitted some of the crystals to distillation.    A fluid passed over
into the receiver, and a white crust was formed in the arch and neck
of the retort. The fluid had an empyreumatic smell, very similar to
that observed in the fluid distilled from the white crust that sur
rounds flint. It changed litmus paper to a faint reddish hue. A va
riety of experiments were made upon the white crust, from the re
sults of which it appeared, that it consisted in part, at least, of an
acid, which did not seem to be either the phosphoric or fluoric; nor
did      its
       properties entirely agree with those   the oxalic acid, although
                                                                    of

   The muscles      fishes, Mr. Carlisle says, are constructed very dif
                               of
ferently from those                  of
                           the other natural classes      animals.  The        of
medium      which fishes reside, the form
                in                             their bodies, and the

struments employed for their progressive motion, give them          cha                             a
racter peculiarly distinct from the rest    the animal creation. Their

                is                            muscular flesh   ofremark                        is

 ably large; but the muscles have no tendinous chords, their inser
 tions being always fleshy. There are, however, semi-transparent
 pearly tendons placed between the plates of muscles, which give
 origin to a series of short muscular fibres, passing nearly at right
 angles between the surfaces of the adjoining plates.
    The progressive motion of fishes, our author says, is chiefly per
 formed by the flexions of the trunk and tail; the pairs of fins, which
 some have considered as analogous to feet, being only employed for
 the purposes of turning, stopping, altering the position of the fish
 towards the horizon, and keeping the back upwards.              The single
fins  appear   to prevent  the rolling  of the body  whilst the tail is em
ployed to impel it forwards. Each of the fins, which are in pairs,
is capable of four motions, viz. of flexion and extension, like oars,
 and of expanding the rays, and closing them.
    Mr. Carlisle now (taking the Cod as a standard of comparison,)
 describes particularly the mode in which the various motions here
 spoken of are performed, and then relates some experiments made to
determine the effect of the fins on the motions of fishes. For this
purpose a number of dace, equal in size, were put into a large vessel
 of water, and the pectoral fins of one of them being cut off, it was
replaced with the others. The result was, that the progressive mo
tion of the fish was not at all impeded; but its head inclined down
wards; and when it attempted to ascend, the effort was attended
with difficulty.
    From another fish, both the pectoral and abdominal fins were
taken. The fish remained at the bottom of the vessel, and could not
be made to ascend. Its progressive motion was not perceptibly more
slow; but when the tail acted, the body showed a tendency to roll,
and the single fins were widely expanded,         as if to   counteract this
effect.
    From a third fish the single fins were removed.        This produced an
evident   tendency   to turn round,   and the  pectoral fins were kept con
stantly extended, to obviate that motion.
    From a fourth fish all the fins were removed. Its back was kept
in a vertical position, whilst at rest, by the expansion of the tail; but
it rolled half round at every attempt to move.
    From a fifth fish the tail was cut off as close to the body as pos
sible. The progressive motion of the fish was considerably impeded,
and the flexions of the spine were much increased; but neither the
pectoral nor the abdominal fins seemed to be more actively employed.
    From a sixth fish all the fins and the tail were removed. It re
mained without motion, floating near the surface of the water, with
its belly upward.
    The above experiments were repeated on the roach, the gudgeon,

    Mr. Carlisle now observes, that the muscles of fishes differ very
materially in their structure from those of other animals; that they
are apparently more homogeneous; that their fibres are not so much
fasciculated,
         -   -   but run more parallel to each other, and are always

perature of 156° of Fahrenheit, when their tendinous and ligamentous
attachments are dissolved, and their serous juices coagulated.    He
then proceeds to give a very minute description of the situation and
arrangement of the various series which form what are called the
lateral muscles of the body. The nerves belonging to these muscles
are also described; and mention is made of loose transparent vesicles
about the size of a millet-seed, containing a white substance like
carbonate of lime, which vesicles are found within the sheath of the
nerves, at the point of their junctions.
   The rate at which fishes move through so dense a medium as water,
 is,our author says, very remarkable; and although this may       partly                            be
accounted for by the large proportion      muscles, and their advantaof

The Bakerian Lecture on the Force of Percussion. By William Hyde
  Wollaston, M.D. Sec. R.S.     Read November    14, 1805. [Phil.
  Trans. 1806, p. 13.]
    The force of percussion is a subject, respecting the estimation of
 which a controversy has subsisted for more than a century past be
 tween different classes of philosophers.          For although it is agreed
 that when unequal bodies move with the same velocity, the forces
 are as their quantities of matter; yet when equal bodies move with
 unequal velocities, there are two methods of estimating the compa
 rative forces of such bodies. Leibnitz and his followers conceive the
 forces to vary as the squares of the velocities; while their opponents
 maintain that the forces are in the simple ratio of the velocities of
 the bodies respectively.      The latter have been considered as New
 tonians; but Dr. Wollaston endeavours to show that they can derive
 no support from any expressions of Newton.
    In order to explain the grounds for each opinion, the author pro
 poses the following experiment.
    He supposes a ball of clay to be suspended at rest, having two
 similar and equal pegs slightly inserted into its opposite sides; and
 he supposes two other bodies, A and B, which are to each other in
 the proportion of 2 to 1, to strike at the same instant against the
 opposite pegs, with velocities which are in the proportion of 1 to 2.
 In this case, the ball of clay would not be moved from                  place                      its
                                                                                                                    B,to
 either side; nevertheless, the peg impelled by the smaller body
 which has the double velocity, would               found           be
                                                                have penetrated         to
 twice is,asfar into the clay     the  pegasimpelled    by the larger body                                      A.
  It       Dr. Wollaston    says,  unnecessary         make the above experi
                                                                         to
 ment precisely        as  here stated, because the results are admitted
                            it      is
 as  facts by both parties; but upon these facts they reason differently.
 One party, observing that the ball         clay remains unmoved, considers
                                                           of
the proof indisputable, that the action           the body         equal
                                                                    of        that        A   is           to
of  the body     B,   they would
                       as                             be
                                               expect, because their momenta
                                        led                 it to
are equal. Their opponents think              equally proved,        the unequal               by
depths    to which the   pegs  have    penetrated,    that the causes       these                         of
effects are unequal,        they would have expected, from considering
                                    as
the forces       proportional
                 as                the squaresto     the velocities. of
    The former party observe,          this experiment, that equal momenta
                                                      in

idea which, the author observes, arises naturally from the daily oc
 cupations of men, since any quantity of work performed is always
 estimated by the extent of effect resulting from their exertions. Thus
 it is well known that the raising of any great weight 40 feet would
 require four times as much labour as would be requisite to raise an
 equal weight 10 feet. And if weights so raised were suffered to fall
 freely, the squares of the velocities acquired would be in proportion
 to the quantity of labour, that                      and              is,

           As a simple case of entire transfer of force from A to B, it is evi
dent that if A were allowed to ascend to the height due to its ve
locity, and if by any mechanical contrivance, of lever or otherwise,
the body B were to be raised by the descent of A, their heights of
ascent would be reciprocally as the bodies; consequently, that the
square of the velocity to be acquired by the free descent of B, would
be, to that of A, in the above-mentioned ratio, and the quantity of
mechanic force so estimated would be preserved unaltered.
   But, on the contrary, the momentum, which is in the simple reci
procal ratio of the bodies, would be increased by such means in the
subduplicate ratio of the bodies that might be employed; and if mo
mentum were really a force efficient in proportion to its estimated
magnitude, it should not only be capable of reproducing the original
quantity, but the additional force, thus acquired, might be employed
for counteracting the usual resistances, and perpetual motion would
be easily produced.    But since the impetus, or mechanic force, re
mains unaltered, it is evident that the utmost that B could effect, in
return, would be the reproduction of A's velocity, and restitution of
 itsformer force, neither increased nor diminished, excepting      the                                                  by

Chemical Eaperiments on Guaiacum. By Mr. William Brande. Com
  municated by Charles Hatchett, Esq. F.R.S. Read December 19,
  1805.   [Phil. Trans. 1806, p. 89.]
  No one of the resins, Mr. Brande observes, possesses    so many cu
rious properties as that called Guaiacum;    and he thinks it remark
able, that although many of the alterations it undergoes, when heated
with different solvents, have been mentioned by various authors, it
has not excited a more particular attention.
   After noticing its more obvious properties, of which we shall only
repeat, that when pulverized, it is of a gray colour, but gradually
becomes greenish by exposure to the air, he proceeds to examine the
action of various solvents upon                  it.
   The first solvent tried by Mr. Brande was water; about      per cent.            9
of extractive matter was taken     up, and the solution appeared also                              to
contain small portion
             a               lime. Alcohol, which was next tried, dis
                                     of
solved nearly the whole         the guaiacum, leaving only about
                                       of                            per                     5

and     alkalies, upon this solution, are then noticed. Water forms

to the brown precipitate obtained, by nitric acid, from the solution
of guaiacum in alcohol, and possessed the properties of a resin in
greater perfection than guaiacum itself. If successive portions of
nitric acid be added to the above-mentioned residuum, or if a large
quantity of that acid is employed so as to form a complete solution,
a product may be obtained, by evaporation, which is equally soluble
in water and in alcohol; both which solutions have an astringent
bitter taste.
    Guaiacum is soluble in the pure and in the carbonated alkalies.
The precipitates formed from these solutions, by dilute sulphuric acid
and by muriatic acid, were of a flesh colour, and approached to the
nature of extract; being less acted upon by sulphuric ether, but
more soluble in boiling water than guaiacum.
    Mr. Brande now proceeds to the analysis, by distillation, of the
substance here treated of.           By this method he obtained, from 100
grains, the following products:

    The coal, on incineration, yielded four grains of lime, but no
alkali could be discovered.                                               -
    From the foregoing experiments it appears, that although guaiacum
possesses many of the properties common to resins, it differs from
them in the following circumstances.                                                    -
    1. By affording a portion of vegetable extract.
    2. By the alterations which take place in it when submitted to
the action of bodies which readily communicate oxygen, such as ni
tric and oxymuriatic acids, and by the rapidity with which it is dis
solved in the former.
    3. By being capable of being converted into a more perfect resin,
in which it resembles the green resin that constitutes the colouring
matter of leaves.
    4. By yielding oxalic acid.
    5. By the quantity of charcoal and lime obtained from it by dis
tillation.
    These circumstances, the author says, shows that guaiacum differs
not only from the substances denominated resins, but also that it
differs from those which are called balsams, gum-resins, gums, and
extracts; and he thinks we may, for the present, consider guaiacum
as composed of a resin, modified by the vegetable extractive prin
ciple, so that it may perhaps, without impropriety, be defined by the
term Extracto-resin.
    In a postscript Mr. Brande observes, that the action of oxygen on
some other resinous bodies is very remarkable.                       By digesting mastic

                                                         218
in alcohol, a partial solution is formed, leaving an elastic substance,
which is said to possess the properties of caoutchouc, but which be
comes hard by exposure to the air.
   The author has remarked, that the portion of mastic dissolved in
the alcohol may be precipitated from it by water, and that this pre
cipitate possesses the properties of a pure resin; but when a stream
of oxymuriatic acid gas was passed through the solution, a tough
elastic substance was thrown down, which became brittle when dry:
this precipitate was soluble in boiling alcohol, but separated from it
as the solution became cool.       Its properties, therefore, approached
                                                                  -

On the Direction of the Radicle and Germen during the Vegetation of
  Seeds.   By Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq. F.R.S. In a Letter to
  the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, K.B. P.R.S. Read January 9,
  1806.   [Phil. Trans. 1806, p. 99.]
  It      is,   Mr. Knight observes, very well known, that         whatever              in
position     seed
                a     placed  is  germinate, its radicle always makes an

gated germen takes          precisely opposite direction: and
                                    a                              has been               it

return      their first direction. These opposite effects have, by some
            to
naturalists, been attributed          gravitation; and Mr. Knight con

inches diameter.       Round the circumference         this wheel, several   of
seeds      of
          the garden-beam,    which had been   previously  soaked   water,                    in
were bound        such    manner that their radicles were made
                         in         a                                point                     to
in  every direction.    The wheel made rather more than 150 revolu
tions in    minute.

     Ina few days the seeds began         germinate, and Mr. Knight had

                         to                  whatever direction they were
                                                                   in
protruded, turned their points outwards from the circumference         the                         of
wheel, and       their subsequent growth receded still further from
                     in                                                                                  it.
The germens,         the contrary, took the opposite direction; and

plants were suffered         remain  to the  wheel;  their stems soon ex

                      centre, but their points returned, and met again                                   at
the centre.

                                                     219
   As Mr. Knight conceived that some slight objections might be
urged against the conclusions he was inclined to draw from the
above experiment, he repeated it in a different manner, by adding to
his former apparatus another wheel, also of eleven inches diameter,
which moved horizontally, and to which he could give different de
grees of velocity.   Round the circumference of this horizontal wheel,
seeds of the    garden-bean    were bound, as in the former experiment,
and the wheel was made to perform 250 revolutions in a minute.
The effect produced by this motion soon became obvious; for the
radicles now pointed downwards about ten degrees below the hori
zontal line of the wheel's motion, whilst the germens pointed the
same number of degrees above it: but when the motion of the wheel
was diminished to 80 revolutions in a minute, the radicles pointed
about 45 degrees below the horizontal line, and the germen as much
above it; the one always receding from the axis of the wheel, the
other approaching to              it.
   The foregoing experiments, the author thinks, prove that the ra
dicles   of the germinating seeds are made            descend, and the ger to
mens      ascend,
         to                by
                       some external     cause,  and not by any power in
herent     vegetable   life;                        he

    Ithas, however, been objected by Du Hamel, that gravitation can
have little influence             on
                            the germen when         points perpendicularlyit
downwards. To obviate this        objection,  Mr.  Knight  made many ex
periments         on
                 the seeds             of
                              the horse-chestnut and       the bean.    The         of
result was, that the radicle                   of

dicularly upwards, formed        considerable curvature

                                        objected, that few     the branches              of
of  trees rise  perpendicularly  upwards,   and that their roots always
spread horizontally. Respecting the first         these objections,      ob
                                                                          of                          he

serves, that luxuriant shoots, which abound in sap, constantly turn
upwards, and endeavour to acquire a perpendicular direction; but
that the feeble and more slender shoots grow in almost every direc
tion, probably from their fibres being more dry, and their vessels less
amply supplied with sap, so that they are less affected by gravitation.
To the second objection, Mr. Knight answers, that the compression
of the radicle, as it penetrates the soil, obstructs the motion of the
sap, and occasions the generation of numerous lateral roots; and as
their substance is less succulent than that of the radicle first emitted,
they are less obedient to gravitation, and consequently extend hori
zontally in every direction. Respecting the tap-root of the oak, the
author says he has examined at least 20,000 trees of that species,
and never found one tree that possessed a tap-root; he therefore
thinks he may be allowed to doubt the existence of such a root.
A   third Series of Eageriments on an artificial Substance, which pos
    sesses the principal characteristic Properties of Tannin ; with some
    Remarks on Coal.     By Charles Hatchett, Esq. F.R.S.      Read       Ja
    nuary 16, 1806.     [Phil. Trans. 1806, p. 109.]
    Mr. Hatchett, in  his former communications on this subject, gave
some account of the effects produced by sulphuric acid upon turpen
tine, resin, and camphor.     He now states the results of a variety of
experiments made with that acid upon a great number of resins,
balsams, gum-resins, and gums; from which it appears, that sul
phuric acid almost immediately dissolved the resins, forming transpa
rent brown solutions, which gradually became black; that the solu
tions of the balsams and of guaiacum were at first of a deep crimson
colour, slightly inclining to brown ; and that caoutchouc and elastic
bitumen were not dissolved, but, after a long digestion, were only
superficially carbonized.
   Turpentine, common resin, elemi, tucamahaca, mastic, copaiba,
copal, camphor, benzoin, the balsams of Tolu and of Peru, assafoe
tida, and amber, yielded a large proportion of the tanning substance;
so also did oil of turpentine.
   Asphaltum yielded only a small portion of that substance; and
some slight traces of it were obtained from gum arabic and from
gum tragacanth; but none was produced from guaiacum, dragon's
blood, myrrh, gum ammoniac, olibanum, gamboge, caoutchouc,
elastic bitumen, liquorice, and manna.     Mr. Hatchett thinks, how
ever, that some of these would have yielded          it,
                                                had not the digestion
with nitric acid been too long continued.
   Olive   oil
             was partly converted into the tanning substance;        so
                                                                      also
were linseed oil, wax, and animal fat.        the experiment with lin

seed oil,  a portion was left undissolved: this portion appeared          to
retain many      the properties
                  of             of   an
                                       inspissated fat oil.     Inthe ex
periment made with wax,      a  white substance was     obtained,  which
was found       possess the properties
                 to                         spermaceti.

animal fat (in which the kidney-fat      of
                                          veal was employed),    a  great

 portion of a grayish-black substance was produced, which was highly
 inflammable, was easily melted, and was readily dissolved in cold
 alcohol; from which, like the resins, it might be precipitated by
 Water.
    From coagulated albumen, and from prepared muscular fibre,                                                         no
 thing but coal could be obtained.
          In
       the above experiments there appeared to be a certain period of
 the process  when the production of the tanning substance arrived at
   its
     maximum; after which          gradual diminution, and
                                                  a              length                                at               a

 elastic bitumen, and on several kinds        coal.  The result was, that

 from elastic bitumen, common pit-coal, Cannel-coal, and asphaltum,
 there was obtained, not only the tanning substance, but also another
 substance, which possessed properties intermediate between those                                                       of
 resin and those       vegetable extractive matter; but this substance

 from Wales, the other from North America, none           the above-men               of

   In  the following section          his paper, Mr. Hatchett compares the

effect   of the acetic, sulphuric, and nitric acids, upon resinous sub
stances.      The first of these he considers as the solvent of such sub
stances,        dissolves them speedily, without producing any apparent

but the moment the solution            complete, progressive alterations ap

those substances by means of the above acid than can be obtained
by distillation.
   Two experiments on the humid formation of coal are also de
scribed : from one of these it appears that oak-wood may, by sul
phuric acid, be converted into a coal which is very different from
charcoal, and which, by    mode         its
                                   burning, and       not affording

any alkali, resembles those mineral coals that do not contain bitu
 Inen.
   The other experiment shows that oak-wood may also        converted                               be
into sort coal

                                                    obtained from its ashes.
    Mr. Hatchett now proceeds                      to

formation        coal. After stating the various theories that have been
                of
formed     on that subject,             he
                                considers      the most probable the theory
                                                              as
which ascribes the principal origin           coal     vegetable substances;

number     of  geological facts. The observations, however, that have
been made upon the submerged wood found                      Sutton and other    at
places, show, our author thinks, that vegetable substances, buried
under the sea         under the earth, are not, merely by such means,
                         or
converted even into the most imperfect sort                  coal; some other     of

from which circumstances, together with the sulphureous odour
emitted by most of the mineral coals when burned, the agency of
sulphuric acid is strongly evinced; and, as we have already observed,
the coals formed artificially from vegetable substances, by means of
sulphuric acid, bear a strong resemblance to the mineral coals, not
only in their external characters, but also in their other properties.

                                               In
  imbedded, not only between the vasa deferentia and the bladder, but

 also, in some measure, between the lateral portions of the prostate
 gland and the bladder. It was evidently a lobe of the prostate gland;
 and its ducts passed directly through the coats of the bladder, and
 opened immediately behind the verumontanum.
    A still more distinct appearance of this lobe was afterwards found
 in a subject twenty-four years of age; a representation of which
 accompanies this paper.
    This newly acquired anatomical fact enables us, Mr. Home says,
 to understand the nature of a disease, of which we could not have a
 clear idea while we were ignorant of the existence of the part in
 which it originates: it also enables us to explain various circum
 stances respecting the disease, particularly what to our author has
 ever appeared the greatest difficulty, namely, the protrusion of the
 tumour into the cavity of the bladder.       This protrusion arises from
 the hard substance of the coats of the vasa deferentia being in close
 contact, and bound down upon the lobe; so that, from its first en
 largement, it must press up the thin coats of the bladder. The situa
 tion of this lobe, and its connexion with the vasa deferentia, also
 render it liable to many causes of swelling, from which the body of
the gland is free ; since every irritation of the seminal vessels, or of
their orifices, may be communicated to it by continuity of parts.
    There is much reason, our author says, to believe that the diseased
state of the lateral parts of the gland, so common in the later periods
of life, has its origin in the lobe here described; for, in most of the                                          s
cases examined by him, this lobe has been enlarged in a much greater
degree, in proportion to its size, than any other part of the gland;
and the difficulty in passing the urine, which comes on very early in
                an is,
the disease,      Mr. Home thinks, owing         the enlargement         to
                                                                      this                           of
lobe; since      enlargement     the lateral portions
                                              of        the gland  widens            of
the canal instead      diminishing
                              of                     it.

no  suspicion   entertained
                is               the cause   ofthe  frequency and distress
in passing it; but they are referred          irritable stateto  the coats                      of

  The present paper                 is  a   continuation           of    that communicated            to   the
Society   by   Dr. Herschel last year,                      in   which        he   considered the     direc      t

                                                       227
tion of the solar motion: he now proceeds to consider the quantity
and  velocity of that motion; and as, in the former paper, the proper
motions, when reduced to one direction, were called quantities, to
distinguish them from the velocities required in the moving stars to
produce those motions, so also in the present inquiry, it will, the
author says, be necessary to keep up the same distinction with re
spect to the velocity of the solar motion.     To determine this, we
ought to have in view the real motion of every star whose apparent
motion we know; but as trials with a number of stars would be very
inconvenient, Dr. Herschel makes use only of the six stars mentioned
in his former paper, in laying down the method followed with all the
                                                                                         -
rest.
   He first considers the proportional distance of the stars; for till
this is fixed upon, neither the parallactic nor the real motion of a star
can, he says, be ascertained. And as it is not sufficiently satisfactory
 to divide the stars into a few magnitudes, and suppose these to re
 present their relative distances, he expresses the relative brightness
 of the six stars already alluded        according    to,
                                                        the notation formerly
                                                                          to
 used by him for that purpose; and from that introduces,                     using                     by
 fractional distinctions, more minute subdivision than has been com
                                       a
 monly admitted.         He then proposes the following arrangement,                                         as
 expressing their proportional distance :-Sirius 1:00, Arcturus 1:20,
 Capella 1:25, Lyra 1:30, Aldebaran 1:40, Procyon 1:40.
    Our author next considers the effect of the increase and decrease
of  the solar motion, and the conditions          be observed        the investi

   The necessary calculations for investigating the solar motion may,
our author says, be divided into two classes: the first of these will
remain unaltered, whatever may be the solar motion under examina
tion; while the other must be adjusted to every change that may be
required. The first will contain the angular quantity of the observed
or apparent motion;                       its
                                direction with the parallel            the star;                        of                        its
direction with the      parallactic    motion;      and      velocity:   the second, its
or   changeable    part,  will consist         the   angularof quantity      the real                              of
motion; the parallactic direction               this motion; and          velocity.                          its
                                                                is of of

permanent quantities            36 stars  of      now given: there are also va
rious figures illustrating the said calculations: upon these, various
remarks are made, which cannot be well understood without                        view                                   a
of  the  figures.    We shall    only    observe,    that several stars      the first                             of
magnitude appear            have less velocity than many which are much
                                     to
smaller.     This, Dr. Herschel thinks, may                   explained,         solar   be                        if   a

original projectile force impressed upon them. As both these causes
are known           act to                 all

be either a single body of great magnitude; or it may be produced
by the joint attraction of a great number of stars united into one
condensed group; or, lastly, it may be formed by the union of several
groups, which, he says, will create a still more powerful centre of
gravitation.
   Dr. Herschel now proceeds to the determination of the quantity
and velocity of the solar motion: and, calculating upon the principles
laid down in the course of the present paper, assuming, as we have
already stated, that the solar motion holds a middle rank among the
sidereal velocities, it appears that we have sufficient reason to fix
upon the quantities of the solar motion to be such as, by an eye
placed at right angles to its direction, and at the distance of Sirius
from us, would be seen to describe annually an arch of 1-116992 of
a degree ; and its velocity, till we are acquainted with the real
distance of the fore-mentioned star, can therefore only be expressed
by the proportional number of 1116992.
   Before he concludes, our author remarks, that the middle rank
among the sidereal velocities, which he has assigned to the sun,
agrees sufficiently with the phenomena that were to be explained.
Thus the apparent velocities of Arcturus and Aldebaran, without a
solar motion, are to each other as 208 to 12; but, according to the
assumed solar motion, it appears, that when the deception arising
from the parallactic effect is removed, these velocities are to each
other only as 179 to 85, or 2 to 1. And although Arcturus still
remains a star which moves with great velocity, yet it has been
shown, in the eleventh table, that we have three or four stars with
nearly as much motion, and five with more. The solar motion also
removes the deception by which the motion of a star, of the conse
 quence of a Orionis, is so concealed as hardly to show any velocity;
whereas, by computation, we find that it really moves at a rate which
is fully equal to the motion of the sun.
   It will now be found, Dr. Herschel says, that we are within the
reach of a link of the chain which connects the principles of the
solar and sidereal motions with those that are the cause of orbitual
 ones: the probable motions of the sun and of the stars in orbits
consequently becomes a subject that may receive the assistance of
arguments supported by observations. And he further observes, that
 what he has said in a former paper, where the sun is placed among
the insulated stars, does not contradict the present idea of its form
ing a part of a very extensive system. The insulation there ascribed
 to the sun relates merely to a supposed binary combination with
 some neighbouring star; and it has been already proved, by the
 example of Arcturus, that the solar motion cannot be occasioned, or
 accounted for, by a periodical revolution of the sun and the above, or
 any other star, about their common centre of gravity.

Observations upon the Marine Barometer, made during the Eramina
  tion of the Coasts of New Holland and New South Wales, in the
  Years 1801, 1802, and 1803.      By Matthew Flinders, Esq. Com
  mander of His   Majesty's  Ship  Investigator. In a Letter to the
  Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B. P.R.S. &c. &c. &c.
  Read March 27, 1806.      [Phil. Trans. 1806, p. 239.]
  The chief circumstance that induced Capt. Flinders to think his
observations upon the marine barometer were worthy of attention,
was the coincidence that took place between the rising and falling
of the mercury, and the setting in of winds that blew from the sea
and from off the land, to which there seemed to be at least as much
reference as to the strength of the wind or the state of the atmo
sphere.
   Our author's examination of the coasts of New Holland and the
other parts of the Terra Australis, began at Cape Leuwen, and con
tinued eastward along the south coast. His observations, which, on
account of their length, we must pass over, show, that a change of
wind from the northern half of the compass to any point in the
southern half, caused the mercury to rise; and that a contrary
change caused it to fall. Also, that the mercury stood considerably
higher when the wind came from the south side of east and west,
than when, in similar weather, it came from the north side.
   Capt. Flinders now proceeds to relate the observations he made
upon the east coast.    From these it appears that the winds which
came from between south and east caused the mercury to rise and
stand high, as the same winds had done, with only one exception,
on the south coast. The wind from north-east kept the mercury up
above thirty inches on the east coast, and caused it to rise after all
other winds, except those from the south-east; whereas, on the south
coast, those winds caused the mercury to fall, and to stand much be
low thirty inches; owing, in our author's opinion, to the wind coming
from off the land. During north-west winds, the mercury stood lower
upon both coasts than at any other time; and, on both, those winds
came from off the land.
   Moderate winds from the south-westward, with fine weather,
caused a descent of the mercury on the east coast; and during their
continuance, it was much lower than with winds from the north
eastward; but upon the south coast it rose with south-west winds,
and it stood much higher than with winds from the opposite quarter.
But it must be observed, that the wind which blew from the sea
upon one coast came from off the land on the other.
   The mean height of the mercury on the east coast is stated by our
author to be not less than 30.08 or 30:10 inches; whereas upon the
south coast he estimates itsmean height to   be   30
                                                 inches. The greatest
range observed upon the east coast was from 29'60        30°36; while
                                                        to
upon the south coast the range was from 29:42           30-51. But
                                                       to          it
must  be  remarked, that these extremes are taken for very short in
tervals of time.

                                       231
  The observations made by our author upon the north coast are
next detailed. The chief differences in the effects of winds upon this
coast, from what they produced upon the south and east coast, are,
that a north-east wind raised the mercury as high, if not higher, than
one from the south-east; and that a north-west wind, when it came
from off the sea, and was moderate, was equal, in the above effect,
to either of them, and kept the mercury higher than the south-west
wind did.
   Upon considering the effects of the same winds upon the different
coasts of Australia, as described in the foregoing summary of Capt.
Flinders's observations, the following queries seem, he says, to present
themselves:
  Why do the winds from the north and north-west, which cause
the mercury to descend and stand lower than any other upon the
south and east coasts, and also in the open sea, and in the south
west bight of the Gulf of Carpentaria, make it rise upon the outer
part of the north coast with the same or even worse weather ?
   Why should the north-east wind, which occasions a fall in the ba
rometer, upon the south coast, considerably below the mean standard,
be attended with a rise above the mean upon the east and north coasts?
The south-east wind, upon the south and east coasts, causes the mer
cury to rise higher than any other;-why has it not the same effect
upon the north coast and upon the west?
   How is it that the south-west wind, which makes the mercury rise
and stand high upon the south and west coasts, causes it to fall be
low the mean standard upon the east coast, and, with the same wea
ther, to descend lower than any other upon the north coast
   The answer to these questions Capt. Flinders considers as suffi
ciently obvious; in support of which opinion he offers the following
explanation:
   The lower air, when brought in by a wind from the sea, meets
with resistance in passing over the land; and to overcome this re
sistance, it is obliged to rise and make itself room by forcing the
superincumbent air upwards. The first body of air which thus comes
in from the sea, being itself obstructed in its velocity, will obstruct
the second ; and this will therefore rise over the first, in like manner,
to overcome the obstruction : and as the course of the second body
of air will be more direct towards the top of the highest land it has
to surmount than the first was, so the first part of the second body
will arrive at the top before the latter part of the first body has
reached it; and this latter part will not be able to pass over the top,
being kept down by the second body and the successive stream of
air, whose velocity is superior to      it.   In
                                          this manner       eddy   an body   or
of  compressed air will be formed, which        first will occupy all the
space below   a line drawn from the shore       the top a to atthe highest
                                                                        of
land; but the succeeding bodies      air,
                                       of      distance from the shore,
                                                   at
will soon feel the effect    ofthe obstruction, and will begin        rise;  to
by which the stratum    oflower air will     deeperbe between the   top           of
the land and the shore, and       to
                                  some distance from              it,
                                                           than upon the

mountains or in the open sea.    Hence it follows, that the mercury
ought to stand somewhat higher when such a wind blows than with
the same wind when it meets with no obstruction; and the more
direct it blows upon the coast, and the higher the land    the higher                                 is,
ought the mercury     rise. On the other hand, when the wind comes
                                        to
from off the hills, this dense air will   displaced; and thus the air  be
over the coast will resume its natural state with   land wind.                         a
   Capt. Flinders concludes his paper with some general remarks
upon the barometer,       which the following seem
                                             of             the most                             to   be

duction, arising from the metallization of white carbonate of lead by
hepatic gas. This, our author says, appears evident in a specimen
which he means to send to Mr. Greville. In one part of this speci
men there is a cluster of large crystals; one of which, upon being

thickness, while            its

considerable number, standing           different directions, and separate
                                                      in
from each other.      Mr. Griffiths was informed that the shells were
filled with     soft gelatinous flesh, and that the animal threw out
                  a
tentacula, resembling small Actiniae, from the two apertures               the                          at
apex. They were easily extracted from their bed, but were all mu
tilated more       less: this, the author thinks, was occasioned by the
                      or
earthquake.

dication that the animal had adhered to any part of the shell.
   The great length and size of these shells, and the division in the
upper part, constitute, in Mr. Griffiths's opinion, their chief pecu
liarities. The radiated appearance of the substance of the shells is
such, that they might, in his opinion, be easily mistaken for stalac
tites.    Mr. Griffiths at first considered these shells as a new genus;
but   afterwards,   on consulting the works of Rumphius, he found in
that author a     description of some shells, very similar, but differing
by having two long-jointed tubes issuing from their upper part.
These shells were found in shallow water among mangrove-trees.
 Observations on the Shell of the Sea Worm found on the Coast of Su
    matra, proving it to belong to a Species of Teredo; with an Account
    of the Anatomy of the Teredo Navalis. By Everard Home, Esq.
    F.R.S. Read May 1, 1806. [Phil. Trans. 1806, p. 276.]
    In the first part of this paper Mr. Home relates some further par
ticulars respecting the sea worm shell from Sumatra, of which an ac
 count was, some time since, laid before this Society by Mr. Griffiths.
A specimen of one of these shells, five feet long, but imperfect at
both ends, was given to Mr. Home by Capt. Maxwell; and in order
 to remove all doubt respecting its nature, a part of it was analysed
by Mr. Hatchett, who found that it was composed of carbonate of
lime and an animal gelatinous substance, greater in quantity than in
 the Chama Gigas, but less than in the common oyster.
    The subsequent discovery of two boring shells and two flattened
opercula, sufficiently evinced that the shell here treated of belonged
 to the genus Teredo; and as the internal structure and economy of
Teredines are very little known, our author thought that nothing
 would tend more to enable us to form an adequate idea respecting
 this new species (which he thinks may be called Teredo gigantea),
 than an accurate knowledge of the common species Teredo Navalis.
 With this view, by the assistance of Sir Joseph Banks and Mr. Whit
 bey, Mr. Home obtained some pieces of wood, with live Teredines
 in them, from Sheerness.        By means of these, and of some speci
 mens in the British and the Hunterian Museums, he has been enabled,
with the assistance of Mr. Clift and Mr. Brodie, to give a very cir.
cumstantial description, accompanied by drawings, of the anatomy
of the Teredo Navalis.
    The Teredines brought from Sheerness, lived in salt water for the
space of three days after being brought to town, during which time
these animals were observed to throw out two small tubes; the largest
of which was about three fourths of an inch in length, and had, within
its external orifice, a fringe composed of about twenty very small ten
tacula.    These tentacula were visible only when the tube was fully
extended, because the animal drew in this tube by inverting it;
whereas the smaller tube was not inverted when drawn in. The
smallest of these tubes appeared to be the most sensible; for the

                                                 235
larger one did not always retract when touched, but upon touching
the smaller one, both were instantly drawn in.
   In examining the shell while in the wood, there appeared to be a
small portion, nearly at right angles to the cylinder, sufficient only
to give a passage to the two small tubes. The shell was found, when
 analysed by Mr. Hatchett, to be perfectly similar to that of the Te
redo gigantea.
   The largest of these worms was 8 inches in length; many of them
lived 24 hours after separation from the shell; in these the heart was
distinctly seen to palpitate. The blood in the vessels going to the
head, and also in the parts near the liver, was of a red colour; but
this colour disappeared soon after death.
   From the middle of the exposed part of the head proceeds a kind
of proboscis.       As this has no orifice in               it,
                                                      Mr. Home thinks        pro                 it
bable that   it  adheres        to
                               the  wood,   and acts       centre-bit,
                                                                     as

animal works with the boring shells, between which                      situated.
                                                                                it       is

The body     of  the animal terminates            small double fold, forming

cup,   on the inside       ofwhich are two opercula, which, when brought
together, close up the shell: these opercula                         do
                                                          not correspond       the                    to
 tubes, but are       in   contrary direction.

content ourselves with mentioning the most striking circumstances,
referring those who wish for more particular information               the paper     to
itself.
   Into the cavity         the worm there are two natural openings; one
                           of
of  these   is the   larger   tube already described, by which           receives        it
water from the      sea;   the other         aperture under the boring shells,
                                            is    an
forming  a   slit     in
                       a transverse direction, which opens into the space
before the   boring    shells.

cavity, and have their fringed edges loose, and exposed                  the sea          to

                                                                     the animal.
In the worms, which were examined while alive, the stomachs, which
extend the whole length             the abdomen, were quite empty; but
                                                                                                           bya in
                                     of
the stomachs      of some       the preserved specimens there was found
                                of
yellow-coloured pulp, which, from some experiments made                                          on
                                                                                                  it
Mr. Hatchett, appeared               to     be   an
                                             impalpable vegetable saw-dust.
The   intestine,   after various   inflections,  terminates     the small tube,
                                                                          in

   The heart consists           two auricles, which open into two tubes;

single; but the mode            which
                                in            performed seems
                                             it   is                     peculiar
to  this animal; the blood being thrown out from the heart, towards
the viscera and the head, and carried afterwards through the ves

                                                236
sels of the breathing           organs,    from which          it    returns         directly to the
heart.
   The mode in which the breathing organs of this animal are sup
plied with water, makes it evident, in Mr. Home's opinion, that all
similar animals which have no cavity for the reception of sea water,
must have their breathing organs placed externally; and he thinks
that the beautiful membranous expansions displayed by those species
of Actiniae, called in the West Indies animal flowers, are, in fact, the
breathing organs of those animals; and not, as their appearance
formerly led Mr. Home to believe, tentacula for catching food.
   The Teredo gigantea, when arrived at                        its
                                                        full growth, closes                            up
its shell;   so also does the Teredo Navalis.           Hence Sellius was led
to suppose that the animal, by this act, formed               own tomb. This,
                                                                      its

            is                                  in
possession, the animal appears              to
                                        have receded from         first inclosure,
and   to have formed        second, three inches up the tube, and after
                            a
wards   a  third, two inches further on. These facts show that the
Teredo  gigantea,    when arrived        its full growth, closes up its shell,
                                            at
and lives   a long  time   afterwards,   being   furnished with food from the
sea by means          of
                      its tentacula.     The Teredo Navalis closes up its
shell in  the same manner;          must therefore, after that period, be
                                     it
supplied with food through the medium                 the sea water; and

probable that the small tentacula, before described, are for the pur
pose  of catching food.

  Mr. Knight,     the papers formerly communicated
                      in                                 him     the                 by      to
Royal Society, endeavoured     prove that the fluid by which the va
                                      to
rious parts added     trees, &c. are generated, has previously circu
                           to
lated through their leaves, either     the same      inthe preceding   or   in
season, and has subsequently descended through their barks. There
is,however,   circumstance stated
                 a                    Hales and      by
                                                   Du Hamel, which     by

                                   237
appears to militate against the above hypothesis, namely, that when
two circular incisions are made, at a small distance from each other,
through the bark, round the stem of a tree, and the bark between
these incisions is wholly taken away; that portion of the stem which
is below the incisions continues to live, and to increase in size, though
much more slowly than the parts above the incisions. The above
mentioned naturalists have also observed, that a small elevated ridge
is formed round the lower lip of the wound, which makes some slight
advances to meet the bark and wood, projected in larger quantities
from the upper lip of the wound.
    Our author, in a former paper, attempted to explain the above cir
cumstance, by supposing that a small part of the true sap, descending
from the leaves, escapes downwards, through the porous substance
of the alburnum: in another paper he has shown, from the growth
of inverted cuttings, the existence of a power in the alburnum         to
carry the sap in different directions; and he now describes some ex
periments made in order to show that the conclusions drawn by him
are not inconsistent with the facts stated by Hales and Du Hamel;
and that although the ascending sap usually rises through the al
burnum and central vessels, yet the alburnous vessels appear to be
also capable of an inverted action, when such action becomes neces
sary to preserve the existence of the plant.
   The first experiment described in the present paper, consisted in
removing the bark by means of circular incisions at the distance of
three inches from each other from the stems of several young oaks, as
soon as the leaves were nearly full grown, and examining, in the
succeeding winter, the state of the parts.     In almost every instance
the alburnum was found to be lifeless, and almost dry; in one in
stance, however, it was perfectly alive; and in this the specific gra
vity of the wood, above the decorticated space, was 1114, and below
it 1111, whereas the specific gravity of an unmutilated stem, from
the same roots, and at the same distance from the ground, was 1112.
Now if the whole of the descending, or true sap, had in the above
instance stagnated above the decorticated part, the specific gravity of
the wood there ought to have been much greater than it was found
to be.
    Mr. Knight, conceiving that he should obtain more satisfactory
 and decisive results from tuberous-rooted plants, now proceeded to
make some experiments on the potatoe.        The early varieties of this
 plant, as is well known, afford neither blossoms nor seeds. This cir
 cumstance he attributed to the privation of nutriment, from the pre
 ternaturally early formation of the tubers; he therefore planted, in
 the last spring, some cuttings of a very early variety of the potatoe
 in garden-pots; and when the plants had grown a few inches high,
 they were secured to sticks, fixed erect in the pots. The mould was
 then washed away from the base of the stems, so that the plants were
 suspended in the air, and had no communication with the remaining
 soil, except by their fibrous roots. Efforts were soon made, by every
 plant, to produce runners and tuberous roots, but these were de

                                   238
stroyed as soon as they became perceptible. An increased luxuriance
of growth now took place in all the plants; numerous blossoms were
emitted, and every blossom afforded fruit.
   In another experiment Mr. Knight, taking great care to prevent
the formation of tubers on any other part of the plant, permitted them
to form on the extremities of the lateral branches; these being the
points most distant from the earth, in which the tubers are naturally
deposited.   Many of the joints of the plants became enlarged; and
our author  thinks,  that if the formation of tubers had been totally
prevented, these joints would have acquired an organization capable
of affording plants in the succeeding spring.
   In another variety of the potatoe, which was very luxuriant in la
teral branches, Mr. Knight detached many of those branches from
the principal stem, letting them, however, remain suspended by such
a portion of alburnous and cortical fibres and vessels as was sufficient
to preserve life. The result was, that the true sap, instead of re
turning down the principal stem into the ground, remained, and
formed small tubers at the base of the leaves of the depending
branches.
     To ascertain whether the tubers would be fed when the passage
 of the true sap down the cortical vessels was interrupted, a portion
 of the bark, five lines in width, was removed from the stems of several
 potatoe plants, close to the surface of the ground, soon after the tubers
 had begun to be formed. The tubers continued to grow, but did not
 attain their natural size; partly, our author supposes, from the de
 clining health of the plant, and partly from the stagnation of a por
 tion of the true sap above the decorticated part.
    The preceding experiments, Mr. Knight admits, do not prove that
 the fluid contained in the leaf passes downward through the decor
 ticated space to be subsequently discharged into the bark below it;
 but he has, he says, found that if the amputated branches of different
 trees have their leaves immersed in water, a portion of that fluid will
 be absorbed, and will be carried downwards, by the alburnum, into
 the bark below a decorticated space; so that the insulated bark will
 be preserved alive and moist during several days.         If the moisture
 absorbed by a leaf can be thus transferred, it appears very probable
that the true sap will pass through the same channel. A considerable
portion of that sap certainly stagnates above the wound, and a great
part of that which escapes into the bark below the wound, is pro
bably carried into the root. But some of that fluid will be carried
upwards, by capillary attraction, and will stagnate on the lower         lip
of  the wound, where,   in   Mr. Knight's opinion, generates the small
                                                  it
portion of  wood and bark described   by     Hales and Du Hamel.
    Our author concludes his paper      by stating, thathe  hasin  his pos
sessiona   piece ofa   fir-tree, from which portion
                                             a         of bark, extending
round its whole stem, had been taken off several years before the
tree was felled. And     he   has ascertained that the specific gravity  of
the wood above the decorticated space        is 0.590, that below   it only
0.491; and having steeped pieces     of   each  part, weighing  100 grains,

                                                       239
in water during               twelve hours,
                                 he found that the latter had absorbed
69 grains, the former only 51.      Hence he thinks considerable ad
vantage may be expected from stripping off a portion of the bark
from resinous trees, all round their trunks, close to the surface of the
ground, in the beginning of the summer preceding the autumn in
which they are to be felled.    He even thinks it probable, that the
timber would be improved by letting them stand a second year;                                                 al
though he admits that some loss would be sustained by the slow
growth of the trees in the second summer.
   It may, Mr. Knight says, be suspected, that the increased solidity
of the fir-wood above described was confined to the part contiguous
to the decorticated space; but it is well known that taking off a
portion of bark round the branch of a fruit-tree, occasions in the
succeeding season an increased quantity of blossoms on every part
of that branch. This increase probably owes        existence      stag       its                   to
                                                                                                    a

greater in any case than in that of copied numbers.        It is conse

tables, or for examining those we already have ; and it is particularly
useful to contrive methods by which any part of a table may be ve
rified, independently of the rest; for by examining parts taken at
random, we may, in some cases, acquire a moral certainty respecting
the accuracy of the whole.                -
    Among the various methods of computing logarithms, none, our
author says, possesses the advantage of forming them with tolerable
ease, independently of each other, by means of a few easy bases.
This desideratum, he trusts, the method described by him will supply;

     The object          of      Mr. Robertson, who resided                         in    Jamaica,        as

Surveyor            of   Land, upwards                  of     twenty years,              is   to   show that          no

    alteration has, for a considerable period, taken place there in the va
    riation of the compass. In that island all grants of land have a dia
    gram thereof annexed to the patent, which diagram is delineated
    from an actual survey of the land to be granted, and has a meridional
    line, according to the magnetical needle, laid down upon it; but no
    notice is taken of the true meridian. The boundary lines are marked
    upon the land; and in all disputes where the keeping up of these
    lines has been neglected, surveyors are appointed to make actual re
    surveys, which are compared with those preserved in the secretary
    of the island's office; and it is expected that the lines and meridians
    of the former will coincide with those of the latter. It is evident,
    however, that this coincidence could not happen if any alteration in
    the variation had taken place in the interval between the two sur
    veys. Mr. Robertson's business, as a surveyor, having been very ex
    tensive, he has had many opportunities of investigating the fact here
    treated of; and it appears from his observations, that the courses of
    the lines and meridians delineated on diagrams annexed to patents
    granted so long ago as the year 1660, coincide with, and are parallel
    to, the lines and meridians delineated on the re-surveys annexed to
    deeds, &c., or on the new diagrams, from recent surveys made by
    means of the magnetical needle, consequently no variation of the
    needle could have taken place, in Jamaica, during the above period
    of time.
       Our author subjoins to his paper a short history of the practice of
    surveying in Jamaica, from the Restoration to the present time, in
    order to obviate any doubt whether the quantity of the magnetical
s   variation was not ascertained and allowed for in the first diagrams
    annexed to patents; and whether the present variation of 6% degrees
    east, might not then have agreed with the true meridian.           He re
    marks, that until the year 1700, when Dr. Halley published his
    theory of the variation of the compass, no observations to ascertain
    the quantity of the variation in the West Indies had (so far as he
    knows) been published; and the variation at Jamaica, as laid down
    by Dr. Halley, appears to have been the same as it is at present. Be
    sides, had the first surveyors allowed for the variation, in delineating
    their diagrams, they would not have omitted to mention it; and the
    same system of surveying would have been continued, since a dif
    ference of 6#2 would have so totally deranged       allboundaries,no as
                                                                              to
    have demanded legislative interference and correction.       But      in
    stance of this kind has occurred.
         Inthe maps     ofthe island made     bythe direction  of Sir Henry
    Moore, Governor (about the year 1760), the magnetic meridian only
    is represented, although that gentleman was considered     a   great sur
    veyor.    In short, the true meridian, our author says, has never been
    noticed, nor the quantity      variation ascertained, nor the latitude
                                  of                                          or
    longitude observed,      by
                              any surveyor    orengineer  in Jamaica except
    himself. He has ascertained the variation           be
                                                    64° east, and has

   The camel, on which Mr. Home's observations were made, was a
female, twenty-eight years old, and was brought from Arabia.                     It
drank regularly, every second day, six gallons of water, sometimes
seven and a half; but would not drink in the intervening period. It
daily consumed a peck of oats, one of chaff, and one third of a truss
of hay. It was killed on the first of April last, by thrusting a double
edged poniard between the skull and the first vertebra of the neck;
it had a few hours before drank three gallons of water.
   A very particular account of the animal's various stomachs, and of
those of the bullock, together with the mode in which the food suc
cessively passes into them, is now given.               From these (which our
limits necessarily oblige us to omit,) it appears, that in the bullock
there are three stomachs for the preparation of the food, and one for
 its digestion; whereas,          the camel, there
                                               in         one stomach that an      is

   It  appears, from our author's examination, that the camel, when                                                   it
drinks, conducts the water              pure state into the second stomach;

  Table 2. contains the mean monthly variation for the times of the
day stated in Table 1, during the above-mentioned period of sixteen
months.
   Table 3. contains the mean monthly true variation, and mean
monthly diurnal alteration of variation during the above period; and
also the mean monthly true variation, and mean monthly diurnal
alteration of variation, for many months in each year, from 1786 to
1805 inclusive.
   Table 4. contains the differences for twelve years (viz. from 1793
to 1805) between the observations made at the times of the vernal
and autumnal equinoxes, and summer and winter solstices.        From a
mean of these, the variation appears to increase, or go westward,
from the winter solstice to the vernal equinox 0'.80; and diminishes,
or goes eastward, from the vernal equinox to the summer solsticel"43;
it increases again, from the summer solstice to the autumnal equinox
2'43; and continues nearly the same, only decreasing 0"14 from
the said equinox to the winter solstice.
   Table 5. contains the dip of the magnetic needle from the year
 1786 to 1805. During the first sixteen months the dip was observed
as frequently as the variation; but as there did not appear to be any
diurnal alteration in the dip, it has been thought sufficient to insert
the mean for each month.      From a comparison of Mr. Gilpin's ob
servations in 1805 with those made by Mr. Cavendish in the year
1775, it appears that      mean annual decrease has been 4":3; and
                                       its
                                                                                             on
its progressive annual decrease,     the above period, has been,

     Respecting the atmosphere                        of    Saturn, Dr. Herschel observes, that

the brightness remaining on the north polar regions is not uniform,
but is tinged with large dusky spaces, of a cloudy atmospheric ap
pearance.      From which, and the fore-mentioned changes of colour
at the  polar  regions, added to the changes he has formerly observed
in the  belts,  we have, he thinks, sufficient reason to infer the exist
ence of a Saturnian atmosphere.
The Bakerian Lecture, on some chemical Agencies of Electricity.        By
   Humphry Davy, Esq. F.R.S. M.R.I.A. Read November 20, 1806.
    [Phil. Trans. 1807, p. 1.]
   The chemical effects produced by electricity have, Mr. Davy says,
long been objects of attention; but the novelty of the phenomena,
their want of analogy to known facts, and the apparent discordance
of some of the results, involved the inquiry in obscurity.
    It was very early observed, that acid and alkaline matter appeared
in water acted upon by a current of electricity; but Mr. Davy soon
found that the muriatic acid came from the animal or vegetable mat
ters employed to connect the two portions of water; for when the
same cotton was repeatedly used, it ceased to be evolved. The soda,
in like manner, was found to proceed from the corrosion of the glass
tube, as it did not appear in water electrified in an agate cup.
    To be more certain of this effect, some distilled water was elec
trified in two agate cups, by the current from 150 four-inch plates,
the communication between the cups being formed by moistened
amianthus. In the first experiment soda was produced in the nega
tive cup, but the quantity was much less than when glass tubes were
 used; and on repeating the experiment, its quantity decreased, so
 that in the fourth experiment the presence of soda was scarcely per
 ceptible in the residual water. The water in the other tube was sour,
 and appeared to contain nitrous acid, with excess of nitrous gas. As
 similar effects were produced by electrifying water in small gold
 cones, Mr. Davy suspected that some minute portion of saline matter
 had been carried over during the distillation of the water; notwith
 standing it did not affect nitrate of silver, or muriate of barytes. And
 on evaporating a quantity of it in a silver vessel by a heat not ex
 ceeding 140°Fahrenheit, a small residuum was actually left, which
 appeared to be a mixture of nitrate of soda with nitrate of lead.      A
 portion of this residuum being added to water electrified in the usual
 manner, and which had attained the maximum of its effect upon tur
 meric paper, considerably increased those effects.
    Water slowly distilled, being electrified either in gold cones or
 agate cups, did not evolve any fixed alkaline matter, though it ex
 hibited signs of ammonia; but in tubes of wax, both soda and potash
 were evolved, and the acid matter in the positive cup was a mixture
 of sulphuric and muriatic acids. In a tube of resin the alkali was
 principally potash. In cups of Carrara marble, primitive marble from
 Donegal, argillaceous schist from Cornwall, serpentine from the Lizard,
 and grauwacke from North Wales, soda was uniformly evolved.

                                                        248
This probably arose from a minute portion of common salt being
contained in them, for the Carrara marble yielded a sensible quan
tity on analysis; and on repeating the electrifying of the water in
the cup formed of                 it,
                         the presence      soda became less visible every
                                                             of
time, and      length disappeared entirely; but the production
                  at                                                    lime                                 of

The longer the operation was continued, the more acid was produced,
arising from the air which continued                              to     be
                                                 absorbed. Volatile alkali
was also constantly formed, from the combination           the nascent hy                 of
drogen with the nitrogen; but           soon attained its utmost limit,
                                                       it                                                              as
hydrogen during its solution        water seems   inexpel nitrogen. When       to
water was electrified       vacuo scarcely any nitrous acid, and
                                        in                                vo                                      no
latile alkali, was formed.      When electrified        receiver filled with    in   a
hydrogen (the common air originally contained       the water having                     in
been extracted    the air    by
                          pump), neither nitrous acid nor volatile al
kali was found in the water.
     Inall these processes, the acid matter collected           the water round           in
the point transmitting the electricity, and the alkaline matter round
that which received                it.
                              When water was even electrified           two cups                    in

   Mr. Davy attempted            ascertain whether the weight

Water was electrified negatively for four days, by current from 150                      a

                a

                                  249
cups, and electrified, the decomposition was more rapid. A solution
of sulphate of potash being put into each of the cups, and electrified
by means of fifty pair of plates for four hours, the acid was found by
itself in the positive cup, and the alkaline bases in the negative cup.
Similar phenomena took place with sulphate of soda, nitrate of pot
ash, nitrate of barytes, sulphate of ammonia, and alum.     When mu
riatic salts were used, these yielded oxymuriatic acid. When com
patible mixtures of neutro-saline compounds were used, the different
acids and bases separated in a mixed state, without any regard to
their affinities. When solutions of metals, deoxidizable by nascent
hydrogen were employed, metallic crystals formed on the negative
wire, and some oxide was deposited; but solutions of iron, zinc, and
tin, only deposited oxide; a great excess of acid was soon observed
on the positive side. Although stronger solutions afforded signs of
decomposition quicker than weaker ones, yet even the smallest pro
portions seemed to be acted upon with equal energy: as papertinged
with turmeric was immediately rendered brown when plunged into
pure water and brought into contact with the negative point; so
paper tinged with litmus was immediately reddened by the positive
point, in consequence of the very minute portion of saline matter
contained in the paper; and it further appeared, that in all these
decompositions the separation of the constituent parts from the last
portions of the compounds was complete when the operation was
 sufficiently protracted.                         -
   The contact of the solution with the wires was not necessary for
its decomposition; for muriate of potash being put into the middle
tube of a series of three, the outer ones containing only water and
 the wires, alkali soon appeared in that connected with the negative
 wire, and acid in the other; and at length they were obtained per
 fectly separate.
    In thus causing the acids to be thus transferred from a saline com
 pound into water, through moistened amianthus, no change was ob
 served to take place in litmus paper placed near the amianthus. The
 reddening of the litmus paper always took place just above the posi
tive point, and then slowly diffused itself to the middle of the vessel.
Similar effects were observed when the alkali was transferred, the
turmeric paper first becoming brown close to the negative wire.
   When three glass tubes were used, the two outer tubes holding a
solution of muriate of soda, and the middle one sulphate of silver, a
communication being made with the central vessel by turmeric paper
on the positive side, and by litmus paper on the negative, neither of
the papers had  its  colour changed, although the muriatic acid passing
through the amianthus occasioned       a dense heavy precipitate     inthe
sulphate  of silver, and the sodaa  more diffuse and lighter one.
    Acid or alkaline substances will also pass through liquids, having
a  strong attraction for them.    In   anapparatus  of three tubes, Mr.
Davy found that sulphuric acid, evolved from sulphate          of potash,
would pass into water, through either ammonia, lime-water,          or
                                                                    weak
solutions  of potash  or    soda. The
                           of           only effectofstrong  solutions    of

potash or soda was to increase the time necessary for this transfer.
Muriatic or nitric acids were also transmitted through alkaline solu
tions; and, vice versd, alkaline matter, by changing the arrangement
of the liquids, was transmissible through the acids: even magnesia
was transferred like the other bases. But when it was attempted to
pass sulphuric acid through aqueous solutions of barytes or of stron
tian, on the contrary, the sulphate of those earths was deposited in
the intermediate tube.
   Muriate of barytes being positive, sulphate of potash intermediate,
and water negative, potash appeared in the water, and sulphate of
barytes was deposited in the intermediate vessel.
   Muriate of barytes being negative, sulphate of silver intermediate,
and water positive, sulphuric acid only appeared in the water, and
muriate of silver was deposited in the intermediate vessel.
   Mr. Davy then proceeds to develop the theory of these pheno
mena: and he first considers the mode of decomposition and transi
tion. Hydrogen, alkaline substances, and metallic oxides, are at
tracted by negatively electrified metallic substances, and repelled by
positive ones: contrary effects take place with oxygen and the acids.
He thinks these electric energies are communicated from one particle
to another of the same kind, so as to establish a conducting chain in
the fluid, as acid matter is always found in the alkaline solutions
through which it is transferred, as long as any acid matter remains
at the original source.    It is possible that there may be, in some
cases, a succession of decompositions and recompositions; but the
process is not absolutely necessary, as pure acids and alkalies pass
through water to the points by which they are attracted. It appears
that this power of transference is overcome by gravity in attempting
to pass barytes through sulphuric acid, or muriatic acid through sul
phate of silver.   To these instances he adds, that magnesia and the
metallic oxides will not pass through an intermediate vessel of water,
but sink to the bottom.
   In the decomposition of water, a particle of oxygen is attracted by
the positive point, and at the same time a particle of hydrogen is re
pelled by           it;
               the opposite process takes place     the negative point:
                                                                    a at
and in the middle               of
                      the circuit there must be    new combination of
the repelled matter,             in
                          the same manner                      as
                                                when two portions                        of
muriate      soda are separated by water; muriatic
                of                                        repelled from
the negative side, and soda from the positive side;        that muriate     so is
of      soda   is   composed     in   the middle vessel.

    Itwas known that many bodies brought into contact and then se
parated, exhibited opposite states      electricity; and Mr. Davy him
                                                  of

ployed   in alternation with plates of a single metal, the alkaline solu
tion received the electricity from the metal, and the acid transmitted
it to the metal. So in the simplest case of electrical action, the alkali,
receiving electricity from the metal, would, on being separated from
it, appear positive, and    course      repelled
                                             of       positively electrified

surfaces, and attracted by negatively electrified surfaces; the acid,
acquiring the contrary electricity, following the contrary order.
   Several phenomena accord with this idea. Sulphur separated from
its contact with                positive; and,      like manner, sulphur
                     metal                                                        is in

composed      three substances, all positive, are
                 of                                     very active     vol               so                      in

    Mr. Davy then     considers the relation between the electrical energy
of  bodies and their chemical affinities; and observes, that all the sub

confined to the freedom of motion it gives to the particles, but to the
exaltation of the electrical energies of bodies, such as is well known
to take place in glass, tourmalin, and sulphur. The electricity of an
insulated plate of copper, and a plate of sulphur, was scarcely sen
sible at 56° Fahr. to the condensing electrometer; at 100° they
affected the gold leaves without condensation; they increased in a
still higher ratio as the sulphur approached its melting point; and at
a little above that point, the two substances rapidly combine, and
evolve heat and light. In general, when the different electrical ener
gies are equally strong, the combination seems to be vivid, the heat
and light intense, and the new compound is in a neutral state, as in
combustion, and the union of the strong acids with the alkalies; but
when only the energy is strong, the effect is less vivid, and the com
pound exhibits the excess of the stronger energy.
   Mr. Davy then considers the theory of the Voltaic apparatus; and
remarks, that the above facts seem to reconcile Volta's own theory
with the chemical theory of galvanism.
   In a pile of zinc, copper, and water, the plates are in opposite
states of electricity; and in regard to such low electricity, the water
is an insulating body.     Of course, each plate produces an opposite
electricity upon the opposite plate, the intensity increasing with the
number, and the quantity with the extent of the series.      Upon con
necting the extreme points, the opposite electricities tend to produce
an equilibrium, which would cause the motion to cease : but the
fluid medium being composed of two elements possessing opposite
electrical energies, the oxygen is attracted by the zinc, and the hy
drogen by the copper.      Hence the balance of power is only momen
tary; for oxide of zinc is formed, and hydrogen is disengaged. The
electricity acquired by the copper is communicated anew to the zinc,
and the process continues as long as the chemical changes are carried
OIl.
   Neither the conducting nor solvent powers of the fluid mediums
are a principal cause of their activity; for strong sulphuric acid has
very little activity in the pile. The effect of neutro-saline solutions
diminishes when troughs are used, according as their acid arranges
itself on the side of the zinc plates, and their alkali on the other;
but the energy may be restored by agitating the fluids in the
cells.
   As sensible heat appears when an equilibrium is produced by small
metallic surfaces in the voltaic battery, the opposite states being
exalted, so if the decomposition of the chemical agents be essential
to the balance of the opposed electricities, the decomposition of the
saline solutions ought to be attended with an increase of temperature.
To water electrified in the gold cones by the power of 100 plates, a    !
drop of solution of potash was added in the positive cone: potash       §
immediately passed over, and in less than two minutes the water was
in a state of ebullition. When solution of nitrate of ammonia was
employed, the water was evaporated in three or four minutes with a
kind of explosive noise, and inflammation took place. The pure alka

                                     253
lies, or acids, produced very little effect, although they are better con
 ductors.
    Lastly, some general applications of these singular facts are pointed
out by Mr. Davy; such, for instance, as the application of electricity
to the analysis of animal and vegetable substances.         Muscular fibre
 being electrified for some time, became dry and hard; and it left,
upon incineration, no saline matter.         Potash, soda, ammonia, lime,
 and oxide of   iron, were collected on the negative side; and the sul
phuric, nitric, muriatic, phosphoric, and acetous acids, on the posi
 tive. Laurel-leaf was rendered brown and parched; green colouring
 matter, with resin, alkali, and lime, appeared in the negative vessel,
 and prussic acid in the positive.
    By using charcoal and plumbago, or charcoal and iron, as the ex
 citing powers, along with neutro-saline solutions, large quantities of
 acids and alkalies might be procured with little trouble or expense.
    It is very probable that many mineral formations have been mate
 rially influenced or even occasioned by the agency of the electricity;
 and the electrical power of transference may thus be applied to the
 explanation of the principal points in geology.
 On the Precession of the Equinoxes. By the Rev. Abram Robertson,
    M.A. F.R.S. Savilian Professor of Geometry in the University of
     Oxford. Read December 18, 1806. [Phil. Trans. 1807, p. 57.]
    The Professor observes, that Sir Isaac Newton was the first ma
 thematician who endeavoured to estimate the quantity of the pre
 cession from the attractive influence of the sun and moon on the
 spheroidal figure of the earth.       His investigations relating to this
 subject evince the same transcendent abilities that are displayed in
 other parts of his Principia; but it is admitted, that, from a mistake
 in his process, his conclusion is erroneous.
     The investigations of other mathematicians in attempting the solu
 tion of the same problem are arranged by the author under three
 general heads. The first arrive at wrong conclusions, in consequence
 of mistake in some part of their proceedings; the second obtain just
 conclusions, but rendered so by balance of opposite errors; the third
 approach as near the truth as the nature of the subject will admit,
 but, in the author's estimation, are liable to the charge of obscurity
 and perplexity.
     The defects in all their investigations Professor Robertson ascribes
 to the same causethe uncultivated state of the doctrine of com
 pound rotatory motion.
     The author's endeavours are, consequently, first directed to the
 investigation of the principles of compound rotatory motion from
 principles which he considers clear and unexceptionable.
     He next proceeds to calculate the disturbing solar force on the
 spheroidal figure of the earth, and thence the angular velocity which

An Account of two Children born with Cataracts in their Eyes, to show

  Trans. 1807, p. 83.]
  The design of the present communication       is to explain a disagree
ment between the results of former   experiments    on this subject; since
a very intelligent boy, thirteen years   of  age,  couched by Mr. Che
selden in 1728,  was unable,   upon  receiving  his sight, to distinguish
the outline of any object placed  before  him,  and thought that every
thing before him touched his eye; but the cases communicated to this
Society by Mr. Ware in 1801 lead to a different conclusion.
   The subjects of Mr. Home's experiments were not equally sensible
of light previous to the operation of couching, and consequently were
not similarly affected by objects presented to them after receiving
their sight.
   The first was a lad twelve years of age, with cataracts in both
eyes, that appeared to have existed from the time of his birth, as it
had been noticed from his earliest infancy that his eyes rolled about
in an unusual manner, and were not directed to objects before him,
nor were his hands ever stretched out to catch at anything; but it
was not till the child was six months old that his mother examined
his eyes with attention, and observed cataracts as distinct as when
he was brought to Mr. Home.
   Previous to the operation, this boy could distinguish light from
darkness, and the light of the sun from that of a candle, saying, it
was redder and more pleasant to look at ; but lightning made a still
stronger impression.      He was accustomed to call          all
                                                            light red.     He
had some   conception      size,
                             of  and said the sun was the size        his hat,
                                                                        of
and that the flame       the candle was larger than his finger, but less
                        of
than his arm. He directed both his eyes             onceat    these objects;
                                                              to
and when      candle was nearer than twelve inches he said           touched
                                                                        it

   The operation   of extracting the crystalline lens was first performed
on the left eye;   but   asthe cataract was      this instance found
                                                   in                         to   be
fluid, and the inflammation which followed was considerable, the
operation    ofcouching was preferred          for the right eye, and was
                                              to
                                               it
performed after    an interval    eight
                                  of     weeks.
                                                                        its
                                                   of so
   After the first operation, the eye was         imperfect        inpowers,
the pupil    socontracted, and the surface        the cornea       irregular,
                                                                    so
that   he could not discern any object distinctly, but imagined that

                                                    255
 everything presented to him touched his eye, and still continued to
 call every object red.
    After couching, the inflammation which followed was not so con
 siderable as in the former case; but this cataract was also fluid, and,
 from its diffusion through the aqueous humour, occasioned a tempo
 rary opacity, which concealed for a time an opacity of the capsule,
which rendered the sight permanently imperfect.
     It was not till the end of four weeks from the second operation that
 the sight was again examined, when it was found that he had ac
quired some knowledge of colours and of the distances of objects,
which no longer appeared to touch his eye; but he could not be said
to have acquired any discernment of figure.
    The second opportunity which Mr. Home had of making similar
experiments was in a boy of seven years of age, who had been blind
from his birth by cataracts in both eyes.                  His blindness, however,
was not so complete as in the preceding case: his pupil contracted
considerably when a lighted candle was placed before                     and     day      it,       by
light he could distinguish many colours with tolerable accuracy, par
ticularly the more vivid ones. The operation                    couching was again
                                                                               of
preferred       in this  case,  with the    hope      avoiding   of
                                                                  inflammation.                           It
gave very little pain, and was attended with the desired success.
    As it   was hoped that the eye would                but little disturbed by the
                                                                   be

                                                      said that this was blue, and

pieces        card were placed before him,                         he

their shape. These being objects which he had not been accustomed
even to feel, he was still learning them as a child learns to read: he
could distinguish the angles, and could count their number in suc
cession; but at the expiration of the third week, he could tell these
forms nearly as readily as their colour.
   The inferences which Mr. Home draws from these, are, that when
the eye, before the cataract is removed, has only been capable of
discerning light, without any power of distinguishing colours, then
objects, after             its
                  removal, appear      touch the eye, and there
                                                              to                                                      is   no
knowledge       their outline,
                       of      agreeably    the observations made by       to
Mr. Cheselden. But when the         eye  has previously been able                                                          to
distinguish colours,    has then also some knowledge
                                    it                      distances,                                of
though not     outline, but will soon attain this also,

Mr. Ware's cases.
     Inpractical view, these cases confirm what has been laid down
       a
by Mr. Pott and by Mr. Ware, with regard          cataracts,     being                to                    in

to the most simple for digesting vegetable food, so those of the bul
lock, camel, and whale, are links from the ruminating to the most
simple stomachs for digesting animal food; and the camel's stomach
is the most important link in each series, the contraction peculiar to
its fourth cavity making it intermediate between the bullock and the
whale.
    Although the above facts appear to throw some light on the di
 gestion of different kinds of food, they also present difficulties which
 must remain to be explained when further progress has been made
 in the investigation. It is in general admitted, that animal substances
 do not require so long a process to convert them into chyle as vege
 tables; and hence the stomachs of carnivorous animals are in general
 most simple: but why the whale tribe, which live on fish that are
 very readily converted into chyle, should have a more complex sto
 mach, it is not easy to explain. What further uses, in regard to
 other secretions, these preparatory stomachs may have, are foreign
 to the design of the present paper, which Mr. Home considers as a
 continuation of a series of observations on digestion, and hopes to
 extend further at some future opportunity.
On the Formation of the Bark of Trees. Ina Letter from ThomasAndrew
  Knight, Esq. F.R.S. to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, K.B.
  P.R.S. &c. Read February 19, 1807. [Phil. Trans. 1807, p. 103.]
   An extraordinary diversity of opinion having prevailed amongst
naturalists most capable of correct observation, respecting the pro
duction and subsequent state of the bark of trees, Mr. Knight has
undertaken to investigate the subject: but such are the difficulties
of the subject, that, in a course of experiment which has occupied
more than twenty years, he has scarcely felt himself prepared, till
the present time, even to give an opinion of the manner in which
the cortical substance is either generated in the ordinary course of
its growth, or re-produced when that which previously existed has
been taken off.                                                     -
   Du Hamel had shown, that the bark of some species of trees is
readily re-produced when the decorticated alburnum is secluded
from the air. Mr. Knight has repeated these experiments on the
apple, the sycamore, and some other trees, with the same result;
and has also observed, that the wych-elm, in moist and shady situa
tions, will frequently re-produce   its
                                   bark when            no
                                                 covering whatever
                                                                             -
has been applied.
  A   glairy fluid (as Du Hamel justly observes) exudes from the sur
face  of the alburnum, which appears      change into
                                           to             pulpous

ganized mass, and subsequently becomes organized and cellular,
facts which are extremely favourable       the opinion
                                           to              Hales, that
                                                             of
the bark   isderived from the substance of the alburnum.    But other
 facts may      be
                adduced which lead       contrary conclusion; since
                                          to   a
 the internal surface  of
                        pieces    bark, when detached from contact
                                 of
 with the alburnum, but remaining united           to

ends, will much more readily generate a new bark than the alburnum
does under similar circumstances.     A similar fluid exudes, and the
same  phenomena   are observable,  in both cases.    The cellular sub
stance, however, which is thus generated is for some time very im
perfectly organized, since the vessels which carry the true sap are at
first wanting; but Mr. Knight has been enabled to trace their pro
gress, and, by appropriate management, to direct the course of their
growth laterally or downwards with a greater or less degree of                                               in
clination; but observes, that their natural tendency is perpendicu
larly downwards, and that they cannot be made to extend them
selves upwards excepting to a very short distance.
   Mr. Knight having thus satisfied himself that both the alburnum
and the bark of trees are capable of generating new bark, or at least
of transmitting a fluid to which the bark owes     existence, his at              its
tention was next directed to discover the sources from which this
fluid   derived.

   The medulla in this case appeared to be wholly inactive.
   By an examination of buds which had been inserted in a preceding
summer, or attached by grafting in the spring, it appeared that ves
sels diverged from them into the bark of the stock.
   It seems therefore probable, that a pulpous organizable mass first
derives its matter from the bark or alburnum, and that this matter
subsequently forms the new layer of bark; for if the vessels had pro
ceeded as radicles (according to Darwin's supposition,) from the
inserted buds or grafts, such vessels would be different from the
natural vessels of the stock; neither is it probable that vessels could
extend, by actual addition to their extremities in the course of a few
days, from the leaves to the roots.    Mr. Knight is consequently    in
clined to believe that the matter itself which composes the new bark
acquires an organization of vessels calculated to carry the true sap ;
but whether, in the ordinary growth of trees, this matter be derived
from the bark or the alburnum, or from both, it will be extremely
difficult to determine.   This, however, is certain, that bark in many
cases exists previous to the existence of alburnum; but there seems
to be no case, in the ordinary growth of vegetables, in which albur
num exists previous to the formation of bark.

   In this paper the author relates briefly some observations which
he formerly made on the progressive changes of these rings, which
appear to him to lead to a satisfactory explanation of their origin.
   In the first place he observed, that some species of fungi were
always to be found at the exterior margin of the dark ring of grass
if examined at the proper season. This position of the fungi led him
to conjecture that progressive increase from a central point was the
probable mode of formation of the ring ; and he thought it likely
that the soil which had once contributed to the support of fungi,
might be so exhausted as to be rendered incapable of producing a
second crop.     The defect of nutriment on one side would occasion
the new roots to extend themselves solely in the opposite direction,
and would cause the circle of fungi continually to proceed, by annual
enlargement, from the centre outwards. The luxuriance of the grass
follows as a natural consequence, as the soil of an interior circle is
enriched by the decayed roots of fungi of the succeeding year's growth.
Such a progressive enlargement, he remarks, had already been ob
served by Dr. Hutton on the hill of Arthur's Seat near Edinburgh;
but Dr. Hutton had not attended to the production of fungi.

                                                           261
   Dr. Withering, on the contrary, remarked the connexion of the
rings with fungi, but had not noticed their progressive enlargement.
   During the growth of fungi, the author observes, they so entirely
absorb      all
           nutriment from the soil beneath, that the herbage     often                                   is
for while destroyed, and ring appears bare
     a                                           a grass, surrounding            of
the dark ring; but after the fungi have ceased         appear, the soil               to
where they had grown becomes darker, and the grass soon vegetates
again with peculiar vigour.
    For the purpose       observing the progress
                                   of                     various circles,      of                             he

growth;Agaricus campestris, Ag. orcades, Ag. procerus, Ag. ter
reus, and the Lycoperdon bovista.
   The author has had many opportunities              remarking, that when of
two circles interfere with each other's        progress,   they     not cross                      do
each  other, but are invariably   obliterated between the points          con                            of
tact. The exhaustion occasioned                                 by
                                            each obstructs the progress                                        of
the other, and both are starved          circumstance which he considers

  For ascertaining correctly the form of any stomach, it was found
that   it should not be distended at the time of the animal's death;
that it should be examined as early as may be after death; and that
its form is best shown by gently distending it with air.

fourth stomach. The glands, from which this fluid is secreted, are
very distinctly seen in the upper portion of the stomach of the deer;
and in the lower portion are other glands, which secrete a fluid, to
complete the process of digestion by forming chyle.
   In the porpoise and whale tribe the two processes of solution and
chylification are completely separate, as there can be no doubt of the
food being dissolved before it arrives at the third stomach; since the
opening leading into that cavity is too small to admit anything but
fluids to pass, and the analogy between the second and third cavities
of the whale, with the two portions of the fourth of ruminants,   -   is
very great.
   In the cod there are only two cavities, one for solution, with a
structure that bears a strong resemblance to that of the second ca
vity of the porpoise, and having orifices similar to those in the pli
cated portion of the stomach of the deer. Beyond this first cavity in
the cod, the food cannot pass till it is broken down; so that the
analogy between the fish and the porpoise is very strong: in both
one and the other, solution is a step previous to the formation of
chyle, which is performed by secretions from glands of a different
structure, and applied to the food in a different cavity. And in this,
the bird, the fish, and the whale tribe,     agree.                 all

plain, concave, or convex. These were placed before a window, in
such a position that the light fell upon the lens at about 30° from
the perpendicular, and was received by the eye, at an equal eleva

   He next examines which are the reflecting surfaces, by means of
certain scratches, and other defects.
   In the 25th and 26th section he finds, by means of similar defects,
that the surfaces in contact are alone concerned in the formation of
rings; and in the 24th and 28th section he discovers, by various                                              ir
regular surfaces which he employs, as 1st and 4th surfaces of two
glasses in contact, that these are not concerned in the production of
rings. And in the 27th section he observes, that the colour of the
under glass does not affect the primary set of rings. .
   The results of the foregoing experiments are,
    I. That only two of the surfaces are essential to the formation of
concentric rings.
    II. That these two must be of a certain regular construction, so as
 to form a central contact.
   III.    That rays, from one side or the other, must pass through one
of the surfaces at or near the point of contact to the other surface,
and be reflected from it.
   And IV. That in      these cases  allset    rings will

 On the Economy of Bees. In a Letter from Thomas Andrew Knight,

   During the progress of the various experiments on vegetation, of
which Mr. Knight has communicated accounts to the Society, he
has had opportunities of paying considerable attention to the economy
of bees, and has observed many interesting circumstances, that ap
pear to have been overlooked by former writers.
   A general opinion prevails that every hive remains at           times                          all
unconnected with other colonies         the neighbourhood, and that

    Having observed several bees flying one evening                   later hour       at   a

termined     upon,  they remove    immediately,    and return only during the

    Mr. Knight has also remarked the manner           which colonies         in                                 of

                                     upon their future habitation.     He
has frequently noticed      examinationan                     of
                                             certain hollow trees    take                             to
place for many days together by detachments           bees, from twenty      of
to fifty    in
           number.     This examination was not confined        the mere                    to

   Their scouts must   apparently  have some means        communicating           of

   Mr. Knight has observed, that          this case also colonies will some
                                                      in

a  cavity,     which another swarm had previous possession, without
              of
opposition. He infers, therefore, that some preceding intercourse
must have taken place between the two swarms, although anything

Observations and Measurements of the Planet Vesta. By John Jerome
 Schroeter, F.R.S. Read May 28, 1807. [Phil. Trans. 1807, p.245.]
   The observations contained in Mr. Schroeter's communication,
comprise those of Dr. Olbers, made at Bremen, from the 29th of
March to the 6th of May, and those of Mr. Bessel at Lilienthal,
from the 1st of April to the 11th of May; from which it appears that
this planet, now called Vesta, became stationary between the 8th
and 11th of May, and is now progressive.
   Mr. Schroeter endeavoured also to ascertain her magnitude; with
magnifying powers of 150 and 300 applied to a 15-feet reflector she
seemed equal to a star of the 6th magnitude, but without any ap
pearance of a disc.    Mr. Schroeter, and his assistant, both saw - the
planet at that time with the naked eye.
   As they had formerly observed Ceres, Pallas, and Juno, with a
13-feet reflector, and with eye-glasses magnifying 136 and 288 times,
they now examined Vesta with the same telescope and the same
powers, and found her appearance to be exactly the same, her appa
rent diameter not exceeding                    ºths
                                       of a second, which Mr. Schroeter
says is only one half the apparent diameter of the 4th satellite of
Saturn. Mr. Schroeter considers the intensity and unsteadiness of
its light, together with                 its
                                                                                 of as
                             extraordinary smallness,      very remark
able for body which, according
            a                          the calculationsto  Dr. Gauss,                           is
in  the same region between Mars and Jupiter,           which the three     in
other lately discovered planets perform their revolutions round the
Sun.

                                                                   a

accelerated         by
                heat fallacious   their results, Mr. Davy proposed the

                                    in or
solutions    sulphate,
               of         muriate   iron impregnated  with nitrous gas,

 as     sufficiently sudden                 their action, and more uniformly free from
contamination               by   other gases.

                                   271
   Much, however, in Mr. Pepys's estimation, remained to be done in
the mechanical part of the apparatus, and in the course of various
experiments on these subjects, that it might be rendered more com
modious in its application, and capable of giving correct results with
the utmost minuteness.
   The instruments which he proposes consist of two tubes, one larger
and one smaller, with a bottle of elastic gum to each, and a glass cy
linder, or cistern, of the same length as the tubes. The larger of the
tubes, containing one cubic inch, is the principal measure, and is di
vided into hundredths; the smaller is intended to measure fractional
parts; and in this each of the former divisions is divided into ten
parts, or thousandths of the cubic inch.
    One of the bottles of elastic gum has attached to it a tube, which
serves as a perforated stopper to the larger measure, through which
any liquid to be applied to the gas under examination may be for
cibly injected. When the full contraction has taken place, the mea
 sure is immersed in the cistern, filled with mercury or with water,
 according to circumstances, and the contraction noted.      But if the
 surface is found not to correspond with a division of the principal
 measure, the smaller tube, which slides through a cork in the bottom
 of the cistern, is to be passed up till its extremity (which is open)
 reaches the gas contained, and the fractional part is then withdrawn
 by means of its elastic bottle, and measured with the greatest pre
CISIOI1.
   Mr. Pepys next    proceeds to an account of various gases, of which
he tried the  purity by means of this apparatus, as nitrous gas, con
taining+++r of impurity, oxygen gas +4+; atmospheric air, of which
**,     were absorbed; carbonic gas, which left rºw,and sulphuretted
hydrogen rºw of impurity.
   In the analysis of compound gases also, he imagines it will be found
peculiarly useful.    He recommends using the solutions hot, which
facilitates chemical union, but prevents the absorption of carbonic
and other gases by the mere water of solution, which might other
wise take place.
   In order to avoid the expansion that would be occasioned by
handling the measure, Mr. Pepys employs a pair of forceps, having
circular extremities lined with cloth, for grasping the tube.
   The elastic gum, he observes, is so little acted upon by chemical
agents, that a great variety of them may be employed, and may with
                                                                      -
facility be used at any temperature.
 Observations on the Nature of the new celestial Body discovered by
   Dr. Olbers, and of the Comet which was expected to appear last
   January in    its
                 return from the Sun.      By
                                           William Herschel, LL.D.
   F.R.S. Read June      4,1807.   [Phil. Trans. 1807,   p.
                                                         260.]
   It was   onthe 24th   April that Dr. Herschel first saw the new
                        of
 planet Vesta; but though     he
                              saw her again      on
                                                the 25th,      he
                                                              could
 not determine which    of
                         several stars    he
                                         noted was the planet, for

                                   272
  want of sufficient motion at that time. He examined her at that time
  with a power of 460, but could not distinguish anything in her ap
  pearance different from surrounding stars of equal brightness.
     On the 21st of May, when he had learned her position more pre
 cisely from the Astronomer Royal, he observed her again with the
 same power, but could discern no appearance of a planetary disc.
     On the 22nd he perceived her to have moved since the preceding
 evening, and now examined her with increased powers of 460, 577,
 and 636, but could find no difference between the planet and a fixed
 star, the 463rd of Bode's Catalogue.
    Since Vesta thus bears to be examined by high magnifying powers
 without apparent enlargement of her disc, which is the test by which
 Dr. Herschel formerly determined the apparent discs of Ceres, Pal
 las, and Juno, to be spurious, he considers her as belonging to that
 formerly unknown species of celestial bodies which he has termed
 asteroids.
    May 24th.--Dr. Herschel compared Vesta with the Gregorian
 planet,   and found that with a power of 577 her apparent disc was
 about one ninth or one tenth as large; and with his 20-feet reflector,
 of 18; inches aperture, she had no surrounding atmosphere or nebu
 losity.
    Dr. Herschel's observations on the comet, which follow, were con
 fined to three days, January 27, January 31, and February 1. It was
 near the electrometer of the constellation, called by Bode Machina
 electrica.   Its coma was of an irregular round form, extending six-
 or seven minutes in diameter.
    Upon revising his observations of sixteen telescopic comets, Dr.
 Herschel remarks, that fourteen have been without any visible solid
 body in their centre, and that the other two had but an ill-defined
 small central light, which did not deserve the name of a disc.
 On the Quantity of Carbon in carbonic Acid, and on the Nature of the
    Diamond. By William Allen, Esq. F.L.S. and William Hasledine
    Pepys, Esq.     Communicated by Humphry Davy, Esq. Sec. R.S.
    M.R.I.A. Read June 18, 1807. [Phil. Trans. 1807, p. 267.]
    The experiments, which form the subject of the present communi
cation were undertaken, not only on account of the difference between
the estimates that have been made of the quantity of carbon in car
bonic acid, but because those of Guyton de Morveau, which are most
frequently preferred at this time in various systems of chemistry,
appeared liable to many objections, from the manner in which they
were conducted; while the original experiments of Lavoisier, on the
contrary, appear to have been performed with much accuracy, and
had moreover been confirmed by Mr. Tennant in his researches on
the nature of the diamond.
    The design of the authors was to consume certain known quanti
ties of diamond and of other carbonaceous substances in oxygen gas;
for which purpose it had been originally their intention to employ

                                                             273
the sun's rays, by means of a powerful lens; but, considering the
uncertainty of a favourable opportunity in this country, they resolved
to employ an apparatus consisting of two mercurial gas-holders, with
a tube of platina interposed between them in a horizontal position,
and passing through a small furnace, by which the tube and        con                                            its
tents might     heated be  any degree requisite for the combustion
                                           to                                                                           of
the substance employed.
   Into this tube the diamond         other variety      or
                                                        carbonaceous matter          of

                            in   a          platina; after which, by open

ing due communication with each gas-holder, the oxygen was made
     a

means    of  the eudiometer lately described        Mr. Pepys.                  by
   Having found that oxygen gas was liable, notwithstanding every
precaution,            to    be

was also ascertained before     every  experiment.   The solution employed
for this  purpose    was the solution       green   sulphate      iron, satu

                                           it                oxygen gas                                of

                                  274,
 weighed 33.82 grains, and that the same measure of carbonic acid
gas weighed 47-26 grains.
   In the first experiment, which they made upon the combustion of
charcoal, four grains of box-wood charcoal were employed, and it
was found that only ºth of a grain remained of a white ash. The
volume of gas employed appeared unaltered after the heat had sub
sided; but the combustion of 3.98 grains of charcoal had produced
 29:13 inches of carbonic acid gas, or 13-76 grains; so that according
to the experiment, 100 grains carbonic acid gas contains 28-92 char
coal. But by a computation founded on the quantity of oxygen con
sumed, it would appear that the quantity of charcoal is only 28-77
per cent.
   In their next experiment 2:49 grains of diamond, in small frag
ments, were consumed.       In this case, as in the former, the combus
tion caused no apparent increase or diminution of the quantity of
 gas; but there were found to be 18:20 inches of carbonic acid gas,
in which the diamond would appear to be contained in the proportion
of 28'95 per cent. But again, by estimation from the weight of
 18:20 inches of oxygen consumed, the proportion of diamond was
slightly different, being 28.81 per cent.
   In this experiment, the authors could perceive no appearance of
moisture or dullness on the surface of the quicksilver, or sides of the
glasses; and they observed that the diamond had left no discoloura
tion of the tray, and no residual ash.                                -
   In a second experiment eleven small diamonds, weighing 4:01
grains, were consumed; and they produced 13.91 grains of carbonic
acid gas, in the proportion of 28.82 parts diamond for each 100 of
gas.
   By a similar experiment upon stone-coal from Wales, such as is
employed by maltsters, the quantity of carbonic acid gas produced
was found to contain 28:20 per cent. of coal; but in this case the
proportion deduced from the quantity of oxygen consumed, rather
exceeded the estimate formed from the carbonic acid, instead of being
less, as in former experiments.
   Carbonic acid formed in the same manner from the combustion of
plumbago, contained 28°46 of carbonaceous matter, whether esti
mated from the gas produced, or from the oxygen gas consumed.
   From the average result of these five experiments, the authors con
clude that 100 parts of carbonic acid contain 28.6 of carbon, a quan
tity rather greater than appeared to Mr. Tennant, who did not find
it more than 27-8; but this difference may easily be accounted for,
by the different modes of operating.
   The authors conclude, that the estimate given by Lavoisier at 28,
which is between that of Mr. Tennant and their own, is very near
the truth.
   2ndly. That the diamond is pure carbon.                      -
   3rdly. That well burned charcoal contains no hydrogen, but soon
absorbs moisture from the air, which would occasion fallacious re
sults.

    4thly. That charcoal is not an oxide of carbon; since, when rightly
 prepared, it requires quite as much oxygen for          combustion                        its                                as

 fluid, but a formation    of small globules, having a bright metallic
 splendour and a perfect resemblance to quicksilver; but they tarnished
 rapidly at their surface, and were in general soon covered by a white
 film, but occasionally burned with explosion and a white flame.
    These globules were soon proved, by numerous experiments, to be
 a  peculiar inflammable principle, the basis of potash.
    The   platina used, as the medium, for communicating the electric
 power, was proved not to have contributed otherwise to the result
 than as a conductor; for by substituting other conductors, as copper,
silver, gold, plumbago, or charcoal, the same substance was formed
by means of them. Its formation was also independent of the pre
sence of air, as it took place equally under an exhausted receiver.
    Soda, when acted upon in the same manner, and under similar cir
cumstances, exhibited analogous results; but it required far greater
intensity of action, and could not be decomposed in pieces which
exceeded fifteen or twenty grains in weight.
    That the substances thus produced were evolved by the decom
position of the alkalies, was proved by careful examination of the
gas extricated from the upper surface, which was found to be pure
oxygen; and again proved synthetically, by ascertaining that they
absorbed oxygen gas, to which they were exposed, and that the com
pounds resulting were, in fact, the respective alkalies that had been
employed for their formation.
    The affinity of the base of potash for oxygen is such, that its me
tallic lustre very rapidly tarnishes in the atmosphere, by the forma
tion of a white crust, which, by attracting moisture, is soon converted
into a saturated solution of potash.
    With the base of soda the phenomena are perfectly analogous, but
less rapid; and when either of them is heated in oxygen gas, a rapid
combustion, with brilliant white flame, is produced.     Oxygen gas is
absorbed in this process, and nothing emitted to affect the purity of
the residual air.
    It appears, then, says Mr. Davy, that in these facts there is the
same evidence for the decomposition of potash and soda into oxygen
and their peculiar bases, and for their recomposition, that there is for
the decomposition and formation of any metallic oxide, or of the
sulphuric or phosphoric acids.
    In the analytic experiments no substances are present but the      al
kalies and a minute portion of water, which, in its common form,
seems in no other way essential to the result, than by rendering them
capable of becoming fluid, and conductors at a lower temperature
than that at which their combustible bases burn; for if the quantity
of water be increased, no such result is obtained.
    These bases seem to be repelled, as other combustible substances,
by positively electrified surfaces, and attracted by negative surfaces,
and hence are formed at that side in the electric circuit.
    The properties of these bodies are such, that in the first place it is
extremely difficult to preserve them, and to confine them for experi
ments; such is their affinity for oxygen, that they act on almost

and in the same manner, that 100 parts of soda contain   81 base and
19  oxygen.
   The other method consisted in collecting the hydrogen evolved
from water by a known quantity of each base, and estimating from
them the quantity of oxygen absorbed.     The mean of two such ex
periments on the base of potash, gave the proportion of 15% per cent.
oxygen, and the mean of three trials upon soda, showed it to contain
20 per cent. oxygen.
   So that the general average of both methods authorizes us to con
sider potash as containing 15 of oxygen, and soda 20 of oxygen, per
cent.
        Since oxygen had thus been proved to enter into the constitution
of the fixed alkalies, Mr. Davy was led to conjecture that it might
also form a constituent part of ammonia.           For though the apparent
conversion of ammonia into mere nitrogen and hydrogen in the ex
periments of Scheele and of Priestley, as well as in the more refined
and masterly experiments of Berthollet, had left no doubt of its na
ture on the minds of chemists in general, it was not impossible that
a small quantity of water in their results might have been overlooked,
when dissolved in the gases or deposited on the vessels employed, or
might even be neglected, as not arising from elements essential to the
construction of the ammonia.         His conjecture was confirmed in the
first place  by  the formation of carbonic acid in the purest and driest
ammoniacal     gas,  by means of charcoal intensely ignited by a voltaic
battery.
   When Mr. Davy had afterwards exposed the base of potash to
ammoniacal gas, and had ascertained the formation of potash, no
doubt was left of the presence of oxygen, although                proportion              its
could not by these means                     be

 upon both barytes and strontian, inflammable matter was produced
 at the negative surface, and burned with a red flame. This matter
 Mr. Davy has much reason to believe was the basis of the earth em
 ployed. Moreover, although these earths have the strongest rela
 tion to the alkalies, there is also a further chain of resemblances
 through lime, magnesia, glucine, alumine, and silex; each of which,
 there is some reason to imagine, may yield new elements when sub
jected to analysis by electric attraction and repulsion.   Nor, indeed,
 are our hopes  or expectations confined to the decomposition of earthy
 substances; as there is equal reason to suppose that the three acids
which have hitherto resisted decomposition, by the usual means of
chemical analysis, may nevertheless yield the oxygen which they
have been presumed to contain when subjected to the more intense
action of electro-chemical         affinity.
On the Structure and Uses of the Spleen.  By Everard Home, Esq.
 F.R.S. Read November     26,  1807.  [Phil. Trans. 1808, p. 45.]
    Mr. Home, in  the course of his late investigation of the functions
of the stomach, having observed that the pyloric and cardiac portions
of that cavity were separated in many animals by a permanent divi
sion, and in most by at least a temporary muscular contraction,
during the process of digestion; and having also found that the food
in the pyloric portion has in general nearly the same consistence,
was led to consider by what means the quantity of fluid frequently
taken at meals could be absorbed from the cardiac portion; and he
imagined the spleen, from its contiguity to the stomach, to be the
                                                                   -
most natural channel for that purpose.
   To ascertain whether liquids do really pass from the stomach by
any other channel than the pylorus, that passage was secured by a
ligature in a living dog, and five ounces of fluid coloured with indigo
were injected into the stomach. At the end of half an hour, two
ounces were brought up by vomiting; and the dog being killed, one
ounce was found remaining in the stomach; so that two ounces had
escaped.     The spleen was turgid; and upon making a transverse
               of it,
section of     the cut surface presented       appearance   an

a man, he again made a dog the subject of experiment; and after he
had tied the pylorus, about three ounces of a mixture of tincture of
rhubarb with water were at intervals injected into his stomach. Upon
killing this dog, at the expiration of eight hours and a half, his blad
der was found distended with urine highly tinctured with the rhubarb.
The spleen was turgid; and, when cut through and examined by a
magnifying-glass, appeared to consist of two parts intermixed, but
very distinguishable from each other by their colour; the one was
transparent, in the form of small circles or ovals, and surrounded by
a different structure, which was vascular, of a red colour, but of a
lighter hue than the substance of the liver.
   This spleen was immersed in water, and being cut into small
pieces, the water became discernibly impregnated with the rhubarb,
as was rendered manifest by the test of alkali.
   On-the contrary, an equal portion of the liver of the same dog,
treated in the same way, gave no such colour to the water, but only
tinged it with blood of a red colour. Although fluids are thus found
to pass from the stomach to the spleen, the vessels by which they are
conveyed have not been detected, nor does Mr. Home entertain much
hope of such a discovery.

the existence of quadruple, but even of strictly triple compounds. He
believes that          all

ammonia, and with that compound made              precipitate from muriate        a
of strontian.    By  this method      obtaining the compound, the same
                                                            of
quantity        of     acid was found  have united with only half the quantity
                                                    to
of   strontian          that had been contained    the former precipitate;  in                                                     a

                                   287
proportion which he had before observed to take place in the super
oxalate and neutral oxalate of potash.
   In the decomposition of these salts by heat, Dr. Thomson found
the acid to be resolved into water, carbonic acid, carbonic oxide, car
buretted hydrogen, and charcoal.
   With the view of determining with precision the composition of
oxalic acid, Dr. Thomson made choice of the oxalate of lime, of which
100 grains by distillation yielded 60 cubic inches of gas, consisting
of carbonic acid gas and inflammable gas, in the proportion of 2 of
the former to 7 of the latter. The inflammable gas also consisted of
2 parts, seven tenths being carbonic oxide, and three tenths carbu
retted hydrogen.
   Hence if 160 grains of oxalate of lime, which contain 100 oxalic
acid, be distilled, the products are, 59.53 carbonic acid, 24-28    in
flammable air, 11:51 water, 4.68 charcoal : and as the constituents
of these products are known, the ultimate elements are, 64-69 oxygen,
31:78 carbon, 353 hydrogen; which Dr. Thomson considers to be,
64 oxygen, 32 carbon, and 4 hydrogen.
   In the analysis given of this acid by Fourcroy, as performed by
Vauquelin and himself, the quantity of carbonic acid appears much
too small; and Dr. Thomson is convinced their method must be erro
neous, as the quantity of carbonic acid alone that is formed during
distillation contains considerably more carbon than they assign to
oxalic acid.
   From the weights of the elements obtained from oxalic acid by
chemical analysis, Dr. Thomson turns to views of a different nature,
and hopes to arrive at a more intimate and accurate knowledge of the
difference between this acid and other vegetable products consisting
of the same ingredients, by attending to certain numerical relations
of their elements to each other: and this relation is such, that if hy
drogen be expressed by 1, the number which corresponds to carbon
is 4:5, and oxygen 6. Azote, expressed according to the same scale,
will be 5. The law observable in their union is this, that in all their
compounds the proportions of these constituents may be always ex
pressed by these numbers, or by small multiples of them; for instance,

   From the knowledge of this law, which was first observed by Mr.
Dalton, it is difficult (says Dr. Thomson) to avoid concluding, with
him, that the numbers above given represent the relative weights of
a single atom of each of these elements; that they first unite atom

                                                       288
to atom; but that they may also combine in the proportion of two or
more particles of one sort with one of another.                 -
   Dr. Thomson observes, that the same law holds also with respect
to salts, and that numbers may be affixed to each of the acids and to
each of the bases; which numbers, or their multiples, will represent
them in all the combinations into which these bodies enter.
    In this scale the particle of sulphuric acid is represented by 33,
muriatic acid by 18, nitric acid by 17, carbonic acid by 17°5, ba
rytes 67, lime 23, soda 24, ammonia 6.
    From these data, and from the proportion in which oxalic acid has
been found above to combine with several bases, Dr. Thomson assigns
the number 39'5, which represents the particle of oxalic acid. Re
verting next to the proportion of         elements, and its   the weights            to                        of

On Super-acid and Sub-acid Salts. By William Hyde Wollaston,
   M.D. Sec. R.S. Read January 28, 1808. [Phil. Trans. 1808,
   p. 96.]
   The author having some time since observed various instances of
super-acid salts, in which he found that the quantity of acid was
exactly double of what would be necessary merely to saturate the
alkali present, had intended to have pursued the inquiry, but was
prevented by the publication of Mr. Dalton's theory of chemical
combination, as explained by Dr. Thomson.
   However, since it appeared that Mr. Dalton's theory was originally
founded on the analysis of gases, which is attended with too many
difficulties to be repeated by every one who may be desirous of veri
fying the law of simple multiples by experiment, the author thought
it might be desirable to select from his observations certain experi
  *
ments extremely easy to be repeated, each of which exhibits in itself
the most direct and simple proof of the law under consideration.
   The subcarbonates of potash and of soda are named as instances
of salts containing exactly half the acid necessary to form their
fully-saturated carbonates; and the proof is obtained by taking two
quantities of either of these alkalies fully carbonated. One quantity
being taken exactly double of the other, is exposed to a red heat,
and is thereby reduced to a semi-carbonate; for it now yields the
same measure of gas that is given out by the unburnt half quan
titv.
                     of potash is adduced as an instance of a salt con
taining an exact double share of acid. The proof consists in taking
two equal quantities of potash, to one of which is added any large
quantity of sulphuric acid, and the mixture is exposed to a red heat,
by which a part of the redundant acid is expelled; but such an ex
cess of acid remains as is neutralized by the-  second equal portion of
alkali reserved for that  purpose.
   Super-oxalate of potash is also proved to be an exact binoxalate.
Two equal quantities are taken of salt of sorrel; one is exposed to a
red heat, to destroy the whole of its acid, after which the alkali that
remains is just sufficient to neutralize the redundant acid of the other
portion.
   In addition to the preceding compounds selected as distinct exam
ples of semi-acid and bin-acid salts, the author has observed one re
markable instance of a more extended and general prevalence of the
same law.      For when the circumstances are such as to admit the
union of a further quantity of oxalic acid with potash, the quantity
is again doubled; so that the potash present is sufficient to saturate
only one part in four of the acid contained in any quantity of the
salt; and, consequently, the three redundant parts of acid require
for their neutralization the alkali of three equal quantities of this
quadroxalate, which may be obtained by burning, as proof that the
proportion has been rightly ascertained.
   The last experiment is designed to determine whether potash would
                                     U

                                                      290
also unite with three quantities of oxalic acid; but it was found, that
when two parts of potash are in solution with six equivalent quanti
ties of oxalic acid, they do not crystallize together in this proportion;
but one part of the potash becomes a true binoxalate by union with
two parts out of the six of oxalic acid taken; and the other part of
potash is found united with the remaining four parts of acid.
   The author expresses an opinion that we shall not be able to ex
plain satisfactorily, why this acid refuses to unite in the proportion
of 3 to 1, till we can attain a just conception of the geometrical ar
rangement of the elementary particles in                                all

the  apple-tree   showed none       the sinuosities    the bark     the crab  of                  of
tree which covered it; neither did the vessels and fibres         the newly                      of
generated alburnum         any degree correspond with those
                           in                                      the trans                     of

                                            291
 posed bark. And it was evident, that in each instance a new layer,
both of cortex and of alburnum, was generated.
   Mr. Knight's attention was next directed to the progressive for
mation of alburnum in the young shoots of an oak coppice; but he
could discover nothing like transmutation of bark into alburnum,
although the commencement of alburnous layers in this tree is pecu
liarly conspicuous, by a circular row of very large tubes. These
tubes he found, at their first formation, passing through a soft gela
tinous substance, much less tenacious than the surrounding pre
existent bark; and there was nothing in the bark at all correspond
ing to the circular row of tubes contained in the alburnum.               The
interior surface of the bark is at the same time well defined, and its
own peculiar vessels are distinctly visible, and by no means exhibit
any appearance of progressive transmutation.
   Mr. Knight remarks also, that the qualities of different kinds of
wood are not in any degree indicated by the bark which covers them.
He instances the wych-elm and the ash, the woods of which, for
agricultural implements, are frequently substituted for each other,
although the textures of their barks are extremely dissimilar; inas
much as one is brittle, and the other so tough as frequently to be
used for ropes.
   Another circumstance, very unfavourable to the theory of conver
sion, is the firm adhesion which subsists between the layers of bark
to each other, in comparison to their adhesion to their alburnum.
   Two experiments of Du Hamel are, however, cited by Mirbel in
support of that theory.                                                       -
   In the  first, pieces of silver  wire, inserted into the  bark,  were fre
quently found in the alburnum; but the evidence is defective, as it
was not rightly ascertained that the pieces of wire did not, at their
first insertion, pass between the bark and alburnum, and thus be
liable to be covered by a new deposition of either one or the other. .
   In the second experiment, the bud of a peach-tree, with a piece
of bark attached to    it,  was inserted into      plum-stock:
                                                        a            layer a      of
wood was afterwards found beneath the inserted            bark, perfectly  si
milar   tothe peach; but     it    easier
                                  is              to
                                             conceive    layer   a alburnum,
                                                                          of
generated by deposition from fluids that have circulated through the
inserted bud, than that part a         of    its
                                           bark should               be
                                                           converted into         a

                                                      the inserted bark.
   Mr. Knight also remarks, that when the bud           destroyed, the bark
                                                               is

found many years afterwards            to

Some Account of Cretinism. By Henry Reeve, M.D. of Norwich.
  Communicated by William Hyde Wollaston, M.D. Sec.R.S. Read
  February 11, 1808. [Phil. Trans. 1808, p. 111.]
   The peculiar idiots, Cretins, which prevail in the Valais and in
Switzerland, appear to have been first described by Felix Plater in
1656; but the author of the present communication refers to M. de
Saussure for the most accurate account of the appearance of the dis
order; to Malacarni of Turin, and to Professor Ackerman, for a par
ticular description of several cretins that they dissected; and for a
more full account of the malady, to the Essai sur le Goitre et Cre
tinisme, by Mons. Foderé.
   By these and other accounts, Dr. Reeve's curiosity was excited to
examine what connexion could subsist between mental imbecility and
that enlargement of the thyroid gland which so frequently accompa
nies   it,

   Notwithstanding the assertions and ingenious reasoning        Foderé                       of
and other authors upon the supposed connexion between goitre and
cretinism, the author      inclined

calcareous matter is equally unfounded; and even the general opi
nion, that goitre is endemial in mountainous countries, is of no value,
since it is rare in Scotland, though mountainous, and very common
in the county of Norfolk.
   From those dissections which have been made of cretins by Acker
man, by Malacarni of Turin, and by Foderé, some very singular ap
pearances in the cranium have been observed. There was no cavity
for the reception of the pons varolii and medulla oblongata; and that
which contained the cerebellum scarcely exceeded one third of its
natural capacity.
   The present paper is accompanied with two drawings taken in the
anatomical museum at Vienna, from the skull of a cretin who died
at thirty years of age; yet the fontanelle is not closed, the second
set of teeth are not out of their sockets, and none of the bones are
distinctly and completely formed.      Every part bears marks of irre
gularity in the growth and formation of bone. The zygomatic and
maxillary processes of the ossa malae are wanting; the ossa nasi very
small; in the temporal bone the zygomatic process terminates at the
coronoid process of the lower jaw; the mastoid and styloid processes
are wanting; the os occipitis is unusually large, and numerous addi
tional ossa triquetra are seen along the whole course of the lambdoi
dal suture.
  Cretinism, says the author, is a most distinct instance of the effect
of physical causes on the intellectual as well as on the bodily powers;
and it is now sufficiently ascertained, that it may be prevented by
removal of children from the confined and dirty situations to the
more open and airy parts of the mountains: and, accordingly, the
number of cretins has, within the last ten years, sensibly diminished.
The analogy between this disorder and rickets is considerable. It is
remarkable, that they were both first described nearly at the same
time; and it is to be hoped that they will disappear together, and
at some happier period be known only by description.

An Account of     the Application of the Gas from Coal to economical
     Purposes.   By Mr.William Murdoch. Communicated by the Right
     Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B. P.R.S.     Read February 25,
     1808.   [Phil. Trans.  1808, p. 124.]
   An apparatus for the production of the gas from coal having been
prepared by Mr. Murdoch, for the very extensive cotton manufactory
of Messrs. Philips and Lee, at Manchester, which is now illuminated by
means of this alone upon a very large scale, this instance was selected
as the best for estimating the expense of employing the gas lights.
   The quantity of light there employed was ascertained by compa
rison of the shadows to be equal to that of about 2500 mould candles
of six in the pound, each of which consumes about four tenths of an
ounce of tallow per hour.
   The coal is distilled in large iron retorts, and the gas conveyed by
pipes of iron to large reservoirs or gasometers, where it is washed
and purified before it is conveyed to the mill. The main pipes branch
off into a variety of ramifications (the aggregate length of which
amounts to several miles), the several branches diminishing in dia
meter in proportion as the quantity of gas to be passed through
them becomes less.
   The burners where the gas is consumed communicate with the
main by short pipes, furnished each with a cock to regulate the ad
mission of gas. These burners are of two kinds: one is on the
principle of the Argand lamp, and the other has a conical termination
with three holes, one at its point, and the other two placed laterally
about one thirtieth of an inch in diameter.    The former, of which
there are 271, are each equal to four candles; and the latter amount
ing to 633, are each equal to 2+ candles; so that the total amount
is,    above stated, about equal
      as                                   2500 candles.to
   For the hourly supply          these burners, 1250 cubic feet
                                             of                         gas are                 of
necessary; and since the        lights   are used for about two hours, the
daily consumption         gas      of
                                   2500 cubic feet.

   If the estimate were made upon three hours instead of two per
day, it is evident that the comparison would be still more in favour
of the gas lights, since the interest of capital would be the same,
and the wear and tear not much greater; so that the annual cost
might be about 650l. instead of 3000l.
   The introduction of the gas lights into this manufactory has been
gradual: at first some inconvenience was experienced from the smell;
but this objection has been wholly removed by improved methods of
purifying the gas, and it is now much approved by the work-people
for the perfect steadiness of the light; and it is wholly free from the
inconvenience of snuffing, and from the danger occasioned by sparks
that fall from candles.
   In addition to the foregoing statement of comparative economy,
the author conceives it may be interesting to the Society to be in
formed of the original application of this gas, as a substitute for                                     oil

half in three doses of half a pint each, with the same quantity of

 538 miles              in secondly, that since the portion

and the same inference is drawn respecting the nature of the tail; for
if it were sufficiently dense to be visible by reflected light alone, at
the distance of 235 millions of miles, its opacity would entirely pre
vent our seeing stars through                             it.

taken from Dubuat and Gerstner, with some of his own, the results
of which are compared with the velocities calculated according to the
formulae of Dubuat and of the author.
   The next section treats of the resistance occasioned by flexure of
the channel. In this case Dubuat directs the squares of the sines of
the angles of flexure to be added together and multiplied by the
square of the velocity, and considers the quantity thus obtained pro
portional to the height necessary for overcoming the resistance. But
since the magnitude of this quantity is evidently dependent on the
number of parts into which the angle is arbitrarily divided, the au
thor prefers attending merely to the aggregate angle of flexure as
expressed in degrees to which the resistance is proportional, but va
ries also inversely as the radii of curvature, or more nearly as that
power of the radius which is expressed by 4. A table which follows
shows the comparative correctness of the author's formula with that
of Dubuat.
   Dr. Young next considers the propagation of impulses through
tubes, the elasticity of which supplies the want of elasticity of the
fluid contained, and admits the same mode of reasoning that is em
ployed in the case of elastic fluids or solids; for if the elastic force
of the tube be as the increase of its circumference, a certain finite
height may be assigned, which would cause infinite extension, and
which may be called the modular column.       The velocity of an im
pulse at any point will be equal to half that which is due to the
height of this point above the base of such a column, and hence the
time of ascent of an impulse will be twice as great as that of a fall
ing body; and if the pipe be inclined, the ascent of an impulse will
bear the same relation to that of a body moving along an inclined
plane.
   The magnitude of diverging pulsations is next examined, and the
conclusions of Euler, Lagrange, and Bernouilli, who have demon
strated that the velocity of each particle of an elastic fluid is as its
distance from the centre of impulse, are supported by a new method
of considering the subject.
   When a wave is reflected from two surfaces distinctly opposed to
each other, they evidently sustain equal pressures; and if to one of
these surfaces two others be opposed converging at the acute angle,
the wave will be elevated higher as it approaches the angle; and if
the height be supposed in the inverse subduplicate ratio of the cor
responding subtense of the angle, the pressure will then be equal to
that upon the single surface opposed: and hence is an additional
reason for inferring, that in       all
                                      transmissions       impulses the
                                                         of                in
tensity is   in the inverse subduplicate ratio      of the extent      parts

   The general design of this paper is to show the great distance to
which the same strata may be found to extend, or to have extended,
over the surface of a country, and thereby to explain the existence of
small detached portions of the same species of matter at considerable
distances from each other, as having been originally connected by
continuity of the same material over the whole surface of the coun
try, whatever be the present interval, and whatever be the quan
tity of matter which such an hypothesis supposes to have been re
moved.                                                                                       -
   The basaltic area which comprehends most part of the county of
Antrim and a portion of Derry, appears to Dr. Richardson peculiarly
favourable to such speculations, uncommonly regular in           stratifi        its
cation, and highly favoured by nature         the frequent exposure
                                                       in                                   of

are more diversified and more curious in their structure.

   From     revision of the various circumstances observable in these
            a
strata, Dr. Richardson selects certain facts which he considers         im                              of
portance      geology.
             to            First, that every stratum preserves the same
thickness throughout its whole extent.           Secondly, that this uni
formity      of
             thickness       interrupted only where the upper surface
                                  is
has been exposed by removal            the superior strata.   Thirdly, that
                                                    of of                                                    in
the curvature          of
                     the summits        the façades does not correspond
form   to the surfaces           of
                             the strata underneath.        Fourthly, that the
same arrangement does not continue for more than two                      three                    or
miles.     Fifthly, that wherever materials          different species are  of                                in
contact, the line           of
                        demarcation       always distinct and well defined.
                                                        is
 Sixthly, that the upper part         any façades, where the strata are ex
                                                   of
posed,  is generally perpendicular, and the lower steep and precipitous.
Seventhly, that the rude masses which appear                  the sea       the   in                    at
base   of the precipices, are not,                          as
                                           has been supposed, ruins which
have fallen from the strata above, but are remnants               lower strata         of
remaining        their original position. Eighthly, that these abrupt sec
                in
tions are by no means confined           the coast, but are often formed on
                                                        to

                of                                           Ninthly, that                                   in
                                      at
                                 distance from the sea.

all such abrupt terminations         strata, whether on the coast
                                                   of                   within                     or
land, the materials broken off are completely carried away, without
a  fragment being left behind.
    The formation           of
                         these abrupt precipices has been,           some, as                by

   The exact resemblance between the inland façades and those on
                                      all
the shore, proves them         have been cut down perpendicularly by
                                      to
the same agent, which has not confined       operations    the coast, its              to                    or
to  the periphery      the basaltic area. We can trace

author, over its whole surface.
   Some persons have maintained that the inequalities are those
original conformation;                as
                               the world had come from the hands
                                           if                                                                to of of
the Creator with all the varieties which now contribute so much
its beauty.
   Others, admitting the original continuity      the strata, and their      of
subsequent abruption, have differed concerning the direction      which                            in
the cause has acted; some preferring the milder and more gradual
operation      waters from above the surface, which, according
                of                                                                                           to
Dr. Richardson, rather tend      level than   raise inequalities; while
                                               to                      to

                                                                   from                             up
the bottom        of
                the sea               by
                           furious explosions, which,      the author's                in

                                      303
g estimation, can never have taken place beneath the present rectilinear
y and parallel strata.
      Dr. Richardson assumes as a fact, that strata having very strong
  resemblance were once continuous, however interrupted we now find
  them; for instance, the stratified remnants at the tops of the Seafin
  and Slievegallon, between which the valley of the Mayola is an ex
  cavation 1700 feet deep and three miles wide, were originally con
  nected in their present position by similar materials, the whole of
  which have been completely carried away. And again, to the north
  ward, between Seafin and Carntogher, the same stupendous operations
  have carried away the parts which formerly connected these undis
  turbed remains of the same strata.
      The number of basaltic hummocks thus left on the tops of various
  mountains, is represented to be considerable, as if they had been left
  by the unknown sculptor for the express purpose of showing how high
  the original surface of the country formerly reached,a conclusion
  which appears formidable; but the author does not admit that any
  thing is absurd, incredible, or impossible, in geology and cosmogony.

  tained 4} uric acid, and 2% animal matter.        A third consisted of
  oxalate of lime; and it is added that a fine powder is also voided
  from the kidneys, consisting of the ammoniacal phosphate of mag
   nesia, and of phosphate of lime.
      Calculi retained in the infundibula, or pelvis of the kidneys, may
  be increased either by a deposition of uric acid, or may be coated by
  an external lamina, consisting of the phosphates.
      Calculi met with in the bladder, are of four kinds.
      1. Formed on nuclei of uric acid, from the kidneys.
      2. On nuclei of oxalate of lime, from the kidneys.
      3. Formed on sand or mucus deposited in the bladder.
      4. Formed on extraneous bodies introduced into the bladder.
      Those consisting of uric acid vary in colour, from a deep reddish
  brown to a pale yellowish brown.        Those containing phosphate of
   lime, and the triple phosphate of magnesia, are whiter, and are often
   soft and friable.   Those which contain oxalate of lime, called mul
   berry calculi, are browner, harder, and less soluble,
      Out of 150 examined by Mr. Brande,
      16 were composed of uric acid.

     6 chiefly oxalate of lime.
    It is observed by Mr. Brande, that calculi from the bladder, con
 sisting of uric acid, contain a larger proportion of animal matter
 combined with             it,

 grains by solution           triple phosphate, and the remaining 488 were

Some Observations on Mr. Brande's Paper on Calculi.           By Everard
    Home, Esq. F.R.S.        Read May 19, 1808.      [Phil. Trans. 1808,
    p. 244.]
    In  consequence of Mr. Brande's observations, that either acids or
alkalies may be attended with injurious consequences, Mr. Home ad
duces various cases, for the purpose of doing away the expectation
generally entertained, of relief from the use of solvents.
    The first case is that of a person who had been relieved of the
symptoms of calculus while taking saline draughts in the state of
effervescence, but in whose bladder were found, after death, as many
as twenty calculi; but the prostate gland had become enlarged, and
had formed a barrier, so as to prevent the neck of the bladder from
being irritated by them.
    The second patient had used Perry's lixivium, with the same ap
parent benefit, which, in fact, arose from the same cause as the pre
ceding.
    Mr. Home has also found calculi in cysts, between the fasciculi of
the muscular coat of the bladder, even so many as three or four in
the same bladder, in which      cases the usual symptoms   of stone would
Inot occur.
    A gentleman having, at the age of seventy, voided a small uric
calculus during a course of alkaline medicines, continued to use them
at intervals for four or five years, suffering occasionally in a slight
degree, but passing no more calculi. After his death about 350 light
spongycalculi, consisting of the phosphates cemented by uric acid, were
found in his bladder, which, in Mr. Home's estimation, were occa
 sioned by the use of alkalies, in the manner suggested by Mr. Brande.
    Another gentleman, who was found, by sounding, to have a stone
 in his bladder, took fossil alkali for about three months, after which
 he underwent the operation of lithotomy. The stone was found, ex
 ternally, composed of pure triple phosphate of magnesia, in spiculated
 crystals, while the central parts had also a mixture of uric acid with
 the phosphates, so that the alkali had prevented the formation of uric
 acid; but the deposition of the phosphates appeared to Mr. Home
 more rapid than before.

     Respiration.   By W. Allen, Esq., F.R.S. and W. H. Pepys, Esq.

     The importance of a process so essential to life having excited pro
  portional curiosity in philosophers from the earliest ages, the authors
  of the present communication take occasion to trace the history of
  their subject.   Beginning with the conjectures of Hippocrates and
  of Plato, they proceed to notice the first accurate notions of Boyle
  and of Mayow, which were neglected and forgottentill the time when
  Priestley and Scheele first distinguished the two constituent parts of
  the atmosphere from each other.

  The next discovery of importance on respiration, is that by Dr.
Black, who observed the formation of carbonic acid. Succeeding la
bourers in the same field of inquiry, it is observed, are too numerous
for justice to be done to every one; and the principal information
collected from them relates to measures of quantity.       Dr. Goodwin
estimated the residual gas in the lungs, after expiration, at 109 inches.
Dr. Menzies found the absorption of oxygen nearly 52,000 inches in
twenty-four hours.
   Lavoisier and Seguin, from a series of elaborate experiments, con
cluded that more oxygen was absorbed than evolved, as carbonic acid,
and thence imagined that water was formed by the union of oxygen
and hydrogen in the lungs.
   Their experiments showed the consumption of oxygen to be greater
in a colder atmosphere, and to be increased also during digestion
and during exercise; and they estimated the average consumption at
                                          -
41,000 inches per day.
   The quantity of carbonic acid formed, was first estimated by Mr.
Davv.
     #.  authors conceiving that many important points are not yet
satisfactorily settled, undertake to examine in the present communi
cation,--
   1. The average quantity of oxygen converted into carbonic acid in
ordinary respiration.
   2. Whether oxygen is absorbed by the blood.
   3. Whether azote is absorbed, and whether hydrogen or other gas
is evolved.
    On account of the impossibility of knowing, with precision, the
quantity of gas remaining in the lungs after expiration, and the con
sequent difficulty of deciding whether any gas is absorbed in the act
of respiration, it was determined to perform the experiments on such
large quantities of air at a time, that the error arising from residual
gas might bear a small proportion to the whole quantity.
    The apparatus for the first five experiments consisted of two ga
someters, one of which contained 4200 inches of atmospheric air over
water, from which the inspirations were made, and the other being
filled with mercury, was employed to receive the gas after expiration;
           to its
but as       capacity was only 300 inches,       was necessary for the
                                                               it

the quantity expired had been read off, noted, and expelled from the
gasometer; after which the same process was repeated about twelve
times. The quantity       inspired air having now been read off from
                                   of
the water  gasometer, the quantity expired was ascertained     casting       by
 upthe amount      the successive fillings
                         of                  the mercurial gasometer.

From      an
          average     these five experiments, there appeared
                              of                                                  to   a
diminution      twenty inches
                    of            3700. But the authors are inclined
                                             in
to ascribe this difference   the  difficulty
                                        to   above mentioned,     bring       of
ing the lungs            to
                   the same state                 of
                                       contraction after the experiment
as   they had been before.
     In determining the quality              of   the expired gas, lime-water was first

                                    307
employed for the absorption of carbonic acid, and then a solution of
green sulphate of iron, saturated with nitrous gas, to determine the
quantity of oxygen that remained.
    In the sixth experiment there were found 9 carbonic acid, and 9
oxygen; together 18.
    In the seventh experiment there were found 8 carbonic acid, 10%
oxygen; together 18%.
    In the eighth experiment there were found 6% carbonic acid, and
12% oxygen; together 19.
    In the ninth experiment there were found 7 carbonic acid, and 11
oxygen; together 18.
    So that as one measure of carbonic acid contains just an equal
measure of oxygen, the apparent diminution of oxygen in these ex
periments is 2% per cent.
    In the subsequent experiments two mercurial gasometers were em
ployed, so that the hurry of measuring the gas, and inconvenience of
retaining the breath, were avoided, and the respiration was conse
quently more natural throughout the whole of each experiment.
    Nevertheless, the result of the ten experiments still showed an ap
parent diminution of 1 per cent. But the eleventh experiment showed
no diminution, and is considered by the authors as a standard ex
periment.      From this the quantity of oxygen consumed, and of car
bonic acid formed in a minute, is calculated to be 26% inches, and
hence the quantity of solid carbon given off by the lungs, in twenty
four hours, is computed at 10# ounces troy.
    The person who made these experiments breathes about nineteen
times in a minute, and takes about 16; cubic inches of air at each
natural inspiration.
    In the twelfth experiment the same quantity of air was breathed
from one of the mercurial gasometers to the other repeatedly durin
three minutes, and was then found to contain 9% carbonic acid, 5%
oxygen, and 85 azote per cent. ; so that six parts, in 100 of oxygen,
seemed to have disappeared, and some other gas, not absorbed by
water, was apparently given off from the lungs.
   The results of the fourteenth experiment were similar, and more
remarkable, as the respiration of the same air was continued for a
greater length of time: 100 parts contained 10 carbonic acid, 4 oxy
gen, and 86 azote; so that in this instance there appeared a loss
of 7 oxygen, and an equal increase of azote, or of some other gas
 not absorbable by water.       By careful examination, the authors
 are satisfied that no other gas is present in the residuum but azote;
 that the azote itself, though apparently in greater proportion, is in
 fact unaltered; and that the difference arises solely from diminution
 of oxygen when respiration is painfully protracted.
    By the respiration of another person, whose chest was of greater
 capacity, the same quantity of air as by the former was taken in just
 one half the time; but nevertheless very nearly the same proportion
 of it was found converted into carbonic acid.
    In the succeeding experiment nearly 10,000 cubic inches of air
                                    x 2

                                                        308
were breathed.      The quantity of carbonic acid was in this case 8,
the remaining oxygen 13, and the azote 79 per cent., as before in

carbonic   acid, being 32-3 inches in a minute.
   The   deficiency in the quantity expired was so small, that the au
thors were satisfied that none was absorbed. But in the two fol
lowing experiments, which were each performed on upwards of 3000
inches of owygen gas, the deficiency was much greater, and there did
appear to have been absorption of 58 in one experiment, and of 67
in the other.
   The formation of carbonic acid was, in these cases, far more rapid,
being at the rate of 37% inches in a minute.       From the quantity of
air which had necessarily remained in the lungs before the experi
ments, a quantity of azote was unavoidably mixed with the inspired

    Since it seems thus established, that the foetus is nourished with
out a placenta, the source of the gelatinous matter provided for its
nourishment becomes a natural object of inquiry. In birds the al
bumen of the egg, which corresponds with this jelly, is formed in a
tube called the oviduct, and the lateral canals, which open into the
cavity of the uterus of the wombat and kanguroo near          neck, bear                            its

evident that the tubes               do
                                not convey the sap, but are intended
execute   a different office.
    But   if   the sap does not rise through                            the alburnous tubes, says

Mr. Knight, it must pass the cellular substance; and to show that
the cellular substance is pervious                  to fluids, he quotes an instance
from a preceding communication,                    in which bark was generated on
the surface of the cellular substance of pollard oaks.       A new expe
riment is also related in confirmation of this opinion. Various branches
of two years old were cut from different trees; and after the cut
surface had been covered with a cement impermeable to water, a
portion of the bark was detached from each, so as to expose the sur
face of the alburnum.        They were then immersed in coloured infu
sions for   twenty  hours,  and were found to have imbibed the colour
between the alburnous tubes, apparently through the cellular sub
stance.
    When an incision is made into the alburnum near the root, and
                                       it,

likely to cause any incorrectness in the observation. To obviate the
uncertainty that will always attend the results of such observations,
from different states of weather, difference of telescopes, and imper
fection of vision in different observers, Mr. Goldingham recommends
not to draw any inference from comparison of corresponding immer

emersions also, by which            all

                                     of
formed was evidently not pure, but apparently alloyed by another
metallic substance.
    When barytes, strontites,             or
                                       lime, was mixed with oxide           silver      of
 or mercury, the compounds afforded analogous results when acted on
by the voltaic battery.
    When these experiments were resumed, after                      an
                                                              interval     several     of
weeks,    a battery had been prepared with 520 pair              plates; and
                                                                         of                   an
attempt was then made               to
                                   unite the bases             of
                                                         these earths with the

                                                    314
wire by which the power was conveyed from the negative end of the
battery. Lead, silver, copper, and iron, were successively employed;
and it was by means of the last that the most distinct results were
obtained.
    When an iron wire, one seventieth of an inch in diameter, was made
the conductor on the negative side, and brought into contact with
moistened barytes or strontites, lime or magnesia, alumine or silex,
the globule formed by fusion at the end of the wire appeared in each
case to be alloyed with something capable of acting upon water; but
those last named had, in succession, less action than the preceding.
    The author had not himself used mercury as a means of obtaining
the bases in a state of alloy till informed by a letter from Professor
Berzelius of Stockholm, who has used it with success for the decom
position of lime and barytes. And Mr. Davy has found it to succeed
equally with strontites and magnesia. And although mercury alone
failed of effecting the decomposition of alumine and silex, yet when
an alloy of mercury and potassium was made the medium of commu
nication even with these bodies, they each appeared to be decom
posed by assistance of the affinity of potassium for their bases.
   The author also informs us of his success in repeating an experi
ment of Professor Berzelius and Mr. Pontin, on the decomposition of
ammonia: a globule of mercury being inserted in a small cavity
made in a piece of carbonate or muriate of ammonia slightly moisten
ed, they are placed together on a plate of platina positively electri
fied, and the wire from the negative end of the battery is applied to
the mercury. The globule soon increases very considerably in bulk,
and becomes converted into a soft amalgam, which absorbs oxygen
from the atmosphere, or decomposes water into which it is thrown,
and forms ammonia, while the globule gradually recovers        fluidity,                    its
and     reduced
        is          its original
                         to      size before the experiment.

measurements of Keill and others, for the diameters of the aorta, and
of its successive subdivisions.     The quantity of blood in the arteries
is estimated at nine or ten pounds; its velocity in the aorta about
eight inches and a half in a second; while that in the capillary arte
ries is about wºrd of an inch in a second (the diameter of these ves
sels being about rºwth of an inch). The resistance that would be
opposed to water circulating under the same circumstances is calcu
lated to be equivalent to a pressure of a column of twenty inches;
but the resistance to the motion of the blood is supposed in conse
quence of         its
                 viscidity           to    be
                                 about four times     great, and     conse    as                  is

versally believed;                and though a mola has sometimes been found                            in
the uterus totally destitute of heart, and in which the blood must
have circulated, in its usual course, through the arteries and veins, it
cannot be known that there was any alternate pulsation; and, even
if there was any pulsation, it must have arisen from preternatural
power in the arteries, and the resistance in the extreme vessels must
have been preternaturally small.
   The service which the author imagines is performed by the mus
cular coats of arteries, is that of adapting their capacities to the va
rying quantity of the blood contained in them.
   According to this statement, the qualities of the pulse, as discernible
to the touch, are ascribed almost entirely to the action of the heart.
   The duration from the natural state may consist either in a change
of the heart or of the capacity of the smaller arteries. The quantity
of blood transmitted may also remain the same, or be diminished,
or be increased. When it remains the same, the change cannot be
very material, and is not likely to lead to any disease of the vital
functions. When the quantity transmitted is smaller than in health,
the arteries must become contracted, and the veins distended.           The
pulse must be small and weak, until the blood accumulated in the
veins stimulates the heart to greater action.          From the vigour ac
quired during the former remission of its exertion, the pulse becomes
full and strong, a greater quantity of blood being transmitted than
in health, as seems to occur in the hot

An Account of  some Eaperiments, performed with a View to ascertain
  the most advantageous Method of constructing a Voltaic Apparatus,
 for the Purposes of Chemical Research. By John George Children,
  Esq. F.R.S. Read November 24, 1808. [Phil. Trans. 1809, p. 32.]
   The object of the author is to determine how the greatest effect
may be produced by the voltaic battery, with the least waste of power
and expense.
   For this purpose he had one battery constructed of twenty pairs of
plates of zinc and copper of large dimensions, each plate being four
feet long and two feet wide. Each pair was connected together only
at the top by a strap of lead, so that both sides of each plate were
exposed to the action of the fluid in the trough.     The trough was
made entirely of wood, with wooden partitions, made water-tight by
cement; and this battery when in action was charged with a mix
ture of three parts nitrous acid, with one of sulphuric diluted with
three parts of water.
   With this battery,
   1. Eighteen inches of platina wire ºr of an inch in diameter were
fused in about twenty seconds.
    2. Three feet of the same wire became visibly red by strong day
light.
 s:   Four feet of the same became very hot, but not visibly red.
  4. Charcoal burned with intense brilliancy.
  5. On iron wire, the effect was remarkably feeble. Not more than
ten inches of the finest harpsichord wire could be fused by                                        it.
   6. Imperfect conductors were scarcely affected by        No effect                      it.

        With this battery potash and barytes were readily decomposed.

the greater energy of the small battery. In this the number of plates
being tenfold gives tenfold intensity, although the aggregate quantity
of surface in the whole battery is not sºoth part of the acting sur
faces in the large battery.
   The advantage of a large quantity of fluid is evinced by the long
continued action of the small   battery; and it is also observed that in
very numerous combinations,     a certain distance between the plates
becomes necessary to prevent    spontaneous discharges, which the au
  *.
thor found to take place in a  battery of 1250 plates of four inches
Souare.
         this battery of 1250, excited by a fluid of the same strength
as was used in the former experiments, the author ascertained the
striking distance through the air to be ºth of an inch, care having
been taken to dry the air, through which the discharge took place,
before the experiment, as well as to avoid any increase of - tempera
ture previous to the discharge.
   The electric light was also made to pass through a vacuum, and
was observed to be the same as from a common electrical machine.
   The effect of this great number of plates on imperfect conductors,
was of course uncommonly powerful, but yet their power of fusion
 was comparatively weak, as they barely melted half an inch of the
same platina wire that had been used in the former experiments;
and hence it is evident that the construction must be different ac
cording to the purpose for which the battery is designed.
   For igniting perfect conductors large plates are necessary, but they
need not be numerous; and for overcoming the resistance of imperfect
conductors number is requisite, but the size of the plates may be
small.
   The new method of constructing the trough wholly of wood,
with moveable plates joined together only at top, is much preferred
to the old construction, as the plates are more easily cleaned or re
paired, and as they expose double extent of surface.

   The objects which principally occupied Mr. Davy's attention in
the present lecture are, the elements of ammonia; the nature of sul
phur; the nature of phosphorus; the states of the carbonaceous prin
ciple in plumbago, charcoal, and diamond; the analysis of boracic
acid; the analysis of fluoric acid; with a series of numerous experi
ments on muriatic acid.
   With respect to ammonia, he has been induced to reconsider the
subject, not from any doubt which he himself entertained of the cor
rectness of his former results, but on account of the opinion still

maintained by Messrs. Berthollet on the non-existence of oxygen in
ammonia, and on account of the inference deduced by Messrs. Gay
Lussac and Thenard, from the action of potassium on ammonia, who
conclude that potassium is a compound of potash and hydrogen.
Mr. Davy consequently details a variety of processes in which he
examined all the circumstances and results of their mutual action.
   The potassium employed was procured by passing dry potash
through red-hot iron turnings in a gun-barrel, which appears to differ
from that obtained by electricity solely in containing a very small
portion of iron.
   Agreen glass retort, after the introduction of a piece of potassium,
is first exhausted, then filled with ammoniacal gas, and after two
subsequent exhaustions, finally filled again with the gas in an ex
tremely pure state. The potassium thus exposed to ammonia at
common temperatures, loses          lustre and becomes white by

merely be applied, potash and nitrogen are the result.
   In consequence of the supposition of Messrs. Gay-Lussac and The
mard, that they had formed a compound of potassium and hydrogen,
Mr. Davy repeated their experiment frequently, without any success;
neither has he, by any other means, been able to form a compound
                                       -
of hydrogen with potassium.
   In the residuum obtained by heat, after the action of potassium on
ammonia, the nitrogen appears to be combined with an oxide of po
tassium, in which the oxygen amounts to about three per cent. By
greater heat this compound itself sublimes, and does not yield nitro
gen without the intervention of oxygen; as if some portion of the
latter were essential to the constitution of nitrogen gas.
   Mr. Davy refers to an hypothesis formerly advanced, that all me
tals may possibly be compounds of unknown bases with hydrogen;
but replies to those arguments by which Messrs. Gay-Lussac and
Thenard imagined that they had proved the existence of hydrogen in
potassium; for which there appears to be no foundation in fact. Un

physical qualities          of

   They agree       being non-conductors, whether fluid

parent when fluid, but semi-transparent when solid, and highly re
fractive; but resinous and oily bodies contain             small quantity a                                   of
hydrogen and oxygen, with         large quantity
                                                                  is of

So also  in sulphur, the mixture         hydrogen   offully proved, and the
               oxygen might                 be
            on of

                                                   is    evinced      the for                  by
            potash when potassium                       sulphuretted hydro
mation   of                                 heated           is   to in
gen. From such experiments             were most    as    depended upon,  be                                  it

                                 321
is inferred that the quantity of oxygen in sulphur amounts to about
ten per cent., and hence the intenseignition that occurs in the union
of sulphur with potassium, and other metallic bodies, is traced to a
more probable source than their mere affinity for sulphur.
  The same analogies apply to phosphorus as to sulphur; the same
mode of operating was adopted, and products perfectly analogous
were obtained.    By electrization, phosphuretted hydrogen was given
out, and the phosphorus became of a deep red brown colour. By the
action of potassium also, phosphuretted hydrogen was obtained, and
by the action of acids on the residuum, it appeared that the potas
sium had gained oxygen from the phosphorus; and the same inference
is drawn from the action of potassium on phosphuretted hydrogen,
which appears to contain oxygen in a state of combination, similar to
that which obtains in sulphuretted hydrogen.
   The same new modes of research are next employed to discover
what differences subsist in the states of carbonaceous matter, in
plumbago, charcoal, and diamond; for though late and very accurate
experiments have proved that they yield very nearly the same quan
tities of carbonic acid, it was nevertheless not improbable that new
means of analysis might detect chemical differences, correspondent to
the extreme difference of their physical properties.
    Plumbago, whether acted upon by the voltaic battery or by potas
sium, yields no elastic product in either case; but in the latter,
merely combines with the potassium unaltered.         Charcoal, on the
contrary, by the voltaic apparatus, yielded a considerable quantity of
carburetted hydrogen, but did not contribute to the oxidation of the
potassium, any more than plumbago had done.
    The unconducting nature of the diamond rendered it impossible
to apply the voltaic battery with any effect, but it was by no means
insensible to the action of potassium.     When these substances were
heated together, there was no intensity of action, and no production
of elastic fluid. But the diamond soon blackened at its surface, and
 was ultimately reduced to a state perfectly resembling plumbago;
part of it at the same time uniting to the potassium. The addition
 of carbonaceous matter was not, however, the sole change that had
happened to the potassium, as it now extricated a smaller quantity
 of hydrogen from water than an equal quantity of pure potassium,
 and had evidently acquired a portion of oxygen from the diamond.
 This quantity of oxygen (though certainly very small) is thought to
 be the cause of its non-conducting quality.
     Mr. Davy next resumes the analysis of boracic acid, which he had
 begun in his last Bakerian Lecture. By means of voltaic electricity,
 a black matter could be obtained from it that was unaltered by water,
 but soluble in nitric acid, and when heated to redness, burned slowly,
 giving off white fumes. But the quantity of the base that could be
 thus obtained was too minute for determining distinctly       its
                                                                relation
 to  the acid from whichit    was produced.   However,   by heating to
 gether boracic acid with potassium,      a large quantity    of similar
                                                                   a
matter (as has also been observed    by   M. Thenard) was obtained.    In
                                    Y

                                      322
this experiment intense ignition took place at the point of contact of
the substances, the potassium appearing to burn by oxygen acquired
from the acid, of which eight grains saturated about twenty of po
tassium.
   The residuum did not effervesce in water, which merely dissolved
some sub-borate of potash which is formed, and leaves exposed the
boracic base as a spongy mass, black in some parts, and dark olive in
others.     It appeared to be infusible by heat, but a perfect conductor
of  electricity.  When acted upon by nitric acid, or burned in oxygen,
it was reduced again to the state of boracic acid, probably much hea
vier than the basis from which it is formed.
   When fluoric acid gas was acted on by potassium, fourteen cubic
inches disappeared by means of ten grains and a half of potassium,
and about two inches and a quarter of hydrogen gas were evolved,
apparently from water contained in the gas.        In this experiment, a
brownish sublimate was sometimes raised      by  the heat generated, and
at others,   a blackish matter remained mixed with a quantity of fluate
                                                                         -
of potash that is formed.
   This matter appears to be fluoric acid, deprived of oxygen, and ex
isting in a state analogous to that of sulphur and phosphorus; for
when the sulphuric or phosphoric acids are decomposed by potassium,
the pure bases are not evolved, but sulphurets and sulphites, phos
phorets and phosphites, are generated.
   Although the attempts to decompose the muriatic acid have not
hitherto been equally successful with the preceding, yet many new
and interesting results were obtained.      When a quantity of potas
sium was employed, sufficient to absorb a given quantity of this gas,
so much hydrogen was evolved as to prove that it contains full one
third its weight of water.
   Various attempts were made in consequence, to obtain the acid free
from water, but they only terminated in new and singular combi
nations.
  By burning phosphorus in oxymuriatic acid, a very volatile com
pound was obtained, consisting, apparently, of muriatic acid and
phosphoric acid in a dry state, and a second compound of phospho
rous acid with muriatic also, free from water. Corresponding products
were also obtained by means of sulphur, consisting of dry sulphuric
and muriatic acids; and the most remarkable circumstance attend
ing these compounds,      is,
                           that they      do
                                         not redden litmus paper, and
           no        ofacidity till water

   In  exposing potassium      these compounds,
                                to                    violent detonation
takes place, and Mr. Davy has some reason          hope that the muria

of instruments, and by observations on the comparative merits of the
respective methods employed by Bird, by the late Mr. John Troughton,

count of his own, which, he says, was first suggested by the action
of the perambulator.       In the first place, the circle to be divided is to

tirely overlooked.                               -
   Although there may be circumstances that will occasion exceptions
to general rules, it appears that 100 numbers may be made correctly
to represent nearly all the phenomena of the mutual action of 100
different salts, which, if described separately, would require about
5000 separate articles.
   The author, having lately paid much attention to some of the prin
cipal facts in chemistry and pharmacy, has attempted the investiga
tion of a series of numbers adapted to this purpose, and has succeeded
in representing nearly 1500 cases of double decomposition enume
rated by Fourcroy, with the exception of not more than twenty cases;
and although it cannot be expected that these numbers are accurate
measures of the forces they represent, yet they may be supposed to
be tolerable approximations; for if any two of them be near the truth,
the rest cannot be very far from                       it.
    Dr. Young, however, observes, that attractive force, which tends

Account of the Dissection of a Human Fetus, in which the Circulation
  of the Blood was carried on without a Heart. By Mr. B. C. Brodie.
  Communicated by Everard Home, Esq. F.R.S. Read February 16,
   1809.   [Phil. Trans. 1809, p. 161.]
   Mr. Brodie was induced to draw up the account of this case, al
though other instances are already recorded, because the child dif.
fered much less from the natural formation than usual.                                           -
  Twins were produced, both still-born, at the seventh month of
pregnancy. The placenta was not preserved; but it was remarked
 that the chords belonging to the two children were, at their attach
 ment, distant about three inches from each other.       In one of these
children nothing preternatural was observed. The other was dis
tended, and disfigured with fluid contained in two cysts under the
common integuments of the neck and thorax; but when the fluid
was evacuated, the form was nearly natural, with the exception of a
hare lip, and a deficiency of some of the toes and fingers.        In the
brain also, and nervous system, nothing unusual was observed. But
in the thorax there was no heart, thymus gland, or pleura; and
the substances corresponding to lungs, on each side, at the bifur
cation of the trachea, were no more than one third of an inch in dia
meter, the thorax being filled with a dense cellular substance.
    The diaphragm was merely membranous. The stomach had no
cardiac orifice; the intestines were shorter than natural; and there
was no omentum, no liver, and no gall-bladder.
    At the navel entered two vessels, an artery and a vein; the former
passing along, with the urachus, to the left groin, gave off the ex
ternal and internal iliacs, and then passing upwards, joined the right
iliac and became aorta, having the usual branches to the viscera and
parietes of the abdomen; and when it reached the upper part of the
thorax, it sent off the two subclavian arteries, and then divided into
the two carotids, without forming any arch. The course of the veins
was equally simple; but       of its
                               communication with the navel was from
the right groin, instead      passing along with the artery       the left         on
side.   In the whole course of these vessels there could be discovered
no direct communication between the venous and arterial systems,                                as
usual, but merely the union         their capillary extremities,

the author observes, that the tuber differs but little from a branch
which has dilated instead of extending itself. The runners, which
give existence to the tubers beneath the soil, are very similar in or
ganization to the stem of the plant; and if exposed, readily emit
leaves, and perform all the functions of the stem; and, on the other
hand, Mr. Knight has shown, in a former memoir, that the buds on
any part of the stem may be made to produce tubers similar to those
formed beneath the soil; but he has never, under any circumstances,
been able to obtain tubers from the fibrous roots of the plant.
     Many naturalists have imagined the fibrous roots of all plants to
be of annual duration only, because those of bulbous and tuberous
 plants certainly are so; but Mr. Knight observes, that the organi
 zation of trees is extremely different; and he has not found any por
 tion of their roots to be deciduous.
 On the Nature of the intervertebral Substance in Fish and Quadrupeds.
     By Everard Home, Esq. F.R.S. Read February 23, 1809. [Phil.
      Trans. 1809, p. 177.]
     The author, having observed       a new species of joint in the Squalus
 marimus of     Linnaeus,   takes occasion to trace the successive gradations
 of a similar    structure,   through various kinds of fish, to the more re
 mote resemblance to be found in quadrupeds and in men.
      In the Squalus each joint of the spine approaches, in some mea
 sure, to that which is termed the ball and socket joint, as a concave
  surface of each vertebra is applied to a ball; but the ball, in this     in
 stance, is not, as in other cases, a smooth surface covering a solid
  bone, but a collection of fluid contained in a bag that is nearly sphe
 rical, round which the concave surfaces of the vertebrae are moved.
      In a fish of thirty feet in length, the diameter of the body of one
  of the largest vertebrae measured seven inches; the quantity of fluid
  in one of the cavities amounted to three pints; the ligamentous sub
  stance, which unites the vertebrae, being nearly one inch in thickness,
  externally very compact and elastic, but internally possessed of but
  little elasticity.
      The elasticity of these ligaments preserves the straitness of the
  spine when it is not acted upon by the muscles, or by other external
  force; and though the extent of motion, in any one joint, must be
  small, their number affords considerable latitude of motion.
      Since the vertebrae, in other fish, are found with concavities in each
  surface, it was natural to expect a corresponding resemblance in the
  intervertebral structure; and in the skate this was found to be the
  case, and the cavity nearly spherical, as in the Squalus. In the com
  mon eel it is more oblong, the longitudinal diameter exceeding the
 transverse one by about one third.
      In the sturgeon the structure varies considerably, as the cavities
  communicate with each other by apertures through the bodies of the
 vertebrae, which in this fish are cartilaginous rings, connected toge

                                                         330
ther by ligament, and forming a tube communicating from one ex
tremity of the spine to the other.
   This species of intervertebral joint, which thus appears common to
the fish tribe, is not found to obtain in the whales, as their structure
in this, as in many other respects, is the same as that of quadrupeds,
but is more distinctly visible, from the vast size of the parts. In them
the intervertebral substance is arranged in concentric circles, con
nected by transverse fibres, the external layers being very firm and
compact; but the interior become successively softer, till in the centre
there is a soft pliant substance, more like jelly than an organized
body, corresponding in its use to the incompressible fluid in fish.
   In the bullock, sheep, deer, monkey, and man, the structure cor
responds with that of the whale; but in the hog and rabbit a cavity
was observed, with a smooth internal surface extending through half
the diameter of the vertebrae; so that the structure in these animals
imitates that of fishes, though not for any obvious purpose.
   In the alligator the several joints are regularly articulated with
capsular ligaments, and are lubricated with synovia.     In the snake
there is a regular ball and socket joint between every two vertebrae;
so that the means employed for the motion of the back-bone in dif
ferent animals, comprehends almost every species of joint.
   Mr. Home's paper has annexed to it an appendix, by Mr. William
Brande, giving an account of the chemical analysis of the fluid con
tained in the intervertebral cavity of the Squalus marimus.
   Its specific gravity was found to be 1027. It was not coagulated
by heat.
   No precipitation was occasioned by infusion of galls, or of catechu;
nor was any change produced by alcohol.
   But oxymuriate of mercury, muriate of tin, nitrate of silver, and
acetate of lead, threw down copious precipitates.
   From the effect of these re-agents, it appears to Mr. Brande, that
the fluid contains neither gelatine nor albumen; but when the fluid
was evaporated to half                    its
                              bulk, pellicles began     form     the sur to           on

On Platina and native Palladium from Brazil. By William Hyde
  Wollaston, M.D. Sec. R.S. Read March 22, 1809. [Phil. Trans.                                 -

thought it deserved particular examination, although the quantity
                                                                        -
which he could obtain was too small for accurate analysis.
   The appearance of this mineral is whiter than Peruvian platina;
the grains are rougher and more angular, being evidently fragments
of larger masses, very little worn at their surfaces. When examined
by solution and precipitation, the greatest part of the grains appeared
to be platina nearly pure, as they are free from iron, which forms a
considerable part of the Peruvian ore; and apparently free from the
several metals, which have within these few years been discovered
in that mineral; but they contain, on the contrary, a small quantity
of gold, which is not contained in the grains of Peruvian platina.
   The author discovered also, among the grains of native platina, a
few fragments of native palladium, which he describes as resembling,
in the whiteness of their colour, the grains of platina, but differing
from them in presenting an appearance of fibres diverging from one
extremity. These grains are readily detected by their solubility, and
by the red colour of the solution: that they consisted of palladium,
was proved by precipitation with prussiate of mercury, or green sul
phate of iron, as well as by their fusibility by assistance of sulphur.
It is remarked, however, that these grains are not absolutely pure,
but contain a very small quantity of platina, which, by         redness                       its
when precipitated, seems         contaminated by iridium.

 which have been    made,    replacing the    by
                                           points     the compass into                     of

them, the author proposes a means of obviating that inconvenience,
by substituting a microscope instead of one of the points; and he
describes a method of proceeding, in which there is no need ever to
set the other point into any division already made.
    The beam to be employed for this purpose must have a fixed point
at one extremity, and at the other a centre of motion, round which
the length of the beam may revolve as radius.      A microscope is to
slide in a groove along the middle to any required distance from the
point; and in order that these may both be over the circle at the
same time, the centre of motion must be capable of adjustment, that
it may be fixed at a greater or less distance from the centre of the
circle, according to the magnitude of the arc intercepted between
the point and microscope.
    In dividing by continual bisection, the microscope is first to be
removed from the point to a distance nearly equal to the chord of
the half-arc ; and when the centre of motion has been duly adjusted,
and the wire of the microscope is made to bisect the dot at one ex
tremity, a faint scratch must be made with the point.
   The beam having next been turned half round, and the dot at the
other extremity brought under the wire of the microscope, a second
scratch is made with the point, which, if the distance has been taken,
will be very near the former; and the wire of the microscope will
easily be placed midway between them in the further process of bi
section, which is again performed in the same manner, after the po
sition of the microscope and of the centre of motion have been duly
altered.
        In layingdown the real divisions from the marks thus made, the
 centre of motion must be so placed that the whole length of the beam
 may become a tangent to the circle; and when the microscope has
 been fixed close to the point, and the first dot brought under                 the               it,
 first division        be marked, and the rest
                          is   to                          succession till all are

made.
    Since the entire arc                 of
                                  circle cannot

On a Method of eramining the Divisions of astronomical Instruments.
  By the Rev. William Lax, A.M. F.R.S. Lowndes's Professor of
  Astronomy in the University of Cambridge. In a Letter to the Rev.
  Dr. Maskelyne, F.R.S. Astronomer Royal. Read June 1, 1809.
  [Phil. Trans. 1809, p. 232.]
   Since the utmost precision in making astronomical observations,
and in reading off the indication given by any instrument, will be of
no avail if the instrument itself be not divided with proportional ac
curacy, the author felt the importance of estimating the probable
amount of errors that might occur in Bird's method of dividing by
continual bisection, and has also contrived a method of examining
the divisions of any circle, and of measuring, within certain limits,     -
the actual errors in every part of                       it.

ninety-eight hours, and the labour, no doubt, is very considerable;
 but when the errors thus ascertained have been duly noted in a table,

instrument to be amply compensated by the confidence given to
 every subsequent observation by means of it.
    It is also proposed occasionally to obviate the effects of unequal
expansion in any particular observation, by comparing the arc by
which any angle has been measured with several succeeding equal
arcs, until the multiple exceeds the whole circumference, and thereby
includes the opposite errors, which arise from this cause in different
parts of a circle, and correct each other.
On the Identity of Columbium and Tantalum. By                  William Hyde Wol
  laston, M.D. Sec. R.S. Read June 8, 1809.                    [Phil. Trans. 1809,
    p. 246.]
   The author having received specimens of the Swedish mineral tan
talite, containing the metal called Tantalium, by Mr. Ekeberg, was
desirous of ascertaining whether that metal might not be the same
as columbium, which had been discovered a short time before by
Mr. Hatchett; and for that purpose he procured some oxide of co
lumbium from Mr. Hatchett, and also a fragment of the mineral in
the British Museum, originally analysed by Mr. Hatchett.
   He describes the external resemblance to be such, that one might
be taken for the other; but observes, that the columbite is rather
more brittle than tantalite.
    By analysis, also, he finds them to consist of the same three                 in
gredients; namely, a white oxide, iron, and manganese.
    To separate these substances, the mineral is powdered and fused
with carbonate of potash and a small proportion of borax. The iron
and manganese may then be dissolved, along with the salts employed,
by muriatic acid, and the oxide of columbium or tantalium remains
as a white powder for further trial of       its
                                            properties.
   Five grains     columbite being thus treated, left four grains
                                                                                   of of
                    of
white oxide; and the solution yielded three fourths             grain   of
                                                                         a
iron, and one fourth     of
                          a grain  ofmanganese.
   Five grains    tantalite, by the same treatment, left four grains and
                    of
a  quarter ofoxide, half grain
                          a        ofiron, and two tenths       grain   of   a     of
manganese.
   The white oxides obtained from each      these minerals appear

oxalic acid, in tartaric acid, or in citric acid.
   They are both precipitated of an orange colour by infusion of galls,
but are not precipitated by that re-agentif a considerable excess either
of alkali or acid prevail in the solution.
   As a further agreement in their properties, it is added, that neither
of them is precipitated by prussiate of potash or by hydrosulphuret
of potash.
   From these experiments, although a great difference which sub
sists between the specific gravities of the two minerals cannot be
very satisfactorily explained, the author is satisfied that the Ameri
can and Swedish minerals, in fact, contain the same metal.
Description of a reflective Goniometer. By William Hyde Wollaston,
 M.D. Sec. R.S. Read June 8, 1809. [Phil. Trans. 1809, p. 253 ]
    The instrument here described by the author is designed to obviate
the inconvenience which has been found in attempting to measure
any small crystals by the instruments hitherto used for that purpose.
    When a surface is so small as one fiftieth of an inch in breadth, it
becomes extremely difficult to apply the short radius of a goniometer
to it with correctness.      But since a surface of that magnitude may
reflect a very brilliant light, the reflected ray may be employed as
radius, and may at pleasure be taken of such a length that the angles
of small crystals can be known with as much precision as those of
the largest surfaces.
    The crystal being attached to a horizontal axis, with              edge           its            in
the line   ofthe  axis, one     of

place, the axis is  turned till the second surface reflects the same light,
and  is  consequently      the same position. The number
                           in                                          degrees        of
through which the axis has turned being the supplement                  the re            to

                                           is                        by

Continuation of Experiments for investigating the Cause of coloured
  concentric Rings, and other Appearances of a similar Nature.   By
  William Herschel, LL.D. F.R.S. Read March 23, 1809. [Phil.
  Trans. 1809, p. 259.]
  In the former part of this paper the author had pointed out various
methods of producing coloured rings between surfaces in contact, and
had proved that no other surfaces are concerned in their formation;
and he now proceeds to show, that, by varying the figures of the
surfaces, a corresponding change of the form of the rings will be ob
served. As a spherical surface applied to a plane surface produces
circular rings, so, when it is applied to a cylindrical surface, the
rings become ellipses; and when the cylinder is applied to a plane,
the ellipses become straight lines, and irregular curves occasion irre
gularity in the form of the rings. But Dr. Herschelis of opinion, that
plane surfaces, applied to each other at any extremely small angle,
cannot exhibit any such appearances of colour unless they are dis
figured by unequal pressure.
   The author next examines the circumstances of the prismatic blue
bow observed by Newton, as the limit to the perfect reflection that
occurs in the interior of a prism when light is much inclined to                                its
                                                                                       at of
surface; and Dr. Herschel calls this the critical separation              the
colours.     He also examines the prismatic red bow observable            the
same critical inclination, when the transmitted light prevails over that
which   is reflected; and remarks the change from red            blue, occa  to
sioned by changing the direction         the light.

                        contact with
                         is              prism, contain

colours,    it    evident that the less refrangible, after having been
                    is

re-enter the prism.
   Dr. Herschel next proceeds         delineate, from strict computation,
                                             to
the course           of
                   the several  rays;  and, by    diagram drawn upon
                                                             a                                  an
enlarged scale, shows, that when light falls upon           pair    surfaces
                                                                      a           of
nearly  in  contact, and when single rays                   or
                                                small pencils are separated

                                  339
at regular intervals from each other, then the rays, which emerge,
and after reflection re-enter the same surface, will also be separated
so as to present streaky appearances, in some of which the order of
the colours will differ from that in others, agreeably to observation.
   With respect to the curvature of the prismatic bows, that mani
festly depends upon the position of the eye, as the lines of equal       in
cidence form a cone, of which the eye is apex; and, accordingly, as,
the eye recedes from the prism, the bow becomes less curved, and
for a small space will appear straight.
   Dr. Herschel having remarked, when a plane surface is applied to
a prism,  that the appearance of the streaks that are seen in contact
with the prismatic bow depends on what he has termed the critical
separation of the rays, infers, that those rings of colours which are
seen when a lens is laid upon a plane surface, depend also upon the
same critical separation; the lens being in this case considered as a
prism bent round into a circular form.
     The several points of resemblance in the circumstances           under
which the bow-streaks from a prism, and the rings from contact of
lenses, appear or disappear, or change their form or their colours,
are next compared; and are considered by the author as decisive
proof that each arise from the same critical separation at the boundary
of prismatic reflection; and if the mere difference of refrangibility of
the several colours is sufficient to account for the phenomena, it is
inferred, that no alternate fits of easy reflection and easy transmis
sion really exist as original properties in the rays of light.
An Account of    a Calculus from the Human Bladder of uncommon        Mag

   This calculus, which is considered as the largest on record, weighs
44 ounces avoirdupois.      It was taken after death from the bladder
of Sir James     Ogilvie, who had submitted to a fruitless attempt to
remove it  by  the usual operation of lithotomy, rather than prolong
an existence extremely miserable from this among other conse
quences of a blow on his back thirty years before.        The stone so
completely filled the cavity of the bladder, that it was with difficulty
taken out, although there was no real adhesion.           Its
                                                           texture was

  The author next treats more at large of the sensible or obvious
properties, including smell, taste, weight relative to water, and ap
pearance under the microscope.
  The next division of the subject includes the agency of heat; the
separation of a coagulum, or curd, at temperatures from 150° to 170°;
the properties of the curd, and of the residuum which it leaves when
burned; the saline contents of the fluid separated from the curd, and
obtained by evaporation.
   Under the same head of agency of heat is also included the pro
cess of distillation to dryness, the properties of the fluid distilled, and
of the residuum.
   The action of alcohol is next tried, both on the residuum left by
distillation, and also on different kinds of expectorated matter in
their fresh state.
   Next follow experiments on the miscibility of these matters with
water, and also a set of experiments made with acetous acid. After
other miscellaneous experiments, the author concludes, that the va
rious kinds of expectorated matter consist of the same ingredients,
but that the proportion of these ingredients is somewhat different;
that expectorated matter consists of water containing certain saline
and earthy bodies, together with a coagulable albuminous oxide,
amounting in general to between one sixteenth and one twentieth
of the whole, but sometimes not exceeding one fiftieth part, and at
others amounting to as much as one tenth.
   The saline ingredients are stated to be,
   Muriate of soda, varying from 1 to 2 in 1000 parts.
   Potash, neutralized by animal oxide, 0.4 to 0-7.
   Phosphate of lime, 0.4 to 0-5.             -
   Ammonia, united probably to phosphoric acid.
   Phosphate, perhaps of magnesia.
   Carbonate of lime.
   Indications of sulphate of lime.
   Vitrified matter, perhaps with silica.
   Oxide of iron in too small proportion to be estimated.
The last six substances scarcely amounting to one thousandth part.
   The different consistence is ascribed to the different quantities of
albuminous oxide.     The thicker matter is also said to be less saline
than that which is more fluid.
   The author observes, that    all   the animal fluids contain potash, but

                                                       341
that pus does not contain so much potash or muriate of soda as is
contained in the above expectorated secretions.
   Dr. Pearson also thinks it much more probable that the circulating
and secreted fluids are impregnated with potash, as he has observed,
than with soda, as observed by others.
   Finally, we are informed, that expectorated matter contains glo
bules, which have not before been observed, and seem to the author
to denote organization.

   The theory of the figures of the planets involves two questions
perfectly distinct from each other; first, the figure which a mass of
matter would assume by the mutual attraction of           particles, com             its

such spheroids                 of

                   composition    liquid albumen; and secondly, On

                                                    342
   The mucus contained in saliva in expectorated fluids, and in that
from the oyster, were first examined; but since nitrate of silver and
acetate of lead, which have been supposed to detect mucus, were
found to act principally on the salts contained in them, it became
necessary to employ other means for the removal of the salts; and
the voltaic apparatus was applied for the purpose of extracting the
alkalies at one pole, and the acids at the opposite.   But there oc
curred a phenomenon that was wholly unexpected; as a considerable
coagulation of albumen took place at the negative pole, which Mr.
Brande (at the suggestion of Mr. Davy) is inclined to ascribe to the
separation of alkali with which it was combined, and to which its
solubility was owing.
   It is observed, in confirmation, that when an egg is boiled for some
time in water, the liquid becomes alkaline to tests, and still deposits,
by electrization, a small quantity of albumen, which the alkali re
                                                                    -
tains in solution.
   The coagulation of albumen by acids is also ascribed to their su-
perior affinity for the alkali.
     For discovering the nature of the saline ingredients, the water in
which some white of egg had been boiled and macerated, was elec
trified by a powerful battery, through the medium of a cup of water
on each side.    After the process had continued for one hour, the
fluids were  examined;   that on the negative side contained a quan
tity of soda nearly pure, and that on the positive side a small quan
tity of albumen, with a little muriatic acid, but not enough to satu
rate the alkali.
 The same means of analytic investigation      being applied to other
fluids, detected larger quantities of albumen than were discoverable
by heat alone; as in saliva, in the mucus from the oyster, the mucus
from the trachea, in bile, in milk, and in the liquor of Amnios: and
hence the author is led to doubt whether mucus may not be a com
pound of albumen, either with muriate of soda or with excess of soda.

acid and alkali at the opposite wires.
   A second experiment was made, with similar results, on blood still
fluid, in the vein of an animal just killed.
   A third experiment was made upon serum, with 120 plates highly
charged, with the same result.
 . A fourth experiment      was conducted in a similar manner, with
12 pair of plates, with similar results.
   In a fifth experiment, 30 pair of plates, very weakly charged, also
extracted alkali and acid from serum exposed to them.
   Since powers so weak are capable of separating the constituent
parts of blood, it is suggested that the weaker powers existing in
animals may produce the same effect, and thus occasion all the dif
ferent secretions, and modify albumen into the states of the different
animal solids.
On the comparative Influence     of Male and Female Parents on their
   Offspring.   By Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq. F.R.S. In a Letter
   to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B. P.R.S.            Read
   June 22, 1809. [Phil. Trans. 1809, p. 392.]
   During the very extensive series of Mr. Knight's endeavours to
improve the varieties of fruit-trees, he has also been occupied in
making correspondent experiments on the breeding of animals, and
has always paid attention to the strong analogy which universally
subsists between plants and animals in most points relating to gene
ration.
   Although the author's experiments have extended to many different
species of fruit-trees, yet the greatest number, and those under the
most favourable circumstances, were upon apple-trees.         But as the
results were all in unison, the instances here adduced are from the
apple alone.
    Linnaeus conceived the character of the male to predominate in the
 exterior both of plants and animals: but Mr. Knight's observations
have led him to form a different conclusion; for he remarks, that
 seedling plants and the young of animals inherit much more of the
 character of the female.
    Seeds from cultivated apple-trees, impregnated by the Siberian
 crab, produced larger fruit than those from the crab impregnated
 by stamina from the cultivated fruit; but the quality and flavour of
 the fruit appeared to inherit, in a greater degree, the qualities of the
 male.
    In consequence of the frequent intermixtures that have taken place
 in the breeding of domesticated animals, there is often little resem
 blance to either parent; but it is observed, that the dimensions of
 the offspring are regulated principally by those of the female, and
 that a corresponding length of legs appears especially necessary for
 accompanying the parent in flight.      But unless the male parent be
 proportionally strong, the legs of the offspring may be too long in

                                                            344

the female entirely predominates,            particular females will produce

  Esq. Sec. R.S. Prof. Chem. R.I. [Phil. Trans. 1809, p. 450.]
   Mr. Davy, having in the experiments described in the late Bakerian
lecture, found that a quantity of nitrogen disappeared during the ac
tion of potassium on ammonia, and that it could not be made to re
sume its gaseous state but by the agency of oxygen in water, has
been from that time much occupied in determining, with certainty,
all the circumstances of the process; and though he cannot yet speak
with precision as to the quantities, he thinks the general results de
cisive with respect to a decomposition of nitrogen having been ef
fected.

coloured fusible substance, losing all   metallic properties,  quan

 so that the total quantity    hydrogen collected of    this analysis,                 in

    would have yielded                   15   of      hydrogen,       and     6   or   7   of   nitrogen;         so

                                   348
that in the present experiment there was a loss of between three and
four inches of nitrogen to be sought in the residuum which had been
heated in the metallic tube. But when the tube was opened, nothing
was found but potash that had been fused, and a small quantity of
potassium sublimed into its upper part; so that in the place of the
nitrogen nothing was found but oxygen contained in the potash,
which, together with a small excess of hydrogen, may amount to the
weight of the nitrogen lost.
    In other experiments five grains of the olive-coloured ammoniacal
pyrophorus, formed by potassium, yielded by mere heat, or by oxygen,
three fourths of an inch of nitrogen; but by water they evolved one
fifth of hydrogen, and 3+ of ammonia, which by estimate contain 14
of nitrogen.
    If the nitrogen is to be considered as converted into oxygen and
hydrogen,    it must be regarded as containing much more oxygen than
water; and if we do not adopt this supposition, Mr. Davy considers
the only alternative to be, that water is the ponderable matter which,
under different modifications of electro-chemical existence, consti
tutes oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and the nitrous compounds; but
with respect to conclusions so important, and so little to be expected
by any analytical chemist, it appears to Mr. Davy highly unphiloso
phical to decide in the present state of our knowledge.
The Croonian Lecture. By William Hyde Wollaston, M.D. Sec.          R.S.
        Read November 16, 1809. [Phil. Trans. 1810, p. 1.]
    Since the remarks, which the author has connected together on
the present occasion, as tending, each of them, to promote the design
of Dr. Croone, do not appear to bear any direct relation to each other,
he divides the lecture into three distinct heads; the first of which
contains an observation, and some experiments on the duration of
muscular action.     In the second he traces the origin of sea-sickness,
from a mechanical cause deranging the circulation of the blood.       In
the third he offers a mechanical explanation of the advantages de
rived from riding, and the various modes of carriage exercise.
    With regard to the duration of muscular action, the author is of
opinion that each effort, apparently single, consists in reality of a
great number of contractions, repeated at extremely short intervals.
He infers the existence of these alternate motions, from a sound ob
served upon inserting the extremity of the finger into the ear. The
sound resembles that of carriages at some distance passing rapidly
over a pavement. The sound is not perceived when the force applied
to stop the ear is not muscular, unless the action of some distant
muscle be communicated through some medium capable of conveying
its vibrations.
    With a view to estimate the frequency of these vibrations, the
author contrived to imitate them by rubbing a stick, regularly notched,
and placing it in such a position, that the tremor was communicated
to the ear along with the muscular vibrations.      The results of such

                                                    349
trials was, that the vibratory alternations recur between twenty and
thirty times in a second, but varying in number in proportion to the
degree of force exerted by the muscle.
   The utmost frequency which he has observed, he estimated at 35,
and the lowest 15. But he considers the visible unsteadiness of an
aged or infirm person, to arise from a less frequent repetition of the
same motions.
   In the second part of this lecture, which treats of sea-sickness, the
author described an irregularity that he observed in his respiration,
after having suffered some days from that affection, which appeared
to be an involuntary effort of the constitution to relieve itself, by
counteracting the effects of the motion of the ship.
   In waking from a disturbed sleep, he remarked that each effort of
inspiration was suspended for a time, and was then taken with a cer
tain feeling of adaptation to some unknown motion of the sea. In
reflecting afterwards upon this observation, it appeared to him that
the act of inspiration might afford relief by means of its effect upon
the circulation. For since, when the skull is trepanned, the effect
of inspiration in withdrawing blood from the brain is manifested by
the alternate heaving and subsidence of the brain, in alternate motion
with the opposite states of the chest, the act of inspiration must tend
to counteract any cause propelling blood to the head. And such a
cause of pressure will manifestly occur in the descent of a ship by
the subsidence of a wave on which it rests. When a person is stand
ing erect upon deck, the motions of the column of blood contained
in his vessels may be compared to those of quicksilver in a barome
ter. When the deck descends, the fluids no longer press with their
whole weight against the force which supported them. The mercury
continuing to be pressed with the whole weight of the atmosphere is

necessary consequence which,                            he
                                        observes, must take place from
mere mechanical   agitation.    Since the direction      which the circu              in
lation    of
         the blood     carried forward
                               is          animal bodies,     given solely
                                                               in                                is

system, so also will a similar direction be given to the effects of ex
termal motion.    Every motion tending to propel forward the blood,
will hence assist the powers of the heart; but such as have a con
trary tendency will be resisted by the interposition of the valves, and
cannot occasion proportional obstruction to the regular progress of
the blood; the heart is thus assisted in the work of restoring a sy
stem, which has recently struggled with some violent attack, or al
lowed, as it were, to rest from a labour to which it is no longer equal,
when the powers of life are nearly exhausted by some lingering dis
order.
   It is conceived that all the other animal functions must participate
in the relief thus afforded to so important an organ; and it is re
marked, that even the powers of the mind itself, though most remote
from our conception of material agents, are, in many persons, thus
immediately affected, by the consequences of a merely mechanical
operation.
The Bakerian Lecture for 1809.     On some new Electrochemical Re
  searches, on various Objects, particularly the metallic Bodies, from
  the Alkalies, and Earths, and on some Combinations of Hydrogen.
  By Humphry Davy, Esq., Sec. R.S. F.R.S.E. M.R.I.A. Read
                                                                      -
  November 16, 1809.     [Phil. Trans. 1810, p. 16.]
  Mr. Davy having from the commencement of his electro-chemical
researches, communicated the several steps of his progress to the
Society, takes the present opportunity of reporting the results of his
further inquiries under four principal heads. First, on the nature of
the metals of the fixed alkalies.    Second, on the nature of hydrogen
and  composition  of ammonia.     Thirdly, on the metals of the earths;
and, Fourthly, he makes a comparison between the antiphlogistic
doctrine, and a modified phlogistic hypothesis.
   When Mr. Davy first communicated to us his discoveries of potas
sium and sodium, he adopted, as most probable, the antiphlogistic
interpretation of the phenomena, and considered potassium and so
dium as simple metallic bodies, of which potash and soda are the
oxides.    The same experiments have since been repeated by others
with the same results, but the explanations given by different che
mists have been various.    The theory which has appeared most de
serving the author's notice, and is more particularly controverted, is
that of Messrs. Gay-Lussac and Thenard, who conceive these metals
to be compounds of their respective alkalies with hydrogen; although
in the interpretation of their own production of a metallic substance
from boracic acid, they relapse again into the antiphlogistic doctrine,
and suppose themselves to have effected a decomposition,   by abstrac
                                                       -              -
tion of oxygen   from it.
   Since the principal experiment     which Messrs. Gay-Lussac and
                                       on
Thenard rely,      that
                      in which ammonia      acted upon    by
                                                           potash, Mr.

experiment with the utmost care      avoid moisture, which appears
                                      to                             to

have misled the French chemists, and with the most scrupulous at-
tention to the products.
   When the experiment is conducted in tubes of iron, there is always
a conversion of a portion of potassium into potash, a loss of nitrogen,
and a production of hydrogen; but when platina or copper tubes are
employed, the quantity of potassium remains the same, there is no
loss of nitrogen, but there is a loss greater or less of hydrogen. The
explanation suggested for this difference      that     affinity   these  is,             an                 of
metals for potassium may prevent its attracting oxygen from the
anannonia.
   For the decomposition       ammonia, sodium seems preferable
                                                  of                                                                      to
                                      facility
                      as on
potassium,     account    the greater        of  employing   free from          of                      it
moisture;      the latter oxidates more  rapidly    the surface, while               at
transferring from one vessel      another, and more rapidly attracts
                                                        to
moisture when oxidated.
    Mr. Ritterfounds the same opinion, that hydrogen       constituent                         is   a
part     of
       potassium and sodium, upon      singular circumstance that  a                                                      he

of potash in such state, as is allowed to be perfectly dry, according
to the latest experiments of the most celebrated chemists, Mr. Davy
converted eight grains of potassium into muriate of potash, by burn
ing it in muriatic acid gas. Now, according to the experiments of
Berthollet, recently published, eight grains of potash would make just
twelve grains of muriate of potash, by the addition of four grains of
acid. But the eight grains of potassium received an increase of six
grains and a half, making fourteen grains and a half of dry muriate of
potash, of which 41%ths must be acid, according to Berthollet's esti
mation, and consequently there are 14%ths of oxygen added to the
potassium instead of hydrogen being extricated from                                it.

                         voltaic electricity, but without success. Phos
phuret     lime was next substituted for potassium, but the nitrogen
was not decomposed.        Nitrogen was next mixed with oxymuriatic
acid, and passed through red-hot tube, without effecting any de
                                              a
composition.

cesses, the original grounds for supposing oxygen present     ammo                            in
nia remain.   The amalgam produced from ammonia, which yields
ammonia again               by
                     apparent oxidation, might lead    the inference               to

that both hydrogen and nitrogen are oxides; but from the action of
potassium on ammonia, it would rather appear that nitrogen alone
is in that instance decomposed.
   But there is great difficulty in reasoning upon the precise nature
of this amalgam, on account of the presence of water, which it is at
least extremely difficult to avoid, as the amalgam cannot be formed
in dry ammoniacal gas, nor by means of any dry compound of am
monia yet tried.
   The driest amalgam is that formed by an alloy in which potassium
is also present. In endeavouring to distil ammonium from this com
pound, there is always a partial regeneration of ammonia mixed with
about one third hydrogen; and if the proportion of oxygen contained
in ammonia be inferred from this product, it would appear to be forty
eight per cent., a result which agrees with the quantity which might
be presumed to exist in ammonia, from the proportion in which it
unites with acids. But if the proportion of hydrogen to ammonia
thus evolved be less than that of one to two, the results will not ac
cord; and then, says Mr. Davy, it may reasonably be supposed that
hydrogen and nitrogen are both oxides, either of the same metal or
of different metallic bases. But                    if,

thesis be all metallic; some of them being as yet known only in
combination, as those of sulphur, of phosphorus, and some others.
   But a phlogistic hypothesis might also be framed, so as to account
for all the phenomena with equal facility; the principal argument in
favour of it being derived from the easy reduction of metals in pre
sence of hydrogen. The ultimate predominance of one or the other
hypothesis must, in the author's estimation, depend upon the nature
of ammonia, of which the supposed elements do not present pheno
mena analogous to those of other simple bodies.      Sulphur, for    in
stance, whether combined with hydrogen or with oxygen, has acid
properties; but nitrogen combined with one of those bodies is an     al
kali, and with the other an acid; so that in nitrate of ammonia,     ni
trogen is neutralized by nitrogen.
   Mr. Davy finally adduces some new facts which accord with Mr.
Dalton's hypothesis respecting the apparent union of ultimate atoms
in a given relation by weight; and he also mentions some new instances
in conformity to the observation of M. Gay-Lussac, that the different
compounds of gaseous bodies are related in simple arithmetical pro
portions by measure.
The Case of a Man, who died in consequence of the Bite of a Rattle
  snake; with an Account of the Effects produced by the Poison.   By
  Everard Home,   Esq. F.R.S. Read December      21,  1809.    [Phil.
  Trans. 1810, p. 75.]
   Thomas Soper, 26 years of age, was bitten by a rattlesnake on
the 17th of October. The snake had refused to bite a ruler with which
it had been teased, but as soon as the man introduced his hand into
the cage for the purpose of taking out the ruler which had dropped in
by accident, the snake seized his hand, and made two bites in suc
cession, one on the thumb, and another on the fore-finger. The first
person who saw him immediately after the bite supposed him to be
intoxicated, and treated him accordingly; but though it is known
that he had been drinking, Mr. Home is inclined to ascribe the inco
herence of his language and behaviour to the effect of the poison.
   In the course of half an hour a swelling had taken place on his
hand, and half way up the fore-arm, with a great deal of pain. In an
hour and half it reached the elbow; in two hours it extended half
way up toward the shoulder, with much pain in the axilla. The
man's answers were incoherent, his skin cold, his pulse 100 in a mi
nute, and he complained of sickness at the stomach.
   In the course of eight or nine hours the pain became extremely
violent, the swelling very tense, so that the arteries could not be per
ceived with accuracy, and no pulse could be felt in any part of       it.
He was seized with fits  of faintness every quarter   of   an
                                                            hour.
   The following morning his pulse was extremely feeble, and 132
                                                                       to in
a minute.    The swelling had not extended beyond the shoulder
the neck, but there was fullness
                         a          of that side down  to the loins, with
a mottled  appearance  from extravasation   of  blood.   The arm conti

                                                355
nued cold, and painful when pressed, with several vesications near
the elbow. The skin of the whole arm had a livid appearance, simi
lar to what is met with in the dead body after putrefaction has begun
to take place.
   On the third day in the morning his pulse was scarcely percepti
ble; his extremities were cold; and the vesications were larger: but
the swelling of the arm was diminished, and he had sensation in it
down to the fingers. On the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and
ninth days the swelling continued subsiding, but more painful; and
his pulse rising in strength, and diminishing in frequency.             But on
the tenth, his pulse had increased, and the arm was again swelled
and inflamed. On the twelfth a large slough began to separate from
the inside of the arm, below the axilla; and on the following day a
large abscess had formed on the outside of the elbow, and discharged
a quantity of reddish matter, with slough of cellular membrane
floating in      it.
   On the sixteenth,        appeared that mortification had taken place
                                it                                                                     on

An Analysis of several Varieties of British and Foreign Salt (Muriate
    of Soda), with a view to explain their Fitness for different economical
    Purposes.    By William Henry, M.D. F.R.S., Vice-Pres. of the
    Literary and Philosophical Society, and Physician to the Infirmary, at
    Manchester. Read January 25, 1810. [Phil. Trans. 1810, p. 89.]
    An opinion having for some time prevailed, both in this and in
other countries, to the prejudice of British salt as a preserver of ani
mal food, and large sums of money being annually paid to foreign
nations, in conformity to this opinion, for the supply of an article
which Great Britain possesses beyond almost any other country in
Europe, Dr. Henry has been induced to undertake the present in
quiry, for the purpose of ascertaining whether the preference of foreign
salt be founded on accurate experiments, or merely a matter of pre
judice; and in the former case, whether any chemical difference
could be discovered that would explain that superiority.
    The subject is divided into three parts: in the first of which are
contained, general observations on the different kinds of salt manu
factured, and the modes of preparing them. The second division
contains the general statement of the results of the experiments, and
conclusions deducible from them.        But since a long detail of analy
tical processes must be uninteresting to very many persons, to whom
the results will be acceptable, the description of the method em
ployed by Dr. Henry, in his analysis, is reserved for the last section,
in which (as the author observes) are not to be expected any novel
ties in science, but merely a careful selection and employment of
known processes.
    The principal sources of the salt manufactured in this country are:
the rock salt of Cheshire; the brine springs, which are also mostly
in the same district; and sea water, which cannot be evaporated ar
tificially with profit, excepting where fuel is cheap.
    Concerning the preparation of salt in Cheshire, Dr. Henry extracts
a brief statement from an excellent history given by Mr. Henry Hol
land, in the agricultural report of the county of Chester; and he no
tices four varieties.
    First. That which is called stoved or lump salt. Second. Called
common salt.   Third. Large-grained flaky salt. Fourth. Fishery salt;-
the difference among these depending principally on the degree of
heat used for evaporation of the brine.
    The stoved salt is prepared by rapid evaporation at a boiling heat
of 226°Fahrenheit, and it obtains its name from being subsequently
dried in stoves after being well drained.
    For making common salt, the brine is evaporated at a temperature
between 160° and 170°; and as the salt is consequently formed in
 somewhat larger grains, it is merely drained, and does not require to
be dried in stoves as the former.      The name of the third, or large
 grained flaky salt, implies a slower process of crystallization, and it
is conducted at a temperature of 130 or 140 degrees.
    The last, or fishery salt, which is the largest, is prepared at a heat

                                                            357
of 100 or 110 degrees.      This process is so slow as to last seven or
eight days, instead of eight or ten hours, which is the shortest time
employed in the first mode of evaporating the same quantity of brine,
and accordingly the salt forms in large cubical crystals, proper to the
muriate of soda.
   Of these varieties, the stoved salt is that which is usually em
ployed for domestic purposes. The common salt is consumed prin
cipally in the salting of provisions that are not intended for sea
voyages.    But for this last purpose, the large-grained or fishery salt
is peculiarly fitted.
   With respect to the preparation of salt from sea-water, the author
takes notice of the process employed on the coasts of Scotland, both
east and west, where, from the cheapness of fuel, artificial heat alone
is used; and of the salt-works at Lymington in Hampshire, where
advantage is taken of a milder climate for removing five sixths of
the water by spontaneous evaporation, previous to        admission into                 its
the boilers.
   Since the evaporation       each    these works

Sunday salt. At Lymington, there are also formed,             drippings                           by
from the salt during                   its
                          drainage, large stalactical masses, termed
salt-cats, weighing sixty     eighty pounds each; but these
                                             or                 not ex                                 do

     Of the several salts above described, the large-grained fishery salt
is that which most resembles the foreign bay-salt                 appearance;                in
and   infact (says the author,)       large proportion a     what      sold             of          is            in

                by    iron. The native rock salt
coloured     oxide             or of                  Cheshire also                      of
contains    muchas   more    insoluble impurity, which
                                                  of       chiefly                                 is
marly earth, with some sulphate       lime.  The earthy muriates of                                               of a
lime and magnesia abound most       salt which   prepared    inrapid            is                      by
evaporation          of
               sea water.
   Since common salt contains extremely little water    crystalliza                           of

                                              358
tion, it is pretty evident that the earthy muriates discovered in the
analysis of sea salt are derived from the portion of the mother water
which adheres to the salt after being drained; and accordingly, those
salts prepared from sea water that are smallest grained, and conse
quently have the largest proportion of interstice, are debased by the
largest proportional quantity of this species of impurity. But of this
impurity the Cheshire salts are nearly free, as they do not contain
 one part in 1000 of earthy muriates; and indeed it is scarcely possi
 ble that any portion of Cheshire prepared salt can contain more,
 since the rock itself does not contain more than 5 in 1000; while
 on the contrary, in sea water, the earthy muriates amount to no less
 than ºths       of the entire quantity of salt contained.  Dr. Henry
 pays particular attention to these muriates, because the propensity of
 common salt to deliquesce by attracting moisture from the atmosphere,
 depends in great measure (though not entirely) on the presence of
these deliquescent compounds.
   Since in the analysis of salts nominally the same, great difference
often occurred even in examination by the same process, Dr. Henry
endeavoured to trace the origin of this disagreement of his results.
And, as he conceived it might arise from the different degrees of pu
rity of the liquor in different stages of     evaporation,        its
                                                               procured                           he

    The difference between the large-grained fishery salt and the bay
 salt of foreign manufacture is so inconsiderable, that although the
 superiority of the former in chemical purity may not be considered
as of any advantage for economical purposes, yet in its mechanical
 qualities it cannot be said to be inferior in a degree that can be pre
judicial.
    The methods of analysis employed by the author in this inquiry
are next described.        The salt to be examined was first dried at a
given temperature of 180°. The earthy muriates were then sepa
rated by alcohol, and their aggregate weight ascertained after evapo
ration of the alcohol.        An aliquot part was next dissolved, and the
lime   precipitated  first by  carbonate of ammonia, after which the mag
nesia was separated       by  phosphate of soda, as a triple ammoniacal
phosphate of magnesia.           A previous trial having shown that 100
grains of dry muriate of magnesia would give 151 of the triple
phosphate, the quantity of muriate of magnesia was inferred from
this latter precipitate, and the difference between that and the ag
gregate weight of the two muriates was considered as muriate of
lime. Sometimes the estimation was formed in a different way, by
superoxalate of potash, which was found to occasion a precipitate of
 116 grains from 100 dry muriate of lime; and thence, as before, the
weights of each might be inferred.
    For estimating the earthy sulphates, the quantity of original salt
 that remained after affusion of alcohol was dissolved by long boiling
 in water; the earths were precipitated as carbonates by carbonate of
 soda. The sulphuric acid was separated by muriate of barytes, and
thence estimated. The earths were then re-dissolved in sulphuric
acid, dried, and their weight ascertained.              Of these sulphates, the
more soluble part was dissolved in a small quantity of warm water,
and the magnesia precipitated, as in the former case, as a triple
phosphate of magnesia.
    It was found that 100 grains of this precipitate indicate 111 of
crystallized sulphate of magnesia; and hence the respective quan
tities of the two sulphates was known : but since it was possible
that some proportion of alkaline sulphates might be also present,
some collateral experiments were necessary for the purpose of ascer
taining whether the sulphuric acid obtained above by muriate of ba
rytes, corresponded with that which would be contained in the mere
quantities of sulphate of magnesia and sulphate of lime discovered

                                   360
to be present.    The quantity of sulphate of barytes produced from
100    grains of sulphate   of lime was accordingly ascertained, and
found to be    1759;   and 100 grains of crystallized sulphate of mag
nesia were found to give 112 of sulphate of barytes.        And since the
aggregate quantity of sulphuric acid obtained from any quantity of
salt examined was found to agree with the above proportions, it
was inferred that no alkaline sulphate was present in any of the
varieties of muriate of soda, whether of English or foreign manufac
ture.
    In addition to the author's account of the methods pursued in his
analyses, he also mentions various objects of inquiry respecting the
preparation of salt, which may be interesting to chemical readers 
such as the specific gravity of the original brine of Cheshire, and its
original contents; the specific gravity of mother liquors, and their
 ultimate contents; the clearings of brine, which are raked out as
 soon as the salt begins to granulate; the pan-scale, that forms as a
 hard crust, attached to the pan in which the brine is evaporated;
 and the varieties in this scale, under different circumstances.
    The difference between sea-water and the brine from salt-springs
is also stated, and the extreme difference also of the residua obtained
from the respective mother liquors, especially in respect to muriate
of magnesia; since the mother liquors of Cheshire contain only 35
parts in 1000, while that of the other amounts to 874; the mere
refuse of the Cheshire processes being nearly equal in purity to some
kinds of salt prepared from sea-water.
Description of an extraordinary Human Fætus.            In a Letter from
    Mr. Benjamin Gibson, Surgeon, to H. Leigh Thomas, Esq. F.R.S.
    Read February 8, 1810.       [Phil. Trans. 1810, p. 123.]
    Although instances of human bodies nearly entire, united side by
side, or back to back, or otherwise, are by no means rare in the col
 lections of anatomists; and although such a conjunction is generally
 not connected with any peculiarity in the organs which compose them,
and lead the physiologist to anticipate nothing curious in their inter
mal configuration;yet, where some parts are found double, and others
single, the resources of nature become apparent in adjusting parts
which have naturally no connexion.         Such is the instance here de
scribed; and it appears peculiarly interesting, from the consideration,
that the system of deviation was apparently compatible with life; for
if the difficulty of the birth had not proved almost immediately fatal,
 the complexity of the structure would probably have formed no im
pediment to its existence.
    This curious production had two heads, placed side by side, united
 to one body, with two legs and two arms. The countenance of the
 one appeared to the author to be male, and of the other female; and
 the conformation of the organs of generation, which partook of both
 sexes, confirmed that persuasion.
    The trunk, though appearing as one body, was broader than       natu

                                               361
ral;   and   it was evident,        even from external           examination, that there
were two spines corresponding to the two heads. These were found
to terminate in a double os sacrum, tipped with two ossa coccygis;
there were consequently two vertebral canals, independent of each
 other. The chest in front was nearly as usual, with the common
number of ribs on each side; but there were also, in the middle of
the back, short bones, which must be considered as ribs connecting
the two spines to each other.
    The chest was divided by its mediastinum into two cavities. In
the right was one lung connected with the right head, and in the
left another belonging to the left head, without any mutual commu
nication. On inspecting the vascular system, there were found to be
two hearts; that on the left, and corresponding with the male head,
was much the larger of the two; but they both had the usual num
 ber of auricles, and were inclosed in separate pericardia.
    The principal difference in the distribution of their vessels was ob
servable in the veins; as the vena cava superior was wanting on the
right side, and the right heart received            blood  its the vena cava by
inferior alone; while that        the left had its principal supply by
                                     on                                                               a
large vena cava superior, which brought the blood from the jugulars
of  the right head and right subclavian,           well    as
                                                           from thoseas    its                   of
own side. But,             on
                        the contrary, the vena cava inferior was com
paratively very small.
    With respect      the arteries, the difference was not considerable,
                       to
as  they each sent off their respective aorta and pulmonary artery,
and each supplied their respective head by two carotids, and their
corresponding arm by one axillary artery; after which the two
arches united into one trunk              as
                                     descending aorta.

longing     tothe female were even here apparent; and, upon internal
examination,          an
                   uterus was discovered imbedded        the posterior    in
part   of
        the  bladder,  from which   Fallopian tubes were given off                                    at
each side near its upper  part.
  The author next examined carefully the distribution        the nerves,          of
and found,     general, extremely little connexion between them, ex
                 in
cepting     the semilunar ganglion, which was composed
            at                                                    nerves               of

to  the semilunar ganglion.
    A  pair     intercostals also proceeded from each head. The left
                  of
 intercostal from one, and the right intercostal from the other, pro
 ceeded      usual; but those which passed down between the two
             as
 spines, and adjacent         each other, neither gave off nor received
                                    to
 communicating branches, and did not form the usual ganglia, for
want    of   all
              the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar nerves excepting the first
 cervical. The other nerves were          general distributed

what more capacious than usual. Although the vascular system was
furnished with two hearts, the principal vessels were arranged and

Observations   on the Effects    of Magnesia, in preventing an increased
   Formation of Uric    Acid;   with some Remarks on the Composition of
   the Urine.     Communicated by Mr. William T. Brande, F.R.S. to
   the Society for the Improvement of Animal Chemistry, and by them
   to the Royal Society. Read February 22, 1810. [Phil. Trans. 1810,
   p. 136.]
   Mr. Home's inquiries into the functions of the stomach, and his
discovery of liquids passing directly from the cardiac portion into the
circulation of the blood, occasioned him to consider the prevention of
calculous complaints, by correcting the generation of acid in the sto
mach, and consequent secretion of uric acid.
    Since magnesia was better adapted to the mere correction of acidity
than alkalies, as it could not be absorbed till it had been previously
dissolved, Mr. Home was desirous of examining its effects in pre
venting the generation of uric acid, and requested Mr. Brande's as
sistance for that purpose.
    After several previous trials, in which it appeared that an excessive
secretion of uric acid was corrected by magnesia more than by a
liberal use of alkalies, it was afterwards tried in various cases of con
firmed calculus; and four cases are selected as instances of the prin
cipal varieties of that disorder, from many others in which magnesia
was tried.
    The first was that of a gentleman       of 60, who had passed small
 calculi of uric acid.
    He had first taken subcarbonate of soda in water highly impreg
nated with carbonic acid, to the quantity of nine drachms in a day,
but without any apparent effect on the secretion and formation of
 uric concretions.
    He then took, in the same manner, subcarbonate of potash, dis
 solved in water impregnated with carbonic acid, to the quantity of
 three drachms every day; but though the deposit of sand from the
 urine was in some degree diminished, yet small calculi continued
 occasionally to be voided.
     On the contrary, by taking as much as fifteen grains of magnesia
 three times a day, the quantity of uric acid was diminished in quan
 tity; and after three weeks was only occasionally perceived in his
 urine.
     The second case is that of a gentleman 40 years of age, who for
 four years preceding had occasionally passed much red sand, and
  once a small calculus.
     Subcarbonate of soda was first given him in water highly impreg
  nated with carbonic acid, which had the effect of diminishing the
  secretion of uric acid, but not of preventing occasional severe attacks
  after irregularities in his diet.
     Magnesia was next directed, to the quantity of twenty grains every
  night and morning; and during six weeks' continuance of this pre
  ventive, he had no return of his complaint, and no superabundance
  of uric acid in the urine.

                                            364
  The third was a gentleman of 43, who had passed three small cal
culi, and whose urine had for a short time been constantly turbid,
and occasionally deposited red sand.
   By the use of soda-water, these symptoms were diminished, but
returned in some degree even during the continued use of it; and
his urine became also loaded with mucus.
     By taking twenty grains of magnesia every night, the uric acid
diminished in quantity, but did not disappear entirely, even by the
continued use of magnesia for three weeks in the same quantity.   It
was then repeated every night and morning for a month, and suc
ceeded in restoring the urine to a perfectly healthy state. Upon a
return of the disorder, he had recourse again to the magnesia, with
the same effect.
   The fourth patient was subject to gout, and occasionally voided
abundance of red sand, consisting of uric acid.     He was subject to
heart-burn, and to other pains attendant upon weakness of stomach,
for which he had been in the habit of taking tincture of bark and
other spirituous medicines.   He had also tried the use of alkalies,
but could not continue them on account of the unpleasant sensation
they occasioned in his stomach.
   Magnesia was accordingly given, at first three times a day, and
afterwards in a quantity of twenty grains twice every day; and it
had the effect of lessening the disposition to form uric acid, and ap
peared also at least to suspend the attacks of gout for a greater
length of time than he had been accustomed to.
   Comparative trials were afterwards made of the effects of the al
kalies and of magnesia upon healthy urine.
   Two drachms of subcarbonate of soda seemed to Mr. Brande to
produce        its
             full effect upon the urine         quarter
                                                      in   a   hour afterof   an                     it

consisting of the triple phosphate of magnesia. Though his stomach
did not admit the use of stronger acids, the carbonic acid proved
highly grateful; and by examination of his urine, it appeared that
the phosphates, which before were voided as a sediment of white
sand, were now passed only in a state of complete solution, by means
of the redundant acid.
Supplement to the First and Second Part of the Paper of Experiments
   for Investigating the Cause of Coloured Concentric Rings between
    Object-glasses, and other Appearances of a similar Nature.      By
   William Herschel, LL.D. F.R.S. Read March 15, 1810. [Phil.
    Trans. 1810, p. 149.]
   The Supplement now offered to the Society, is intended to clear
up certain points which have been represented to the author as ob
scure or doubtful in his former communications, and at the same time
to connect more intimately the prismatic experiments of the second
paper with those made upon convex glasses, and described in the
author's first paper on the subject.
    Since Dr. Herschel has heard the originality of his observation of
the red bow called in question, upon the ground that a red bow had
been observed by Sir Isaac Newton, which is merely the converse of
the blue bow (the change of colour being dependent upon the di
rection in which the light is received upon the prism), Dr. Herschel
first endeavours to answer the objection, and reminds us that in his
former observations the angular breadth and elevation of the two
bows are different; but those of the Newtonian blue and red bows
are said to be, and are, necessarily equal.    In the Newtonian expe
riment   also, the same beam of  light is made to exhibit both pheno
mena, being received upon two right-angled prisms, applied base to
base, so that one portion of the light is reflected upwards, as a blue
bow from the under surface of the first prism; and the remainder,
by transmission, through the second prism, appears as a red bow to
an eye beneath.      But in Dr. Herschel's experiment, the same prism
is made to exhibit, to an eye in the same situation, the red bow as
well as the blue, by means of light transmitted in an opposite di
rection through the under surface of the prism, without any occasion
for a second prism, which (as Dr. Herschel observes) is necessary in
the Newtonian method of conducting the experiment.
    The next objection replied to by Dr. Herschel, regards the streaks
that may be seen adjacent to the bows, when a second surface is ap
plied to that side of a prism at which a critical separation of the co
lours takes place. It has been said that streaks parallel to the bows,
though not dependent on critical separation, will in that situation be
seen most easily and most distinctly, because the visual ray, under
those circumstances, passes with the greatest obliquity between the
surfaces.
    To this objection Dr. Herschel replies, that these streaks not only

                                   366
can be seen most easily and most distinctly in the place where the
bows are, but they absolutely cannot be seen anywhere else.
   The parallelism also of the streaks to the bows, in the author's
estimation, proves that the same cause which determines the direc
tion of the bow, must determine that of the streaks, and thus esta
blishes their dependence on critical separation.
   Dr. Herschel also contends, that streaks of different colours could
not be produced by a plate of air, of uniform thinness, between plain
surfaces, and that the prevalence of a blue colour in the streaks be
longing to the blue bow, and of the converse in those belonging to
the red bow, prove their dependence on critical separation.
    Since it has been conceived by other persons, that by means of a
plateof air, having theform of an extremely thinwedge, straight bands
of colour would be produced between plain surfaces slightly inclined
to each other; and as an experiment in support of this opinion had
been shown to the author, he gives his own explanation of the fact:
and he ascribes the production of the colours to distortion of the sur
faces, because a degree of force was in that instance employed for
the purpose of producing the requisite contact at one extremity of
the glass.     And since in other experiments, made with perfectly
plain surfaces, where no pressure was employed no streaks could
be seen, Dr. Herschel concludes that when streaks are seen, the sur
faces employed are either not plain in their general extent, or are
terminated by some inconceivably small curvature at the edges in
contact.
    It has, in the next place, been observed to the author, that in the
enlarged figure which he has given in his last paper to illustrate the
streaks, the vacancies observable correspond with, and depend upon,
the assumed intervals between the rays, which in that figure are re
presented as originally separated by blank spaces.
    Dr. Herschel admits that there is some plausibility in this objection,
but informs us, that the supposed force of it is founded on a miscon
ception of the figure, which is not designed to represent the visible
arrangement and colours of the streaks, which can only be deduced
from their mixture at the place where they enter the eye; but he de
clines a thorough investigation of this point, because it would really
be an endless undertaking.
    One section of the present communication is devoted to the con
sideration of the breadth of the streaks compared to that of the bows,
and the cause why they must take up a broader space than the bows
from which they are derived; because it has been remarked, that this
circumstance precludes the possibility of accounting for them by cri
tical separation.     But although this remark may at first view appear
to be  justified, it must be remembered (says the author) that the mo
difying power of the surfaces is added to the principle of the critical
 separation.    The modification specifically named by the author, is
that of reflection by the plain surface held under the prism, which,
in the first instance, magnified the extent to 2% times the breadth of
the bow; and if the reflection be repeated any number of times be

                                    367
tween the two adjacent surfaces, it may increase the extent in any
greater proportion.
     The last objection to which the author replies, relates to those po
sitions in which rings of colours, and other similar phenomena, are
seen, but in which the colours produced by critical separation could
not reach the eye. For instance, rings and bands of colour, which
arise from contact at the under surface of a plate of glass terminated
by parallel planes, are seen through the upper surface, although co
lours separated by critical reflection or intermission, evidently could
not come to the eye under these circumstances.           But Dr. Herschel
reminds us, that he does not affirm critical separation to be the sole
cause of the rings produced by contact of a plane and sphere, but
that it only furnishes the colours, which are afterwards modified by
the subjacent spherical surface; and next proceeds to several sets of
experiments, which he considers decisive in support of the validity
of his theory, in reply to this objection.
     In the first set of experiments a series of prisms, of different forms,
 are successively placed within their bases, resting upon a spherical
 metallic surface.
     When a right-angled prism was placed in this situation, and the
 eye was gradually raised from a level with its base, no colours were
 seen till it arrived at the elevation necessary for critical separation.
 At this point the blue bow became visible, and rings began to be per
 ceived at the same time.       When the eye was lifted gradually higher
 and higher, till it arrived opposite to the vertex of the prism, the
 rings continued visible, without interruption, notwithstanding suc
 cessive changes which occurred in their colours and size: and even
 when the eye was carried beyond the vertical position, the same rings
 continued visible, so as to be seen, upon the whole, through a range
 of at least 77°.
      Instead of the right-angled prism, having a refracting angle of 45°
 on each side, Dr. Herschel afterwards substituted prisms with their
 vertical angles successively more obtuse, and with equal refracting
 angles on each side, first of 30°, then of 25°, then of 20°, and lastly
  of 9° on each side.
      In all these instances the phenomena were similar; but the range
  of visibility increased in proportion as the refracting angle was
  smaller, so that in the last instance the range within which the rings
  were visible from each surface, exceeded 138°. And hence might be
  inferred the still greater extent, in case of plain glass, which may be
  looked upon as a prism with a vanishing refracting angle.
       These experiments, in Dr. Herschel's estimation, establish the mo
  difying power of spherical surfaces, whereby they render colours that
  have been entirely separated, visible in every direction.
       In the next set of experiments, the author substitutes a cylindrical
   surface for that which in the former set was spherical; and by a       si
   milar series of prisms, successively more and more obtuse at their
   vertical angles, the coloured streaks, which in this case appeared
   instead of rings, were rendered visible to greater and greater extent,
   till with a plain glass they were seen as far as 170°.

                                                                        368
           In
          third set of experiments, conducted in the same manner, the
                a
 under surface brought into contact with the prisms, consisted of mica,
 rendered nearly cylindrical by being bent over a cylindrical surface.
    From the irregularity in the form of the mica, that of the colours
 was also irregular; but they served to show the increase of extent to
 which such appearances may be rendered visible by corresponding
 change of the angle of the prism. * *                     . . . . .      9  º'                                     tº
    Dr. Herschel is    consequently     of opinion,   that   any  one who could
 object to the admission of critical separation as the cause of the phe
 nomena under consideration, cannot have paid sufficient attention to
 the modifying power of the subjacent reflecting surface, which is so
 essential to their formation.

some other cause than critical separation, unless it can be shown how
rays critically separated can reach the eye, the author ºthinks: it is
 not to be expected that, he should trace them through a most intri
cate complication of reflections from curve to curve, when it has been
shown, in the second part of this paper, that,even with streaks pro
duced by contact of two plain surfaces, it would be an endless attempt
to follow them. He accordingly, thinks it sufficient to have proved,
                          º
to his own satisfaction, two essential points; first, that colours sepa
rated critically may be formed into rings, when modification will in
crease the

                                                 of
in  mind the analogy that subsists,           many respects, between the    in
organs              of
           animals and those       vegetables;       though   ofmay not                   for                  it               be

such considerations, it is not improbable that, on the contrary, some
new light may be thrown upon the functions of the animal economy
by investigations respecting those of vegetables, where the necessary
experiments may be repeated any number of times, and where the
influence of efficient or defective organs may be observed with the
most deliberate attention.
    The parts separately noticed on the present occasion, are the roots,
the stem, and the leaves. The roots and leaves have been compared
by all naturalists, both ancient and modern, to the intestines and
lungs of animals. The analogy also, between the sap of vegetables
and the blood of animals, is very obvious; and the circulation of sap
in the former, as far as is necessary to, or consistent with, their state
of existence, is very satisfactorily established by the experiments for
merly communicated to us by Mr. Knight, in addition to those made
by other naturalists.
    With  respect to the roots, no experiments appeared wanting to
determine that no defect in the action of this organ occurs from age,
and consequently that the debility and diseases of old varieties of
fruit were not derived from this source. The duration of roots, in
old coppices, that are felled at stated periods, appeared to the author
sufficient to establish that the quantity of produce is not diminished
by age of the roots. The inability also, of a seedling stock to give
the character of youth to an inserted bud or graft, seemed to prove
how little is effected by undoubted youth of the root.
    Mr. Knight ascertained, however, by an experiment of an opposite
nature, that the stock may be affected by the graft.        By planting
cuttings of some very old varieties of apple, he obtained stocks which
would soon have manifested the usual appearances of age. At the
end of two years these were grafted, at about two inches from the
 ground, with new and luxuriant varieties; and at the end of five
years the roots were examined, and were found to contain ten times
 as much alburnum as they would probably have contained if they
 had not been grafted; and they were also wholly free from disease.
    Another kind of experiment was next made upon the effect of
 grafting young wood upon old, the old having first been grafted upon
 a young stock, in a situation where it would not have survived the
 second or third year.     But when a portion of an old golden pippin
 was thus included between two portions of a crab, the wood was
 found to grow just as well, and to be just as healthy as the stock
 and branches.
    In other experiments the author tried the effect of placing young
 grafts upon old ones, that had long since become cankered. The old
 ones being cut off at the distance of a foot from their original junc
 tion, he regrafted them with new and healthy varieties, and he found
 that they became, in consequence, perfectly freed from every appear
 ance of canker.
    The author having thus ascertained that the debilities of old va
 rieties of fruit-trees did not originate in any defective action of the
                                     2 B

bark or alburnum of either the stem or the root, he proceeded to                                                      in
vestigate the states of the leaf, and of the succulent annual shoot.
With this view various grafts of the golden pippin, which were known
to be liable to decay, were inoculated with buds of new varieties;
and in the ensuing winter their own natural buds were removed, and
those that had been inserted were alone allowed to remain. As soon
as the leaves of these began to appear, every symptom of disease was
removed; and each part of the branch of the golden pippin thus re
generated, appeared to perform             office     well       its

defective leaves, according         his former views  to    the functions they          of
perform,       preparing and assimilating the sap transmitted through

                  observes, that the deficiency        power       the leaves   of                in                   is

    As his instrument  had the advantage of being fixed upon stone
piers, which are not liable to partial expansion, and as the size of
the instrument itself seemed to him better adapted to determining
the real quantity of atmospherical refraction than any which had
been before employed for the same purpose, he extended the range
of his observations as low down towards his north horizon as his
situation would permit.     For this purpose he selected fifty stars of
different polar distances, and of these he made, upon the whole, up
wards of 1000 observations.
   The observed zenith distances being first corrected by the usual

    In the   kanguroo,   and others of the    opossum   tribe in New South
Wales, there is a communication between the uterus and vagina,
which answers the same purpose of acrating the foetal blood, which is
necessary in these animals; because the young is not, as in others,
connected with the uterus by a navel-string, but is detached as a sort
of soft egg, and consequently cannot receive the influence of the ar
terial blood of the mother through the coats of any contiguous
vessels.
On Cystic      Oride, a new species of Urinary Calculus. By William
  *  Hyde    Wollaston,   M.D. Sec. R.S. Read July 5, 1810. [Phil.
    Trans.   1810,  p.  223.]
    The calculus, which is the subject of the present essay, is the only
new species which the author has had an opportunity of observing, in
addition to five which he described to the Society in the year 1797.
    It appears to be comparatively very rare, as he has hitherto seen .
only two specimens of it; one in the possession of Dr. Reeve of
Norwich, and the other in a collection of calculi belonging to Guy's
Hospital. They are in appearance more like the triple phosphate of
magnesia than any other calculus, but are more compact and semi
transparent, with a slight tinge of yellow.
    By destructive distillation they yield foetid carbonate of ammonia,
with a heavy animal oil, and the residuum is a black spongy coal.
    They are not dissolved by water, by alcohol, by acetic acid, by
tartaric acid, but are dissolved by most other acids, by muriatic, ni
tric, sulphuric, phosphoric or oxalic acids.
    They are dissolved also by most alkaline menstrua, as by solutions
of pure potash or soda, pure ammonia, or by lime-water, and even by
the fully saturated carbonates of potash or of soda, but not by car
bonate    of ammonia.           * *       3.
    It is  remarked also, that the solution formed with mitric acid does
not    yield  oxalic acid, as the uric acid does when similarly treated,
and does not turn red in drying, but becomes brown, and ultimately
black, when much heated.
     Since this substance yields carbonate of ammonia by distillation,
 it  evidently contains oxygen, but it does not appear acid, as it does
 not redden litmus, but has rather the properties of an oxide, inas
 much as it unites readily with either acid or alkaline substances;
 and the author is induced to give it the name of cystic oxide, be
 cause the only calculi hitherto observed have been taken from the
                              -     -       -
 bladder.
     The author takes this opportunity of correcting an inaccuracy or
 two in his former communication on this subject; and he also adds

   The tendency                  of   the author       in   the present investigation,                     is     to   re
turn     the opinion respecting the relation
            to                                      muriatic acid and oxy       of

                             to     which was    originally  entertained                                                by
Scheele.
    According      that most illustrious chemist, the oxymuriatic was
                           to
the more simple body, and by union with phlogiston became muriatic
acid. But from many experiments made soon after by Berthollet,                                                         it
was inferred that the latter was simple, and             union with oxygen           by
became converted into      oxymuriatic   acid.      Mr. Davy's former at        In

            obtain the base      muriatic acid   by

 no instance been able        separate oxygen from oxymuriatic acid,
                                            to                                                                          or in

of the presence of oxygen in that acid: but Mr. Davy observes, that
an opposite doctrine may be equally maintained; since the metals may
consist of bases united with hydrogen, which, by combining with oxy
muriatic acid, converts it into muriatic acid. A corresponding doubt
occurs also respecting the nature of hyperoxygenized muriatic acid.

smell; it did not seem to be soluble in boiling water, nor even in
muriatic, mitric, or sulphuric acid; neither did strong lixivium of
caustic potash appear to produce the least effect; and the only pro
cesses by which it appeared to be affected were combustion, or the
action of fused potash.   In the latter case it emitted a smell of am
monia; it appeared to dissolve in the potash, which then gave indi
cation of the acids that had entered into the composition of this sin
gularly intractable substance.
    Amongst the known combustibles, it is observed that charcoal is
the only one which does not combine directly with oxymuriatic acid
gas; but Mr. Davy is of opinion that it does in some cases unite by
the medium of hydrogen, as in the state of olefiant gas, and in the
formation of muriatic ether. The author expresses a hope that new
and more correct views of the composition of muriatic salts will faci
litate their decomposition, and explain, in a satisfactory manner, va
rious economical processes, long since practised, for obtaining the

    Although the property of emitting light, which is possessed by
some animals, has appeared interesting to naturalists of all ages, and
 although many detached memoirs have been written upon the sub
ject, the author observes that the history of these animals is still ex
tremely imperfect; and he endeavours to supply the defect by enu
merating    all the different animals which,      his knowledge, possess

   Of the genus Fulgora, only three have been particularly noticed

     In none of these animals could Mr. Macartney discern that the
  luminous organs were supplied either with nerves, or with air tubes,
  better than other parts of their bodies.                    -
     With the  exception  of these insects, in which the light  is confined
  to particular parts, the exhibition of light appears to the author to
  depend on the presence of a fluid matter diffused throughout the
  whole body of the animal.                                           -
     By squeezing the fluid of two large Medusae into a glass of well
  water, it was rendered luminous for nearly an hour and a half. Agi
  tation also occasioned a fresh appearance of light after that period,
  and even after agitation ceased to produce any effect, an increase of
  temperature rendered it again luminous for a short time.
     Since the phenomena of animal light have been attempted to be
  explained in various ways by different authors, and since their expe
  riments are in many respects at variance with each other, the author
  adds a series of experiments of his own, from which he draws his
  own conclusions.
     A glow-worm lived, and emitted light, nearly two hours in a glass
  of water, though thus confined from oxygen.               -              º
     The luminous substance, after being extracted from glow-worms,
 gave no light.
    The luminous sacs, on the contrary, after having been cut out from
 the tail of the glow-worm, continued to emit light several hours in
 the atmosphere; and when put into water the power was prolonged
 to forty-eight hours.
    By application of heat they were not rendered more luminous, and
 had no tendency to active combustion, like phosphorus.
    The luminous part of the glow-worm appeared to raise a delicate
 thermometer, somewhat more than other parts of its body; but of
 this fact the author is not confident: but when the luminous sacs
 had been separated from the body of the animal, these had no effect
on the thermometer, though they continued to emit light.
    By heating some water containing Medusae, the brilliancy of their
light was very much increased; but they were killed in less than a
minute.
    Some of the same Medusae, being put into spirits of wine, emitted
immediately a strong light, which continued till they died.
    The Medusa scintillans, or hemisphaerica, being put under the re
ceiver of an air-pump, in a vessel of water, continued to emit light,
notwithstanding complete exhaustion of the air.
    A Medusa, upon being electrified by sparks from an electric ma
chine, was not excited to give out light. But when shocks were
transmitted through a collection of Medusae hemisphatrica,

    From these experiments, says the author, it appears that the        lu
minous substance is by no means of the nature of phosphorus, as it
often shows the strongest light when excluded from oxygen gas; and
so far from undergoing any process of combustion, it is incapable of
being inflamed; that the increase of heat during the shining of glow

                                    383
worms is merely an accompaniment, not an effect of the phenomenon;
and that heat and electricity act merely like other stimuli upon the
vital powers of the animal.
Observations    and Erperiments on Pus.       By George Pearson, M.D.
       F.R.S.   Read July 5, 1810.      [Phil. Trans. 1810, p. 294.]
    The author prefaces the account of his experiments and observa
tions on the nature and properties of purulent fluids, by an etymo
logical disquisition concerning the origin of the word Pus, and the
various senses which philologists may discover for the word rvos, be
sides the distinct signification given to it by Hippocrates, of a thick,
white, inodorous, uniformly smooth fluid, which is contained in an
abscess.     From the etymology, Dr. Pearson next proceeds to the
history of the several opinions that have been entertained respecting
the formation of purulent matters, and of the characters by which
different persons have endeavoured to distinguish real pus, from such
purulent fluids as ought rather to be considered as modifications of
 mucus.    Since nothing appears to have been added since the date of
 Mr. Home's dissertation on pus, which was written in the year 1798,
 Dr. Pearson's history concludes with an outline of Mr. Home's ac
 count of the nature of pus. According to him, pus is composed of
 globules swimming in a transparent aqueous fluid. The globules, on
 which its opacity depends, are formed subsequently to the secretion
 of the transparent fluid. They are not soluble in cold water, like
 those of blood, but are decomposed by boiling water; and the fluid
 in which they swim is not coagulable by heat, as serum, but is co
 agulable by sal-ammoniac, which does not coagulate serum.
     Dr. Pearson's examination of pus is divided into six sections, of
 which the first treats of the simple and obvious properties; and he
 distinguishes four different kinds of pus.
     1. The cream-like and equally consistent.
     2. The curdy of unequal consistence.
     3. The serous, or thin kind.
     4. The thick, viscid, or slimy.                                     -
     Of course, as he examines, under the name of pus, fluids so dif
 ferent from each other, he obtains results which differ accordingly
 in the qualities and quantities of their ingredients.        -          .
     In the second section the   agency  of caloric is observed.        -
     According to the author, all kinds of pus are coagulated between
  160° and 165° of Fahrenheit.       By continued heat the water is eva
 porated, and there remains a dry brittle mass, amounting to about
  one seventh or one eighth of the original weight.        By exposure to
  greater heat in a crucible of platina, the greatest part of this resi
  duum was consumed, and there remained only the salts of the serum
  fused together, and amounting to ++wth, rººdth, or ++wdth, of the
  original quantity of pus employed.             -
     These, says the author, consisted chiefly of muriate of soda, phos.
  phate of lime, potash, with strong indication of carbonate of lime,

                                                        384
and a sulphate, beside traces of phosphate of magnesia, oxide of iron,
and vitrifiable matter (probably silica).
   The different kinds of pus are next mixed with large quantities of
water, and the matter which subsides examined separately from the
water. In the same manner they are next mixed with alcohol, and
afterwards with acetic acid, but without any remarkable results.
Dr. Pearson also made various attempts to discover a criterion by
which to distinguish pus from mucus; but after trying the agency
of sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids, he says he could by these dis
cover no constant characteristic property of these substances by such
experiments.
  By alkalies also, he was not more successful; nor did the subse
quent addition of acids to the solution afford criteria which could be
depended upon, as has been supposed by other experimentalists.
After trial of several different neutral salts, he observed the same
effect from sal-ammoniac which had been noticed by Mr. Hunter,
and was considered by him as coagulation; but Dr. Pearson gives it
the name of inspissation, and observes, that this effect is not pro
duced in expectorated matter by the same salt; so that this is un
doubtedly a criterion, as it was supposed to be by Mr. Hunter.
   From the whole of his experiments, Dr. Pearson infers that pus
essentially consists of three distinct substances: first, an animal oxide
in the form of fine curdy particles, not soluble in water, not coagu
lable into one mass by hot water; secondly, a limpid fluid, like
serum of blood, and like it coagulable by heat or by alcohol; and
thirdly, innumerable spherical particles, visible only by the micro
scope, not soluble in hot or cold water, and specifically heavier
than water.
     He observes also, that other extraneous matters are sometimes
mixed with pus: that whenever pus is fetid, it is in the state of pu
trefactive fermentation; that the several ingredients in pus are pro
ducts of secretion; that the varieties of purulent matter depend on
the proportion of                its
                          essential ingredients; that the saline ingredients
before named are dissolved           the serous fluid, and that the quantity

to potash formed by the combustion of potassium, then water was
instantly formed, and oxymuriate of potassium.
    The phenomena when sodium or soda are employed, are precisely
analogous to the former; but the quantity of oxygen absorbed by
sodium, and extricated from it by oxymuriatic gas, is very nearly
twice as much as with potassium.
    When two parts of potassium are heated with common salt that
has been previously dried, the salt is decompounded; and one part
of sodium is obtained in a very pure state by an extremely easy pro
CeSS.
    From the experiments on sodium contained in the last Bakerian
lecture, Mr. Davy deduces the elementary number 22, as representing
the proportion in which it unites with different bodies.
    He observes also, that the proportions ascertained on the present
occasion to exist in the hydrates of potash and of soda, accord with
the supposition that they each contain one part of water, combined
with one of the respective alkali.
    The proportions also of potash or soda in different neutral com
binations by these estimates (says Mr. Davy), will be found to agree
very nearly with those derived from the most accurate analyses; and
as one instance, he refers to Dr. Marcet's analysis of muriate of soda.
    Since the muriates of barytes, lime, and strontia, when thoroughly
dried by exposure to a white heat, are not decomposable by boracic
acid, or by any simple attractions, Mr. Davy was led to suppose
that they consisted of their peculiar metallic bases, combined with
oxymuriatic gas; and he is confirmed in this opinion by the result
of other experiments; for when these earths are heated to redness
in oxymuriatic gas, the same dry muriates are formed, and oxygen
is expelled. The proportion which this oxygen bears to each earth,
Mr. Davy has not yet ascertained; but he found it to be in the con
stant ratio of one to two in volume of the oxymuriatic gas employed.
    When dry quick-lime was heated in muriatic gas, water was im
mediately formed; and it can hardly be doubted, says Mr. Davy,
that this arose from the union of hydrogen from the acid with oxygen
from the lime.
    The author next endeavoured to obtain the metals of barytes,
strontia, and lime, from their muriates by means of potassium; and
though he did not succeed in separating them, he is of opinion that
either the bases of the earths were wholly or partially deprived of
oxymuriatic gas by this process, or that the potassium had entered
into triple union with their muriates.
    When small portions of the common metals were heated in oxy
muriatic gas, they each inflamed, with the exception of gold, silver,
 and lead.
    The product from arsenic was butter of arsenic highly volatile;
 that from antimony was butter of antimony easily fused, but crystal
 lized when cold. Those from tellurium, zinc, and bismuth, were very
 similar to the preceding.

                                                              387
   The product from mercury was corrosive sublimate.
   The compound formed with iron was of a bright brown, iridescent,
like the Elba iron ore, volatile at a very moderate heat, and forming
brilliant crystals on the sides of the vessel.
     Tin    afforded Libavius's liquor, having its usual properties.
   When instead of the metals themselves their oxides were exposed
to the action of oxymuriatic gas, oxygen was given off, in most cases
at a heat below redness; and the quantity was the same as had been
previously absorbed by the metals.
   From the whole of the present series of experiments, Mr. Davy de
rives confirmation of his former opinion respecting the simple nature
of oxymuriatic gas, the leading property of which is               tendency                              its
unite with inflammable bases, forming binary compounds. Since                                                              its to

   The present lecture comprises the details         his experiments on             of
this subject.
   The first experiment was made upon        rabbit, the head      which
                                                                    a                                 of

were then inflated artificially once     five seconds, during twenty-five
                                                          in
minutes.    The circulation of the blood was found to continue the
whole     that time; but
          of                   was observed that no secretion
                                         it                         urine                              of
took place.
   The second experiment was made upon              middle-sized dog, for   a
the purpose     ascertaining also, whether the animal heat was kept
                     of
up   to   its
         natural standard.     At the end       two hours the pulse con
                                                                     of

at the end of two hours it had fallen                                      14°      in the thorax; and at the
end      of     the experiment 20°                    in the thorax.
        At
      the beginning of this experiment the ureters had been tied;
and at the end of the experiment it was found that no urine was col
lected above the ligature.
   The third experiment was made upon a rabbit; and the artificial
respiration was continued one hour and forty minutes.              A thermo
meter in the cavity of the abdomen fell in the first hour from 100° to
89°; and in the next forty minutes to 85°; but in the cavity of the
thorax it was as low as 82°.
   Since the blood in these experiments was observed to retain                                                                    its

common theory         animal heat,      retain also its proper temperature;

                       therefore became     necessary     attend particularly                   to

cause of general irritation.
   Upon examination of the carotids, they seemed to be somewhat
dilated, for about half an inch in length; but in other parts they
were not larger than natural.     The involuntary motions, which in
this lady were confined to the left side, were not in any degree af
fected by pressure of the carotids on that side; but when the right
carotid was strongly compressed, all the vibrations were uniformly
stopped; which, says the author, hardly could occur but from re
moval of undue pressure of the brain, and consequent excessive irri
tation.
On the Non-eristence of Sugar in the Blood of Persons labouring under
  Diabetes Mellitus. In a Letter to Alexander Marcet, M.D. F.R.S.
 from William Hyde Wollaston, M.D. Sec. R.S. Read January
  24, 1811. [Phil. Trans. 1811, p. 96.]
   Dr. Marcet, having been requested by Dr. Wollaston to examine
whether the serous fluid, secreted in consequence of the application
of a blister, could be impregnated with prussiate of potash, gave to
a young woman five grains of this prussiate, every hour, till she had
taken thirteen or fourteen such doses. After the fifth dose, when her
urine became blue immediately by addition of sulphate of iron, a
blister was applied, and the serum secreted in consequence was col
lected, whilst her urine still indicated the presence of the prussiate.
But in this serum no prussiate could be detected.
   Dr. Marcet also repeated Dr. Wollaston's experiment on serum
derived directly from the blood, but with this variation, that the blood
was drawn by cupping; and he could not discover the presence of
any prussiate.
   The author observes, that in several instances in which prussiate
of potash had been taken by other persons, it could not be detected
in their urine. As some of those in whom it failed to appear were
 taking mercury at the time, he conjectured that the difference might
 possibly arise from that cause; but as in two other failures no mer
 cury was present, he does not lay much stress on that conjecture.

tain whether these could be detected in their passage through the
blood, from the stomach to the bladder.
   The method employed by the author for detecting sugar in the
serum, was first to add dilute muriatic acid to the serum, and then
to heat it till perfectly coagulated.   The water which exudes from
healthy serum so coagulated, contains scarcely anything but salts,
which crystallize by evaporation.     But if a very small proportion of
sugar has been previously added, it is immediately detected upon
evaporating a drop of this fluid, by the blackness and interruption to
the crystallization which are occasioned by                      it.

Being an Appendir to his former Paper on the Rectification of the
  Hyperbola, inserted in the Philosophical Transactions for the Year
   1802.   Communicated by Nevil Maskelyne, D.D. F.R.S. Astro

  The present communication is designed by the author as an ap
pendix to his former paper on the same subject, printed in our Trans
actions for 1802.
   Although he acknowledges the ingenuity of Mr. John Landen,
who devised the rectification of the hyperbola by means of two ellipses,
and adds his tribute of applause to that which has been bestowed upon
it by the most eminent mathematicians of the Continent, as well as
of our own country, Mr. Hellins is nevertheless of opinion, that it is
more to be admired as curious than practically useful; since it is
circuitous, and requires much more calculation than will be found
requisite by the theorem, which is the primary subject of this paper.
   Mr. Hellins also adds some further observations on the rectification
of the hyperbola, and shows the great advantage of descending series
over ascending series, in many cases, and gives several methods of
computing the constant quantity by which those series differ from
each other.

  It often explodes while collecting,            in     consequence      of   heat     gene

                                               394
rated; and it may always be made to explode by the heat of the
hand, with instantaneous extrication of heat and light.        After ex
plosion the gas is found to occupy about one sixth part more bulk
than before.     From the gas so exploded, oxymuriatic gas may be
absorbed by water, and there remains about one third part of
oxygen.
   When copper, or antimony, or mercury, or iron, are exposed to
this gas, it has no action upon them till heat is applied; but then they
burn with a very brilliant light, and generally with explosion.      But
charcoal, which has no affinity with oxymuriatic gas, burns only with
a dull red light, by union with the diluted oxygen.
   Arsenic was acted upon without the application of heat. After a
short time it caused an explosion, and united with the oxymuriatic
gas.   Sulphur caused instant explosion, but was not burned.
   Phosphorus caused explosion with brilliant light; and uniting with
both constituents, formed phosphoric acid, and solid oxymuriate of
phosphorus.
  When the gas was mixed with muriatic gas, a gradual diminution
of volume took place; oxymuriatic gas was formed, and dew depo
sited on the sides of the vessel.
     These experiments, says Mr. Davy, enable us to explain the con
tradictory accounts that have been given of the properties of oxy
muriatic gas, which have been confounded with those of the ex
plosive compound.     That the latter has not been collected before, is
principally owing to       its
                         being absorbed                  by
                                             water, which has generally
been used for receiving the products from hyperoxymuriate        potash;                  of
aud since water absorbs about ten times        bulk       its
                                                       this gas, nothingof

                                               of
water became completely saturated.
   The violent explosion, accompanied with heat and light, which                                           is
in this instance produced during the separation and expansion        two                           of

into the circulation   the blood without going through the thoracic
                           of

                                                     which they are          by

                                         395
conveyed; but brings forward the present set of experiments to cor
rect that opinion, which he finds to be erroneous.
    Mr. Brodie having tied the thoracic duct in some experiments of
his own, it occurred to Mr. Home, that under these circumstances
the existence or non-existence of any other channel from the stomach
into the circulation might be fully established.
    A rabbit and a dog were each subjected to this experiment. After
tying the thoracic duct, a quantity of infusion of rhubarb was inject
ed into the stomach; and, in an hour after, the urine was examined,
and found to be tinged with the rhubarb.          In the dog, the bile was
also  examined,    and found to be   tinged  with the rhubarb. The exist
ence of a channel distinct from the thoracic duct being thus esta
blished, the experiment was repeated on a dog whose spleen had
been removed four days previously; but still the urine became tinged
with the rhubarb, so that the channel is not through the spleen.
    As it was possible (though not very probable) that the rhubarb
might, by some anastomosis, obtain a passage through the lymphatic
vessel, which enters at the angle between the jugular and subclavian
veins on the right side, the same experiment was repeated upon an
other dog, in whom this vessel was also secured by ligature, as well
as the thoracic duct, previously to the injection of the rhubarb; but
in this experiment also the rhubarb found its way to the bladder, as
before.     When the spleen of this dog was infused in water, the in
fusion was slightly tinged with the rhubarb; but when the liver was
 infused, the proportion of blood present was so great as not to admit
of determining whether rhubarb was present or not.
    In some of these experiments the thoracic duct was wounded or
ruptured, so that chyle was found to have flowed from                  it,
                                                                    and was
 collected for experiment:    in   other experiments the duct itself, the
 mesenteric glands, and lacteals, were found distended, and the fluid
 was pressed from them for the same purpose; but              wasit       in
                                                                         in   no
 stance found  to   be tinged with the rhubarb.
    These experiments, says Mr. Home, completely establish the fact,
 that the rhubarb did not-pass through the thoracic duct, and also
 completely overturn the opinion          the spleen being the medium by
                                         of
 which      was conveyed.     He conceives, therefore, that the rhubarb
 found in itthe spleen must previously have entered the circulation, and
 thence have been deposited, by secretion,                       the spleen.
                                                    is in
                                                    the cells     of
 The   objectionto   this opinion  is,that there     no excretory  duct from
 the spleen; but Mr. Home observes, that the lymphatic vessels pro
 bably perform the office   of   excretory ducts,     they are both larger
                                                        as

On the Composition               of Zeolite.         By James Smithson, Esq. F.R.S.
            Read February 7, 1811.                   [Phil. Trans. 1811, p. 171.]
    Although the substance called Natrolite by Mr. Klaproth has lately
 been found, under a crystalline form, perfectly similar to that of me
 sotype, M. Haüy has not thought himself warranted, from this cir
 cumstance, to consider these two bodies as of the same species, on
 account of the difference of their chemical composition; because,
 according to the analysis of M. Vauquelin, there was not observed
 to be any soda in zeolite, but, on the contrary, a considerable quan
 tity of lime, which is not a constituent part of natrolite.
    Mr. Smithson, on the contrary, is inclined to consider them as the
 same substance, by the agreement of their chemical properties, as
well as crystallographical form. Although he had, many years since,
found that the zeolite of Staffa contained soda, as has since been ob
served by Dr. Hutton and Dr. Kennedy, he still felt uncertain whether
these were of the same kind as those analysed by M. Vauquelin:
but having lately received from M. Haüy a cluster of mesotype in
rectangular prisms, terminated by a quadrangular pyramid, Mr. Smith
son took this opportunity of ascertaining whether this substance and
natrolite did or did not differ in their composition. The method pur
sued by the author in the analysis of zeolite was first to expose ten
grains of it to a strong heat, for the purpose of ascertaining the loss;
and he found it to be 95 grain. An equal quantity was then dissolved
in muriatic acid; and after the solution had been evaporated to dry
ness, the residuum was exposed to a red heat.          Water was then
poured upon            it,
                    and dissolved     portion, which, upon evaporation,
                                                     a
was found         to   be
                   muriate      soda, weighing
                                           of        grains. From the  3'   15
solution     of
              this salt, neither carbonate                        of
                                               ammonia nor oxalic acid
occasioned any precipitate; by which         appeared that this zeolite
                                                                it
contained no lime.
    The residuum from which the muriate of soda had been extracted
was next digested      muriatic acid, which dissolved
                             in                           part, but left         a
undissolved     quantity
                  a         silica, which, after being made red hot,
                                       of
weighed 49 grains. The muriatic solution was then evaporated
                                                                                                   to to
dryness, and exposed         red heat; and the residuum appeared
                                      to   a
be  pure alumina.   Since    was possible that some magnesia might

also   bemixed with             it,

                                                               in
but the residuum was not found         yield any sulphateto   magnesia                of

ever, had not been expelled by heat, but was afterwards separated
by   nitrate   of      barytes; and the alumina was estimated                        to   amount   to
27 grains.

            given by Klaproth, that                                                                to of

Baron Cronstadt, the original discoverer   this class    bodies; and
                                                                  of             of

this indeed appears but a feeble tribute of respect to the services
which he has rendered to the science of mineralogy.
   Since the crystallization of certain mineral substances, in which
nothing but earths has been discovered, has appeared problematical
to many persons, and has led to the supposition of the existence of
unknown acids in their composition, Mr. Smithson endeavours to
explain this difficulty, by suggesting that quartz itself may be con
sidered as an acid, to which class of bodies it has analogous quali
ties: we shall then have a numerous class of silicates, both simple
and compound; and zeolite will belong to the latter, and may be
regarded as a hydrated silicate of alumina.
Experiments and Observations on the different Modes in which Death
  is produced by certain vegetable Poisons.   By B. C. Brodie, Esq.
  F.R.S. Communicated by the Society for promoting the Knowledge
  of Animal Chemistry. Read February 21, 1811. [Phil. Trans.
   1811, p. 178.]
  The substances selected for these experiments are vegetable poisons
only; and they were chosen of the most active kind, that the exact
nature of their effects might be more readily discerned.   The prin
cipal object of the experiments is to determine on which of the vital
organs the influence of each poison is exerted, and through what
medium the organ becomes affected. The first series of experiments
relates to the effects of internal application to the tongue and ali
mentary canal, and the second to the consequences of application to
external wounds.
   When proof spirit was given to a rabbit in sufficient quantity to kill
it,   the heart was observed            to   continue       action after apparent death.
                                                           in
   The same observation was made respecting the heart                           of   acat,
killed    byinjecting the root              of
                                      aconite into the rectum.
    When the oil distilled from bitter almonds was employed, although
                    single drop had been given           cat, she died
                                                                                     of in
no more than
                                                                 to

minutes. Two        drops         of
                               the same oil  injected into the rectum     an
other cat, killed        alsoit        in
                                  five minutes.    And the heart,    each in   in
stance, continued acting after apparent death.
                    of oil
    Distilled           tobacco exerted nearly the same energy
                             of                                           the        as
distilled oil       bitter almonds, and apparently          the same way,
                                                                     in                      as
the heart was observed           contract after apparent death.
                                       to
    From this    circumstance,      Mr. Brodie inferred that these poisons
              primary                   the brain, and that death ensues
                                                 on
                                                                                             onin

                     of                  respiration, which
                                                  of            dependent is
the brain.
   When        an
             infusion             of
                          tobacco was made use        instead       of
                                                                  the em       of
pyreumatic oil, and injected into the rectum, the effects were different
from any     the preceding,
               of                            as
                                   the heart continued      contract, and to
was  uniformly  found             in

                                       extreme distension.    Mr. Brodie
 is,however,     opinion, that the heart was not directly affected, but
                    of
through the medium          the nervous system.

 infusion was injected into the rectum of a dog whose head had been
cut off, and whose respiration was kept up by artificial means, the
heart continued to act in the same manner as in the experiments
which Mr. Brodie lately communicated to the Society, without being
sensibly affected by the infusion.
    The author's trials of the eaternal application of poisons were con
fined to the essential oil of bitter almonds, the juice of aconite, and
the South American poison called Woorara. They                   produced the          all
same effects            as
                  the two former had done when applied internally, for
the heart was observed         contract,to    before, long after other sym
                                                             as
ptoms      of
           life had   ceased;       that the circulation could

               artificial respiration.
    With respect        the medium through which poisons affect the

brain when    they  are applied        external wounds, the author's expe
                                                  to
riments were confined to the woorara.           And he endeavoured to de
termine whether the influence was conveyed by the nerves,             whether                    or
the poison itself entered the circulation, either by the absorbents,                                            or
through the divided veins. By dividing the nerves                    part, the             of   a
efficacy       of
             the woorara did not     appear   diminished,   neither did tying
up the thoracic duct         any degree interfere with its action.
                                    in                                     But

include the sciatic nerve, the rabbit was not           the least affected by
the woorara.
  The author consequently infers that the woorara acts upon the
brain by passing into               its
                             substance through the divided vessels           the                           of

respiration, after the brain had been even completely removed, Mr.
Brodie conceived       possible that the functions
                             it                           the brain might        of                             be

continued for       time a              by
                              artificial respiration, and that thus the life
of the animal might                be
                            preserved.
   After two experiments, which were not attended with complete
success,     third was made upon

which some naturalists have been disposed to compare to animal in
stinct. Mr. Knight examines whether this comparison has any foun
dation.
   He remarks, that when trees which require moisture are near to
water, by far the greatest part of their roots extend themselves in
that direction; but when those to which a dry soil is more congenial
are placed in the same situation, their roots take an opposite course.
When a tree is placed upon a wall, at a distance from the ground,
its powers appear directed exclusively to one object; its roots are
extended with well-directed efforts to reach the soil beneath, while
its branches are in the mean time stinted in their growth; but as
soon as the roots have entered the soil, the branches then grow with
vigour and rapidity.
   Mr. Knight sowed some seeds of the common carrot and parsnip
in light poor loam, under which, at the depth of eighteen inches, he
had placed a stratum of very rich mould, incorporated with fresh
vegetable matter.       The plants grew feebly till the end of summer,
but then assumed a very luxuriant growth; and when the roots were
 examined, they were found nearly cylindrical, with very few fibres
emitted into the superficial poor soil, whilst the rich mould beneath
 was filled with fibres.
   When the strata of soil were reversed, the roots were found to
 have formed accordingly, ramifying, in an unusual manner, into the
 superficial rich soil, but emitting few of their fibres into the subjacent
stratum.
   When mould contained in an inverted garden-pot was so supported
by frame-work that its under surface was exposed to the air, the ra
dicles of garden-beans in contact with this surface extended horizon
tally along      it,
               and        few days emitted many fibrous roots upwards

                     animal life.

                                       of             the first experi            in

ment, as well as the branched and taper roots of those sown in a soil
superficially rich, admit of a similar explanation.   So also when the
seeds of the bean were placed to vegetate beneath the mould of an
inverted pot, the lower surface of the radicles, being exposed to dry
air, were rendered rigid and incapable of emitting fibrous roots; while
their upper surface in contact with the mould, being preserved in a
due state of moisture, emitted fibres in that direction alone in which
proper food was to be procured.
   In confirmation of this explanation, the author made a correspond
ing experiment, in which water was so constantly and abundantly
supplied, that every part of the radicles was kept equally wet, and
then they emitted fibres perfectly obedient to gravitation, without
being influenced by the soil above them.
   The strength of roots, by which they appear to be wisely adapted
to their situations of exposure to the violence of winds, is traced by
the author to the operation of another cause, noticed in a former
memoir; for the immediate consequence of motion upon the roots,
as well as upon the branches, is a deposition of alburnous matter
upon the part moved; and hence those roots which immediately join
the trunk of an insulated tree become strong and rigid, but diminish
rapidly in bulk as they recede from the stem and descend into the
ground.    But in a sheltered valley, on the contrary, where a tree is
protected by           its
                   neighbours, and little agitated   winds, the roots   by
grow long, and continue slender like the stem and branches, and
hence comparatively much less                      of
                                     alburnous matter    expended be         is
neath the ground.
     In
      the whole            of
                     this arrangement the author sees much reason                                 to
admire the   simplicity     the means employed
                                    of             the wisdom      naby                     of

   This result was founded on the computations of his friend Mayer,
who, by the assistance of the best astronomical tables then in use,
found that neither the eclipse mentioned by Pliny, Scaliger, Cal
visius, Petavius, or Usher, could possibly be the eclipse alluded to
by Herodotus. Mayer calculated                                all

     Mr. Baily's inquiries
                         have consequently taken    greater range than           a
those     of
          his predecessors.   He has taken the   pains    calculate all                       to
the solar eclipses from 650 before Christ    580, and has found only   to
                                      near any part      the peninsula
                                                        in                                  of
one that was central and total                          or
of Asia Minor.
     This eclipse took place   the 30th       on
                                            September, 610. The centre

and to have crossed the very ground where the armies of Cyaxares
and Alyattes probably met.    And if the order of events belonging to
the reign of Cyaxares, as related by Herodotus, does not accord so
exactly as might be wished with this determination, and cannot be
entirely reconciled to their dates, Mr. Baily would attribute the
confusion to the want of authentic documents at the time the history
was written.
   Although the author has employed in these calculations the secular
variations of the moon's mean longitude, mean anomaly, and mean
distance from her node, as deduced from the formulae of Laplace, and
given in the Tables Astronomiques, he expresses some doubts of the
accuracy of these results; and his doubts are founded upon an eclipse
recorded by Diodorus to have happened during the voyage of Aga
thocles from Syracuse to invade Africa, in the year 310 B.C., in
which, when computed according to the present tables, the path of
the moon's shadow appears to have passed so much more south than
Agathocles can be supposed to have been at that time, that the la
titude of the moon would require to be at least 3° greater than our
present tables make              it.
   These observations                (if
                           correct) would show the necessity     some                          of
alteration of the secular variation of the moons mean distance from
her node; but this hypothesis, Mr. Baily observes, could not       re                               be
conciled with the eclipse mentioned       Herodotus; for    by
                                                             means                      by               of

by the operation of water, as observed by Dr. Richardson, in his re
marks upon the basaltic counties of Antrim and Derry in Ireland.
   It is to these tracts of elevated strata, and their abrupt termina
tions, or faults, in the county of Derby, that the author's observations
have been principally directed; and he enumerates a series of four
different elevations, in succession, one within the other, of which the
innermost is most elevated. The outermost, or least elevated, ex
tends from Nottingham northward into Yorkshire, as far as the river
Wharf, this being the eastern boundary of the tract; while       western                                      its
boundary extends from near Stone,         Staffordshire,      the neigh

which the author calls the great Derbyshire fault; but its northern
extent has not yet been ascertained by actual observation.
   The second tract, which much more elevated than the preceding,
                                                is

An Account of an Appendia to the small Intestines of Birds. By James
  Macartney, Esq. F.R.S. Read March 21, 1811. [Phil. Trans.

     Although almost every author who has written upon the incubation
of the egg has observed the direct communication between the yolk
bag and the small intestines of the chick, and although some of them
have observed that this duct remains in the form of a small caecum
during life, it appears to have escaped the notice of any one, that in
some species of birds this part is of considerable size, and possesses
a structure peculiar to itself.
   It was in the snipe that Mr. Macartney first observed        magni                              its
tude     exceed that

 Portuguese settlements; and the same tree also produces a gum as
food for man, and another substance employed to fatten poultry.
   The substance examined by Mr. Brande resembles that procured
from the Cerorylon Andicola described by Humboldt. The Ceroxylon,
however, is a tall palm-tree, growing about 1000 toises or more above
the level of the sea; but the Brazilian plant is a low tree, and grows
in a country where it does not appear that there are any mountains.
By analysis also, these products differ entirely; for that of Hum
boldt, according to Vauquelin's analysis, consists of two thirds resin
and one third wax; while that from Brazil is entirely wax, without
any perceptible quantity of resin.
   Mr. Brande received this wax in the state of a coarse pale-grey
powder, soft to the touch, mixed with pieces of bark, and other im
purities, amounting to nearly 40 per cent.
   It melts at 206°Fahrenheit; and if then purified by straining
through linen, it acquires a dirty green colour; when cold it is hard
and brittle, and              its

others it is more faint, and might, at first sight, be thought resolv

thought by Dr. Herschel rather to arise from the latter, which he as

  Among the    nebulae that have been formerly observed by the author,
he refers to  seven,  which he considers as having approached very
near to final  condensation;    and of these he observes, that we see
only a superficial lustre, resembling that of planets, which are opake
bodies, and not such as might be expected if the nebulous matter had
no other quality than that of shining, and were perfectly transparent.
   The author observes, that the spheroidal form which prevails among
nebulae, is another circumstance of resemblance to planetary bodies,
from which also their rotation on their axes may be inferred.
   That nebulae do really undergo successive changes, the author de
duces not only from a comparison of different nebulae with each other,
but from a comparison of his own observations, made upon the ne
bula in Orion at this time, with those which he himself made thirty
seven years since.

  [Phil. Trans. 1811,     337.]     p.
  An opinion having been entertained by many persons, that alcohol
which has been distilled from wine does not exist ready formed                                                in
the liquor, but     generated during the process
                      is                              distillation, Mr.           of
Brande undertook      repetition
                           a        Fabronis experiment, on which
                                                   of
this opinion  isprincipally founded; but when       added four ounces         he
   dry subcarbonate     potash   eight fluid ounces   port, no alcohol
                                               of to
of                            of                                                   of
was  separated, although  some    the same wine had   previously   been

                                                    409
ascertained to yield one fifth part of alcohol by distillation.   When
the same experiment was repeated on the same wine, to which one
seventh part of alcohol had been previously added, still none was
separated by subcarbonate of potash : but when so much as one
third part had been added, then a very small proportion was found
to float upon the surface after it had stood twenty-four hours.
   When madeira or sherry were employed instead of port, the re
sults were nearly the same. Since the method of Fabroni failed of
detecting the presence of alcohol, unless the quantity was very con
siderable, it became necessary to have recourse to some other method
of proving or disproving the presence of it as a product of fermenta
tion; and Mr. Brande conceived, that if it were formed by the heat
applied in distillation, the quantity should in that case be different
when the same liquor was distilled at different temperatures.
   In the first of four processes of distillation, port wine was made to
acquire the heat of 200° by addition of muriate of lime, and one half
was quickly distilled over; and in the last, an equal quantity of port
was kept for five days at the temperature of 180°, till half the quan
tity had passed over into the receiver; but in all these experiments
the specific gravities of the products were so nearly the same, that
there did not appear to be any difference in the quantity of alcohol
obtained.
     Mr. Brande also attempted to separate alcohol from different kinds
of wine by freezing; but the cake of ice produced was spongy, and
would not allow any portion of alcohol to separate from                                it.
  The author having thus,     his satisfaction, proved the existence

   Norwithstanding the skill with which Dr. Maskelyne conducted
the astronomical observations upon Schehallien, and the accuracy
with which      may he presumed    be                   to
                                    have measured the deflection                                            of
his plumb-line from the perpendicular, whereby      discovered the           he
actual attraction   that  mountain;
                              of     and although great  ingenuity

                                    410
was manifested by Dr. Hutton in deducing from thence the mean
 density of the earth; there remained one source of uncertainty in
 their results, dependent on the specific gravity of the mountain,
 which they assumed to be 2:5, but were aware that this might not
 be so accurate as would be desirable in a standard to which the den
 sity of the earth is directly compared.
    It was for this purpose that Mr. Playfair, with the assistance of
 Lord Webb Seymour, undertook the present survey of Schehallien,
 ascertaining,   as accurately as they were able, the direction and   in
 clination of the strata of which the mountain consists, and collecting
 specimens of all the varieties of rock which they could discover, in
 order to determine the specific gravity of each by direct experiment,
 and thence to estimate the correction which it might be necessary to
 introduce into Dr. Huttons calculation.
     Schehallien, like all other mountains in its vicinity, was found to
 consist entirely of primitive rocks in strata, which stretch in a direc
 tion from S.E. to N.W., and nearly vertical in position; but in some
 parts towards the base, they deviate as much as 15° from the per
 pendicular. The most elevated and by far the largest part of the
 mountain was found to consist of granular quartz, extremely hard,
 compact, and homogeneous, of which the specific gravity, by an
 average of thirteen specimens, was nearly 2-64.       Adjacent to this
 mass, on each side, and next in quantity, is a micaceous schist, con
 taining hornblende ; and lower down toward the base appear strata
 of granular limestone, highly crystallized, and containing mica. The
specific gravity of this part of the mountain, on an average of fifteen
specimens, was found to be 2.81.
    Beside these there are also veins or dykes of porphyry and green
 stone, which intersect the other strata at right angles, but bear a
very small proportion to the general mass of the mountain.
    With respect to the micaceous schist and limestone, which are
distinctly stratified in vertical planes, their continuity from one ex
tremity of the mountain to the other may with confidence be pre
sumed; but this is not the case with respect to the granular quartz,
which may either be interposed between them, and continue with
them to an indefinite extent in length and depth, or may be of sub
sequent formation, occupying only the summit of the mountain, and
not penetrating into the interior.
    Since the result of the calculation of the earth's density is mate
rially affected by the difference of these suppositions, the author has
made an estimate according to each hypothesis.
    With the exception of the corrections thus obtained for the specific
gravity of the mountain, Mr. Playfair adopted the method employed
by Dr. Hutton, of dividing the whole mass of the mountain into a
certain number of vertical columns, formed by cylindrical sections,
so that their respective attractions on the plumb-line could with
great facility be computed upon the supposition of uniform density
throughout.
-- Upon the former of the two hypotheses of Mr. Playfair, in which

                                   411
the granular quartz is supposed to pervade the base of the mountain
to an indefinite depth, the corrections, in proportion to the mere dif
ference between the specific gravities assumed by Dr. Hutton and
that found by experiment, were simple in comparison to those ne
cessary on the second hypothesis; but in each case the attractions
of opposite portions of the cylindrical sections became, in fact, un
equal, and consequently required to be computed with due regard
to their respective specific gravities, as well as the azimuth and alti
tude of each.
    The nature of these computations is fully explained by the author,
but cannot be understood without reference to the figures which ac
company them. The resulting density deduced according to the first
hypothesis is found to be nearly 4:56; that deduced by Dr. Hutton
having been only 4:48: but according to the second hypothesis, the
difference is far more considerable; the density in this case being
4'87.
    This last is nearly a mean between that of Dr. Hutton and the
density of 5:48, which Mr. Cavendish inferred from a very different
                                                -
mode of investigation.
    By considering the experiments on Schehallien alone, the density
of the earth might be assumed to be between the limits above as
signed, the mean of which amounts to 471. Mr. Playfair, however,
thinks it desirable that an element so important in physical astronomy
should be the result of many experiments, and recommends the selec
tion of granite mountains, if possible, for this purpose, because their
homogeneity might be presumed with considerable confidence.
 Observations and Experiments on Vision.     By William Charles Wells,
    M.D. F.R.S. Read     July  4, 1811. [Phil. Trans. 1811, p. 378.]
    The experiments here described by Dr. Wells were made in con
 sequence of an imperfection of sight occurring to his observation,
 which he has nowhere seen upon record. The subject to whom the
 disorder happened was a gentleman about thirty-five years of age,
 who, after a slight catarrh, had been seized with a degree of stupor,
 and weight of his forehead, accompanied with a paralytic state of the
 right eyelid. The pupil of this eye was also observed to be much
 dilated; and he had lost all power of adapting that eye to near ob
jects, although he could see at a distance with great distinctness.
 The left eye also became shortly after affected in a slight degree,
 and in a similar manner.
    The nature of the defect became evident by trial of spectacles; for
 it was found that convex glasses enabled him to read with perfect
 ease, and supplied the want of the power of adaptation which he
 had before possessed.
    Since the application of the juice of belladonna to the eye occa
 sions a dilatation of the pupil, it appeared to Dr. Wells not impro
 bable that it might also affect other muscular powers of the eye. It
 was his intention to have made this experiment on his own eyes:

                                                        412
but he found their power of adaptation too far diminished by age for
such a trial.    He however prevailed on Dr. Cutting, a young phy
sician of his acquaintance, to make trial of                 The result was per
                                                                             it.
fectly conformable          the supposition. The dilatation

                                               hour, the eye, which before the

three feet and      half: and when
                        a                                   its
                                              pupil had acquired the greatest
dilatation, the rays from         candle, evena       eight feet distance, could
                                                                       at

        made      converge on the retina, but only those from stars,

from very distant lamps. The defect thus occasioned by belladonna
was found nearly               in
                         the same state          the following day; and
                                                              on                  was                     it
not till the ninth    day    that the   power        adapting      of
                                                                  the  eye       near                     to
objects was completely restored.            During the whole            this time            of                it
was observed that the affection was wholly confined                 the left eye, on    to
which the experiment was made, and that the                  right   eye remained
unaltered; and        the same manner, when the experiment was after
wards repeated              on in
                       the right, the left was then wholly unaffected by

                                         now found, that when         wished                         he

   In the course of these experiments Dr. Wells observes, that the
sympathy between the eyes, which is in general considered as sym
pathy of the iris, is in fact sympathy of the retina; for when the
pupil of one eye is dilated by belladonna, the pupil of the other be
comes so much the more contracted, in consequence of the greater
light which the enlarged pupil admits.
   He remarks, also, that though he has lost, in great measure, the
power of adaptation, he has in no degree lost any command of the
external muscles, but can make the optic axes meet at any short
distance from his face, to which he could formerly make them con
verge. So also, while Dr. Cutting's eyes were under the influence
of belladonna, the powers of the external muscles remained unim
paired; whence it appears, that the power of adapting the eye to
different distances is not dependent on the external muscles, but
rather to be referred to the crystalline lens, although the muscularity
of that organ does not appear to Dr. Wells to be by any means
established.

   Sir Isaac Newton, who first considered the figure of the earth and
planets, confined his view to the supposition of their having been
originally in a fluid state; and he conceived them to retain the same
figure which they assumed in their primitive condition; and those
mathematicians who succeeded him in the same path of inquiry have
seldom ventured beyond this limited hypothesis, and have shown,
that when a body composed of one uniform fluid revolves about                                           its
axis, or  even      consists

enlarged point of view; and D'Alembert has extended his researches
to other figures beside the elliptic spheroid, and has invented a method
of investigating the attractive force of a body of any proposed figure,
and composed of strata, varying in density according to any given
law; but his method, though ingenious, is destitute of the requisite
simplicity.
   Laplace has also treated this extremely difficult question with his
usual skill, and has deduced the relation between the radius of the
spheroid and the series for the attractive force, upon a point without
or within the surface, in a manner admirably simple when the com
plicated nature of the question is considered.
   In the course of his investigation, Laplace lays down a theorem,
which he affirms is true at the surfaces of all spheroids that differ
but little from spheres. This proposition is enunciated in the Mé
canique Céleste in the most general manner, comprehending every
case in which the attractive force is proportional to any power of
the distance between the attracting particles. But the demonstration
which Laplace has given of this proposition appears to Mr. Ivory not
to be conclusive.     It              is,
                             says he, defective and erroneous, because                                               a

                evanescent          cases; whereas

the quantities which Laplace has omitted are then really equal                                                       to

assigned by Laplace, but for          reason that has no manner

On the Attractions of an extensive Class of Spheroids. By James
  Ivory, A.M. Communicated by Henry Brougham, Esq. F.R.S.
  Read November 14, 1811. [Phil. Trans. 1812, p. 46.]
    In hissecond paper, Mr. Ivory investigates the attractions of that
particular class of spheroids mentioned in the former; for though it
is to these that the theorems of Laplace may strictly be applied, it is
liable to the important objection, that the terms of his series near
the beginning cannot be found without previously computing           the                                            all

coagulum surrounded by a transparent colourless fluid. The former
has more the properties of cheese obtained from milk, than of the
fibrine of the blood; while the serous part also is like whey, and
contains a species of sugar which at least very nearly resembles the

    The next subject which Mr. Brande undertakes to examine, is the
lymph found in the thoracic duct of animals deprived of food for
twenty-four hours before death. This is rendered slightly turbid by
alcohol, but is not coagulated either by heat or by acids. It produces
no change in vegetable blue colours till evaporated nearly to dryness.
After incineration, it is found to contain a small portion of common
salt, but no indications of iron.

COmet.
     The planetary body was at no time perceptibly otherwise than cir
cular. Its apparent magnitude was about three quarters of a second,
and its real diameter is estimated at 428 miles. The position of this
body never appeared to be in the centre of the head, but to be more
or less eccentric at different periods of observation, but always more
remote than the centre from the sun.
   Nevertheless, the greatest illumination of the surrounding head is
represented by Dr. Herschel as greatest in the centre, and in its de
crease from thence to be somewhat brighter on the side toward the
sun than at the part occupied by the planetary body. The apparent
magnitude of the head was found to measure 33 minutes; so that
 itsreal magnitude        estimated  is  have been 127,000 miles.

    The great eruptions were generally attended with sounds like the
firing     of

                           or                                       earth                     of

   On the succeeding day, however, the eruptions were repeated with
still greater violence than before; and the quantity of matter thrown
up subsequent to this period was so great, that upon Capt. Tillard's
return to St. Michael's on the 4th of July, one side of the crater was
elevated nearly eighty yards above the level of the sea, and the circuit
of it so nearly complete, that the channel of communication between
the inside and outside was not more than six yards over, and the
water within was boiling hot. The beach was also proportionally
heated; so that although by rowing round to the leeward side Capt.
Tillard was able to land on the outer margin, the heat prevented his
ascending at that part more than a few yards.     The inclination also
was so steep on     sides,     all

                                   425
 distinct attachment of a rib on both sides to each vertebra by a ball
 and socket-joint. It is remarked, that in this tribe of animals the
relative positions of the ball and socket are reversed from their usual
 situation, the socket being attached to the extremity of the rib, and
fitted to a protuberance from the body of the vertebra, instead of the
 extremity of the rib being applied to an indentation between two ad
jacent vertebrae.    Hence the ribs do not in any degree interfere with
 the motion of the vertebrae upon each other, as in other animals.
    The muscles by which these motions are performed, are also de
 scribed by Mr. Home; but the distribution of them cannot readily be
understood, without reference to the drawings which accompany the
paper.
    At the termination of each rib is a small cartilage, which rests for
its whole length on the inner surface of the corresponding abdominal
scutum, to which it is connected by a short muscle.
    The scutum being thus moved by a rib from each side, its posterior
 edge lays hold of the ground, and becomes the support by which the
adjacent portion of the body is propelled forwards, and by a series
of alternate motions is capable of renewing the impulse with consi
derable rapidity.
    Mr. Home remarks, that in the Draco volans the wings, by which
the animal flies, are supported by ribs, which form the skeleton of
them; but in this instance the elongated ribs are superadded, for the
sole purpose of forming the wings, and do not, as in the snake, assist
in the process of respiration, at the same time that they are employed
in giving progressive motion.
An Account of      some Eaperiments    on the Combinations    of different
    Metals and Chlorine, &c. By John Davy, Esq. Communicated by
    Sir Humphry Davy, Knt. LL.D. Sec. R.S. Read February 27,
    1812.    [Phil. Trans. 1812, p. 169.]
    The principal objects of these experiments is to determine the pro
portions in which oxymuriatic acid or chlorine combines with various
metals; but the author has also extended his inquiry to the relative
proportions, in which oxygen also, and sulphur, unite with some of
the same metallic substances.
    Of copper, Mr. John Davy notices two compounds, to which he
gives the names of Cuprane and Cupranea.         The former is the same
as the resin copper of Boyle, which may be obtained by heating to
gether one part of copper with two parts of corrosive sublimate. This
compound is also the same as that named by Proust, white muriate
of copper, who obtained it by mixing together muriates of tin and
copper; and Proust observed that the same compound might be pro
cured, by heat, from the common deliquescent muriate of copper.
    This compound is fusible by heat below redness, and in close ves
sels is not decomposed by a strong red heat; but if air be freely ad
mitted, it is dissipated in white fumes.    It is insoluble in water, but

                                            426
is soluble with effervescence in nitric acid, and without effervescence
in muriatic.   It consists of 36 chlorine, and 64 copper.
   In the other compound, which the author calls Cupranea (a term
that, in the language proposed by his brother, implies a substance
containing more acid), the proportions are 53 chlorine, and 47 copper.
This compound is also best obtained from the common deliquescent
muriate by slow evaporation, carried ultimately to dryness, at a tem
perature not exceeding 400° of Fahrenheit; for if greater heat be
applied, one portion of chlorine is expelled, and what remains is re
duced to the state of cuprane and resin copper.
   In addition to the foregoing, there is also a native muriate of
copper, which, by the author's analysis, consists of 73 brown oxide,
16.2 muriatic acid, and 10-8 water.
   This compound has also been imitated by Proust; and Mr.        Davy        J.
has also found various methods of    making  the same combination.
   Tin also forms two compounds with chlorine, one already known
under the name of the fuming liquor of Libavius, which the author
calls Stannanea, most readily obtained by heating together an amal
gam of tin with corrosive sublimate; and a second analogous to the
former, made by the substitution of calomel, and accordingly con
taining a less proportion of chlorine, and therefore called stannane.
        The former contains 42° 1 tin, with 57.9 chlorine.
        The latter           62°22 tin,                
                                               37'78 chlorine.
   The only new and remarkable property of the liquor of Libavius
observed by Mr.    J.Davy, is         its
                                    action upon oil     turpentine, which
                                                                   of
in one experiment was           so
                             violent           to as
                                              occasion inflammation.                In
other instances oxide      of
                          tin seemed       be formed, and tenacious oil,
                                                  to                     a
having smell somewhat like camphor.
       a
   Beside these compounds            of
                                 tin with chlorine alone, there       also    is    a
submuriate observed    by  Proust,   containing about 70-4 grey oxide,
19 muriatic acid, and 10-6 water.
   With iron likewise,      well
                            as            as
                                      with the former metals, there are
two compounds with chlorine, which may either             formed by direct
                                                                    be
union with oxymuriatic gas,           or
                                    may             be      evaporating by
                                                                                    of to
                                              obtained
dryness the green and red muriates         iron. When thus deprived
                                                  of
water, they receive the name          of
                                    Ferrane and Ferranea. The former
contains 46'57 iron, and 53'43 chlorine; the latter 35l iron, and
64'9 chlorine.
   With other metals that have been tried by the author, such         man      as
ganese, lead, zinc, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth,                      he
                                                             has not found
that chlorine combines       more than one proportion.

without   decomposition;    but when        heated

riatic acid fumes are   evolved,  and oxide     manganeseof remains.                It
appears  to  consist  of   54
                            chlorine, and 46 manganese.
   The muriate   of  lead, known by the name       Horn lead, but called
                                                              of
by the author Plumbane, was found          contain 74°23 lead, and 25°77
                                                  to
chlorine.

                                  427
   Butter of zinc, obtained by distilling to dryness the muriate of
zinc, was found to consist of exactly equal parts of the two ingre
dients.
   The fuming butter of arsenic was found to contain nearly 60 chlo
rine to 40 arsenic.    This compound has the property of dissolving
phosphorus when gently heated, but to part with it on being cooled.
It also readily dissolves sulphur when warmed, and yields crystals of
sulphur by cooling. It likewise dissolves resins, oil of turpentine, or
olive oil; and in these respects resembles the compounds of sulphur
or phosphorus with chlorine, which have the same property of en
tering into combination with fixed and volatile oils.
   In this respect also the butter of antimony was found to agree with
the same compounds; and in the proportion of its constituent parts,
to be as nearly as possible the reverse of the preceding.
   It is remarked concerning these compounds, in general, of metals
with chlorine, that their volatility or fusibility are in no degree cor
respondent to the qualities of the metals of which they consist. One
of the compounds of iron, for instance, is volatile; but those of bis
muth, zinc, and lead, are even less fusible than the metals themselves.
   In order to correct the preceding analysis, the author has had re
course to the general analogy of definite proportions; and since one
of hydrogen unites with 7:5 oxygen, or with 33-6 chlorine, the com
pounds of chlorine have been compared with the oxides of the same
metals; and in the instances of copper, iron, zinc, and arsenic, have
been found to agree correctly with the analyses of oxides by other
chemists; and where such agreement has been wanting, it has been
obtained by new analyses of the oxides of tin, lead, antimony, and
bismuth.
   In making similar comparisons of the compounds of the same me
tals with sulphur, four instances of correspondence were found in tin,
lead, antimony, and bismuth; but others were observed not to ac
cord with the proportions assigned.
   The author concludes with observing the degree of analogy that
subsists between the oxides of metals, and their compounds, with
chlorine; horn silver, resin copper, horn lead, and corrosive sub
limate, being each soluble in excess of muriatic acid, although
the last is even less soluble in nitric or sulphuric acids than in mere
Water.
Further Erperiments and Observations on the Action of Poisons on the
   Animal System. By B. C. Brodie, Esq. F.R.S. Communicated to
   the Society for the Improvement of Animal Chemistry, and by them
   to the Royal Society. Read February 27, 1812. [Phil. Trans. 1812,
   p. 205.]
   In the  description of the author's former experiments on the same
subject, he entered more into the detail of particular occurrences than
he now thinks necessary.       He was formerly apprehensive that the
operations of the same poison might not be always the same, and was

                                                   428
 therefore careful to relate all the circumstances.           But he now finds
 extremely little difference in the action of the same poison, even upon
 different animals; and in those of the same species no difference but
 what may be referred to difference of quantity of poison, or age, and
 power of the animal.        He consequently does not enter minutely into
 the   particulars  of his late experiments, but gives a general account
 of those which appear to be of most importance, with regard to the
 inferences that may be drawn from them. The greatest part of them
 relate to the action of mineral poisons; but since, on the former oc
 casion, his trials of woorara had been left imperfect for want of a
 sufficient quantity of that poison, he states the results of two expe
 riments made after obtaining a fresh supply, for the purpose of en
 deavouring to recover animals that had been apparently killed by                                       it.
    A   young cat was the subject                  of

ficial respiration forty times                in

                               that this inflammation       caused by the          is
local application       of                          the stomach; and se

                      the arsenic    the coats
condly, that this inflammation      the cause      death.
   To these opinions Mr. Brodie objects, that          many cases the ap    in
pearances     of
               inflammation are too   slight    warrant such by   opinion;                   an

                           animals killed                      to
                                              arsenic, death takes place                                in
too short time for     to be considered as the result of inflammation.

  The author observes also, that the inflammation does not depend
on the local application; for  has been remarked
                                          it           Mr. Hunter                   by
and Mr. Hume, and Mr. Brodie has confirmed the observation by
new experiments, which have satisfied him, that inflammation   the                                of

                                    429
stomach is more violent and more immediate, in consequence of ap
plication of arsenic to wounds, than when it is taken into the sto
mach itself.      The symptoms first produced are paralysis of the hind
legs, and other parts of the body; convulsions, dilatation of the pu
pils, and general insensibility, indicating disturbance of the functions
of the brain. Secondly. A feeble slow intermitting pulse, from dis
turbance of the functions of the heart. Thirdly. Pain in the abdomen,
sickness, vomiting, &c. from the action of this poison on the stomach
and intestines.
      From such general affection of such different organs, from the order
in which they are affected, and from the analogy with vegetable
poisons, which from Mr. Brodie's former experiments appeared not
 to act till they had entered the circulation, he infers that arsenic also,
 in whatever way administered, does not produce its effects even on
 the stomach till it has been received into the blood.       And although
 it might be supposed that blood containing arsenic would equally
 destroy the vitality of every part, there are various circumstances
 which show that this is not the case; for even to the instant of
 death, in consequence of the full effect of arsenic on the brain, heart,
 and bowels, various secretions continue apparently unimpaired; and
  even after death the muscles remain excitable to powerful contrac
 tions by means of electricity.
      From such trials as Mr. Brodie has made of muriate of barytes, it
 has appeared to act principally on the brain, but in some degree on
 the heart also ; for although the heart always continued to act after
  respiration had ceased, in consequence of the affection of the brain,
  nevertheless the pulse was feeble and intermittent; and although ar
  tificial respiration was made with the greatest care, in the hope of
  keeping up the circulation, it could rarely be maintained more than
  a few minutes. In some instances, in which the artificial respiration
  had been pursued with apparent success for a greater length of time,
  there were some signs of restoration of the functions of the brain,
  with occasional returns of voluntary respiration; but though the
  greatest care had been taken to preserve the temperature also by ex
  ternal means, the pulse notwithstanding continued to diminish in
  strength and frequency, and ultimately ceased. It was found, how
  ever, that the heart, the intestines, and the muscles, in general, were
   excitable to contraction by means of electricity, although insensible
   to the stimulus of blood poisoned by muriate of barytes.
       The stomach likewise is affected by this poison with some degree
   of inflammation, but less so than by arsenic. And though in some
   instances it operates as an emetic, the author considers the inflam
   mation to be independent of the local application,          and to arise
   through the medium of the general circulation.
       The effects produced by emetic tartar are very similar to those of
   the preceding poisons; but it much more frequently occasions vo
   miting. The symptoms enumerated are paralysis, drowsiness, and
    at last complete insensibility. The pulse becomes feeble, but still
    the heart continues to act after apparent death; so that its action

                                                       430
may be increased by artificial respiration, but never longer than for
a few minutes.    Its principal action is conceived to be upon the
brain; but it appears to act upon the heart also. The stomach some
times bears marks of inflammation; but the author has seen no                                                        in
stance of the intestines being inflamed.
   The experiments of Mr. Brodie on corrosive sublimate, have led
him to conclusions very different from the preceding respecting its
mode of action.     When applied to a wounded part, it produces a
slough, without any affection of the general system; and when taken
internally, its effects, he thinks, may be best explained by its local
action on the stomach alone, unconnected with any absorption of it
into the circulation.
   When a solution of corrosive sublimate is taken into the stomach,
                                                                                                                     as its
the mucous membrane is found of a dull grey colour, having lost
texture,     so      easily separated from the muscular coat; and
                    as   to      be
this precludes the idea     absorption into the circulation, Mr. Brodie
                                           of
conceives that              its
                    deleterious effects depend entirely upon its che
mical action on the stomach, and that the brain and heart are thence
affected by nervous sympathy.

   Dr. Herschel remarks, that the physical construction    this comet                                 of
must have been extremely different from that   the former, approach                   of
ing very nearly                 to   the planetary condition,                         and having       a     diameter

the preceding; for this were self-luminous, says Dr. Herschel, we

could hardly account for its little density, which would scarcely bear
to be magnified even       107 times, although the former was seen
                                          to

and   he observes, that when the electrization          muriatic acid gas                 of                         is
performed over mercury, the hydrogen evolved amounts          about one                                to
                   original quantity    gas employed.   There appears,

to the quantity which has been stated, nothing further is gained by
continuation of the process.
   When mercury is not present during the electrization, then a dif
ferent result is obtained.    The quantity of hydrogen is estimated by
the author not to exceed one seventieth part of the gas employed.
The gas does not appear to be changed in bulk; but a part of it is
converted into oxymuriatic acid gas.     When this gas amounts to a
certain proportion of the mixture, the effect of the electricity will
then be to re-unite it to the hydrogen, and form muriatic acid gas
rather than to decompose                           it.
   But when mercury                   removes the oxymuriatic acid
                                                                                                                         is as

rounded            by    hydrogen that             it    cannot attain
                                                                                to

cation.
     Insupport    this explanation, Dr. Henry mixed thirty measures
                              of
of  hydrogen with 400      muriatic acid gas; and when this mixture
                                              of
was electrified over mercury,       effect was produced; the quantity
                                                          no
of  hydrogen was not increased; and        was evident that     oxymu                                         no

                                               mercury  remained withof it
out the slightest tarnish.
   When,                 on
               the contrary, the muriatic acid gas was mixed with
oxygen, and electrified over mercury, then      diminution     bulk en         a                         of
sued, and the surface       the mercury became tarnished,

                 on of
contact                                                                                        in

of the muriatic acid.
  These results, says Dr. Henry, may                                      beexplained either according
to   the commonly received theory,                                 or   according     that adopted by
                                                                                             to

Of the Attraction of such Solids as are terminated by Planes; and of
  Solids of greatest Attraction. By Thomas Knight, Esq. Commu
  nicated by Sir Humphry Davy, LL.D. Sec. R.S. Read March 19,
  1812.    [Phil. Trans. 1812, p. 247.]
  The attention of most mathematicians who have treated of the at
tractions of bodies, has been confined to those bounded by continuous
surfaces; and Mr. Knight is not aware that any author, with the ex
ception of Mr. Playfair, has given an example of that kind of inquiry
which he here undertakes.
   If a solid be bounded by plane surfaces on all sides, whether regu
lar or irregular, he undertakes to determine its action, both in quan
tity and direction, upon any point placed either within or without the
body.
   For this purpose, the solid is first conceived to be divided into its
most simple forms, of which the action can be determined separately;
and thence the collective force of the aggregate is subsequently ascer
tained.
   The first section treats of the attraction of planes bounded by right
lines (whether triangular, quadrangular, or polygonal), on points how
ever situated.
  The second section extends the      same inquiry, first to pyramids, and
then to   solids, which   may be divided into as many pyramids as there
are sides.
   And in the third, the attraction of prisms of various forms is inves
tigated.
   Having completed this part of the subject, Mr. Knight next applies
the formulas he has obtained to find the attraction of certain complex
bodies, which, though not bounded by planes, have a natural connexion
with the preceding subject, having their sections in one direction of
a right-lined figure, though in another direction their sections be in
part curvilinear, such as the portion of a cylinder generated by the
motion of a segment of a circle parallel to itself, or parabolic cylinder
by similar motion of a portion of a parabola.
   Under the same head, also, the author includes curvilinear pyra
mids, or groined solids cut from the preceding cylinders by a trans
verse motion of a similar or dissimilar curve, so as to have a paral
lelogram for their base.
| In the section which concludes this communication, the author
enters into the consideration of solids of greatest attraction; for
though this subject has been already treated      of,    part,
                                                        in    by  Professor
Playfair and by Silvabelle, their investigations relate solely     tohomo
geneous solids   of  revolution; but Mr. Knight extends the investiga
tion  to  the attractionsof  those solids treatedof   inthe preceding sec
tions, not only when the density    is  homogeneous, but also according
to  different hypotheses  of  varying density.

Of the Penetration of a Hemisphere by an indefinite Number of equal
  and similar Cylinders.   By Thomas Knight, Esq. Communicated
  by Sir Humphry Davy, LL.D. Sec. R.S.       Read March 19, 1812.
  [Phil. Trans. 1812, p. 310.]
   The problem which Mr. Knight here undertakes to solve, is to
pierce a hemisphere perpendicularly to the plane of its base, with
any number of equal and similar cylinders of such kind, that after
the removal of these cylinders, the remainder of the hemisphere
shall admit of exact cubature; and when the surface has been thus
perforated, the remaining surface shall admit of exact quadrature.
   But the solution of this problem, as well as of those contained in
the preceding communication, was, of course, such as not to admit
of being publicly read.
On the Motions of the Tendrils of Plants. By Thomas Andrew Knight,
  Esq. F.R.S. In a Letter to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart.
  K.B. P.R.S. Read May 4, 1812. [Phil. Trans. 1812, p. 314.]
   Some naturalists have supposed tendrils to be endued with some
degree of perception, to which their propensity to approach neigh
bouring objects may be ascribed; and though others who have written
on the same subject may have rejected this hypothesis, it does not
appear to Mr. Knight that any direct experiments have been made
similar to those which he here describes, for the purpose of ascertain
ing whether these motions may not be ascribed to peculiarity of or
ganization, aided by the operation of external causes.
   The plants selected for his experiments were, the Virginia Creeper,
the Ivy, the Vine, and the Pea. When a young plant of the creeper,
trained directly upwards, was placed alone in the centre of a forcing
house, its tendrils were all turned towards the north wall; but as this
was out of their reach, they declined gradually, and ultimately fixed
themselves on the upright stem beneath and upon                 its
                                                             support.
   When other plants were placed near the glass, their tendrils were
always directed from the light,              as
                                           the former instance, although
                                                  in
no object was within their reach              on
                                         the dark side.
   Mr. Knight next tried the effect          placing near them piece
                                                      of                   a         of
dark  paper;     tothis  they  appeared            to
                                                   strongly attracted, and
                                                           be

                                         a     position,  the tendrils were
found     follow
          to       it. When      piece
                                    a       glass was substituted for the
                                                  of
paper, the tendrils showed no disposition         approach it; but,
                                                           to            the   on
contrary, when      was placed          soreflect the light    the sun upon
                                                                  it. of
                  it                         as   to
the tendrils, they appeared          strongly repelled
                                    to   be                     by
     In
      making corresponding experiments           the ivy, Mr. Knight found
                                                           on

                              tendrils manifested the same tendency
to recede from the light. When first emitted, they pointed upwards;
but the angle gradually increased, and ultimately they pointed di
rectly downwards when                                no
                           object was within their reach      which

    There was, however, this difference observable between the ten
drils of the vine and those         the Virginia creeper: those

    The subject of this communication is divided into four sections,
the first of which relates to silicated fluoric acid gas, and to sub
silicated fluoric acid; the second to the combinations of these acids,
and of pure fluoric acid with ammonia; the third relates to fluo
boracic acid; and the fourth to the compound of this acid with
ammonia.
   For obtaining silicated fluoric gas, the author mixes finely-pow
dered glass with the materials which, at the same time that it                                                           in

On a Periscopic Camera Obscura and Microscope. By William Hyde
  Wollaston, M.D. Sec. R.S. Read June 11, 1812. [Phil. Trans.
  1812, p. 370.]
  The same     views which the author originally had of the periscopic
construction   of spectacles, naturally suggested to him a corresponding
improvement     in the camera obscura. But though it is evident that
enlargement    of the field of view, and some improvement in the di
stinctness of images obliquely situated, might be made by causing
each part of a lens to be as nearly as may be at right angles to each
pencil of rays that are to be collected to a focus, it was not clear to
what extent this principle could be carried where the portion of lens
is necessarily large, and consequently includes parts that may require
a different form for preserving distinctness of other pencils of rays.
   He has, accordingly, made trial of different forms of meniscus for
this purpose, and describes the construction which appears to possess
the greatest advantage with least detriment to the brilliancy and di
stinctness of objects centrally situated.     The radii of curvature here
preferred are in the proportion of 2 to 1.
    A meniscus so formed is placed with convex surface towards the       its

  By means             ofa  camera thus constructed, the author observes, that

Further Experiments and Observations on the influence of the Brain on
  the generation of Animal Heat. By B. C. Brodie, Esq. F.R.S. Com
  municated to the Society for promoting the knowledge of Animal Che
   mistry, and by them to the Royal Society.                      Read      June 18, 1812.
   [Phil. Trans. 1812, p. 378.]
     In some former experiments it was found, that in an animal from
whom the head was removed, the circulation of the blood might be
maintained by means of artificial respiration; that under these cir
cumstances the blood underwent the usual changes of colour in the
two capillary systems, and carbonic acid was evolved from the lungs,
but no heat was generated, and the animal cooled more rapidly than
a dead animal of the same size. In the present communication, some
experiments are detailed, which were instituted with a view to the
further elucidation of this subject.
   An apparatus was constructed for the purpose of measuring the air
consumed in respiration; and two series of experiments were insti
tuted,the first to ascertain the quantity of air consumed by animals
breathing under ordinary circumstances; and the second to ascertain
the quantity consumed by animals which are made to breathe arti
ficially after the functions of the brain are destroyed. It was found,
that in animals breathing under these different circumstances, there
is little or no difference in the quantity of oxygen which disappears,
and of carbonic acid, which is evolved in a given space of time; but
that it uniformly happens, that where the functions of the brain are
suspended, no heat is generated; and that the animal cools more
rapidly than a dead animal.
   In   another experiment, an animal apparently dead from the poison
of essential oil of almonds, was made to recover, by respiration being
artificially produced until the poison had ceased to exert     influence.         its
It was found, that while the functions        the brain were suspended,

restored, the power      generating heat returned.

birds, and has here collected several varieties that he has observed;

   Of the birds that live on animal food, the author has examined
several kinds of falcon, the Soland goose, the crane, the cormorant,
the common gull, and the snow-bird, the last of which differs     con
siderably from the rest.
   Among graminivorous     birds, the swan and goose are noticed as
differing from most others in the situation and structure of these
glands.   Others of this tribe here examined are the turkey, the cas
sowary, the American ostrich, and the African ostrich. In the three
last the solvent glands are in a cavity of unusual size; and the mus
cular structure of the gizzard is uncommonly weak, which the author
conceives to be connected with the mode of progressive motion, which
is the same in these birds, and may serve to grind the food without
the assistance of strong muscular action.
On some Combinations of Phosphorus and Sulphur, and on some other
  Subjects of Chemical Inquiry. By Sir Humphry Davy, Knt. LL.D.
  Sec. R.S.   Read June 18, 1812. [Phil. Trans. 1812, p. 405.]
   The author has formerly described to the Society two compounds,
consisting of phosphorus and oxymuriatic acid, or chlorine; one of
them is a solid compound; and by his present experiments, consists
of three parts of phosphorus combined with twenty of chlorine. The
second compound contains only half this quantity of chlorine, and is
a fluid, having the specific gravity of 1:46. The fluid will also dis
solve a still further quantity of phosphorus; but the author has not
ascertained whether there is any definite limit to the proportion so
dissolved.
   When this fluid compound is treated with water, it forms a thick
fluid, of the consistence of syrup, that crystallizes slowly by cooling.
These crystals may be called hydrophosphorous acid; for by heat they
are decompounded into phosphoric acid, and a peculiar gas, consist
ing of phosphorus and hydrogen.        This gas differs from common
phosphuretted hydrogen, in not being spontaneously inflammable
when mixed with common air, and in being considerably less fetid
than that gas. The proportions of its constituent parts are estimated
to be four hydrogen, with twenty phosphorus.         The phosphoric acid
contained in the crystals, derived its origin from the water added to
the original fluid; while the hydrogen of the water escaped with the
chlorine in the form of muriatic gas.
    In the interchange of elements which takes place in these combi
nations, there are many circumstances favourable to ascertaining the
proportions in which the several elements unite with each other;
 and the author observes, the results accord remarkably well with
other determinations.
  In the same manner respecting sulphur, a similar accordance be
tween the proportions, by weight, in which it unites with different
elements, confirms other estimates of the elementary number       fit   to

                                    441
express the relation of this body to hydrogen, the unit of the scale.
For since in sulphuretted hydrogen the hydrogen is not altered in
bulk by the sulphur it holds in solution, the increase of weight shows
the proportion of sulphur combined.       And so likewise in sulphurous
acid gas, the bulk is not greater than that of the oxygen which it
contains; and since the specific gravity is double that of oxygen, the
increase proves that sulphur, in this instance, has combined with an
equal weight of oxygen. When sulphur combines with a larger pro
portion of oxygen, the presence of water appears to be requisite as
the medium of union. In the phosphoric acid, on the contrary, water
is not necessary for uniting the full proportion of oxygen with which
phosphorus is capable of combining.
    With respect to the water that has been observed to be retained
by many earths, and metallic precipitates, it is remarked, that this is
probably combined with them in definite proportion, and that the
presence of the water has considerable influence on their colours, and
on other properties.
 On a   new detonating Compound:   in a Letter from Sir Humphry Davy,
    LL.D. F.R.S.     to the  Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B.
    P.R.S.     Read November 5, 1812. [Phil. Trans. 1813, p. 1.]
    The present account is intended as a caution to others against the
dangerous effects of the very explosive detonation, by which the
author has himself been a sufferer.      His attention was first directed
to the    subject by   a letter received from France, mentioning that
about twelve months since, a compound had been discovered of azote
 with chlorine, which appears in the form of an oil heavier than water,
 and which explodes, by a gentle heat, with all the violence of the
 fulminating metals. The letter adds, that this discovery cost the
 operator an eye and a finger. Since the letter contained no account
 of the mode of preparing the compound, and as none could be found
 in any of the French journals, Sir Humphry Davy pursued a hint
 given him by Mr. Children, who informed him that his friend Mr.
 Burton had, in the month of July last, observed the formation of a
 volatile oily substance in a solution of nitrate of ammonia, exposed
 to chlorine in the state of gas. In repeating the experiment, the
 author perceived first an oily film on the surface of the fluid, which
 gradually collected into small globules, and fell to the bottom. One
 of these globules being taken out while floating on the surface of the
 water, and slightly warmed, exploded with brilliant light, but with
 out any violence of detonation.
    In a series of experiments carried on jointly with Mr. Children
 and Mr. Warburton, other ammoniacal solutions were substituted,
 and it was found that the same product was obtained by means of
 oxalate of ammonia, or by a weak solution of pure ammonia.          The
 first instance that occurred of violent  explosion, was in their endea
 vours to form larger quantities in a Wolfe's apparatus, by a series of
 bottles containing the different solutions.

                                                   442
   The heat generated by the union of ammoniacal vapour and chlo
rine, caused the destruction of the whole apparatus by an instanta
 neous explosion.
   From this time their attempts to form the oil were confined to
small phials of the gas, and their trials of                          its
                                                  properties were limited
to   aquantity not greater than grain        mustard-seed; but still the

results were attended with danger.         attempting    In   collect the gas           to

water       curved tube, the tube was shattered with great violence,
           in  a

eye, from which he has not yet recovered.
   Explosions equally violent were afterwards witnessed             Mr. Chil                       by
dren and Mr. Warburton, even without confinement: when                  small                            a

   The author thence proceeds to deduce other theorems that would
be for the most part complicated and unintelligible when geometri
cally enunciated, though sufficiently simple in their algebraic expres
sions.   They are indeed, as the author observes, properties rather of
the equations of the conic sections, than of the curves themselves;
properties of a limited number of disjoined points, determined ac
cording to a certain law, rather than of a series of consecutive points
composing a line.

of notation, which is new, and for which he apologizes, by explaining
its advantage     point in simplicity.     of

fraction from his own observations, he has hitherto employed those
of Dr. Bradley, which have been many years in use at the Royal Ob

 Observations relative to the near and distant Sight of different Persons.
   By James Ware, Esq. F.R.S. Read November 19, 1812. [Phil.
   Trans. 1813, p. 31.]
   The author states, in the first place, that he has rarely observed
short-sightedness in children under ten years of age, and that he con
siders it as commencing generally between that period and eighteen;
that it at first occasions so little inconvenience, that it is not noticed
by those who have not access to concave glasses, and consequently
is very frequently overcome by the natural efforts of the eye. Per
sons, on the contrary, in the higher ranks of society, who have it
more in their power to indulge a slight weakness, by having recourse
to short-sighted glasses, soon confirm the imperfection, and in many
instances even render
                   -     it worse, by employing glasses deeper than are
necessary.
   For the purpose of instituting a comparison between the propor
tional prevalence of this defectin different classes of society, Mr. Ware
made inquiry in the three regiments of Foot Guards, containing nearly
 10,000 men, and also in the two Universities, Oxford and Cambridge.
In the Guards short-sightedness among the privates is scarcely known;
and not more than half a dozen recruits are said to have been re
jected for this imperfection     in the course of twenty years. In the
 Universities,  on the contrary, the numbers are so considerable, that
in one of the colleges in Oxford, it is said that of 127 persons, so
 many as thirty-two have used either a hand-glass or spectacles. It is
thus proved that short-sightedness is corrected in one class of per
sons, and encouraged in the other; and it is evident that even in
those who absolutely require glasses, it may be increased by using
such as are deeper than are really necessary, or counteracted by em
ploying the lowest with which the eye can see with comfort.
   It is observed, however, that extreme short-sightedness sometimes
occurs in children from visible imperfection in the form of the cor
mea, and sometimes arises as an accidental and temporary conse
quence of general debility, and is then removable by chalybeate me
dicines and bracing applications.
   Dr. Porterfield has observed, that the pupils of short-sighted per
sons are in general more dilated than those of others; but Mr. Ware
does not admit this to be generally the case; neither does he admit

                                                      445
the common opinion to be well founded, that the magnitude of the
pupil varies according to the distance of the object viewed.         He
names, however, one extraordinary instance of a lady, whose pupil
contracts only when she views objects at the distance of nine inches,
but at other times is dilated very nearly to the full extent of the rim
of the cornea.
    Mr. Ware has also made experiments similar to those of Dr. Wells,
on the alteration of the power of the eye during that dilatation of
the pupil which is produced by the external application of belladonna.
Those of the author were attended with the same result of length
 ening the focus of either eye to which the belladonna was applied,
without affecting the customary range of vision in the other eye.
    The author observes, that short-sightedness does not depend on
 the greater or less concavity of the cornea alone; since      distance                           its
 from the retina, and the convexity      the crystalline also, must
                                                               of                                                   be
 taken into the account.
   It  has sometimes been observed, that old persons have                    short                 in   a
time recovered the      perfect   sight      younger     persons;

been explained              by
                       Dr. Porterfield, by supposition         a  the absorption        of
of  fat from the bottom         the orbit, allowing the axis
                                       of                              the eye               of                     to
become more elongated: but Mr. Ware thinks                  more   likely     have
                                                                              it                        to

                                           of                   consequence         in                              of
which the sclerotica would                           be
                                       pressed inwards, and that then the
axis    ofthe eye would                be
                               elongated.
    Mr. Ware observes, that persons             general who use glasses, pos
                                                               in
sess the    power     seeing
                        of    both near and distant objects with the same
 glass, but that this     not the case with those who have been couched,
                                 is
who    always   require     different glass

 objects; proving thereby that the adapting power               the eye depends     of
 on   the presence       the crystalline.

     In comparing the range                     of
                                     adaptation possessed           short-sighted        by
 persons with that         others, the author conceives the range
                                 of                                             the                      of

The Bakerian Lecture.              On the elementary Particles of certain Crystals.
     By William            Hyde Wollaston, M.D. Sec. R.S. Read November
     26, 1812.            [Phil. Trans. 1813, p. 51.]
    In this lecture the author undertakes to explain a difficulty that
has occurred in crystallography, respecting the primitive molecule of
those bodies that assume the octohedral and tetrahedral forms, when
broken in the direction of their natural fractures.
    The substance that he selects as most convenient for experiment
is fluor spar, which may very readily be divided into any number of
acute rhomboids, having the angles of their surfaces 60° and 120°.
   These might be regarded for all the practical purposes of crystal
lography as the integral molecule, and from thence                  the other mo      all

alone, will fill any space without leaving vacuities.

from the arrangement which spheres would most naturally assume
by mutual attraction, proposes            theory founded

                                                         as

                                                                   in a
and one beneath them. Accordingly, Dr. Hooke could know nothing
of that which forms the principal novelty   the present observation,
                                                                   of
namely, that when     mass   spheres has been formed wholly accord

      to               tetrahedral arrangement, then certain sections
                                    or

                                 447
of the same mass present also the square arrangement, and accord
ingly certain portions of    it exhibit the octohedral group.
   The author    remarks,   in support of this theory, that a large pro
portion of those substances which assume the octohedral form, are
considered by chemists as simple bodies, and are therefore more likely
to have the simple form of spheres than such as consist of more than
one element.     Since the supposition of spherical particles appeared
to him to afford so satisfactory an explanation of an acknowledged
difficulty in crystallography, he was led to consider what other forms
would result from the union of solids most nearly allied to spheres;
and he observed that obtuse rhomboids, like those of carbonate of
lime and other substances, would be formed by the union of oblate
spheroids, as indeed Huyghens had long since observed; and that by
the union of oblong spheroids, the natural result would be triangular
and hexangular prisms, as are found in beryl and phosphate of lime.
   But the most singular arrangement noticed, is that which affords
an explanation of the origin of cubes in crystallography.      These, he
supposes, may consist of spherical particles, of two different kinds,
regularly intermixed in equal numbers (in conformity to the most re
cent views of binary combination in chemistry); for these, he ob
serves, will not tend, as before, to the octohedral arrangement, but
will be perfectly in equilibrio when every group of eight balls com
poses a cube, according to the most obvious course of alternation of
the two elements. For in that case all similar balls will be equi
distant from each other, and will also be equally distant from all ad
jacent balls of the opposite denomination.
   In a note are subjoined some observations on a theory of crystalli
zation proposed by M. Prechtl, who imagines that a mass of soft
spheres may all be compressed into tetrahedra, which is demonstrably
impossible.   That by another degree of softness or of attraction,
spheres, each surrounded by five others, may be compressed into tri
 angular prisms, without regard to the different degree of compression
that must take place in the direction of the axis; that other spheres
 again less compressible than before, and consequently surrounded by
 as many as six others, may be formed into cubes, which indeed is
admitted to be a very possible supposition.
  It is observed, however, that M. Prechtl denied that a sphere can
be surrounded by more than six, although, in fact, the most probable
supposition   is,
                that each soft sphere would       surrounded by twice
                                                    be

resinous matter no longer soluble in water, but now rendered soluble
in alcohol, by a supposed union with oxygen derived from these acids.
   Mr. Smithson being in possession of ulmin, sent to him from Pa
lermo by the same person who had furnished M. Klaproth with the
subject of his researches, has made various experiments, which lead
to a different opinion of                     its   nature from that which has been                               enter

solution, however, still retains     slight yellow colour, from

its original properties.
   Hence Mr. Smithson infers, that ulmin       not simple vegetable           is         a
principle        of      qualities,                       potash, with

 over a lamp till all the air is expelled; and while the stream is still
 issuing with violence through the capillary extremity, the end of it
 is held in the flame of the lamp, till in proportion as the force of the
 steam diminishes, the heat acquires power to seal the tube hermeti

 empty ball be placed in a freezing mixture of salt and snow, the
 water contained in the opposite ball will be frozen solid in a very few
 minutes.
    The first vapour being condensed by the common effect of cold, is
 immediately succeeded by a fresh emission, with proportional reduc
tion of temperature; so that heat is continually withdrawn, or cold
 generated at a distance by the freezing cause.

A    Description   of the solvent Glands and Gizzards of the Ardea Argala,
    the Casuarius Emu, and the long-legged Cassowary from New South
    Wales. By Sir Everard Home, Bart. F.R.S. Read December 17,
    1812.     [Phil. Trans. 1813, p. 77.]
    In the first of these birds the solvent glands are different from those
of any other bird examined by the author, each gland being made up
of five or six cells, that open into one common excretory duct; but
its gizzard is very similar to that of the crow.
    In the Emu the solvent glands are oval bags, one fourth of an inch
in length, and one sixteenth wide. The gizzard differs from that of
the crow in having a thicker lining, and is remarkable solely for its
situation; for it is not placed, as usual, between the stomach and
the duodenum, but forms a pouch on one side, so that food can pass
onwards direct into the duodenum, without being received into the
gizzard.
    In the Cassowary of New South Wales, the solvent glands are si
milar to those of the emu, but larger; and the gizzard is also similar
in every respect, but stronger.
    The author further remarks upon the circumstances in the struc
ture of the cassowaries, and other birds most nearly allied to them,
which adapt them to the different degrees of fertility of the countries
they inhabit.
    The Emu of Java, where there is abundance of food, has intestines
that are of large diameter, and comparatively short, so as to afford
free passage to the superfluity of food they take, and a gizzard to be
employed only occasionally.
    The Cassowary of New South Wales has intestines of smaller dia
meter, thirteen feet long; and a stronger gizzard, more frequently
employed in a less productive country.

  The Rhea Americana, with intestines equally long, has a gizzard
so placed, that no part of the food can escape trituration.
   And lastly, the Ostrich of Africa, where its means of subsistence
are most precarious, has a gizzard extremely strong, and intestines
seventy feet in length.
Additional Remarks on the State in which Alcohol exists in fermented
  Liquors.    By William Thomas Brande, Esq. F.R.S.        Read De
  cember   17, 1812.   [Phil. Trans. 1813, p. 82.]
   The question here discussed, is whether alcohol exists in fermented
liquors ready formed as the result of fermentation, or is formed sub
sequently from them by the process of distillation.         The latter the
author has imagined to be the commonly received opinion; and in a
preceding communication to the Society he endeavoured to refute                                               it,
by   showing that the same quantity         alcohol was always obtained,

rature. Since the conclusions which            then drew   may he    objected                  be
to   onthe ground that even the lowest temperature that             employed               he

   The breed here described by Col. Humphreys, first occurred as an
accidental variety in the State of Massachusetts, about sixteen miles
distant from Boston, in the year 1791; a lamb was produced, having
a singular appearance, from the shortness of           legs; and     some        its                      by
chance rather than by any particular design, was reserved for breed
ing.      the first season only two lambs were yeaned, resembling the
          In
father; but       subsequent years several more were produced, having
                       in
the same    peculiarities;  and     breed was thence established, which,

at  first called the Otter breed; but from       surgeon who afterwards    a
dissected one       them, they were called Ancon, from the elbow-like

   When ancons are put into the same inclosure with other sheep,

they have been encouraged, there are few commons, no hedges, no
shepherds, no dogs to attend the flocks; and the fences of wood and
stone are not sufficient to prevent active sheep from breaking pasture,
to the great destruction of adjacent crops.
   The advantage, however, in this respect, is counterbalanced by a
corresponding inconvenience arising from the same source, namely,
the great difficulty of driving such cripples to market, at the same
time that they are generally not so fat as others, from the greater
labour they undergo in gathering their food.
   These objections are indeed such, that since the introduction of
Merinoes, which are equally gregarious, quiet, and orderly, in ad
dition to the strong recommendation of their fleeces, the ancon breed
appears in danger of becoming wholly extinct; so that the author
had some difficulty in procuring one in Boston to be dissected, for the
purpose of sending a skeleton, which accompanied the letter, and
was laid before the Society.
Experiments to ascertain the coagulating Power of the Secretion of the
   gastric Glands.    By Sir Everard Home, Bart. F.R.S.      Communi
   cated by the Society for promoting the Knowledge of Animal Che
   mistry.    Read January 21, 1813. [Phil. Trans. 1813, p. 96.]
   It has long since been observed, that the first step in the process
of digestion is the conversion of the food into a jelly; but whether
this is effected by means of the gastric liquor alone, or by a joint
operation of other secretions, has not been ascertained.     From Mr.
Hunter's experiments, it appeared that the same species of coagu
lation takes place in the same food admitted into the stomach of a
great variety of animals; and that in the calf's stomach this power
resided in the fourth cavity alone; since the mucus taken from the
surfaces of the first, second, or third cavities, had no such effect as
rennet, which is prepared by infusion of the inner membrane of the
fourth cavity.
   The same inquiry is here pursued by the author, with a view to
ascertain more accurately what part it is that possesses this property
in the highest degree, by comparison of the effects of rennet pre
pared from different portions.
   By this mode of trial no part of the hog's stomach was found to
coagulate milk, but that near the pylorus, where the gastric glands
are situated.
   Experiments were next made with rennets prepared from the crop
and gizzard of a cock, from the stomach of a shark, the stomach of a
salmon, and that of a thornback, all of which had the power of coa
gulating milk.
   Other experiments were afterwards made, with the assistance of
Mr. Hatchett and Mr. Brande, on the comparative powers of different
parts of the same stomach, and the difference in various species of
animals, the chicken, hawk, turkey, and calf.
   In a chicken the horny lining of the gizzard gave a firmer curd

                                                         453
from milk than the cardiac portion of the stomach. The cardiac
portion of the stomach of the hawk was found more powerful than
the same part of a common fowl.
   The gastric glands were carefully dissected out from behind the
membrane that lines the cardiac extremity of the stomach of a turkey;
and of these, forty grains, by weight, were taken, and their effect
compared with an equal weight of membranous lining of the same
cavity, an equal weight of membrane from the fourth cavity of a calf's
stomach in a recent state, and forty grains of dry rennet. Since the
last must have been prepared from about four times        weight      re                          its                   of
cent  membrane,   its effect was  produced     much the shortest time.     in
The coagulation effected by the gastric glands took place nearly                                                             at
the same time       by the recent calf's stomach; while that from the
                           as
lining    the turkey's stomach was nearly three times
             of                                             long    pro                               as            in
ducing the corresponding effects.
   From these experiments, the author infers that the secretion from
the gastric glands possesses the power       coagulating milk, and com

   Along with the polarized light, Dr. Brewster also observed a faint
nebulous light not polarized, which he also finds in transmission
through cornelian and chalcedony, and thinks it important as leading
to a satisfactory theory of polarization.

power of chromate of lead, which, he remarks, is greater than that

using the common concave glasses till he was upwards of thirty years
of age, when No. 2 was barely sufficient; and he very shortly had
recourse to No. 3. In the course of a few years an increase of the
defect rendered it necessary for him to employ glasses still deeper,
and his sight soon required No. 5, where it has remained stationary
to the present time.  From the progress which Sir Charles Blagden
has observed in his own short-sightedness, he is of opinion that it
would have been accelerated by an earlier use of concave glasses, and
might have been retarded, or perhaps prevented altogether, by at
tention to read and write with his book or paper as far distant as
might be from his eyes.
   In this communication he takes the same opportunity of adding an
experiment made many years since on the subject of vision, with a
view to decide how far the similarity of the images received by the
two eyes contribute to the impression made on the mind, that they
arise from only one object. In the house where he then resided, was
a marble surface ornamented with fluting, in alternate ridges and
concavities.   When his eyes were directed to these, at the distance
of nine inches, they could be seen with perfect distinctness.  When
the optic axes were directed to a point at some distance behind, the
ridges seen by one eye became confounded with the impression of
concavities made upon the other, and occasioned the uneasy sensation
usual in squinting. But when the eyes were directed to a point still
more distant, the impression of one ridge on the right eye corresponded
with that made with an adjacent ridge upon the left eye, so that the
fluting then appeared distinct and single as at first, but the object
appeared at double                 its
                        real distance, and apparently magnified      that
proportion. Though the different parts         the  fluting  were     of
                                                                      the                             of in
same form, their colours were not exactly alike, and this occasioned
some degree      confusion when attention was paid
                      of                                   this degree                to                       of
dissimilarity.

same proportion as the silver. By steeping for a few minutes in
nitrous acid the silver is then dissolved; but the gold or platina re
main unaffected, and require merely to be washed in distilled water
in order to free them from any portion of the solution or other little
impurities that may adhere during the solution.
   The method employed by the author for coating gold wire is
attended with more difficulty than he expected.       A rod of silver
having been previously drawn of considerable thickness, a hole was
drilled through                      and into this hole a gold wire was
                             it longitudinally,
inserted so as to fill the hole.  But in consequence of the toughness
of fine silver, the operation of drilling was found extremely difficult,
and this method was afterwards abandoned.            It was found that
platina might be advantageously substituted for gold, as in that case
the first drawn wire might be coated with silver by fixing it in the
axis of a cylindrical mould, and then pouring melted silver to fill the
mould. The platina employed for this purpose was fused by the
flame of a spirit lamp impelled by a current of oxygen, as contrived
by Dr. Marcet: this platina having then been drawn alone to a wire
rº-r of an inch in diameter, it received a coating of silver that was
just 80 times the thickness of the platina: accordingly when the
silver was reduced by drawing to +1-a of an inch in diameter, that
of the platina was re-ºry; but nevertheless it remained surprisingly
tenacious in proportion to           substance.   its

an area of 120 square yards, as many as six tusks of that animal

   One horn of an ox measured as much as four feet six inches in

time capable of being easily disunited for the purpose of making any

   On the Formation    of Fat in the Intestines of living Animals. By Sir
     Everard   Home,   Bart. Presented by the Society for promoting the
     Knowledge of Animal Chemistry.          Read March 18, 1813. [Phil.
     Trans.  1813,  p. 146.]
     In the course of the author's inquiries respecting the digestive
  organs of different animals, he has been gradually led to suppose that
  the office of the colon and lower intestines in general is different from
  that of the upper. In the stomach and small intestines the process
  of forming and separating the chyle is carried on; but after the food
  has passed into the caecum and colon, it appears to undergo a total
  change in its appearance and smell, with some tendency to putrefac
  tion, that is not observable in the contents of the small intestines,
  and is prevented from being communicated to them by a valve that
  does not allow even gases to pass upwards into the small intestines.
     The general construction also of the colon and caeca favours the
  opinion that the functions which they perform are of a different kind;.
  since their capacity and arrangement would occasion the passage of
  their contents to be more tardy than       it is through the small intes
  tines.   The smell and semi-putrescent state of these matters led to
 a comparison of them with animal substances buried in the ground
 in moist situations, which are known to be converted into adipocere,
 and suggested the possibility that the secondary digestive operation
 performed in the lower intestines might be the formation of fat; and
 this conjecture appeared to the author to be supported by the con
 sideration, that fat is the winter supply in dormant animals, and that
 these animals have a formation of intestines peculiar to themselves,
 in which there is no valve to distinguish the beginning of the colon,
 and no other impediment to the free supply of materials for the pro
 duction of fat.
     The author next adduces an instance of the conversion of a corpse
 into adipocere (in the course of twenty-one years) in Shoreditch
 churchyard; and compares the situation of feculent matters retained
 in the cells of the colon with a current of more fluid matters passing
 over them with that of bodies buried in the neighbourhood of a com
 mon sewer; and he enumerates various instances in which substances
 of a fatty nature are known to be formed in the large intestines.
     Ambergris, for example, is never found excepting in the last seven
 feet of the intestines of the spermaceti whale.       In the human intes
 tines also fatty concretions are sometimes found, called scybala, and
 these have a considerable resemblance to ambergris.
     One instance of the formation of fatty concretions in the intestines
 appeared to have occurred in consequence of having swallowed large
 quantities of common olive oil. The consistence of these is com
 pared to that of soft wax, and by analysis they appeared to consist
 of two thirds olive oil, and one third animal mucus.
     A second instance is noticed, which, as well as the preceding, was
 observed by Dr. Babington in a child 4; years old, subject to
jaundice, who has voided for some time past at intervals of ten days

                                    463
or a fortnight, as much as two or three ounces at a time, of a yellow
oily fluid that concretes when cold.
   In consequence of such instances of fat existing in considerable
quantities in the lower intestines, the author endeavoured to ascer
tain whether it might not be found in the common contents of the
colon, and preferred those from the duck as the subject of experiment.
Mr. Brande, who undertook to make this experiment for the author,
divided the matter into two parts, which were kept for a week at a
temperature varying from 40° to 60°; one in pure water, the other
in extremely dilute nitrous acid. In the former no perceptible
quantity of fat was found; but the latter yielded by this treatment
about one eighth part of fat.
    When a similar experiment was made on the contents of the
rectum, there was no appearance of fat produced even by the action
of nitric acid.
    As it appeared possible that bile might perhaps assist in the con
version of animal substances into fat, the author requested Mr. Brande
to try the effect of mixing muscular flesh with bile. Human muscle
 when digested with water alone, at the temperature of 100°, for four
days, became slightly putrid without any appearance of fat; but
 when digested with human bile at the same temperature it became
 fetid on the second day, fetid and yellow on the third, and on the
 fourth it had the smell of excrement, was flabby, and appeared fatty
on the surface.
   A second experiment on beef in the bile of the ox had the same
result as the preceding.
    In a third experiment made also on beef with ox-bile at the
temperature of 60°, there was no appearance of fat at the end of
six days; and in a fourth experiment made again at 100°, there was
again no appearance of grease produced by the process.
    From these experiments, says the author, we learn that the bile
has the power of converting animal substances into fat; that the
temperature of 100°, or nearly so, is necessary for that process; and
that the change is produced just as putrefaction is beginning to
take place.
    With a view to ascertain whether the same process could be
detected actually going on in the human intestines, a quantity of
faeces that had been retained upwards of six days were examined
by being mixed with water at the temperature of 100°, and allowed
to cool, when a film that appeared to be of an oily nature was found
on the surface.
   If,  then,it   be admitted that the origin    of  fat
                                                       is   such   as   here
                                                                        is
conceived     by the author,   he  remarks that the   wasting of  the  body
in various disorders of the lower bowels    is   accounted for. The uses
 of the various turns of the colon in different animals will be ex
 plained, and the origin  of   fatty concretions in the gall-bladder, which
 are so  common, may    be   supposed to  arise from the action of  the bile
 on the mucus secreted from its coats.

 On the colouring Matter of the black Bronchial Glands and        of  the
    black Spots of the Lungs.       By George Pearson, M.D.      F.R.S.
   Read    February  25, 1813. [Phil. Trans. 1813, p. 159.]
    It is well known that in men the bronchial glands that are situated
near the bifurcation of the trachea are of a very dark colour; that in
infancy the lungs in general have little or no such colour; that at
the age of eighteen or twenty they have a mottled or marbled
appearance, from black or dark blue spots, lines and points dissemi
nated through them immediately under the membranous covering,
and that this appearance becomes darker and darker as persons ad
vance in age; and that the same black spots are also observable
throughout the whole interior substance of the lungs when cut.
    It has been conjectured by some persons that this appearance is
owing to sooty matter taken in with the air during respiration, and
accumulated in proportion to the duration of life; but in reply to
this supposition it has been objected by others, that the same degree
of blackness is not observable in brute animals, and that the theory
is not supported by any accurate observations of the proportional
want of intensity in those persons who might be supposed to have
lived less exposed to soot by permanent residence at a distance from
any large town, and from any other considerable consumption of
fuel.
   Dr. Pearson professes himself to be of the former opinion, and
adduces a series of experiments to prove that the black matter in
question is actually charcoal.    In order to collect the subject of his
experiments, the black glands in which it is contained are dissected
out, and by washing are freed as far as possible from extraneous
matter.     The colouring substance is then partly pressed out, diluted
with    water,  and found to subside from it as a black deposit.      By
boiling the black glands in caustic potash the whole structure is
destroyed, but the black matter is not dissolved, and after a sufficient
length of time subsides from the fluid.      By muriatic acid also the
glands are dissolved, and black matter is deposited from the solution.
Nitric acid also dissolves the glands, but not the black matter which
in this case floats on the surface.
   By corresponding experiments on the substance of the lungs the
same black deposit is obtained, but in much smaller proportion than
from the glands.
   The black matter thus collected and subsequently dried, having
been found to yield carbonic acid by deflagration with nitre or
oxymuriate of potash, Dr. Pearson considers himself warranted in
concluding that it is charcoal in an uncombined state; that it is
admitted along with the air in respiration; that it is retained in the
minute ramifications of the air-tubes, and conveyed by the absorbents
to the bronchial glands.

Experiments on the Alcohol of Sulphur, or Sulphuret of Carbon.  By

  Guy's Hospital.  Read May 13, 1813. [Phil. Trans. 1813, p. 171.]
   The great diversity of opinions entertained by several of the most
celebrated of the French chemists regarding the nature of this com
pound, which was originally noticed by Lampadius in the distillation
of a mixture of pyrites and charcoal, induced the authors to under
take the present analysis, without any knowledge that it was again
nearly at the same period under examination in France. The original
opinion of Lampadius was, that it consisted of sulphur and hydrogen,
and his opinion was also supported by Vauquelin, Robiquet, and the
younger Berthollet. The elder Berthollet had supposed it to be a
compound of sulphur, hydrogen, and carbon; but, according to
Messrs. Clement and Desormes, hydrogen had appeared not to be
one of its constituents, a result which is now adopted in a late re
port of Messrs. Berthollet, Thenard, and Vauquelin, and is here
further confirmed by the inquiries of Professor Berzelius and Dr. -
Marcet.
   Their joint paper is divided into four parts, the first of which de
scribes the preparation and general properties of the compound; in
the second, the authors examine whether hydrogen be present in                                               it;

 of them is to be regarded as the elementary atom, according to Mr.
Dalton's view of the subject.
   Professor Berzelius next examines various compounds, which may
be termed carbo-sulphurets of the alkalies and earths.      The carbo
sulphuret of ammonia sublimes unchanged in close vessels; but when
exposed to air, the carbon is deposited, and hydro-sulphuret is pro
duced; and, in the same manner, the carbo-sulphurets of lime, ba
rytes, and strontia are decomposed when moisture is present, and
hydro-sulphurets of these earths are formed.
   The remainder of this appendix contains the analysis of a solid
white crystalline compound, having the appearance and volatility of
camphor, formed by exposure of the sulphuret of carbon during three
weeks to the fumes of strong nitro-muriatic acid.    It is insoluble in
water, but dissolves in alcohol, ether, and in oils, whether fixed or
volatile. When this compound was sublimed through a red-hot tube
containing iron wire, it was decomposed, and found to consist of mu
riatic acid, 48-74; sulphurous acid, 29-63; and carbonic acid, 21-63.
On the Means of procuring a steady Light in Coal Mines without the
  danger of Explosion.    By William Reid Clanny, M.D. of Sunder

   The author having resided several years near the coal mines in the
county of Durham, has paid much attention to the circumstances of
those explosions which so frequently occasion the death of many                         in
dustrious people, and has contrived a lamp, which he thinks likely
to answer the purpose of illumination, without any danger attending
its use.
   He is of opinion, that ventilation, as at present practised, has little
or no effect in preventing explosions; since it has no tendency to di
minish the quantity of inflammable gas emitted by the old workings,
which must always be in danger of exploding wherever it comes into
contact with atmospheric air, if light be applied to            The partitions

the quantity of inflammable gas amounts to one twelfth part of the
atmospheric air present, an explosion may take place.       f
   For the purpose of preventing such accidents, Dr. Clanny has con
trived to insulate a candle, by water placed both above and below
the lantern in which it is contained. The air, which is intended to
support the flame, is supplied by means of a pair of common bellows,
by which it is forced through the water beneath the flame; and it is
again emitted, after having supported the combustion, by a bent tube
that passes into water from the top of the lantern.
   In consequence of this arrangement, if the air of the mine becomes
liable to inflame, the explosion will be confined to the mere content
of the lantern, of which only a small part will be consumed, unless
the quantity of inflammable gas be very suddenly increased.

 Additions to an Account of the Anatomy of the Squalus maximus, con
   tained in a former Paper; with Observations on the Structure of the
   Bronchial Artery, By Sir Everard Home, Bart. F.R.S.          Read
   June 24, 1813. [Phil. Trans. 1813, p. 227.]
     The author observes, that with respect to his former description of
 the external parts, he has no addition to make, excepting that, from
 the position of the fish at the time when it was drawn, a small fin
 was omitted between the anus and tail; which, however, is so far
 important, that some persons have on this ground imagined that the
 fish described was a different species of Squalus.
     Of the internal parts, the stomach is now described, and a delinea
 tion given. The liver has six ducts; but these unite, before they
 enter the duodenum, in one common cavity, which corresponds to
 the dilatation of the common duct in those quadrupeds that have no
gall-bladder.
  . A drawing is given of the heart and valves of the bronchial artery;
 and it is remarked, that the coats of this artery are muscular to some
 distance from the ventricle, the use of which is conceived by the au
thor to be to aid in propelling the blood through the gills when
impeded by the pressure of any great depth of water: for the same
quantity of blood should pass through the gills at all depths, unless
the water at greater depths contained a larger proportion of air; but
this did not appear to be the case by direct experiment, in which the
author was assisted by Mr. Brande.
     In support of the opinion that muscularity of the coats of the
bronchial artery is connected with the circumstance of living at great
depths, the author remarks, that in the turbot and the wolf-fish, which
live in shallow water, there is no muscular covering to the origin of
the bronchial artery, but, on the contrary,              its
                                                 coats are    exceedingly     so

   After this digression concerning varieties in the structure of the
heart, the author resumes his anatomy of the Squalus marimus, and
notices, among the peculiarities of the urinary passages, that there
is no proper urinary bladder, but a cavity comparatively small, that
is common to the urine and semen; since both the vasa differentia
and ureters open into it at the distance of about four inches from
each other.
   The holders in the male Squalus have been noticed before; but it
is now added, that in each holder is a canal, communicating with a
cavity between the skin and muscles of the abdomen, which is stated
to be eleven feet long and two wide. The surfaces of this cavity are
white, and extremely smooth; and it contains a mucus more viscid
than any known animal secretion.
   Respecting the brain, it is remarked, that in the Squalus, as well
as in fish in general, the cerebrum is wanting, unless the part from
which the olfactory nerves arise be so called.
  The eye is very small for the size of the fish; its largest diameter
being not more than three inches, and                            its
                                           shortest only one inch and
three quarters.                        -
  The straight muscles that surround the eye are        much stronger             so
than would appear        the author requisite for moving

   When the bulb of a thermometer, wrapped in fine lint, has been
dipped in the sulphureous liquor, if it be simply exposed to the air it
sinks to about zero of Fahrenheit's scale, although by a similar eva
poration of ether the cold produced is not below 20°.
   If a thermometer, coated as before, and wetted with the sulphuret,
be placed in the receiver of an air-pump, a cold of 65° or 70° below
0° is easily obtained, by a vacuum which supports one fourth of an
inch of mercury; and if the air-pump can exhaust as far as one eighth
of an inch, the thermometer sinks to 81° or 82° in less than two
minutes, even though the thermometer at the commencement of the
experiment was as high as 70° above 0.
   Hence the freezing of mercury is an experiment that may be per
formed at any time, and with no more apparatus than a common air
pump, and enough of the sulphuret to moisten the bulb of a thermo
meter.    Since sulphuric acid has no affinity for the sulphuret, it has
no effect in adding to the degree of cold produced upon the principle
upon which that is employed by Mr. Leslie, excepting in so far as
it removes any moisture that may be present in the air, and which
in some measure impedes the process until it is converted into a
hoar frost, that may be seen adherent to the bulb of the thermo
meter.

Some Experiments and Observations on the Substances produced in dif
  ferent chemical Processes on Fluor Spar. By Sir Humphry Davy,
   LL.D. F.R.S. V.P.R.I. Read July 8, 1813. [Phil. Trans. 1813,
  p. 263.]
   In the Bakerian lecture for 1808, the author had supposed fluor
acid to be decomposed when potassium is heated in silicated fluoric
acid gas, and that oxygen was separated from it; an inference which
had also been drawn from a similar experiment by Messrs. Gay
Lussac and Thenard. But when he afterwards found that oxymuriatic
acid could not be decomposed, and that no oxygen could be separated
from the compounds of this body with phosphorus, sulphur, or the
metals, he was led to conceive an analogy between the oxymuriatic
and fluoric compounds, an analogy also suggested to him by M. Am
pere.
   The experiments described in the present paper are principally
guided by this analogy, with a view to ascertain whether it is well
founded.
   The subjects of experiment are silicated fluoric gas, originally dis
covered by Scheele.     Liquid fluoric acid in its concentrated state,
first obtained by Messrs. Gay-Lussac and Thenard, and the fluo-boric
acid of the same chemists.
   When these compounds are acted upon by potassium or sodium,
the results are fluates of potash or soda, with silicum, hydrogen, or
boron, according to the compound operated upon.
  With regard to these results, there are three hypotheses which
may be maintained.      One             is,
                                  that fluoric acid consists              of

   Sulphuric and nitric acids which, according to the first supposition,
are inflammable bases combined with oxygen and water, when acted
upon by ammonia yield water, but fluoric acid in combining with
ammonia gives out no water.
   Sulphate of ammonia, by the action of potassium, yields sulphur
and ammonia; and in the same manner nitrate of ammonia yields
its base azote, with ammonia.    But when fluate of ammonia is acted
upon by potassium, the only product beside ammonia is hydrogen,
just as in the action of potassium upon muriate of ammonia, which
yields only hydrogen and ammonia. In the latter case chlorine com
bines with the potassium; and it would appear that a similar base is
contained in the fluate of ammonia.

A     Synoptic  Scale   of Chemical    Equivalents.   By  William Hyde
     Wollaston, M.D. Sec. R.S.         Read November     4, 1813.  [Phil.
     Trans. 1814, p. 1.]
     The design of the scale here proposed by the author is to save
 chemists the labour of many troublesome computations in estimating
 the ingredients of neutral salts, and the reagents and precipitates by
 which these ingredients might be ascertained.
     For though certain laws to which chemical union is subjected
 have of late been discovered, and have enabled chemists to determine
 with greater precision than formerly the composition of bodies sub
 mitted to be examined, and to express numerically the relation of
 the several elementary chemical substances to each other; never
 theless the computations requisite for applying these results to many
 objects of inquiry are frequently attended with considerable trouble.
     The author briefly sketches the history of proportional chemistry,
 beginning with Bergman, who, perceiving that the same acid united
  to the same base, always in the same proportion, took pains to
  ascertain the composition of various salts.       Kirwan followed the
  same line of endeavour to a greater extent, with a view to determine
  the proportions of various acids to different bases, as questions    in
  dependent of each other. To these succeeded Richter, who gave con
  nection to the subject by observing a new relation that had escaped
  the notice of Bergman, Kirwan, or any of his predecessors. They had
  observed only the constancy of the proportion of the same acid
  to the same base; Richter observed, further, a fixed relation of acid
  to acid: namely, that when the proportional quantities of any two
  acids, that are each sufficient to saturate a given quantity of any one
  base is determined, the same proportional weights of these acids will
  also saturate equal quantities of any other base; and consequently
  that if any quantity of sulphuric acid be assumed as standard, then
   equivalent quantities of all other acids may be conveniently expressed
  by fixed numbers, adapted to each; and the several quantities of
   different alkalies and earths that would each saturate the standard
   quantity, might also be represented constantly        by corresponding
   numbers.
      The observation of other proportions, which are simple multiples
   of the preceding, by Mr. Dalton and others, are noticed as affording
   an important correction of the best analyses; but it is observed that

                                         478
the theory of atoms by which these facts are explained is by no means
of importance to the present inquiry. It is by means of a series of
numbers computed according to the method of Richter, that this
scale is constructed so as to answer at one view the very numerous
questions that occur to an analytic chemist in the examination of
any saline compound.       It is similar in principle to the common
sliding rule, and like that instrument has the usual Gunter's line of
numbers on the slider; but upon a line adjacent to the slider are
marked certain points corresponding to those numbers which repre
sent the various chemical elements, acids, alkalies, and other com
pounds intended to be included in the present view. By motion of
the slider any one point of the line of numbers, as 100, may be made
to correspond with the point indicating any compound, as sulphate
of potash. By the position of the point for sulphuric acid, this salt
is seen to contain 46 of acid, and the other ingredient potash at the
same time corresponds with 54 on the slider.       By the position of
the  point for sulphate of  barytes, it appears that 135 of this pre
cipitate would be obtained from 100 of the salt, and in the same
manner that it would yield 176 of sulphate of lead, with a great
variety of similar answers respecting the equivalent quantities of
other compounds in which the same quantities of acid or neutralizing
base is contained.
   Since the line of numbers is so divided that a given space of every
part of it corresponds to numbers that bear a given ratio to each
other, and since the intervals on the adjacent column of equivalents
are all laid down according to certain given portions of the same
scale, they directly indicate by juxtaposition numbers that are in
the same proportion on any part of the scale that may be presented
to them, as will be very evident to those who are acquainted with
the common properties of other sliding rules.
   For the sake of those who may not be accustomed to the use of
the sliding rule, and for the purpose of recommending that valuable
instrument to more general use, the author enters rather more than
might otherwise be requisite into the elementary principles of logo
metric division.
Methods of clearing Equations of quadratic, cubic, quadrato-cubic,

   In a paper communicated to the Royal Irish Academy by Dr.
Mooney, the method of exterminating any number of quadratic
surds is pointed out by successively squaring them when brought
alone to one side of the equation; and the present is an extension
of the same method: first, to       all
                                   surds whose indices are any integral

                                                   surds whose common

Analysis of a      new Species   of Copper Ore.    By Thomas Thomson,
    M.D. F.R.S. L.      and  E.   Read November   18, 1813. [Phil. Trans.
     1814, p. 45.]
    The mineral here analysed was brought from the peninsula of
Hindostan by Dr. Heyné, where it occurs in considerable quantity
along with malachite.        Those specimens that are freest from mala
chite are of a dark blackish brown colour, soft, being easily scratched
with a knife, which leaves a streak of a reddish brown. Its specific
gravity is 2.62.        Its fracture is in general small-conchoidal, but
with a    tendency   in some parts to a foliated fracture; but it has not
yet been seen with any appearance of external crystalline form.
    It effervesces with acids, which form a blue or green solution ac
cording to the acid used, and leaves a red powder undissolved.
    One hundred grains treated with dilute sulphuric acid lost 16-7
grains by escape of carbonic acid gas.
     One hundred grains having been treated with muriatic acid formed
a   green  solution, from which a clean plate of zinc precipitated 48.5
sº  almS.
          red powder left by cold muriatic acid was digested for several
hours in nitro-muriatic acid, which left 2: 1 grains of white quartz
undissolved, and afforded by ammonia a precipitate of 19.5 grains
 oxide of iron.
     In order to determine the state of the oxide of copper in this ore,
Dr. Thomson put 100 grains in fine powder into the bottom of a tall
narrow vessel, which he then filled with water, and by means of a
funnel poured a quantity of muriatic acid on the ore at the bottom.
 Since the ore was even in this mode immediately attacked, and
formed a solution which from the commencement appeared green,
he considers this evidence decisive, that the copper is in the state of
black oxide, in which 100 of the metal are combined with 25 oxygen;
 so that 48.5 of copper precipitated by zinc indicated 60-75 of black
 oxide in the ore, and the analysis thus conducted gives an amount
 of ingredients corresponding within one per cent. with the quantity
 originally taken for experiment.
     Since the integrant parts of carbonic acid and of oxide of copper,
 as the author has elsewhere shown, are to each other in the ratio of
 2.75 to 10, and as this is just the ratio of 16-7 to 60-75, the quan
 tities contained in the ore, there can be no doubt that the carbonic
 acid and copper are combined in the ore, constituting a carbonate
 of copper without water, and in that respect differing from both
 malachite and the blue carbonate, the former of which would appear
 from Klaproth's analysis to contain two particles of water, and the
 latter one. So that the present ore may be distinguished by the
 name of anhydrous carbonate of copper,

 The Bakerian Lecture: on some new Electro-chemical Phenomena.
   By William Thomas Brande, Esq. F.R.S. Prof. Chem. R. I.
   Read November 25, 1813. [Phil. Trans. 1814, p. 51.]
    When any decompositions are effected by means of the voltaic
battery, it is known that one of the constituents is attracted towards
the positive pole, and the other to the negative.         Of the ultimate
chemical elements a    very  small proportion  is attracted by the former,
by far the greatest part being attracted by the negative pole ; and it
is thence inferred that these are themselves possessed of inherent
positive electricity.
   Although           all
                  the differences observable between voltaic and com
mon electricity have already been shown               depend solely upon  to

the positive surface became considerably warmer than the negative,
the flame itself being now visibly attracted towards the positive ball,

                                                     the latter was directed
towards the positive ball. With respect              sulphur,     particular             no
direction was observed              given

passed toward the positive ball.         When potassium             state               in   a          of
combustion was    placed   between the electrified balls, both the flame
and the fumes were drawn           the negative conductor.
                                           to                   The attrac
tion  of other fumes   being    tried,  not     the state    in combustion,         of
ammonia afforded           distinct result. Muriatic gas was visibly
                            no
attracted by the positive pole; and nitrous acid gas was also drawn
in the same direction.    The fumes that arise from benzoin and from

                                        481
 amber, when moderately heated, were attracted as acids to the positive
 side; but when these bodies were ignited so as to admit a dense.
 smoky flame, the carbonaceous matter was drawn, like that of other
 resinous bodies and camphor, to the negative ball.
     The majority of these instances, says the author, serve well to
 illustrate the inherent electrical states of different species of matter,
 and give a further proof of the identity of common and voltaic
 electricity, and especially the attraction of the fumes of the phos
phoric and benzoic acids to one side, and of the fumes produced by
the combustion of potassium and camphor to the other.
     But there are some phenomena that did not turn out as might
have been expected.     The combustion of carburetted hydrogen, for
instance, gives rise to the production of water and of carbonic acid;
but its flame is attracted by the negative surface.       It is conceived,
however, that this direction may be given to the flame by its carbo
naceous contents rather than by the products of its combustion.
     Mr. Brande is of opinion that these experiments may suggest a
fair explanation of the phenomena presented by those bodies that
are termed unipolar by Mr. Erman, because when connected with
one or other extremity of the voltaic battery, they transmit the in
fluence of only one species of electricity.   The flame, for instance,
of oil or of wax must be considered as      consisting  chiefly of these
bodies in a state of vapour; and as their natural  electricity is positive,
they will have no tendency to destroy that of a positive pole with
which they are connected, and the gold leaves of an electrometer

pole, their inherent positive electricity will neutralize that of the

An Account of some      new Experiments on the  fluoric Compounds; with
  some Observations on other Objects       of Chemical Inquiry. By Sir
  H. Davy, LL.D. F.R.S.            V.P.R.I.   Read February 13, 1814.
     [Phil. Trans. 1814, p. 62.]
   Since the date of those attempts of the author to decompose
fluorine, of which an account has already been printed in our
Transactions, and from which he inferred that pure liquid fluoric
acid consisted of hydrogen united to a base which he had not then
been able to procure in a separate form, but which is detached from
the hydrogen by various metals, he has made many experiments that
in his opinion tend to confirm this idea, though        all
                                                     his attempts        to
effect the actual decomposition have been unsuccessful.
   Fluate   oflead, which, according     to
                                         the author's view     its consti

of  lead,    consequence    ofthe decomposition    of water which gives
          to in
oxygen      the lead, and hydrogen       to
                                        the acid which now enters into
the composition    offluate ofammonia.

   So also silicated fluate of ammonia, or fluoborate of ammonia, when
acted upon by chlorine, yield no silica, or boracic acid, unless in con
sequence of the presence of moisture; but they form muriate of
ammonia, and either silicated fluoric or fluoboric gas.
   When charcoal was ignited in either of these gases no decompo
sition was effected, but only a disengagement of a little inflammable
gas from the charcoal.      Neither was liquid fluoric acid decomposed
by charcoal heated to whiteness in a tube of platina.
    According to the author's experiments on the decomposition of
fluor spar by sulphuric acid, the sulphate of lime which remains
after complete decomposition weighs more than the spar decomposed
in the proportion of 175 to 100.       But in order to obtain this result,
it is necessary  to collect the very  purest white Derbyshire fluor, and
to distil repeatedly  to dryness, after the addition of fresh acid at each
repetition. By computing upon the eighth result, and supposing the
number representing calcium to be 40, that for fluorine is estimated
to be 34°2.
   By forming fluate of potash from a known quantity of subcarbonate,
the number obtained for fluorine appeared to be about 32°6.
   From these experiments, and others made on the quantity of fluate
of potash obtained from hydrate of potash, the author infers that the  -
number representing fluorine may be estimated at about 33.
   Two cubical inches of ammoniacal gas, weighing 36 grains, were
found to combine with one of silicated fluoric gas, which were found
to weigh 1107, the number for which is thence inferred to be 984;
and it is presumed to consist of two parts fluorine, and one of silicious
basis.
   The author has made many experiments with the hope of deter
mining the quantity of oxygen in silica, but has not succeeded to his "
satisfaction.   However, since one part of silica requires more than
three times its weight of potassium to decompose                  it,
                                                                                            of to
                                                              this seems
show that silica cannot contain much less than half                weight  in its
oxygen. But          he
                     has not been able       to
                                            obtain its basis        separate   a               .

   Sir Humphry Davy has       atvarious times made many experiments

                                                        Professor Berzelius

laws of multiple proportions, Sir Humphry Davy observes, that the
fact  is,
        that the oxygen which Professor Berzelius supposes                                                                      to   be   in
the chlorine    combined with the metals; and that with respect
                       is                                                                                                                  to
any regularities among multiple proportions, there         general law                                 is   no
observable.   Azote,  for instance,   combines with three volumes                                                                          of
hydrogen. When combined with oxygen            may     united                          it              be                       to   #,    1,

with four volumes.
   The author combats the notion      oxygen being considered      the  of                                                       as
principle   acidity, and contends that hydrogen enters into the com
               of of
position   nearly    many acids  asoxygen; that chlorine and fluorine
                                                                   as
are merely bodies    the same class, which like oxygen combine with
great energy, but                in do of
                      not owe these properties   the presence     any                        to                                  of

light, forming a white fusible substance soluble in water, and acrid
to the taste, from which iode is again separated by sulphuric acid.
    Iode was found to combine with chlorine into a yellow volatile
solid, from which iode was again separated by solution of potash, not
in excess.
   When iode is heated with oxygen gas, or with oxymuriate of pot
ash, it undergoes no change.      When heated in the presence of iron,
zinc, tin, lead, or mercury, out of the contact of air, it forms com
pounds that are fusible and volatile, and have a yellow, orange, or red
colour, excepting the compound formed with zinc, which is white.
    The compound of iode and iron, when exposed to an alkaline so
lution, yields oxide of iron, but it combines with dry ammoniacal gas
without decomposition; whence the author infers that the formation
of oxide depends on the presence of water.
    When iode is heated in hydrogen, the gas expands considerably,
and the compound is found to be highly acid, rapidly absorbed by
water, forming a liquid acid without colour, but becoming tawny by
dissolving an excess of iode.
    Iode combines with phosphorus, producing heat without light; a
solid compound is formed that is fusible and volatile; and a strongly
acid gas is extricated, that is readily absorbed by water. When po
tassium or mercury are heated in this gas, they extricate hydrogen
equal to half the volume of the gas, and are found combined with
iode; so that this gas appears to arise from the presence of hydrogen
probably contained in the phosphorus.
   When the fusible compound with phosphorus is acted upon by
water and heated, much gas arises that is acid and spontaneously in
flammable, and the remaining liquid is found to contain hydrophos
phorous acid.
   When iode is thrown into a moderately strong solution of potash,
two compounds are formed, as in the formation of oxymuriate of
potash.    The first appears in crystals, which form immediately, and
fall to the bottom of the solution, and are analogous to hyperoxymu
riate of potash, and very similar to it in properties. But the solution
contains a different salt, without excess of oxygen, being simple iodate
of potash. The crystals are sparingly soluble in water, deflagrate
when mixed with charcoal, and yield abundance of oxygen when
heated.
   By passing the purple vapour over red-hot potash, oxygen is also
expelled; and    it appears that oxygen quits the triple compound at a
red heat.
   The affinities of this body for potassium and the metals are inferior
to those of chlorine for the same bodies; and accordingly it is ex
tricated from them when the compounds are exposed to oxymuriatic
   When the compound of iode with potassium is acted upon by sul
phuric acid, a different class of phenomena appear in consequence of
the decomposition of the acid, and of the water present. Sulphureous
acid is disengaged, mixed with the acid gas formed by the union of

                                                         485
iode with hydrogen; whilst the oxidated base remains in solution in
the state of sulphate of potash.
   When the same compound is acted upon by nitric acid, nitrous
gas and the purple vapour are extricated.
   When this compound is acted upon by liquid muriatic acid, it is
completely dissolved.   The excess of muriatic acid may be driven
off by heat, and the acid formed by iode and hydrogen found in the
liquor.
   When oxy-iodate of potash is dissolved in muriatic acid, muriate
of potash crystallizes, and the yellow compound of oxymuriatic gas
and iode remains in solution.
   When liquid ammonia is poured upon iode, the black fulminating
powder observed by MM. Desormes and Clement is produced; and
the salt remaining in solution is found by Sir Humphry Davy to con
sist of ammonia combined with iodic acid, such as was before formed
by the union of iode and hydrogen; and he hence infers that the ful
minating compound consists of iode and azote, since no azote escapes
during its formation.
   From several experiments made upon the proportion in which this
body unites with potassium, or with potash and with sodium, the
author infers that the number representing it will be about 165, that
for potassium being 75; and consequently that the acid gas formed
by       its
        union with hydrogen must                             be   by
                                         far the heaviest known gas.

An Account of a Family having Hands and Feet with supernumerary
  Fingers and Toes. By Anthony Carlisle, Esq. F.R.S. In a Letter
  addressed to the Right Hon. Sir Joseph Banks, Bart. K.B. P.R.S.
  Read December 23, 1813. [Phil. Trans. 1814, p. 94.]
  These instances of supernatural formation are traced, by the author's
inquiries, through four successive generations, from Zerah Colburn,
the American calculating boy, to his great grandmother, whose
maiden name had been Kendall, but of whose brothers, sisters, or
parents, the present generation possess no record.
   This woman had five fingers and a thumb on each hand, and six
toes on each foot.
   She had eleven children, ten of whom are said to have had the
same peculiarity complete; but one daughter, the grandmother of
the present boy, had one of her hands naturally formed.
   Of the next generation there were four persons. Abiah, the boy's
father, and two others, had the peculiarity complete; but one of his
uncles was like the grandmother, with one hand natural.
   The present generation are eight in number, of whom four are na
turally formed as their mother is; the rest, including Zerah the cal
culator, have the peculiarity complete, with the exception of his
eldest brother, who has one of his feet naturally formed.
   It appears to Mr. Carlisle, that these instances are sufficiently rare
to be added to the numerous cases on record of peculiar structures
continued by hereditary descent, in the hope that a greater accumu
lation of facts may enable future physiologists to trace, in some de
gree, the laws which govern such productions; more especially if at
tention be paid to the relative influence of the male and female sex
in the propagation of peculiarities.
Experiments and Observations on the influence of the Nerves of the
  eighth Pair on the Secretions of the Stomach.   By B. C. Brodie,
  Esq. F.R.S.   Communicated by the   Society for the Promotion of
  Animal Chemistry. Read February 10, 1814. [Phil. Trans. 1814,
  p. 102.]
   Former experiments having shown that when the functions of the
brain are destroyed the secretory organs invariably ceased to perform
their office, and consequently that the various secretions were pro
bably dependent on nervous influence, it appeared desirable to ascer
tain this point by dividing the nervous branches by which some one
gland is supplied, and observing the effect. But on account of the
difficulty of the operation itself, and of the injury done to adjacent
parts, it appears extremely difficult to determine the real influence of
the nerves in the natural state of all the functions. There are, how
ever, some experiments on the preternatural secretion excited by the
action of arsenic, and           its
                           interruption          by
                                           division    the nerves, which
                                                           of
the author thinks  may   deserve       to   be
                                       recorded       as
                                                    tending     to
                                                                elucidate
 so   important   a   subject.

                                   487
    Mr. Brodie had formerly observed in dogs poisoned by arsenic, a
very copious secretion of mucus and watery fluid from the coats of
the stomach and intestines, and so rapidly excited, that he conceived
this to be a favourable instance for observing the effect of dividing
those nerves which supply the stomach.
    He consequently divided the nerves of the eighth pair, with the
accompanying sympathetic nerves in the neck of a dog, and imme
diately afterwards inserted ten grains of arsenic into a wound in the
thigh. The symptoms which usually appear from the poison of
arsenic were soon produced; but though the dog lingered under this
treatment three hours and a half, none of that watery mucus observ
able in other instances of death by arsenic was found in the stomach
and intestines, though both stomach and intestines were found much
inflamed.
    In a second experiment, during nine hours that the dog lingered
under the effects of the arsenic applied also to a wound, no such se
cretion had taken place.
    In the third instance, the dog was made to swallow a solution of
arsenic, with the same result, after he had lingered three hours.
    Since in the preceding trials, respiration was disturbed in conse
quence of the injury done to the nerves supplying the thorax, a fourth
experiment was made by dividing the lower branches of the eighth
pair after their passage through the thorax, where they appear in the
oesophagus, just above the cardiac orifice of the stomach.      In this
mode of operating the respiration was not affected; but still the
symptoms and visible effects of the arsenic were the same as before,
without any fluid evacuations from either the stomach or intestines.
  . From these experiments,    the author thinks it hardly possible to
avoid the conclusion, that the suppression of these secretions was
owing to the division of the nerves; and that the secretions from the
stomach, in general, must be much under the controul of the nervous
system. But it appears premature to deduce any conclusion respect
ing their influence over other secretions.
On a   fossil human Skeleton from Guadaloupe. By Charles König,

    The skeleton described in this letter was contained in a mass of
stone nearly two tons in weight, brought home by Sir Alexander
Cochrane,    and presented by the Admiralty to the British Museum.
The existence of such skeletons had been mentioned by General
Ernouf, in a letter to Faujas St. Fond, published in the fifth volume
of the Annales du Museum; and also by Lavaisse, in his Voyage à la
Trinidad. The block brought home by Sir Alexander Cochrane agreed
very correctly with the description given by General Ernouf, mea
suring 8 feet by 2%, having very much the appearance of a huge
nodule separated from a surrounding mass, without any marks of a

    In this communication the author again notices certain coloured
images, seen on each side of the flame of a candle, or other luminous
object seen through the agate, one at 10%., and a second at 21°,
but which he is not yet able to explain, and supposes to be a new
 case of production of colours.
    Dr. Brewster next gives the result of experiments on the trans
mission of light previously polarized, through various substances, and
notices those positions of crystallized bodies in which the polarization
 continues unchanged, and those intermediate positions at which com
 plete depolarization takes place; and adds, that such effects are also
 occasioned by plates of horn, gum-arabic, glue, tortoise-shell, and
 even plate glass.
    In addition to these properties, which mica, topaz, and rock crystal
 possess in common with other crystallized bodies, Dr. Brewster ob
 serves, that they have the power of depolarizing in certain oblique
positions, which he considers peculiar to them. And at the same time
these bodies have certain oblique positions in which they do not de
polarize, and which he terms neutral.
    In the preceding experiments depolarization has been effected by
the interposition of a second body, through which the rays are trans
mitted after having been previously modified by some polarizing sub
stance; but the author observes that these effects may both be pro
duced by the same crystals, if the direction of the light be such, that
after reflection from the posterior surface it will coincide with the
oblique depolarizing axis.
    It was in attending to the affections of light thus polarized and
depolarized by a plate of topaz Tººth of an inch in thickness, that
the author observed certain elliptical coloured rings, which he con
siders entirely new ; and as he thinks them important, he takes much
pains to describe their various dimensions and successions of colours,
 and represents them in coloured drawings.
    When a doubly-refracting substance is employed to view these
 rings, the two images seen of them are differently coloured, the co
 lours of one set being complementary to those of the other.
    When a plate of agate, or a plane reflector at a specific angle of
 inclination are employed, then only one or the other set is seen, ac
 cording to the relative position of the planes of incidence; and it is
 in the instance of using the plane reflector, that these rings appear
 with such peculiar brilliancy on account of the absence of         all
                                                                foreign

 pletely avoided.

is 30; and since, under these circumstances, the whole of the light
that is not reflected at the first surface is transmitted through the
whole series, the author observes, that transmission is not in this
case a maximum at a perpendicular incidence, and that the law
employed by Bouguer fails by reason of these newly-discovered
properties of light, of which that distinguished philosopher was not
aware.

oblique reflection, and              its

   The mean of this and the two former experiments, without making
allowance for the imperfect polish of the Cassegrainian in one of them,
gives the comparative superiority in the illuminating power of the
Cassegrainian more than 2 to 1; or if the experiment which the au
thor considers less perfect be rejected, it would appear to be 2+ to 1
in favour of the Cassegrainian construction.

 be the perfect  simple   star.

     The author observes, however, that in the instances which present
themselves of such connexion between stars and nebulae, which are
the two extremes of the series, the nebulosity may not always be a
remnant of the unsubsided nebulous matter from which they were
originally formed, but detached portions of nebulous matter may,
like stars, have a considerable proper motion, and may be intercepted
in their course by clusters of stars, or by the more powerful attrac
tion of a single star of great magnitude, by which they will in still
less time be absorbed. In Dr. Herschel's endeavours to arrange the
vast accumulation of observations already recorded on this subject,
there are many phenomena too ambiguous to admit of classification;
but this, he observes, will necessarily occur at every period in the
progressive improvement of telescopes; since a greater power of pe
netrating into space, which would be sufficient to render all present
 objects distinct, would bring into view a still greater number of ap
pearances, requiring a still further extension of our powers to com-
 prehend.
     After arranging the various instances of gradation in which nebu
 losity appears successively more and more condensed, whether with
 or without intervening stars, the author examines aggregations of
 stars alone, referring to many former observations of patches of stars,
 which, at the time of recording them, he was induced to call forming
 clusters, in consequence of some appearances of a tendency to approach,
 which he inferred from the greater density of such clusters toward
 their centre. This apparent propensity to cluster seemed chiefly
 visible in parts of the heavens extremely rich in stars; and Dr. Her
  schel refers to about 150 instances of such an appearance in the Milky
  Way, but generally of an irregular form, and very imperfectly col
  lected. Of other clusters, in which more of regularity is observable,
  a more particular description is given.
      The various degrees of compression of different clusters are also
  noticed, with references to numerous instances by classes in which
  they are now arranged.       Some of these are visible with ordinary
  telescopes; others are selected as fine objects for good telescopes;
  and others again, on account of their higher compression, cannot be
  resolved without the aid of very superior telescopes.
      The form, also, of those most compressed is observed to partake
   more or less of a spherical form. Thirty-nine instances are quoted in
   which the form is oval in various degrees. But objects of this de
   scription can hardly be seen to advantage without a twenty-feet
   telescope.   Others again, and very numerous, are referred to, disco
   vered as globular nebulae with common telescopes, but resolved into
   stars by telescopes of high magnifying as well as space-penetrating
   power; and as these are accordingly but little known, Dr. Herschel
   selects, from numerous observations that he has made during four
   and-thirty years, various nebulae, classed according to the telescopes
   with which he had observed them, as a guide to those who may wish
   to view them, that they may be able to judge which objects may pos
   sibly be within the power of the telescopes they happen to possess.

                                                    496
   Since the luminous appearance of the Milky Way is caused by
stars that are invisible to the naked eye, this part of the heavens pre
sents a vast field for observation on the existence of a clustering
power. To the naked eye it is visibly divided into large patches;
and a telescope shows it to be still further subdivided into unequal
groups, which, though now not completely detached, it is presumed
will hereafter become insulated; so that the Milky Way will finally
be broken up, and cease to be a stratum of clustered stars.
   The same mode of reasoning that leads the imagination to con
ceive the progressive changes of                           its
                                           future existence, involves also

of about 1000 tons, acting on a lever one foot in length, while the
strain arising from the unequal distribution of the weight, and the
displacement, amounts, where it is greatest, to 2600, although it is
somewhat less than this exactly in the middle of the vessel. The
next force investigated by the author is that of the waves, which he
considers as including the consequences of the effect of the wind;
and this he finds capable of becoming much greater than the former,
amounting, in particular cases of the effect of a series of waves, to a
strain of about 10,000 tons, and their difference more than 6000
when the waves are in a contrary direction.       Hence it is inferred,
that  although these occasional strains exceed in magnitude the per
manent causes of arching, they do not by any means make it super
fluous to give the greatest strength to the fabric in the direction
which is best calculated for the prevention of that effect. It is
also remarked, that when fastenings have once given way to an oc
casional force of this kind, the ship must naturally assume the form
which is determined by the operation of more permanent causes;
and this circumstance may lead the inattentive observer to false con
clusions respecting the manner in which the injury has been sustain
ed. The tendency to breaking transversely arises from causes pre
cisely similar to those which have been mentioned as operating lon
gitudinally; but their precise magnitude does not appear to be easily
calculable. The force tending to produce a lateral curvature has com
monly been in some measure neglected, for want of a permanent
strain in a similar direction, capable of exhibiting          effects; but                      its
                                    be its

greatest  utility; an opinion in favour of which he adduces the autho
rities of Bouguer, Gobert, and Don George Juan. He then proceeds
to calculate how far Mr. Seppings's braces are strong enough to sus
tain alone the force to which it has been proved that their situation
is likely to expose them; and finds that they will support, without
being crippled, such a change as may be expected when a seventy
four arches about two feet, but not more; and that they will afford
a resistance fully sufficient to withstand a strain much greater than
that which has been attributed to the pressure of the waves, and to
the usual causes of arching.       Dr. Young does not apprehend any
evil from the omission of the internal planking between the parts,
nor from the removal of the partial remedy which the immersion of
the ends, produced by arching, affords to the unequal distribution of
the weight and pressure. The filling-in between the timbers in the
hold he considers as wholly unexceptionable;        and remarks, that
wedges may easily be driven in such a manner, while the ship is on
the stocks, as to have a tendency to render the keel convex rather
than concave below, and to prevent the common effect of arching
when the ship is launched, without any other superiority of strength
or workmanship; and that, without some such accidental cause, no
ship when launched could be wholly free from a perceptible degree
of arching. He doubts the superiority of Mr. Seppings's iron fasten
ings of the beams when acting as ties; and observes, that the obli
quity of the planks of the decks diminishes in some degree the strength
of the tie with respect to arching; but remarks, that it may per
form a very important service in rendering the ship more capable of
resisting the lateral strains, which, although sometimes very violent,
have been little considered by theoretical reasoners: and he suggests
that it may be possible to               fix
                                  the carlings between the beams

accordingly,  in his computation of a formula for that purpose, m Ursae
Majoris, at 70° 10' zenith distance, was the lowest star included in
his estimate. By applying that formula to stars below 80° zenith
distance, Mr. Groombridge has since found some correction to be
necessary; for the refraction at the low altitudes is not really so.
great as might be presumed from that of stars less distant from the
zenith.   He has consequently been induced to make a course of ob
servations on other circumpolar stars, beyond the former limits, and
as near to his north horizon as the situation of his observatory would
permit. Since the formula of Dr. Bradley appears most conveniently
applicable to the purposes of the practical astronomer, but not quite
correct in the numbers assumed for refraction at 45°, and for the co
efficient of r, the author has endeavoured to find out such numbers
as would correspond more accurately with observation, and has found
that the same formula may be made to serve as low down as to 87°
of zenith distance, by increasing the amount of the numbers before
mentioned still a little more than he had formerly done.
   But for stars of less altitude than this, or within three degrees of
the horizon, he found that the same formula could not be made to
serve throughout, but that it became necessary to vary the amount
of the coefficient y nearly in proportion to the excess above 87° ze
nith distance.
   The table of observations on which these estimates are founded is
divided into two parts; the former of which is the result of more
than 240 observations made upon sixteen stars between 80° and 87°
zenith distance; and the latter is founded upon six other stars be
tween 87° and 88°42' zenith distance.
   The difference of the obliquities of the ecliptic, as deduced from
the summer and winter solstices, or disagreement between the eleva
tion of the equator, thence deduced, and the zenith distance of the
pole, as inferred from the zenith distance of circumpolar stars, is
ascribed by the author to error in the quantities of refraction, which
was assumed too small by Dr. Bradley.         And he remarks, that, on
the contrary, his observations of the solstices, when reduced accord
ing to his own improved formula for refraction, agree in giving re
sults that correspond with his observations of circumpolar stars.
    With respect to thermometrical corrections, Mr. Groombridge ob
serves, that his results appear to be most correct when reduced by
the state of the thermometer without-doors instead of that which is
within; and that the difference is very considerable where the zenith
distances are so great as those included in the present remarks.

   That the perspective representation of an entire circle is an ellipse,
is simply a part of the doctrine of comic sections, and is not in need
of demonstration. The principal inquiry of the author has been with
regard to the positions of the axes of such ellipses.
   Selecting the case of any number of circles in the same plane, and
having their centres in the same line, he examines what law is to be
observed in the directions of the axes of the representing ellipses.
   It is shown first, that, excepting one particular case, their axes do
not converge to one point, but are parallel to other lines that do con
verge to one point.      He does not, however, pretend to determine
accurately and separately each of these other lines, but endeavours
to ascertain certain limits within which they must be arranged, and
a certain regularity in the variation of their directions, which he con
siders sufficient for all the practical purposes of the artist.
   Preparatory to this inquiry are a series of propositions purely geo
metrical, relating to the properties of tangents to circles, and of tra
peziums inscribed in circles, some of which may not be altogether
new, but are inserted as necessary to the demonstration of other pro
perties, which he believes have not before been noticed.        These are
kept separate from the perspective propositions, because they may be
more interesting to mathematical readers than they might be if inter
woven with considerations of their application to perspective repre
sentation. The greatest part of this paper of course could not admit
of being publicly read, being unintelligible without reference to the
figures which accompany             it.

Sometimes 3000 of them may be counted in an inch, while in an
other part of the same specimen they become much coarser; and a
corresponding appearance may be detected in the substances which
have received the impression.   The axis of extraordinary reflection
is always perpendicular to the direction of these grooves. Dr. Brew
ster thinks that the general reflection by which the common image
is formed, is the effect of the repulsive force of the whole surface,
acting at such a distance, that       irregularities        its

Results      of some recent Experiments on the Properties impressed upon

    The author, being engaged in making a variety of experiments on
 resinous and other bodies that could be fused between plates of glass,
remarked a partial depolarization while the subject of examination
was hot, but which diminished on cooling, and consequently could
not be ascribed to incipient crystallization. He therefore tried a plate
of glass alone; and having previously raised              temperature almost  its

 Observations on the Functions of the Brain. By Sir Everard Home,
  Bart. F.R.S. Read May 26, 1814. [Phil. Trans. 1814, p. 469.]
    The observations comprised in this paper, are selected from those
cases  of injury to the brain which have occurred to the author in the
course of his professional pursuits. The facts thus accidentally forced
upon his notice, may be regarded as so many experiments made on
different portions of the living brain; and the remarks upon them re
late to those effects which tend to elucidate their several functions.
    The collection of observations here given, are classed under dif
ferent heads; and with respect to the first set, which relate to the
pressure   of water on the brain, the subject is again subdivided ac
cording to the parts in which the water may be collected, whether
in any of the ventricles, or between the membranes. In the next
place, the consequences of concussion of the brain generally, are also
considered.
    The effects of extravasation of blood, in various situations, are se
parately described.     The consequences that ensue from formation of
matter, and immediate relief of the symptoms by its removal, are no
ticed.
   The symptoms that occur from depression, or from thickening of
different parts of the skull, are next distinguished, as well as those
which arise from pressure of soft tumours in different situations.
    In addition to the preceding, which are all instances of pressure
variously modified, the author adds his observations relating to wounds,
inflammation, and suppuration of the cerebrum in different parts; and
his remarks upon injuries done to the medulla spinalis, which form
the concluding section of his classification.
Further Experiments and Observations      on Iodine.   By  Sir Humphry
   Davy, LL.D. F.R.S.     V.P.R.I.   Read  June  16, 1814.  [Phil. Trans.
    1814, p. 487.]
   The present set of experiments are, in part, a continuation of the
author's experiments on compounds of iodine and fixed alkalies, which
he treats of under the head of triple compounds, because they con
tain iodine, oxygen, and potassium, or sodium. But he also treats of
various compound salts, which this substance forms in conjunction
with other acids, and of the effects produced upon iodine by the ac
tion of some compound gases.
   When the triple compound of iodine, oxygen, and potassium, is
dissolved in nitric acid, the acid may be distilled without any decom
position of the salt; but when it is dissolved in sulphuric acid or
phosphoric acid, the heat which these acids will bear is sufficient to
decompose the salt, which then yields oxygen and iodine, and leaves
sulphate or phosphate of potash.
    When a solution of this salt, in strong muriatic acid, is heated,
there is a smell of chlorine, the fluid becomes yellow, and yields, by
distillation, chloriodic acid.

     A solution of the triple compound, in sulphurous acid, when dis
tilled, yields iodine, and leaves sulphate of potash; but the pheno
mena are variously modified, by a greater or less proportion of either
ingredient.
    From such experiments as the author has made on the proportional
weights of the constituents of this salt, he considers it perfectly ana
logous to hyperoxymuriate of potash; and                                     re
                                                                              its

    The author also made triple compounds with iodine and alka
line earths, which, like oxyiode           potash, contain

Observations respecting the natural production of Saltpetre on the walls
  of subterraneous and other Buildings.     By John Kidd, M.D. Pro
 fessor of   Chemistry  at Oxford.    Communicated   by William Hyde

  The intention of the present paper is to state the result of a series
of observations on the connection of production of nitre with the state
of the atmosphere; and the account begins with a description of the
situation of the laboratory of the Ashmolean Museum, where these
observations were principally made; the pavement being nine feet
below the level of the street in which the museum stands, and seven

   By distillation this acid may                           be
                                       decomposed into prussic acid and

similar     to

                                 of
   The author observes also, that there are other substances beside

                                    51 1
  oxide of iron that are capable of forming peculiar acids with the ele
  ments of prussic acid; and the most remarkable of these is sulphur,
  which makes an acid of a red colour, having always the same pro
  perties, though formed in various different ways.     The first method
  by which Mr. Porrett formed this acid, was by boiling together sul
  phuret of potash with prussian blue; but he has also made it by the
  same sulphuret with prussiate of mercury. Also by heating together
  sulphuret of potash with animal charcoal, and by sulphate of potash
  with the same coal. Also by boiling a simple alkaline prussiate with
  sulphur, or by mixing prussiate of ammonia with hydroguretted sul
  phuret of potash. Since one of the properties of this acid is to form
  an insoluble compound with copper, the author takes advantage of
  this valuable property for obtaining the acid in a pure state. After
  decomposing a salt of copper for this purpose, a quantity of sulphuric
  acid is poured on the precipitate, and the whole submitted to gentle
  distillation, by which the acid is obtained nearly pure, or may be
  easily purified.  The author examines the salts formed by union of
  this acid with the several alkalies, earths, and metallic oxides, show
  ing that it may be transferred from one to another without change of
  its properties, and supporting his opinion that it should be regarded
  as an acid of a peculiar and extremely compound nature.
     For the acids here described, the author invents names by com
  bining the initials of three of their constituents, carbon, hydrogen,
  and azote, which give him the term Chyazic; and hence he deno
  minates the former Ferruretted Chyazic acid, and the latter Sulphu
  retted Chyazic acid.     By careful analysis of the former, the author
  found 17-26 oxide of iron in 47-66 of the dry acid; and in 18-4 of
  the latter he found 12 of sulphur.
     In the course of these experiments Mr. Porrett examines and de
  scribes the precautions which are necessary in ascertaining the quan
  tity of iron present in any solution by the quantity of prussian blue
* that can be formed: and he also shows the use that may be made of
  the sulphuretted chyazates as precipitants of copper.      He observes,
  that the precipitate formed in this case contains no water, and con
  sists of about 63 protoxide of copper, combined with 37 sulphuretted
  chyazic acid.
  Some Experiments on the Combustion of the Diamond and other car
     bonaceous Substances.     By Sir Humphry Davy, LL.D. F.R.S.
      V.P.R.I. Read June     23, 1814.    [Phil. Trans. 1814, p. 557.]
     Notwithstanding the many accurate experiments which have been
  made and recorded, showing that diamond and carbonaceous sub
  stances combine with the same quantity of oxygen, and form the
   same quantity of carbonic acid, various conjectures have been formed
  respecting some difference in their chemical composition, which might
   account for the remarkable difference in various sensible qualities.
  Messrs. Biot and Arago conjectured, from the great refractive power
  of the diamond, that hydrogen must be present. Guyton de Morveau

                                             512
imagined that other carbonaceous substances were oxides of diamond;
 and Sir Humphry Davy himself supposed, on the contrary, that dia
 mond, as a non-conductor of electricity, probably contained oxygen,
and afterwards that it contained some new principle of -the same class
with oxygen.
    Having, however, lately made some direct experiments on the com
bustion of the diamond in oxygen gas, by means of the great lens
belonging to the Academy at Florence, his results have not differed
from those made by Mr. Tennant, and subsequently by Messrs. Allen
and Pepys, respecting the quantity or quality of the gas produced;
and he acknowledges that the general tenour of his experiments is
opposed to the conjectures that have been entertained by himself and
others respecting the existence of oxygen, either in the diamond itself,
or in carbonaceous substances. His experiments likewise, so far from
supporting the hypotheses of Messrs. Biot and Arago as to the exist
ence of hydrogen as a constituent part of diamond, showed that a
minute quantity of hydrogen was really contained in each of the
other carbonaceous substances employed for comparison, not except
ing plumbago.     The presence of hydrogen in these bodies is most
distinctly shown on heating them in chlorine, by white fumes that
are immediately perceived in consequence of the production of mu
riatic acid; but when diamond is heated in the same gas, no such
vapour appears.    In the course of these experiments the author no
tices a phenomenon which he had not before seen, namely, that dia
mond when once ignited in oxygen, continues to burn till it is con
sumed.

facts which first led the author to entertain this opinion, were the
accidental consequence of an extremely painful application of pure
kali to a wound, which occasioned a general pulsation of the limb to
which it was applied, although the pulsations of distant arteries were
at the same time undisturbed. In order to be quite certain that this
consequence was really dependent on the irritation of nerves, the
author made two experiments on rabbits in the neighbourhood of the
carotid artery. Having laid bare the par vagum and intercostal nerves,
a probe was passed under the former so as to separate           that the              it,

to the first distillation requires to be fitted with a head and a receiver,
all perfectly air-tight; and it may with most convenience be so con
structed, that, by application of heat in the first instance to this ves

within it will be thereby expelled, and, by a valve or cock, may be
prevented from returning when the heat is withdrawn.
An Account of        some Eaperiments on Animal Heat. By John Davy,
  M.D.         F.R.S. Read February 17, 1814. [Phil. Trans. 1814,
  p. 590.]
   The experiments here detailed relate, in the first place, to the rela
tive capacities of venous and arterial blood for heat; secondly, the
comparative temperature of these fluids in different parts of the body
during life is attempted to be ascertained; and thirdly, the author
states those conclusions which he thinks may be drawn from his ex
periments.
   In his first experiments he endeavours to discover the relative ca
pacities by the times of cooling equal volumes of venous and arterial
blood, regard being also had to the specific gravities of each. When
blood was taken from the jugular vein of a lamb, and after the fibrin
had been separated from it by stirring with a wooden spatula, its
specific gravity was found to be 1050, that of arterial blood from the
same lamb, similarly treated, being 1047. The quantity of each
taken for experiment was the same, contained in the same vessel,
and heated to the same degree.     An equal quantity of water in this
vessel had cooled from 120° to 80° in ninety-one minutes; arterial
blood cooled, through the same interval, in eighty-nine minutes; and
venous blood in eighty-eight minutes: and hence the author infers
the capacity of venous blood to be to that of arterial as 92 to 93-7,
that of water being 100. By other experiments made on various
mixtures of these fluids with each other at different temperatures, he
estimates the proportion to be 93 to 93-7.
   In subsequent trials on the rates of cooling observed in blood that
still contained       its
                     fibrin, Dr. Davy estimated the capacities           of
                                                                        venous

   The next experiments were upon the proportional heat lost                  in

                         before,  for the difference of their specific gravi
ties (viz. 1050 and 1049).
     Inthis mode      trial the proportions were nearly reversed, the ca
                      of
pacity    of venous blood appearing     to   be 95-4, whilst that       of

was no more than 94-8.          But the author observes, that these trials
admit      less accuracy than the preceding; and
          of                                            he would        be

and arterial blood        the living body, were made
                            in                            at the great vessels
of  the neck      lambs, sheep, and oxen; and

   Since these results are at variance with the observations of Mr.
                                                                      of of
Coleman and Mr. Cooper on the temperature          the two sides     the                            of
heart, Dr. Davy also tried the temperatures         these cavities, and
found     difference
          a              about 1°; the left ventricle being
                           of                                          all                 in            in
stances warmer than the     right.
     Inthe author's experiments             on
                                       the temperature        different parts  of
of  the  body,   the most remarkable was with        respect      that     the      to          of
brain, which was found        be   to lower than that
                                           1°                the rectum, al   of
though this part was also       leastat   lower than the right side
                                                  1°                       the                      of
heart, and the anterior part               of
                                      the brain was even                lower        19   or   2°
than the posterior.
   These results, Dr. Davy remarks, are          direct opposition
                                                            in           those                 to
of  Dr. Crawford       every
                          in  respect;    since                  he
                                                     found the capacity                                   of
arterial blood greater than that             of
                                        venous.    He found no difference
of temperature between the two sides           the heart; and,
                                                       of            fact, the            in

fectly consistent with Dr. Black's opinion, that animal heat      pro                           is
duced     the lungs; and they are not inconsistent with the hypo
          in
thesis, that animal heat    dependent

                                          the nervous system.
   In conclusion, the author adds some trials that he has made on the
temperature      infants just born, which
